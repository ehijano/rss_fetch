      <title>Multifractal phase in the weighted adjacency matrices of random Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spectral properties of the adjacency matrix in the giant connected component of Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs, with average connectivity $p$ and randomly distributed hopping amplitudes. By solving the self-consistent cavity equations satisfied by the matrix elements of the resolvent, we compute the probability distribution of the local density of states, which governs the scaling with the system size of the moments of the eigenvectors' amplitudes, as well as several other observables related to the spectral statistics. For small values of $p&gt;1$ above the percolation threshold, we unveil the presence of an exotic delocalized but (weakly) multifractal phase in a broad region of the parameter space, which separates the localized phase found for $p\le1$ from the fully-delocalized GOE-like phase expected for $p\to \infty$. We explore the fundamental physical mechanism underlying the emergence of delocalized multifractal states, rooted in the pronounced heterogeneity in the topology of the graph. This heterogeneity arises from the interplay between strong fluctuations in local degrees and hopping amplitudes, and leads to an effective fragmentation of the graph. We further support our findings by characterizing the level statistics and the two-point spatial correlations within the multifractal phase, and address the ensuing anomalous transport and relaxation properties affecting the quantum dynamical evolution.</description>

      <title>The Griffiths phase and beyond: A large deviations study of the magnetic susceptibility of the two-dimensional bond-diluted Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Griffiths phase in systems with quenched disorder occurs below the ordering transition of the pure system down to the ordering transition of the actual disordered system. While it does not exhibit long-range order, large fluctuations in the disorder degrees of freedom result in exponentially rare, long-range ordered states and hence the occurrence of broad distributions in response functions. Inside the Griffiths phase of the two-dimensional bond-diluted Ising model the distribution of the magnetic susceptibility is expected to have such a broad, exponential tail. A large-deviations Monte Carlo algorithm is used to sample this distribution and the exponential tail is extracted over a wide range of the support down to very small probabilities of the order of $10^{-300}$. We study the behavior of the susceptibility distribution across the full phase diagram, from the paramagnetic state through the Griffiths phase to the ferromagnetically ordered system and down to the zero-temperature point. We extract the rate function of large-deviation theory as well as its finite-size scaling behavior and we reveal interesting differences and similarities between the cases. A connection between the fraction of ferromagnetic bonds in a given disorder sample and the size of the magnetic susceptibility is demonstrated numerically.</description>

      <title>Refined cyclic renormalization group in Russian Doll model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Focusing on Bethe-ansatz integrable models, robust to both time-reversal symmetry breaking and disorder, we consider the Russian Doll Model (RDM) for finite system sizes and energy levels. Suggested as a time-reversal-symmetry breaking deformation of Richardson's model, the well-known and simplest model of superconductivity, RDM revealed an unusual cyclic renormalization group (RG) over the system size $N$, where the energy levels repeat themselves, shifted by one after a finite period in $\ln N$, supplemented by a hierarchy of superconducting condensates, with the superconducting gaps following the so-called Efimov (exponential) scaling. The equidistant single-particle spectrum of RDM made the above Efimov scaling and cyclic RG to be asymptotically exact in the wideband limit of the diagonal potential. Here, we generalize this observation in various respects. We find that, beyond the wideband limit, when the entire spectrum is considered, the periodicity of the spectrum is not constant, but appears to be energy-dependent. Moreover, we resolve the apparent paradox of shift in the spectrum by a single level after the RG period, despite the disappearance of a finite fraction of energy levels. We also analyze the effects of disorder in the diagonal potential on the above periodicity and show that it survives only for high energies beyond the energy interval of the disorder amplitude. Our analytic analysis is supported with exact diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Spin glass model of in-context learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models show a surprising in-context learning ability -- being able to use a prompt to form a prediction for a query, yet without additional training, in stark contrast to old-fashioned supervised learning. Providing a mechanistic interpretation and linking the empirical phenomenon to physics are thus challenging and remain unsolved. We study a simple yet expressive transformer with linear attention and map this structure to a spin glass model with real-valued spins, where the couplings and fields explain the intrinsic disorder in data. The spin glass model explains how the weight parameters interact with each other during pre-training, and further clarifies why an unseen function can be predicted by providing only a prompt yet without further training. Our theory reveals that for single-instance learning, increasing the task diversity leads to the emergence of in-context learning, by allowing the Boltzmann distribution to converge to a unique correct solution of weight parameters. Therefore the pre-trained transformer displays a prediction power in a novel prompt setting. The proposed analytically tractable model thus offers a promising avenue for thinking about how to interpret many intriguing but puzzling properties of large language models.</description>

      <title>Diffusion, Long-Time Tails, and Localization in Classical and Quantum Lorentz Models: A Unifying Hydrodynamic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-time tails, or algebraic decay of time-correlation functions, have long been known to exist both in many-body systems and in models of non-interacting particles in the presence of quenched disorder that are often referred to as Lorentz models. In the latter, they have been studied extensively by a wide variety of methods, the best known example being what is known as weak-localization effects in disordered systems of non-interacting electrons. This paper provides a unifying, and very simple, approach to all of these effects. We show that simple modifications of the diffusion equation due to either a random diffusion coefficient, or a random scattering potential, accounts for both the decay exponents and the prefactors of the leading long-time tails in the velocity autocorrelation functions of both classical and quantum Lorentz models.</description>

      <title>Robustness of quantum chaos and anomalous relaxation in open quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dissipation is a ubiquitous phenomenon that affects the fate of chaotic quantum many-body dynamics. Here, we show that chaos can be robust against dissipation but can also assist and anomalously enhance relaxation. We compute exactly the dissipative form factor of a generic Floquet quantum circuit with arbitrary on-site dissipation modeled by quantum channels and find that, for long enough times, the system always relaxes with two distinctive regimes characterized by the presence or absence of gap-closing. While the system can sustain a robust ramp for a long (but finite) time interval in the gap-closing regime, relaxation is ``assisted'' by quantum chaos in the regime where the gap remains nonzero. In the latter regime, we prove that, if the thermodynamic limit is taken first, the gap does not close even in the dissipationless limit. We complement our analytical findings with numerical results for quantum qubit circuits.</description>

      <title>Machine learning of quantum channels on NISQ devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: World-wide efforts aim at the realization of advanced quantum simulators and processors. However, despite the development of intricate hardware and pulse control systems, it may still not be generally known which effective quantum dynamics, or channels, are implemented on these devices. To systematically infer those, we propose a neural-network algorithm approximating generic discrete-time dynamics through the repeated action of an effective quantum channel. We test our approach considering time-periodic Lindblad dynamics as well as non-unitary subsystem dynamics in many-body unitary circuits. Moreover, we exploit it to investigate cross-talk effects on the ibmq_ehningen quantum processor, which showcases our method as a practically applicable tool for inferring quantum channels when the exact nature of the underlying dynamics on the physical device is not known a priori. While the present approach is tailored for learning Markovian dynamics, we discuss how it can be adapted to also capture generic non-Markovian discrete-time evolutions.</description>

      <title>Selecting Relevant Structural Features for Glassy Dynamics by Information Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate numerically the identification of relevant structural features that contribute to the dynamical heterogeneity in a model glass-forming liquid. By employing the recently proposed information imbalance technique, we select these features from a range of physically motivated descriptors. This selection process is performed in a supervised manner (using both dynamical and structural data) and an unsupervised manner (using only structural data). We then apply the selected features to predict future dynamics using a machine learning technique. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of this approach in identifying the dominant mechanisms governing the glassy slow dynamics.</description>
