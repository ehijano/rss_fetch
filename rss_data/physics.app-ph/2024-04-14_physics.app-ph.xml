      <title>Polar vortex hidden in twisted bilayers of paraelectric SrTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar topologies, such as vortex and skyrmion, have attracted significant interest due to their unique physical properties and promising applications in high-density memory devices. Currently, most polar vortices are observed in heterostructures containing ferroelectric materials and constrained by substrates. In this study, we unravel arrays of polar vortices formed in twisted freestanding bilayers composed of SrTiO3, a quantum-paraelectric material. Depth-resolved structures of the bilayers are measured with deep-sub-angstrom resolution and one picometer accuracy using multislice ptychography, enabling identification of the three-dimensional variations of polarization topology. Our findings reveal the evolution of the polar vortices in the twisted overlapping layers, demonstrating the reverse of rotation manner in the depth direction. Twisted freestanding bilayers provide a unique platform for exploration and modulation of novel polar topologies.</description>

      <title>Photoacoustic effect from an oscillating source in a one-dimensional resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the photoacoustic effect is most commonly generated by pulsed or amplitude modulated continuous optical sources, it is possible to generate acoustic waves by moving a constant amplitude, continuous light beam. If the light beam moves at the speed of sound, an amplification effect takes place which can be used in trace gas detection. Here, the properties of the photoacoustic effect are investigated for a continuous optical beam moving in a one-dimensional resonator. The solution shows the additive effects of sweeping the optical beam the length of the cell and back.</description>

      <title>Cavity engineered phonon-mediated superconductivity in MgB$_2$ from first principles quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong laser pulses can control superconductivity, inducing non-equilibrium transient pairing by leveraging strong-light matter interaction. Here we demonstrate theoretically that equilibrium ground-state phonon-mediated superconductive pairing can be affected through the vacuum fluctuating electromagnetic field in a cavity. Using the recently developed $\textit{ab initio}$ quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory approximation, we specifically investigate the phonon-mediated superconductive behavior of MgB$_2$ under different cavity setups and find that in the strong-light matter coupling regime its superconducting transition temperature can be enhanced by $\approx 73\%$ ($\approx 40\%$) in an in-plane (out-of-plane) polarized cavity. The results highlight that strong-light matter coupling in extended systems can profoundly alter material properties in a non-perturbative way by modifying their electronic structure and phononic dispersion at the same time. Our findings indicate a pathway to the experimental realization of light-controlled superconductivity in solid-state materials at equilibrium via cavity-material engineering.</description>

      <title>Non-uniform wave momentum bandgap in biaxial anisotropic photonic time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic time crystals (PTCs) host momentum bandgaps enabling intriguing non-resonant light amplification in propagating waves, but opening substantial bandgaps demands refractive index changes too extreme for conventional nonlinear optics. Here, we introduce momentum bandgaps for non-uniform waves, including evanescent and ghost types, by extending PTCs to biaxial anisotropic photonic time crystals that periodically alternate between uniform biaxial anisotropy and isotropic media over time. We show that ghost waves, unlike evanescent waves, sustain only momentum bandgaps, opening wide bandgaps at even the smallest modulation depths. Moreover, we demonstrate momentum bandgap effects on non-uniform waves that can be amplified, or through decaying modes, selectively attenuated. We find that ghost wave momentum bandgaps uniquely boost refracted over reflected waves under one-way incidence, in stark contrast to balanced amplification seen in both propagating and evanescent waves. Our approach expands time-varying metamaterials by integrating wave characteristics, bridging the gap between conventional nonlinear optics and PTC momentum bandgaps, and shedding new light on extreme manipulation of surface polaritons.</description>

      <title>Topological insulators based on $p$-wave altermagnets, electrical control and detection of the altermagnetic domain wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional hybrid system made of a $p$-wave altermagnet and a metal possessing the orbital degree of freedom. The hybrid system is a topological insulator without the spin-orbit interaction. There emerge two edge states per one edge, because the system is mapped to a set of two copies of a topological insulator. Each copy resembles the long-range Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model but it is topologically different. Topological interface states emerge at a domain wall of the $p$-wave altermagnet, which are charged due to the Jackiw-Rebbi mechanism. Hence, the domain wall of the $p$-wave is controllable and detectable by purely electrical means.</description>

      <title>Observation of Fine Structure in Channeling of Particles in Bent Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the newly developed 530 MeV positron beam from the Mainz Microtron MAMI and employing a bent silicon crystal, we demonstrate the first successful manipulation with high efficiencies of the trajectories of positrons through planar channeling and volume reflection. This uncovered the presence of fine structure within the angular distribution of charged particles when they are channeled between the planes of bent crystals. The alignment of our experimental findings with simulation results not only demonstrates a deeper understanding of the interactions between charged particle beams and bent crystals but also signals a new phase in the development of innovative methodologies for slow extraction in circular accelerators operating in the GeV range, with implications for worldwide accelerators. Our results also mark a considerable progression in the generation of advanced x-ray sources through the channeling process in periodically bent crystals, rooted in a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between positron beams and such crystals.</description>

      <title>An ultra-broadband photonic-chip-based traveling-wave parametric amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical amplification, crucial for modern communication, primarily relies on erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) to enhance signals without distortion. However, EDFAs only cover a portion of the low-loss spectrum of optical fibers. Optical parametric amplification, utilizing material nonlinearities, offers expanded capacity, but has faced limitations in gain and bandwidth. Addressing this, we present a high-gain continuous-traveling-wave parametric amplifier, surpassing the erbium gain window. Leveraging low-loss gallium phosphide-on-insulator photonic integrated waveguides, we achieve up to 35 dB of parametric gain, with a fiber-to-fiber net gain exceeding 10 dB across a wide wavelength range of approximately 140 nm centered at 1550 nm. We demonstrate the capability to amplify ultra-weak signals, extending over 6 orders of magnitude of input powers, optical frequency combs, and communication signals, highlighting the practical potential of our photonic-chip-based amplifier.</description>

      <title>Softness Matters: Effects of Compression on the Behavior of Adsorbed Microgels at Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deformable colloids and macromolecules adsorb at interfaces, as they decrease the interfacial energy between the two media. The deformability, or softness, of these particles plays a pivotal role in the properties of the interface. In this study, we employ a comprehensive \emph{in situ} approach, combining neutron reflectometry with molecular dynamics simulations, to thoroughly examine the profound influence of softness on the structure of microgel Langmuir monolayers under compression. Lateral compression of both hard and soft microgel particle monolayers induces substantial structural alterations, leading to an amplified protrusion of the microgels into the aqueous phase. However, a critical distinction emerges: hard microgels are pushed away from the interface, in stark contrast to the soft ones, which remain steadfastly anchored to it. Concurrently, on the air-exposed side of the monolayer, lateral compression induces a flattening of the surface of the hard monolayer. This phenomenon is not observed for the soft particles as the monolayer is already extremely flat even in the absence of compression. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the pivotal role of softness on both the equilibrium phase behavior of the monolayer and its effect when soft colloids are used as stabilizers of responsive interfaces and emulsions.</description>
