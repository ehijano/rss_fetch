      <title>The Japanese Personnel Inquiry Records (PIR): Elite, Adoption, Family Composition in the 1900s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a novel elite-level dataset on prewar Japanese elites using the Personnel Inquiry Records (PIR), a historical biographical source covering 1903 to 1939. The PIR contains rich information on family structure, education, occupation, and spatial mobility, capturing elite formation during Japan's transition from a feudal to modern society. By reconstructing intergenerational links and family networks, we document the persistence and transformation of elite status. The dataset provides a foundational resource for quantitative historical research on elite reproduction, social stratification, and institutional development.</description>

      <title>AI Recommendations and Non-instrumental Image Concerns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is growing enthusiasm about the potential for humans and AI to collaborate by leveraging their respective strengths. Yet in practice, this promise often falls short. This paper uses an online experiment to identify non-instrumental image concerns as a key reason individuals underutilize AI recommendations. I show that concerns about how one is perceived, even when those perceptions carry no monetary consequences, lead participants to disregard AI advice and reduce task performance.</description>

      <title>Bridging Short- and Long-Term Dependencies: A CNN-Transformer Hybrid for Financial Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial for decision-making across various domains, particularly in financial markets where stock prices exhibit complex and non-linear behaviors. Accurately predicting future price movements is challenging due to the difficulty of capturing both short-term fluctuations and long-term dependencies in the data. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are well-suited for modeling localized, short-term patterns but struggle with long-range dependencies due to their limited receptive field. In contrast, Transformers are highly effective at capturing global temporal relationships and modeling long-term trends. In this paper, we propose a hybrid architecture that combines CNNs and Transformers to effectively model both short- and long-term dependencies in financial time series data. We apply this approach to forecast stock price movements for S\&amp;P 500 constituents and demonstrate that our model outperforms traditional statistical models and popular deep learning methods in intraday stock price forecasting, providing a robust framework for financial prediction.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Cournot Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces economists to quantum-inspired approaches for modeling firm behavior in a Cournot Duopoly, designed for accessibility and pedagogical use. We present key quantum concepts -- superposition, entanglement, and quantum search algorithms (Grover's and D\"{u}rr-H\o{}yer's) -- in an intuitive manner, tailored for those without a quantum physics background. These concepts are applied to represent uncertainty, interdependence, and optimization in novel ways, offering fresh perspectives on firm decision-making. By incorporating numerical examples, we illustrate how quantum-inspired models differ from classical Cournot outcomes, highlighting potential advantages in capturing complex strategic interactions. The paper aims to bridge quantum computing and economic theory, providing a foundation for teaching and exploring advanced modeling techniques. </description>

      <title>Monitoring North African regional tourism by web data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to explore the opportunity of recent and detailed unconventional data from the tourism sector collected from {\guillemotleft} Booking.com {\guillemotright} to make a finer and more up-to-date analysis than that established by conventional data, particularly, at the territorial level of North Africa. We extracted and geolocalised about 40 variables of different types covering 1852 accommodations on Booking.com to analyze the characteristics of territorial tourist offer of the six North African countries (10 of 12 Moroccan regions, 3 of 13 Mauritanian Wilayas, 26 of 48 Algerian Wilayas, 13 of 24 Tunisian Governorates, 1 region of Libya, 15 of 27 Egyptian Mohafazats). Then, we used a random sample of 10% of the most recent appreciations of nearly 606000 tourists of the three most dynamic destinations (Marrakech-Safi, Tunis, Cairo) by analyzing the feelings of their comments with a differentiation according origin of tourists. We concluded that the accommodation offer of the territories of North Africa is very diversified and unclassified offers are slightly better appreciated compared to those classified. The coastal regions have higher prices compared to the interior of the countries and quality-price appreciation of North African regions is below their overall ratings.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Frontier Structural Function and Bounding Mean Deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a model in which an outcome variable equals the difference between a frontier function of inputs and a nonnegative unobserved deviation. If zero is in the support of the deviation at a given input value, then the frontier function is identified by the maximum outcome there. This obviates the need for instrumental variables. Implementation requires allowing for the distribution of deviations to depend on inputs, thus not ruling out endogenous inputs and ensuring the estimated frontier is not merely a constant shift of a biased conditional expectation. Including random errors results in a stochastic frontier analysis model generalized to allow the joint distribution of deviations and errors to depend on inputs. If the minimum deviation is a function of inputs, then we derive a lower bound for the mean deviation using variance and skewness, without making parametric distributional assumptions. We apply our results to a frontier production function, with deviations representing inefficiencies.</description>

      <title>Individuals, Crowds, and the Network Dynamics of Belief Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Does talking to others make people more accurate or less accurate on numeric estimates such as quantitative evaluations or probabilistic forecasts? Research on peer-to-peer communication suggests that discussion between people will usually improve belief accuracy, while research on social networks suggests that error can percolate through groups and reduce accuracy. One challenge to interpreting empirical literature is that some studies measure accuracy at the group level, while others measure individual accuracy. We explain how social influence impacts belief accuracy by analyzing a formal model of opinion formation to identify the relationship between individual accuracy, group accuracy, and the network dynamics of belief formation. When opinions become more similar over time, change in individual error is always strictly better than change in group error, by a value equal to the change in variance. We show that change in group error can be decomposed into the influence network centralization, the accuracy/influence correlation ("calibration"), and the averageness/influence correlation ("herding"). Because group dynamics both theoretically and empirically lead people to become more similar over time, one might intuitively expect that the same factors which reduce group accuracy will also reduce individual accuracy. Instead, we find that individuals reliably improve under nearly all conditions, even when groups get worse. We support this analysis with data from six previously published experiments.</description>

      <title>Are Politicians Responsive to Mass Shootings? Evidence from U.S. State Legislatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The United States leads the world in the number of mass shootings that occur each year even as policy making on firearms remains polarized along party lines. Are legislators responsive to mass shootings? We estimate the latent positions of 264 California state legislators on gun policy from their roll-call voting records on firearm-related bills from 2011 to 2022. Employing a stacked difference-in-differences design, we find that mass shootings within or near a state legislator's district do not alter their voting behavior on firearm policy, on average (with 95% confidence intervals spanning opposite directions). When we extend our analyses to an additional 5 states (for a total of 1,864 legislators), we find similarly null results, though we report evidence of statistically significant effects in both directions from event-specific estimates. Our findings suggest that even the most heinous acts of mass violence generally fail to produce measurable effects on legislators' positions on firearm-related policy.</description>

      <title>Effects of Price Regulations on Service Utilization and Public Insurance Costs: Evidence from Telehealth Parity Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores Telehealth Parity Laws (TPLs) and their heterogeneous treatment effects by policy type on outpatient utilization and Medicare costs, considering broadband and licensure infrastructure. State-specific legislative framings create varied Price (physician reimbursement) and Cost (consumer expense) control combinations within a quasi-experimental design. Partial equilibrium causal estimates reveal negligible impacts on Medicare enrollment, indicating that Medicare cost shifts stem purely from outpatient utilization changes. Broadband access correlates with increased preventable hospital stays but lower Medicare costs and enrollment. Additionally, the Interstate Licensure Compact increases enrollment among the aged and disabled, possibly addressing previously unmet demand for healthcare services.</description>
