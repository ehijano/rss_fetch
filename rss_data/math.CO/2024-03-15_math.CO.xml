      <title>The absence of monochromatic triangle implies various properly colored spanning trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An edge-colored graph $G$ is called properly colored if every two adjacent edges are assigned different colors. A monochromatic triangle is a cycle of length 3 with all the edges having the same color. Given a tree $T_0$, let $\mathcal{T}(n,T_0)$ be the collection of $n$-vertex trees that are subdivisions of $T_0$. It is conjectured that for each fixed tree $T_0$ of $k$ edges, there is a function $f(k)$ such that for each integer $n\geq f(k)$ and each $T\in \mathcal{T}(n,T_0)$, every edge-colored complete graph $K_n$ without containing monochromatic triangle must contain a properly colored copy of $T$. We confirm the conjecture in the case that $T_0$ is a star. A weaker version of the above conjecture is also obtained. Moreover, to get a nice quantitative estimation of $f(k)$ requires determining the constraint Ramsey number of a monochromatic triangle and a rainbow $k$-star, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative frieze patterns with coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on Berenstein and Retakh's notion of noncommutative polygons we introduce and study noncommutative frieze patterns. We generalize several notions and fundamental properties from the classic (commutative) frieze patterns to noncommutative frieze patterns, e.g. propagation formulae and $\mu$-matrices, quiddity cycles and reduction formulae, and we show that local noncommutative exchange relations and local triangle relations imply all noncommutative exchange relations and triangle relations. Throughout, we allow coefficients, so we obtain generalizations of results from our earlier paper on frieze patterns with coefficients from the commutative to the noncommutative setting.</description>

      <title>Eulerian magnitude homology: subgraph structure and random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we explore the connection between the ranks of the magnitude homology groups of a graph and the structure of its subgraphs. To this end, we introduce variants of magnitude homology called eulerian magnitude homology and discriminant magnitude homology. Leveraging the combinatorics of the differential in magnitude homology, we illustrate a close relationship between the ranks of the eulerian magnitude homology groups on the first diagonal and counts of subgraphs which fall in specific classes. We leverage these tools to study limiting behavior of the eulerian magnitude homology groups for Erdos-Renyi random graphs and random geometric graphs, producing for both models a vanishing threshold for the eulerian magnitude homology groups on the first diagonal. This in turn provides a characterization of the generators for the corresponding magnitude homology groups. Finally, we develop an explicit asymptotic estimate the expected rank of eulerian magnitude homology along the first diagonal for these random graph models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Making use of a newly developed package in the computer algebra system SageMath, we show how to perform a full asymptotic analysis by means of the Mellin transform with explicit error bounds. As an application of the method, we answer a question of B\'ona and DeJonge on 132-avoiding permutations with a unique longest increasing subsequence that can be translated into an inequality for a certain binomial sum.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics of Essential Sets for Positroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positroids are families of matroids introduced by Postnikov in the study of non-negative Grassmannians. Postnikov identified several combinatorial objects in bijections with positroids, among which are bounded affine permutations. On the other hand, the notion of essential sets, introduced for permutations by Fulton, was used by Knutson in the study of the special family of interval rank positroids. We generalize Fulton's essential sets to bounded affine permutations. The bijection of the latter with positroids, allows the study of their relation. From the point of view of positroids, essential sets are maximally dependent cyclic interval. We define connected essential sets and prove that they give a facet description of the positroid polytope, as well as equations defining the positroid variety. We define a subset of essential sets, called core, which contains minimal rank conditions to uniquely recover a positroid. We provide an algorithm to retrieve the positroid satisfying the rank conditions in the core or any compatible rank condition on cyclic intervals.</description>

      <title>Edge-apexing in hereditary classes of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class $\mathcal{G}$ of graphs is called hereditary if it is closed under taking induced subgraphs. We denote by $G^{epex}$ the class of graphs that are at most one edge away from being in $\mathcal{G}$. We note that $G^{epex}$ is hereditary and prove that if a hereditary class $\mathcal{G}$ has finitely many forbidden induced subgraphs, then so does $G^{epex}$.
  The hereditary class of cographs consists of all graphs $G$ that can be generated from $K_1$ using complementation and disjoint union. Cographs are precisely the graphs that do not have the $4$-vertex path as an induced subgraph. For the class of edge-apex cographs our main result bounds the order of such forbidden induced subgraphs by 8 and finds all of them by computer search.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the chromatic index of a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ satisfies Berge-F\"uredi conjectured bound $\mathrm{q}(\mathcal{H})\le \Delta([\mathcal{H}]_2)+1$ under certain hypotheses on the antirank $\mathrm{ar}(\mathcal{H})$ or on the maximum degree $\Delta(\mathcal{H})$. This provides sharp information in connection with Erd\H{o}s-Faber-Lov\'asz Conjecture which deals with the coloring of a family of cliques that intersect pairwise in at most one vertex.</description>

      <title>Universal Definitions of the Roman Factorial: Introduction to Foundational Functions and the Generalization Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new method for redefining the Roman factorial using universally applicable functions that are not expressed in closed form. We present a set of foundational functions, similar to Boolean operations, to simplify the factorial expression. Through a systematic process of generalization, termed generalization process, we aim to use these foundational functions to create recursive and non-recursive, global definitions of the Roman factorial.</description>

      <title>Finite sums and finite products in $IP^{\star}$ sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{key-4}, Hindman proved that for $\mathbb{N}=C_{1}\cup C_{2}\cup\ldots\cup C_{r}$, one cell contains an $AIP$ set, which was a conjecture of Graham and Rothschild. Hindman's method was combinatorial, and an algebraic proof of the Hindman finite sum theorem is followed from \cite[Corollary 5.10]{key-5}, but it was originally due to Glazer and Galvin. In \cite[Theorem 2.6]{key-2}, V. Bergelson and Hindman proved that for any $AIP^{\star}$ set $A$ and sequence $\langle x_{n}\rangle_{n=1}^{\infty}$, there exists a sum subsystem $\langle y_{n}\rangle_{n=1}^{\infty}$ of $\langle x_{n}\rangle_{n=1}^{\infty}$ such that $FS\left(\langle y_{n}\rangle_{n=1}^{\infty}\right)\cup FP\left(\langle y_{n}\rangle_{n=1}^{\infty}\right)\subseteq A$ using algebra of $\beta\mathbb{N}$. In this article, we will prove the same result combinatorially. As a consequence, we will prove that $MIP^{\star}$ sets contain two different exponential patterns.</description>

      <title>Bounds and extremal graphs for monitoring edge-geodetic sets in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A monitoring edge-geodetic set, or simply an MEG-set, of a graph $G$ is a vertex subset $M \subseteq V(G)$ such that given any edge $e$ of $G$, $e$ lies on every shortest $u$-$v$ path of $G$, for some $u,v \in M$. The monitoring edge-geodetic number of $G$, denoted by $meg(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of such an MEG-set. This notion provides a graph theoretic model of the network monitoring problem.
  In this article, we compare $meg(G)$ with some other graph theoretic parameters stemming from the network monitoring problem and provide examples of graphs having prescribed values for each of these parameters. We also characterize graphs $G$ that have $V(G)$ as their minimum MEG-set, which settles an open problem due to Foucaud \textit{et al.} (CALDAM 2023), and prove that some classes of graphs fall within this characterization. We also provide a general upper bound for $meg(G)$ for sparse graphs in terms of their girth, and later refine the upper bound using the chromatic number of $G$. We examine the change in $meg(G)$ with respect to two fundamental graph operations: clique-sum and subdivisions. In both cases, we provide a lower and an upper bound of the possible amount of changes and provide (almost) tight examples.</description>

      <title>Binary Stretch Embedding of Weighted Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study the problem of \textit{binary stretch embedding} of edge-weighted graph. This problem is closely related to the well-known \textit{addressing problem} of Graham and Pollak. Addressing problem is the problem of assigning the shortest possible length strings (called ``addresses") over the alphabet $\{0,1,*\}$ to the vertices of an input graph $G$ with the following property. For every pair $u,v$ of vertices, the number of positions in which one of their addresses is $1$, and the other is $0$ is exactly equal to the distance of $u,v$ in graph $G$. When the addresses do not contain the symbol $*$, the problem is called \textit{isometric hypercube embedding}. As far as we know, the isometric hypercube embedding was introduced by Firsov in 1965. It is known that such addresses do not exist for general graphs.
  Inspired by the addressing problem, in this paper, we introduce the \textit{binary stretch embedding problem}, or BSEP for short, for the edge-weighted undirected graphs. We also argue how this problem is related to other graph embedding problems in the literature.
  Using tools and techniques such as Hadamard codes and the theory of linear programming, several upper and lower bounds as well as exact solutions for certain classes of graphs will be discovered.
  As an application of the results in this paper, we derive improved upper bounds or exact values for the maximum size of Lee metric codes of certain parameters.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are several graphs defined on groups. Among them we consider graphs whose vertex set consists conjugacy classes of a group $G$ and adjacency is defined by properties of the elements of conjugacy classes. In particular, we consider commuting/nilpotent/solvable conjugacy class graph of $G$ where two distinct conjugacy classes $a^G$ and $b^G$ are adjacent if there exist some elements $x\in a^G$ and $y\in b^G$ such that $\langle x, y \rangle$ is abelian/nilpotent/solvable. After a section of introductory results and examples, we discuss all the available results on connectedness, graph realization, genus, various spectra and energies of certain induced subgraphs of these graphs. Proofs of the results are not included. However, many open problems for further investigation are stated.</description>

      <title>On the Gotzmann threshold of monomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $R_n=K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ be the $n$-variable polynomial ring over a field $K$. Let $S_n$ denote the set of monomials in $R_n$. A monomial $u \in S_n$ is a \textit{Gotzmann monomial} if the Borel-stable monomial ideal $\langle u \rangle$ it generates in $R_n$ is a Gotzmann ideal. A longstanding open problem is to determine all Gotzmann monomials in $R_n$. Given $u_0 \in S_{n-1}$, its \textit{Gotzmann threshold} is the unique nonnegative integer $t_0=\tau_n(u_0)$ such that $u_0x_n^t$ is a Gotzmann monomial in $R_n$ if and only if $t \ge t_0$. Currently, the function $\tau_n$ is exactly known for $n \le 4$ only. We present here an efficient procedure to determine $\tau_n(u_0)$ for all $n$ and all $u_0 \in S_{n-1}$. As an application, in the critical case $u_0=x_2^d$, we determine $\tau_5(x_2^d)$ for all $d$ and we conjecture that for $n \ge 6$, $\tau_n(x_2^d)$ is a polynomial in $d$ of degree $2^{n-2}$ and dominant term equal to that of the $(n-2)$-iterated binomial coefficient $$ \binom {\binom {\binom d2}2}{\stackrel{\cdots}2}. $$</description>

      <title>Ordered unavoidable sub-structures in matchings and random matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An ordered matching of size $n$ is a graph on a linearly ordered vertex set $V$, $|V|=2n$, consisting of $n$ pairwise disjoint edges. There are three different ordered matchings of size two on $V=\{1,2,3,4\}$: an alignment $\{1,2\},\{3,4\}$, a nesting $\{1,4\},\{2,3\}$, and a crossing $\{1,3\},\{2,4\}$. Accordingly, there are three basic homogeneous types of ordered matchings (with all pairs of edges arranged in the same way) which we call, respectively, lines, stacks, and waves.
  We prove an Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres type result guaranteeing in every ordered matching of size $n$ the presence of one of the three basic sub-structures of a given size. In particular, one of them must be of size at least $n^{1/3}$. We also investigate the size of each of the three sub-structures in a random ordered matching. Additionally, the former result is generalized to $3$-uniform ordered matchings.
  Another type of unavoidable patterns we study are twins, that is, pairs of order-isomorphic, disjoint sub-matchings. By relating to a similar problem for permutations, we prove that the maximum size of twins that occur in every ordered matching of size $n$ is $O\left(n^{2/3}\right)$ and $\Omega\left(n^{3/5}\right)$. We conjecture that the upper bound is the correct order of magnitude and confirm it for almost all matchings. In fact, our results for twins are proved more generally for $r$-multiple twins, $r\ge2$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a natural generalization of Maya diagrams -- the space of infinite Fibonacci configurations, which are specified functions on $\mathbb{Z}$ with values $1$ and $0$. Infinite Fibonacci configurations are particularly interesting as soon as they parametrize Feigin-Stoyanovsky type bases in lattice vertex superalgebras $V_{\sqrt{N}\mathbb{Z}}$ and their irreducible modules. We calculate the character of such configurations space by two different ways and obtain series of combinatorial identities. These identities turn out to be Durfee rectangle identities with shifts in base and height.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For partially ordered sets $X$ we consider the square matrices $M^{X}$ with rows and columns indexed by linear extensions of the partial order on $X$. Each entry $\left( M^{X}\right)_{PQ}$ is a formal variable defined by a pedestal of the linear order $Q$ with respect to linear order $P$. We show that all the eigenvalues of any such matrix $M^{X}$ are $\mathbb{Z}$-linear combinations of those variables.</description>

      <title>Freeness of hyperplane arrangements associated with gain graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Athanasiadis studied arrangements obtained by adding shifted hyperplanes to the braid arrangement. Similarly, Bailey studied arrangements obtained by adding tilted hyperplanes to the braid arrangement. These two kinds of arrangements are associated with directed graphs and their freeness was characterized in terms of the associated graphs. In addition, there is coincidence of freeness. Namely, if Athanasiadis' arrangement is free, then the corresponding Bailey's arrangement is free, and vice versa.
  In this paper, we generalize this phenomenon by using gain graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2002.00502v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, using the method of compression, we recover the lower bound for the Erd\H{o}s unit distance problem and provide an alternative proof to the distinct distance conjecture. In particular, we show that for sets of points $\mathbb{E}\subset \mathbb{R}^k$ concentrated around the origin with $\# \mathbb{E}\cap \mathbb{R}^k=\frac{n}{2}$, we have \begin{align}\# \bigg\{||\vec{x_j}-\vec{x_t}||:\vec{x_j}\in \mathbb{E}\subset \mathbb{R}^k,~||\vec{x_j}-\vec{x_t}||=1,~1\leq t,j \leq n\bigg\}\gg_k \frac{\sqrt{k}}{2}n^{1+o(1)}.\nonumber \end{align}We also show that\begin{align}\# \bigg\{d_j:d_j=||\vec{x_s}-\vec{y_t}||,~d_j\neq d_i,~1\leq s,t\leq n\bigg\}\gg_k \frac{\sqrt{k}}{2}n^{\frac{2}{k}-o(1)}.\nonumber \end{align}</description>

Abstract: We study PBW bases of the untwisted quantum loop group $U_q(L\mathfrak{g})$ (in the Drinfeld new presentation) using the combinatorics of loop words, by generalizing the treatment of [29,30,43] in the finite type case. As an application, we prove that Enriquez' homomorphism [11] from the positive half of the quantum loop group to the trigonometric degeneration of Feigin-Odesskii's elliptic algebra [15] associated to $\mathfrak{g}$ is an isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Perfect matching modules, dimer partition functions and cluster characters</title>

Abstract: Cluster algebra structures for Grassmannians and their (open) positroid strata are controlled by a Postnikov diagram D or, equivalently, a dimer model on the disc, as encoded by either a bipartite graph or the dual quiver (with faces). The associated dimer algebra A, determined directly by the quiver with a certain potential, can also be realised as the endomorphism algebra of a cluster-tilting object in an associated Frobenius cluster category. In this paper, we introduce a class of A-modules corresponding to perfect matchings of the dimer model of D and show that, when D is connected, the indecomposable projective A-modules are in this class. Surprisingly, this allows us to deduce that the cluster category associated to D embeds into the cluster category for the appropriate Grassmannian. We show that the indecomposable projectives correspond to certain matchings which have appeared previously in work of Muller-Speyer. This allows us to identify the cluster-tilting object associated to D, by showing that it is determined by one of the standard labelling rules constructing a cluster of Pl\"{u}cker coordinates from D. By computing a projective resolution of every perfect matching module, we show that Marsh-Scott's formula for twisted Pl\"{u}cker coordinates, expressed as a dimer partition function, is a special case of the general cluster character formula, and thus observe that the Marsh-Scott twist can be categorified by a particular syzygy operation in the Grassmannian cluster category.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Cryptanalysis: Tight Conditional Bounds for Dense k-SUM and k-XOR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.00486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An average-case variant of the $k$-SUM conjecture asserts that finding $k$ numbers that sum to 0 in a list of $r$ random numbers, each of the order $r^k$, cannot be done in much less than $r^{\lceil k/2 \rceil}$ time. On the other hand, in the dense regime of parameters, where the list contains more numbers and many solutions exist, the complexity of finding one of them can be significantly improved by Wagner's $k$-tree algorithm. Such algorithms for $k$-SUM in the dense regime have many applications, notably in cryptanalysis.
  In this paper, assuming the average-case $k$-SUM conjecture, we prove that known algorithms are essentially optimal for $k= 3,4,5$. For $k&gt;5$, we prove the optimality of the $k$-tree algorithm for a limited range of parameters. We also prove similar results for $k$-XOR, where the sum is replaced with exclusive or.
  Our results are obtained by a self-reduction that, given an instance of $k$-SUM which has a few solutions, produces from it many instances in the dense regime. We solve each of these instances using the dense $k$-SUM oracle, and hope that a solution to a dense instance also solves the original problem. We deal with potentially malicious oracles (that repeatedly output correlated useless solutions) by an obfuscation process that adds noise to the dense instances. Using discrete Fourier analysis, we show that the obfuscation eliminates correlations among the oracle's solutions, even though its inputs are highly correlated.</description>

      <title>Almost Perfect Mutually Unbiased Bases that are Sparse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In dimension $d$, Mutually Unbiased Bases (MUBs) are a collection of orthonormal bases over $\mathbb{C}^d$ such that for any two vectors $v_1, v_2$ belonging to different bases, the scalar product $|\braket{v_1|v_2}| = \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}$. The upper bound on the number of such bases is $d+1$. Constructions to achieve this bound are known when $d$ is some power of prime. The situation is more restrictive in other cases and also when we consider the results over real rather than complex. Thus, certain relaxations of this model are considered in literature and consequently Approximate MUBs (AMUB) are studied. This enables one to construct potentially large number of such objects for $\mathbb{C}^d$ as well as in $\mathbb{R}^d$. In this regard, we propose the concept of Almost Perfect MUBs (APMUB), where we restrict the absolute value of inner product $|\braket{v_1|v_2}|$ to be two-valued, one being 0 and the other $ \leq \frac{1+\mathcal{O}(d^{-\lambda})}{\sqrt{d}}$, such that $\lambda &gt; 0$ and the numerator $1 + \mathcal{O}(d^{-\lambda}) \leq 2$. Each such vector constructed, has an important feature that large number of its components are zero and the non-zero components are of equal magnitude. Our techniques are based on combinatorial structures related to RBDs. We show that for several composite dimensions $d$, one can construct $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d})$ many APMUBs, in which cases the number of MUBs are significantly small. To be specific, this result works for $d$ of the form $(q-e)(q+f), \ q, e, f \in \mathbb{N}$, with the conditions $0 \leq f \leq e$ for constant $e, f$ and $q$ some power of prime. We also show that such APMUBs provide sets of Bi-angular vectors which are $\mathcal{O}(d^{\frac{3}{2}})$ in numbers, having high angular distances among them. Finally, as the MUBs are equivalent to a set of Hadamard matrices, we show that the APMUBs are so with the set of Weighing matrices.</description>

      <title>Arctic curves of the T-system with Slanted Initial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the T-system of type $A_\infty$, also known as the octahedron recurrence/equation, viewed as a 2+1-dimensional discrete evolution equation. Generalizing the study of [P. Di Francesco and R. Soto-Garrido. Arctic curves of the octahedron equation. J. Phys. A, 47(28):285204, 34, 2014], we consider initial data along parallel ``slanted" planes perpendicular to an arbitrary admissible direction $(r,s,t)\in {\mathbb Z}_+^3$. The solution of the T-system is interpreted as the partition function of a dimer model on some suitable ``pinecone" graph introduced in [M. Bousquet-M\'elou, J. Propp, and J. West. Perfect matchings for the three-term Gale-Robinson sequences. Electron. J. Combin., 16(1):Research Paper 125, 37, 2009]. The T-system formulation and some exact solutions in uniform or periodic cases allow us to explore the thermodynamic limit of the corresponding dimer models and to derive exact arctic curves separating the various phases of the system.</description>

      <title>Efficient Combinatorial Optimization via Heat Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are widespread but inherently challenging due to their discrete nature.The primary limitation of existing methods is that they can only access a small fraction of the solution space at each iteration, resulting in limited efficiency for searching the global optimal. To overcome this challenge, diverging from conventional efforts of expanding the solver's search scope, we focus on enabling information to actively propagate to the solver through heat diffusion. By transforming the target function while preserving its optima, heat diffusion facilitates information flow from distant regions to the solver, providing more efficient navigation. Utilizing heat diffusion, we propose a framework for solving general combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed methodology demonstrates superior performance across a range of the most challenging and widely encountered combinatorial optimizations. Echoing recent advancements in harnessing thermodynamics for generative artificial intelligence, our study further reveals its significant potential in advancing combinatorial optimization.</description>
