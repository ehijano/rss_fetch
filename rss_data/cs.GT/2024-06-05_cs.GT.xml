      <title>The complexity of approximate (coarse) correlated equilibrium for incomplete information games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the iteration complexity of decentralized learning of approximate correlated equilibria in incomplete information games.
  On the negative side, we prove that in $\mathit{extensive}$-$\mathit{form}$ $\mathit{games}$, assuming $\mathsf{PPAD} \not\subset \mathsf{TIME}(n^{\mathsf{polylog}(n)})$, any polynomial-time learning algorithms must take at least $2^{\log_2^{1-o(1)}(|\mathcal{I}|)}$ iterations to converge to the set of $\epsilon$-approximate correlated equilibrium, where $|\mathcal{I}|$ is the number of nodes in the game and $\epsilon &gt; 0$ is an absolute constant. This nearly matches, up to the $o(1)$ term, the algorithms of [PR'24, DDFG'24] for learning $\epsilon$-approximate correlated equilibrium, and resolves an open question of Anagnostides, Kalavasis, Sandholm, and Zampetakis [AKSZ'24]. Our lower bound holds even for the easier solution concept of $\epsilon$-approximate $\mathit{coarse}$ correlated equilibrium
  On the positive side, we give uncoupled dynamics that reach $\epsilon$-approximate correlated equilibria of a $\mathit{Bayesian}$ $\mathit{game}$ in polylogarithmic iterations, without any dependence of the number of types. This demonstrates a separation between Bayesian games and extensive-form games.</description>

      <title>Can a Few Decide for Many? The Metric Distortion of Sortition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works have studied the design of algorithms for selecting representative sortition panels. However, the most central question remains unaddressed: Do these panels reflect the entire population's opinion? We present a positive answer by adopting the concept of metric distortion from computational social choice, which aims to quantify how much a panel's decision aligns with the ideal decision of the population when preferences and agents lie on a metric space. We show that uniform selection needs only logarithmically many agents in terms of the number of alternatives to achieve almost optimal distortion. We also show that Fair Greedy Capture, a selection algorithm introduced recently by Ebadian &amp; Micha (2024), matches uniform selection's guarantees of almost optimal distortion and also achieves constant ex-post distortion, ensuring a "best of both worlds" performance.</description>

      <title>Formal Methods for An Iterated Volunteer's Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.12846v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Game theory provides a paradigm through which we can study the evolving communication and phenomena that occur via rational agent interaction. In this work, we design a model framework and explore The Volunteer's Dilemma with the goals of 1) modeling it as a stochastic concurrent multiplayer game, 2) constructing properties to verify model correctness and reachability, 3) constructing strategy synthesis graphs to understand how the game is iteratively stepped through most optimally and, 4) analyzing a series of parameters to understand correlations with expected local and global rewards over a finite time horizon.</description>

      <title>On the completeness of several fortification-interdiction games in the Polynomial Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fortification-interdiction games are tri-level adversarial games where two opponents act in succession to protect, disrupt and simply use an infrastructure for a specific purpose. Many such games have been formulated and tackled in the literature through specific algorithmic methods, however very few investigations exist on the completeness of such fortification problems in order to locate them rigorously in the polynomial hierarchy. We clarify the completeness status of several well-known fortification problems, such as the Tri-level Interdiction Knapsack Problem with unit fortification and attack weights, the Max-flow Interdiction Problem and Shortest Path Interdiction Problem with Fortification, the Multi-level Critical Node Problem with unit weights, as well as a well-studied electric grid defence planning problem. For all of these problems, we prove their completeness either for the $\Sigma^p_2$ or the $\Sigma^p_3$ class of the polynomial hierarchy. We also prove that the Multi-level Fortification-Interdiction Knapsack Problem with an arbitrary number of protection and interdiction rounds and unit fortification and attack weights is complete for any level of the polynomial hierarchy, therefore providing a useful basis for further attempts at proving the completeness of protection-interdiction games at any level of said hierarchy.</description>

      <title>It Takes Two: A Peer-Prediction Solution for Blockchain Verifier's Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The security of blockchain systems is fundamentally based on the decentralized consensus in which the majority of parties behave honestly, and the process of content verification is essential to keep the robustness of blockchain systems. However, the phenomenon that a secure blockchain system with few or no cheaters could not provide sufficient incentive for verifiers to honestly perform the costly verification, referred to as the Verifier's Dilemma, could severely undermine the fundamental security of blockchain systems. While existing works have attempted to insert deliberate errors to disincentivize lazy verification, the decentralized environment makes it impossible to judge the correctness of verification or detect malicious verifiers directly.
  In this paper, we initiate the research that leverages the peer prediction approach towards the design of Bayesian truthful mechanisms for the decentralized verification game among multiple verifiers, incentivizing all verifiers to perform honest verification without access to the ground truth even in the presence of noisy observations in the verification process. With theoretically guaranteed truthfulness of our mechanism for the verification game, our work provides a framework of verification mechanisms that enhances the security and robustness of the blockchain and potentially other decentralized systems.</description>

      <title>Online Fair Allocation of Perishable Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a practically motivated variant of the canonical online fair allocation problem: a decision-maker has a budget of perishable resources to allocate over a fixed number of rounds. Each round sees a random number of arrivals, and the decision-maker must commit to an allocation for these individuals before moving on to the next round. The goal is to construct a sequence of allocations that is envy-free and efficient. Our work makes two important contributions toward this problem: we first derive strong lower bounds on the optimal envy-efficiency trade-off that demonstrate that a decision-maker is fundamentally limited in what she can hope to achieve relative to the no-perishing setting; we then design an algorithm achieving these lower bounds which takes as input $(i)$ a prediction of the perishing order, and $(ii)$ a desired bound on envy. Given the remaining budget in each period, the algorithm uses forecasts of future demand and perishing to adaptively choose one of two carefully constructed guardrail quantities. We demonstrate our algorithm's strong numerical performance - and state-of-the-art, perishing-agnostic algorithms' inefficacy - on simulations calibrated to a real-world dataset.</description>

      <title>State-Constrained Zero-Sum Differential Games with One-Sided Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study zero-sum differential games with state constraints and one-sided information, where the informed player (Player 1) has a categorical payoff type unknown to the uninformed player (Player 2). The goal of Player 1 is to minimize his payoff without violating the constraints, while that of Player 2 is to violate the state constraints if possible, or to maximize the payoff otherwise. One example of the game is a man-to-man matchup in football. Without state constraints, Cardaliaguet (2007) showed that the value of such a game exists and is convex to the common belief of players. Our theoretical contribution is an extension of this result to games with state constraints and the derivation of the primal and dual subdynamic principles necessary for computing behavioral strategies. Different from existing works that are concerned about the scalability of no-regret learning in games with discrete dynamics, our study reveals the underlying structure of strategies for belief manipulation resulting from information asymmetry and state constraints. This structure will be necessary for scalable learning on games with continuous actions and long time windows. We use a simplified football game to demonstrate the utility of this work, where we reveal player positions and belief states in which the attacker should (or should not) play specific random deceptive moves to take advantage of information asymmetry, and compute how the defender should respond.</description>

Abstract: The Plurality rule for linear orders selects the alternatives most frequently appearing in the first position of those orders, while the Anti-Plurality rule selects the alternatives least often occurring in the final position. We explore extensions of these rules to partial orders, offering axiomatic characterizations for these extensions.</description>

      <title>Reachability and Safety Games under TSO Semantics (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider games played on the transtion graph of concurrent programs running under the Total Store Order (TSO) weak memory model. Games are frequently used to model the interaction between a system and its environment, in this case between the concurrent processes and the nondeterminisitic TSO buffer updates. The game is played by two players, who alternatingly make a move: The process player can execute any enabled instruction of the processes, while the update player takes care of updating the messages in the buffers that are between each process andthe shared memory. We show that the reachability and safety problem of this game reduce to the analysis of single-process (non-concurrent) programs. In particular, they exhibit only finite-state behaviour. Because of this, we introduce different notions of fairness, which force the two players to behave in a more realistic way. Both the reachability and safety problem then become undecidable.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Population Games: A Tractable Intersection of Mean-Field Games and Population Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.14662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many real-world large-scale decision problems, self-interested agents have individual dynamics and optimize their own long-term payoffs. Important examples include the competitive access to shared resources (e.g., roads, energy, or bandwidth) but also non-engineering domains like epidemic propagation and control. These problems are natural to model as mean-field games. Existing mathematical formulations of mean field games have had limited applicability in practice, since they require solving non-standard initial-terminal-value problems that are tractable only in limited special cases. In this letter, we propose a novel formulation, along with computational tools, for a practically relevant class of Dynamic Population Games (DPGs), which correspond to discrete-time, finite-state-and-action, stationary mean-field games. Our main contribution is a mathematical reduction of Stationary Nash Equilibria (SNE) in DPGs to standard Nash Equilibria (NE) in static population games. This reduction is leveraged to guarantee the existence of a SNE, develop an evolutionary dynamics-based SNE computation algorithm, and derive simple conditions that guarantee stability and uniqueness of the SNE. We provide two examples of applications: fair resource allocation with heterogeneous agents and control of epidemic propagation.

      <title>Voting power in the Council of the European Union: A comprehensive sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Council of the European Union (EU) is one of the main decision-making bodies of the EU. Many decisions require a qualified majority: the support of 55% of the member states (currently 15) that represent at least 65% of the total population. We investigate how the power distribution, based on the Shapley-Shubik index, and the proportion of winning coalitions change if these criteria are modified within reasonable bounds. The power of the two countries with about 4% of the total population each is found to be almost flat. The level of decisiveness decreases if the population criterion is above 68\% or the states criterion is at least 17. The proportion of winning coalitions can be increased from 13.2% to 20.8% (30.1%) such that the maximal relative change in the Shapley-Shubik indices remains below 3.5% (5.5%). Our results are indispensable to evaluate any proposal for reforming the qualified majority voting system.</description>

      <title>Measuring Bargaining Abilities of LLMs: A Benchmark and A Buyer-Enhancement Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15813v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bargaining is an important and unique part of negotiation between humans. As LLM-driven agents learn to negotiate and act like real humans, how to evaluate agents' bargaining abilities remains an open problem. For the first time, we formally described the Bargaining task as an asymmetric incomplete information game, defining the gains of the Buyer and Seller in multiple bargaining processes. It allows us to quantitatively assess an agent's performance in the Bargain task. We collected a real product price dataset, AmazonHistoryPrice, and conducted evaluations of various LLM agents' bargaining abilities. We find that playing a Buyer is much harder than a Seller, and increasing model size can not effectively improve the Buyer's performance. To address the challenge, we propose a novel approach called OG-Narrator that integrates a deterministic Offer Generator to control the price range of Buyer's offers, and an LLM Narrator to create natural language sentences for generated offers. Experimental results show that OG-Narrator improves the buyer's deal rates from 26.67% to 88.88% and brings a ten times multiplication of profits on all baselines, even a model that has not been aligned.</description>

      <title>Social Choice Should Guide AI Alignment in Dealing with Diverse Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models such as GPT-4 are fine-tuned to avoid unsafe or otherwise problematic behavior, such as helping to commit crimes or producing racist text. One approach to fine-tuning, called reinforcement learning from human feedback, learns from humans' expressed preferences over multiple outputs. Another approach is constitutional AI, in which the input from humans is a list of high-level principles. But how do we deal with potentially diverging input from humans? How can we aggregate the input into consistent data about "collective" preferences or otherwise use it to make collective choices about model behavior? In this paper, we argue that the field of social choice is well positioned to address these questions, and we discuss ways forward for this agenda, drawing on discussions in a recent workshop on Social Choice for AI Ethics and Safety held in Berkeley, CA, USA in December 2023.</description>
