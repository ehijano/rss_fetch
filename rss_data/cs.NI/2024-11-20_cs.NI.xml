      <title>A Software Platform for Testing Multi-Link Operation in Industrial Wi-Fi Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Link Operation (MLO) in Wi-Fi 7 is expected to tangibly boost throughput while lowering transmission latency at the same time. This is very relevant in industrial scenarios and makes MLO suitable, e.g., to support seamless device mobility. Benefits depend on the ability of multi-link devices to select at run-time the best link, among the available ones, in order to maximize both communication performance and reliability.
  In this paper an experimental platform is proposed, with the aim of leveraging commercial hardware and open source software, and easing prototyping and evaluation of MLO techniques. The platform has been employed to analyze the transmission quality of two pairs of non-overlapping channels, and in particular to assess whether or not adequate diversity is provided, so that those channels can be exploited to improve reliability. Results point out that correlation between different links is, in most cases, limited, which makes MLO a valuable approach.</description>

      <title>On the Accuracy and Precision of Moving Averages to Estimate Wi-Fi Link Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radio spectrum is characterized by a noticeable variability, which impairs performance and determinism of every wireless communication technology. To counteract this aspect, mechanisms like Minstrel are customarily employed in real Wi-Fi devices, and the adoption of machine learning for optimization is envisaged in next-generation Wi-Fi 8. All these approaches require communication quality to be monitored at runtime.
  In this paper, the effectiveness of simple techniques based on moving averages to estimate wireless link quality is analyzed, to assess their advantages and weaknesses. Results can be used, e.g., as a baseline when studying how artificial intelligence can be employed to mitigate unpredictability of wireless networks by providing reliable estimates about current spectrum conditions.</description>

      <title>DT-RaDaR: Digital Twin Assisted Robot Navigation using Differential Ray-Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous system navigation is a well-researched and evolving field. Recent advancements in improving robot navigation have sparked increased interest among researchers and practitioners, especially in the use of sensing data. However, this heightened focus has also raised significant privacy concerns, particularly for robots that rely on cameras and LiDAR for navigation. Our innovative concept of Radio Frequency (RF) map generation through ray-tracing (RT) within digital twin environments effectively addresses these concerns. In this paper, we propose DT-RaDaR, a robust privacy-preserving, deep reinforcement learning-based framework for robot navigation that leverages RF ray-tracing in both static and dynamic indoor scenarios as well as in smart cities. We introduce a streamlined framework for generating RF digital twins using open-source tools like Blender and NVIDIA's Sionna RT. This approach allows for high-fidelity replication of real-world environments and RF propagation models, optimized for service robot navigation. Several experimental validations and results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework in indoor environments and smart cities, positioning our work as a significant advancement toward the practical implementation of robot navigation using ray-tracing-generated data.</description>

      <title>Online RMLSA in EONs with $A^3G$: Adaptive ACO with Augmentation of Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Routing and Spectrum Assignment (RSA) represents a significant challenge within Elastic Optical Networks (EONs), particularly in dynamic traffic scenarios where the network undergoes continuous changes. Integrating multiple modulation formats transforms it into Routing Modulation Level and Spectrum Assignment (RMLSA) problem, thereby making it more challenging. Traditionally, addressing the RSA problem involved identifying a fixed number of paths and subsequently allocating spectrum among them. Numerous heuristic and metaheuristic approaches have been proposed for RSA using this two-step methodology. However, solving for routing and assignment of spectrum independently is not recommended due to their interdependencies and their impact on resource utilization, fragmentation and bandwidth blocking probability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to solve the RMLSA problem jointly in dynamic traffic scenarios, inspired by Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). This approach involves augmenting the network into an Auxiliary Graph and transforming conventional ACO into a constraint-based ACO variant that adapts to the constraints of EONs. This adaptation also includes an adaptive initiation process and an aggressive termination strategy aimed at achieving faster convergence. Moreover, we have introduced a novel objective/fitness function, to minimize average network fragmentation while ensuring optimal spectrum resource utilization, thereby reducing overall blocking probability.</description>

      <title>Meeting Future Mobile Traffic Needs by Peak-Throughput Design of Next-Gen RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing congestion in current mobile networks necessitates innovative solutions. This paper explores the potential of mmWave 5G networks in urban settings, focusing on Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) and the Smart Radio Environment (SRE). The mmWave traffic will be mainly made of short bursts to transfer large volumes of data and long idle periods where data are processed. This must change the way of designing mobile radio networks. To this extent, we propose network planning models leveraging the maximization of the achievable peak throughput. Results highlight the advantages of this approach during the network planning phase, providing insights into better accommodating the demands of mobile traffic without sacrificing the overall network capacity.</description>

      <title>Radiance Field Delta Video Compression in Edge-Enabled Vehicular Metaverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offload computationally intensive tasks to multi-access edge computing (MEC) servers via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, enabling applications within the vehicular metaverse, which transforms physical environment into the digital space enabling advanced analysis or predictive modeling. A core challenge is physical-to-virtual (P2V) synchronization through digital twins (DTs), reliant on MEC networks and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). To address this, we introduce radiance field (RF) delta video compression (RFDVC), which uses RF-encoder and RF-decoder architecture using distributed RFs as DTs storing photorealistic 3D urban scene in compressed form. This method extracts differences between CAV-frame capturing actual traffic and RF-frame capturing empty scene from the same pose in batches encoded and transmitted over the MEC network. Experiments show data savings up to 90% against H.264 codec and 45% against H.265 codec under different conditions as lighting changes, rain and fog. RFDVC exhibits greater resilience to transmission errors, achieving a bit error rate (BER) of approximately 10^-1.6 at signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 10 dB, compared to 10^-1.4 for standard video coding.</description>

      <title>AI Flow at the Network Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants have led to remarkable progress across various domains, demonstrating impressive capabilities and unprecedented potential. In the era of ubiquitous connectivity, leveraging communication networks to distribute intelligence is a transformative concept, envisioning AI-powered services accessible at the network edge. However, pushing large models from the cloud to resource-constrained environments faces critical challenges. Model inference on low-end devices leads to excessive latency and performance bottlenecks, while raw data transmission over limited bandwidth networks causes high communication overhead. This article presents AI Flow, a framework that streamlines the inference process by jointly leveraging the heterogeneous resources available across devices, edge nodes, and cloud servers, making intelligence flow across networks. To facilitate cooperation among multiple computational nodes, the proposed framework explores a paradigm shift in the design of communication network systems from transmitting information flow to intelligence flow, where the goal of communications is task-oriented and folded into the inference process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through an image captioning use case, showcasing the ability to reduce response latency while maintaining high-quality captions. This article serves as a position paper for identifying the motivation, challenges, and principles of AI Flow.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10273v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the transformative potential of digital twin (DT) technology for non-terrestrial networks (NTNs). NTNs, comprising airborne and space-borne elements, face unique challenges in network control, management, and optimization. DT technology provides a novel framework for designing and managing complex cyber-physical systems with enhanced automation, intelligence, and resilience. By offering a dynamic virtual representation of the NTN ecosystem, DTs enable real-time monitoring, simulation, and data-driven decision-making. This paper explores the integration of DTs into NTNs, identifying technical challenges and highlighting some key enabling technologies. Emphasis is placed on technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, generative AI, space-based clouds, quantum computing, and others, highlighting their potential to empower DT development for NTNs. To illustrate these concepts, we present a case study demonstrating the implementation of a data-driven DT model for enabling dynamic, service-oriented network slicing within an open radio access network (O-RAN) architecture tailored for NTNs. This work aims to advance the understanding and application of DT technology, contributing to the evolution of network control and management in the dynamic and rapidly changing landscape of non-terrestrial communication systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02240v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Owing to its outstanding parallel computing capabilities, quantum computing (QC) has been a subject of continuous attention. With the gradual maturation of QC platforms, it has increasingly played a significant role in various fields such as transportation, pharmaceuticals, and industrial manufacturing,achieving unprecedented milestones. In modern society, wireless communication stands as an indispensable infrastructure, with its essence lying in optimization. Although artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and mathematical optimization have greatly enhanced the performance of wireless communication, the rapid attainment of optimal solutions for wireless communication problems remains an unresolved challenge. QC, however, presents a new alternative. This paper aims to elucidate the fundamentals of QC and explore its applications in wireless communications and networking. First, we will provide a tutorial on QC, covering its basics, characteristics, and popular QC algorithms. Next, we will introduce the applications of QC in communication and networking, followed by its applications in miscellaneous areas such as security and privacy, localization and tracking, and video streaming. Finally,we will discuss remaining open issues before concluding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By means of numerical analysis conducted with the aid of the computer, the collective synchronization of coupled phase oscillators in the Kuramoto model in the connected regime of random networks of various sizes is studied. The oscillators synchronize and achieve phase coherence, and this process is not significantly affected by the level of connectivity of the network. If the probability that two oscillators are coupled is around the network connectivity threshold synchronization still occurs, although in a more attenuated way. If the size of the network is sufficiently large the oscillators have a phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intelligent surface (IS) is envisioned as a promising technology for the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, which can effectively reconfigure the wireless propagation environment via dynamically controllable signal reflection/transmission. In particular, integrating passive intelligent surface (IS) into the base station (BS) is a novel solution to enhance the wireless network throughput and coverage both cost-effectively and energyefficiently. In this article, we provide an overview of IS-integrated BSs for wireless networks, including their motivations, practical architectures, and main design issues. Moreover, numerical results are presented to compare the performance of different IS-integrated BS architectures as well as the conventional BS without IS. Finally, promising directions are pointed out to stimulate future research on IS-BS/terminal integration in wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Careless Whisper: Exploiting Stealthy End-to-End Leakage in Mobile Instant Messengers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With over 3 billion users globally, mobile instant messaging apps have become indispensable for both personal and professional communication. Besides plain messaging, many services implement additional features such as delivery and read receipts informing a user when a message has successfully reached its target. This paper highlights that delivery receipts can pose significant privacy risks to users. We use specifically crafted messages that trigger delivery receipts allowing any user to be pinged without their knowledge or consent. By using this technique at high frequency, we demonstrate how an attacker could extract private information such as the online and activity status of a victim, e.g., screen on/off. Moreover, we can infer the number of currently active user devices and their operating system, as well as launch resource exhaustion attacks, such as draining a user's battery or data allowance, all without generating any notification on the target side. Due to the widespread adoption of vulnerable messengers (WhatsApp and Signal) and the fact that any user can be targeted simply by knowing their phone number, we argue for a design change to address this issue.</description>
