      <title>Sound Conflict Analysis for Timed Contract Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One can find various temporal deontic logics in literature, most focusing on discrete time. The literature on real-time constraints and deontic norms is much sparser. Thus, many analysis techniques which have been developed for deontic logics have not been considered for continuous time. In this paper we focus on the notion of conflict analysis which has been extensively studied for discrete time deontic logics. We present a sound, but not complete algorithm for detecting conflicts in timed contract automata and prove the correctness of the algorithm, illustrating the analysis on a case study.</description>

      <title>FLARE: Faithful Logic-Aided Reasoning and Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern Question Answering (QA) and Reasoning approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) commonly use prompting techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), assuming the resulting generation will have a more granular exploration and reasoning over the question space and scope. However, such methods struggle with generating outputs that are faithful to the intermediate chain of reasoning produced by the model. On the other end of the spectrum, neuro-symbolic methods such as Faithful CoT (F-CoT) propose to combine LLMs with external symbolic solvers. While such approaches boast a high degree of faithfulness, they usually require a model trained for code generation and struggle with tasks that are ambiguous or hard to formalise strictly. We introduce \textbf{F}aithful \textbf{L}ogic-\textbf{A}ided \textbf{R}easoning and \textbf{E}xploration (\textbf{\ours}), a novel interpretable approach for traversing the problem space using task decompositions. We use the LLM to plan a solution, soft-formalise the query into facts and predicates using a logic programming code and simulate that code execution using an exhaustive multi-hop search over the defined space. Our method allows us to compute the faithfulness of the reasoning process w.r.t. the generated code and analyse the steps of the multi-hop search without relying on external solvers. Our methods achieve SOTA results on $\mathbf{7}$ out of $\mathbf{9}$ diverse reasoning benchmarks. We also show that model faithfulness positively correlates with overall performance and further demonstrate that {\textbf{\ours}} allows pinpointing the decisive factors sufficient for and leading to the correct answer with optimal reasoning during the multi-hop search.</description>

      <title>On the Home-Space Problem for Petri Nets and its Ackermannian Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.02697v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set of configurations $H$ is a home-space for a set of configurations $X$ of aPetri net if every configuration reachable from (any configuration in) $X$ can reach (some configuration in) $H$. The semilinear home-space problem for Petri nets asks, given a Petri net and semilinear sets of configurations $X$, $H$, if $H$ is a home-space for $X$. In 1989, David de Frutos Escrig and Colette Johnen proved that the problem is decidable when $X$ is a singleton and $H$ is a finite union of linear sets with the same periods. In this paper, we show that the general (semilinear) problem is decidable. This result is obtained by proving a duality between the reachability problem and the non-home-space problem. In particular, we prove that for any Petri net and any semilinear set of configurations $H$ we can effectively compute a semilinear set $C$ of configurations, called a non-reachability core for $H$, such that for every set $X$ the set $H$ is not a home-space for $X$ if, and only if, $C$ is reachable from $X$. We show that the established relation to the reachability problem yields the Ackermann-completeness of the (semilinear) home-space problem. For this we also show that, given a Petri net with an initial marking, the set of minimal reachable markings can be constructed in Ackermannian time.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Reasoning over Relational Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many important computational structures involve an intricate interplay between algebraic features (given by operations on the underlying set) and relational features (taking account of notions such as order or distance). This paper investigates algebras over relational structures axiomatized by an infinitary Horn theory, which subsume, for example, partial algebras, various incarnations of ordered algebras, quantitative algebras introduced by Mardare, Panangaden, and Plotkin, and their recent extension to generalized metric spaces and lifted algebraic signatures by Mio, Sarkis, and Vignudelli. To this end, we develop the notion of clustered equation, which is inspired by Mardare et al.'s basic conditional equations in the theory of quantitative algebras, at the level of generality of arbitrary relational structures, and we prove that it is equivalent to an abstract categorical form of equation earlier introduced by Milius and Urbat. Our main results are a family of Birkhoff-type variety theorems (classifying the expressive power of clustered equations) and an exactness theorem (classifying abstract equations by a congruence property).</description>

      <title>Identity Testing for Radical Expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.07961v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Radical Identity Testing problem (RIT): Given an algebraic circuit representing a polynomial $f\in \mathbb{Z}[x_1, \ldots, x_k]$ and nonnegative integers $a_1, \ldots, a_k$ and $d_1, \ldots,$ $d_k$, written in binary, test whether the polynomial vanishes at the real radicals $\sqrt[d_1]{a_1}, \ldots,\sqrt[d_k]{a_k}$, i.e., test whether $f(\sqrt[d_1]{a_1}, \ldots,\sqrt[d_k]{a_k}) = 0$. We place the problem in coNP assuming the Generalised Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), improving on the straightforward PSPACE upper bound obtained by reduction to the existential theory of reals. Next we consider a restricted version, called $2$-RIT, where the radicals are square roots of prime numbers, written in binary. It was known since the work of Chen and Kao that $2$-RIT is at least as hard as the polynomial identity testing problem, however no better upper bound than PSPACE was known prior to our work. We show that $2$-RIT is in coRP assuming GRH and in coNP unconditionally. Our proof relies on theorems from algebraic and analytic number theory, such as the Chebotarev density theorem and quadratic reciprocity.</description>
