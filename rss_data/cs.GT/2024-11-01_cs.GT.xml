      <title>Temporal Fair Division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study temporal fair division, whereby a set of agents are allocated a (possibly different) set of goods on each day for a period of days. We study this setting, as well as a number of its special cases formed by the restrictions to two agents, same goods on each day, identical preferences, or combinations thereof, and chart out the landscape of achieving two types of fairness guarantees simultaneously: fairness on each day (per day) and fairness over time (up to each day, or the weaker version, overall).
  In the most general setting, we prove that there always exists an allocation that is stochastically-dominant envy-free up to one good (SD-EF1) per day and proportional up to one good (PROP1) overall, and when all the agents have identical preferences, we show that SD-EF1 per day and SD-EF1 overall can be guaranteed. For the case of two agents, we prove that SD-EF1 per day and EF1 up to each day can be guaranteed using an envy balancing technique. We provide counterexamples for other combinations that establish our results as among the best guarantees possible, but also leaving open some tantalizing questions.</description>

      <title>Unveiling User Satisfaction and Creator Productivity Trade-Offs in Recommendation Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On User-Generated Content (UGC) platforms, recommendation algorithms significantly impact creators' motivation to produce content as they compete for algorithmically allocated user traffic. This phenomenon subtly shapes the volume and diversity of the content pool, which is crucial for the platform's sustainability. In this work, we demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that a purely relevance-driven policy with low exploration strength boosts short-term user satisfaction but undermines the long-term richness of the content pool. In contrast, a more aggressive exploration policy may slightly compromise user satisfaction but promote higher content creation volume. Our findings reveal a fundamental trade-off between immediate user satisfaction and overall content production on UGC platforms. Building on this finding, we propose an efficient optimization method to identify the optimal exploration strength, balancing user and creator engagement. Our model can serve as a pre-deployment audit tool for recommendation algorithms on UGC platforms, helping to align their immediate objectives with sustainable, long-term goals.</description>

      <title>New Combinatorial Insights for Monotone Apportionment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The apportionment problem constitutes a fundamental problem in democratic societies: How to distribute a fixed number of seats among a set of states in proportion to the states' populations? This--seemingly simple--task has led to a rich literature and has become well known in the context of the US House of Representatives. In this paper, we connect the design of monotone apportionment methods to classic problems from discrete geometry and combinatorial optimization and explore the extent to which randomization can enhance proportionality.
  We first focus on the well-studied family of stationary divisor methods, which satisfy the strong population monotonicity property, and show that this family produces only a slightly superlinear number of different outputs as a function of the number of states. While our upper and lower bounds leave a small gap, we show that--surprisingly--closing this gap would solve a long-standing open problem from discrete geometry, known as the complexity of $k$-levels in line arrangements. The main downside of divisor methods is their violation of the quota axiom, i.e., every state should receive $\lfloor q_i\rfloor$ or $\lceil q_i\rceil$ seats, where $q_i$ is the proportional share of the state. As we show that randomizing over divisor methods can only partially overcome this issue, we propose a relaxed version of divisor methods in which the total number of seats may slightly deviate from the house size. By randomizing over them, we can simultaneously satisfy population monotonicity, quota, and ex-ante proportionality.
  Finally, we turn our attention to quota-compliant methods that are house-monotone, i.e., no state may lose a seat when the house size is increased. We provide a polyhedral characterization based on network flows, which implies a simple description of all ex-ante proportional randomized methods that are house-monotone and quota-compliant.</description>

      <title>The museum pass problem with consortia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the museum pass problem to incorporate the market structure. To be more precise, we consider that museums are organized into several pass programs or consortia. Within this framework, we propose four allocation mechanisms based on the market structure and the principles of proportionality and egalitarianism. All these mechanisms satisfy different reasonable properties related to fairness and stability which serve to axiomatically characterize them.</description>

      <title>Fair Division of Chores with Budget Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fair allocation of indivisible chores to agents under budget constraints, where each chore has an objective size and disutility. This model captures scenarios where a set of chores need to be divided among agents with limited time, and each chore has a specific time needed for completion. We propose a budget-constrained model for allocating indivisible chores, and systematically explore the differences between goods and chores in this setting. We establish the existence of an EFX allocation. We then show that EF2 allocations are polynomial-time computable in general; for many restricted settings, we strengthen this result to EF1. For divisible chores, we develop an efficient algorithm for computing an EF allocation.</description>

      <title>Persuading a Credible Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How to optimally persuade an agent who has a private type? When elicitation is feasible, this amounts to a fairly standard principal-agent-style mechanism design problem, where the persuader employs a mechanism to first elicit the agent's type and then plays the corresponding persuasion strategy based on the agent's report. The optimal mechanism design problem in this setting is relatively well-understood in the literature, with incentive compatible (IC) mechanisms known to be optimal and computationally tractable. In this paper, we study this problem given a credible agent, i.e., if the agent claims they are of a certain type in response to the mechanism's elicitation, then they will act optimally with respect to the claimed type, even if they are actually not of that type.
  We present several interesting findings in this new setting that differ significantly from results in the non-credible setting. In terms of the structure of optimal mechanisms, we show that not only may IC mechanisms fail to be optimal, but all mechanisms following the standard `eliciting-then-persuading' mechanism design structure may be suboptimal. To achieve optimality requires two additional instruments -- pre-signaling and non-binding elicitation -- which naturally result in multi-stage mechanisms. We characterize optimal mechanisms under these design choices. Based on our characterization, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for computing optimal multi-stage mechanisms. We also discover that in scenarios that allow for it, partial information elicitation can be employed to improve the principal's payoff even further. Though, surprisingly, an unbounded number of rounds of information exchange between the principal and the agent may be necessary to achieve optimality.</description>

      <title>HarvestTech agriculture cooperatives: Beneficiaries and compensations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agricultural industries face increasing pressure to optimize efficiency and reduce costs in a competitive and resource-constrained global market. As firms seek innovative ways to enhance productivity, cooperative strategies have emerged as a promising solution to address these challenges. In this context, game theory provides a powerful framework for analyzing and structuring such cooperative efforts, ensuring that each firm's contribution is fairly rewarded. This paper presents an innovative approach to address challenges in agricultural crop processing through inter-firm cooperation. A new class of totally balanced games is introduced, which models the strategic interactions among companies processing agricultural products. The objective is to identify profit allocations that fairly compensate firms contributing to cost reduction and surplus processing for others. To achieve this, the allocations resulting from each type of compensation will be thoroughly examined, and a coalitionally stable compensation procedure will be established. The study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of cooperative strategies for optimizing agricultural processes. Lastly, the findings will be applied to a case study.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Network Intervention for Complex Systems: A Hierarchical Graph Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective governance and steering of behavior in complex multi-agent systems (MAS) are essential for managing system-wide outcomes, particularly in environments where interactions are structured by dynamic networks. In many applications, the goal is to promote pro-social behavior among agents, where network structure plays a pivotal role in shaping these interactions. This paper introduces a Hierarchical Graph Reinforcement Learning (HGRL) framework that governs such systems through targeted interventions in the network structure. Operating within the constraints of limited managerial authority, the HGRL framework demonstrates superior performance across a range of environmental conditions, outperforming established baseline methods. Our findings highlight the critical influence of agent-to-agent learning (social learning) on system behavior: under low social learning, the HGRL manager preserves cooperation, forming robust core-periphery networks dominated by cooperators. In contrast, high social learning accelerates defection, leading to sparser, chain-like networks. Additionally, the study underscores the importance of the system manager's authority level in preventing system-wide failures, such as agent rebellion or collapse, positioning HGRL as a powerful tool for dynamic network-based governance.</description>

      <title>On the Optimality of Dilated Entropy and Lower Bounds for Online Learning in Extensive-Form Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-order methods (FOMs) are arguably the most scalable algorithms for equilibrium computation in large extensive-form games. To operationalize these methods, a distance-generating function, acting as a regularizer for the strategy space, must be chosen. The ratio between the strong convexity modulus and the diameter of the regularizer is a key parameter in the analysis of FOMs. A natural question is then: what is the optimal distance-generating function for extensive-form decision spaces? In this paper, we make a number of contributions, ultimately establishing that the weight-one dilated entropy (DilEnt) distance-generating function is optimal up to logarithmic factors. The DilEnt regularizer is notable due to its iterate-equivalence with Kernelized OMWU (KOMWU) -- the algorithm with state-of-the-art dependence on the game tree size in extensive-form games -- when used in conjunction with the online mirror descent (OMD) algorithm. However, the standard analysis for OMD is unable to establish such a result; the only current analysis is by appealing to the iterate equivalence to KOMWU. We close this gap by introducing a pair of primal-dual treeplex norms, which we contend form the natural analytic viewpoint for studying the strong convexity of DilEnt. Using these norm pairs, we recover the diameter-to-strong-convexity ratio that predicts the same performance as KOMWU. Along with a new regret lower bound for online learning in sequence-form strategy spaces, we show that this ratio is nearly optimal. Finally, we showcase our analytic techniques by refining the analysis of Clairvoyant OMD when paired with DilEnt, establishing an $\mathcal{O}(n \log |\mathcal{V}| \log T/T)$ approximation rate to coarse correlated equilibrium in $n$-player games, where $|\mathcal{V}|$ is the number of reduced normal-form strategies of the players, establishing the new state of the art.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce anytime constraints to the multi-agent setting with the corresponding solution concept being anytime-constrained equilibrium (ACE). Then, we present a comprehensive theory of anytime-constrained Markov games, which includes (1) a computational characterization of feasible policies, (2) a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for computing ACE, and (3) a polynomial-time algorithm for approximately computing feasible ACE. Since computing a feasible policy is NP-hard even for two-player zero-sum games, our approximation guarantees are the best possible under worst-case analysis. We also develop the first theory of efficient computation for action-constrained Markov games, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Representative Social Choice: From Learning Theory to AI Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social choice theory is the study of preference aggregation across a population, used both in mechanism design for human agents and in the democratic alignment of language models. In this study, we propose the representative social choice framework for the modeling of democratic representation in collective decisions, where the number of issues and individuals are too large for mechanisms to consider all preferences directly. These scenarios are widespread in real-world decision-making processes, such as jury trials, indirect elections, legislation processes, corporate governance, and, more recently, language model alignment. In representative social choice, the population is represented by a finite sample of individual-issue pairs based on which social choice decisions are made. We show that many of the deepest questions in representative social choice can be naturally formulated as statistical learning problems, and prove the generalization properties of social choice mechanisms using the theory of machine learning. We further formulate axioms for representative social choice, and prove Arrow-like impossibility theorems with new combinatorial tools of analysis. Our framework introduces the representative approach to social choice, opening up research directions at the intersection of social choice, learning theory, and AI alignment.</description>

      <title>Network Games Induced Prior for Graph Topology Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning the graph topology of a complex network is challenging due to limited data availability and imprecise data models. A common remedy in existing works is to incorporate priors such as sparsity or modularity which highlight on the structural property of graph topology. We depart from these approaches to develop priors that are directly inspired by complex network dynamics. Focusing on social networks with actions modeled by equilibriums of linear quadratic games, we postulate that the social network topologies are optimized with respect to a social welfare function. Utilizing this prior knowledge, we propose a network games induced regularizer to assist graph learning. We then formulate the graph topology learning problem as a bilevel program. We develop a two-timescale gradient algorithm to tackle the latter. We draw theoretical insights on the optimal graph structure of the bilevel program and show that they agree with the topology in several man-made networks. Empirically, we demonstrate the proposed formulation gives rise to reliable estimate of graph topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a simple framework to analyze how targeted advertising interacts with market power. A designer chooses an advertising plan which allows it to flexibly manipulate the demand curve at some cost. A monopolist prices against this manipulated demand curve. We fully characterize the form and value of producer-optimal and consumer-optimal advertising plans under both ex-ante and ex-post measures of welfare. Flexibility is double-edged: producer-optimal plans substantially reduce consumer surplus vis-a-vis uniform advertising, but consumer-optimal plans can substantially improve consumer surplus. We discuss implications for the regulation of targeted advertising.</description>

      <title>Team-Fictitious Play for Reaching Team-Nash Equilibrium in Multi-team Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-team games, prevalent in robotics and resource management, involve team members striving for a joint best response against other teams. Team-Nash equilibrium (TNE) predicts the outcomes of such coordinated interactions. However, can teams of self-interested agents reach TNE? We introduce Team-Fictitious Play (Team-FP), a new variant of fictitious play where agents respond to the last actions of team members and the beliefs formed about other teams with some inertia in action updates. This design is essential in team coordination beyond the classical fictitious play dynamics. We focus on zero-sum potential team games (ZSPTGs) where teams can interact pairwise while the team members do not necessarily have identical payoffs. We show that Team-FP reaches near TNE in ZSPTGs with a quantifiable error bound. We extend Team-FP dynamics to multi-team Markov games for model-based and model-free cases. The convergence analysis tackles the challenge of non-stationarity induced by evolving opponent strategies based on the optimal coupling lemma and stochastic differential inclusion approximation methods. Our work strengthens the foundation for using TNE to predict the behavior of decentralized teams and offers a practical rule for team learning in multi-team environments. We provide extensive simulations of Team-FP dynamics and compare its performance with other widely studied dynamics such as smooth fictitious play and multiplicative weights update. We further explore how different parameters impact the speed of convergence.</description>

Abstract: Reward allocation, also known as the credit assignment problem, has been an important topic in economics, engineering, and machine learning. An important concept in reward allocation is the core, which is the set of stable allocations where no agent has the motivation to deviate from the grand coalition. In previous works, computing the core requires either knowledge of the reward function in deterministic games or the reward distribution in stochastic games. However, this is unrealistic, as the reward function or distribution is often only partially known and may be subject to uncertainty. In this paper, we consider the core learning problem in stochastic cooperative games, where the reward distribution is unknown. Our goal is to learn the expected core, that is, the set of allocations that are stable in expectation, given an oracle that returns a stochastic reward for an enquired coalition each round. Within the class of strictly convex games, we present an algorithm named \texttt{Common-Points-Picking} that returns a point in the expected core given a polynomial number of samples, with high probability. To analyse the algorithm, we develop a new extension of the separation hyperplane theorem for multiple convex sets.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Time Best-Response and Related Dynamics in Tullock Contests with Convex Costs</title>

Abstract: Tullock contests model real-life scenarios that range from competition among proof-of-work blockchain miners to rent-seeking and lobbying activities. We show that continuous-time best-response dynamics in Tullock contests with convex costs converges to the unique equilibrium using Lyapunov-style arguments. We then use this result to provide an algorithm for computing an approximate equilibrium. We also establish convergence of related discrete-time dynamics, e.g., when the agents best-respond to the empirical average action of other agents. These results indicate that the equilibrium is a reliable predictor of the agents' behavior in these games.</description>

      <title>On the Hardness of Fair Allocation under Ternary Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of fair allocation of indivisible items when agents have ternary additive valuations -- each agent values each item at some fixed integer values $a$, $b$, or $c$ that are common to all agents. The notions of fairness we consider are max Nash welfare (MNW), when $a$, $b$, and $c$ are non-negative, and max egalitarian welfare (MEW). We show that for any distinct non-negative $a$, $b$, and $c$, maximizing Nash welfare is APX-hard -- i.e., the problem does not admit a PTAS unless P = NP. We also show that for any distinct $a$, $b$, and $c$, maximizing egalitarian welfare is APX-hard except for a few cases when $b = 0$ that admit efficient algorithms. These results make significant progress towards completely characterizing the complexity of computing exact MNW allocations and MEW allocations. En route, we resolve open questions left by prior work regarding the complexity of computing MNW allocations under bivalued valuations, and MEW allocations under ternary mixed manna.</description>

      <title>Learning Social Welfare Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Is it possible to understand or imitate a policy maker's rationale by looking at past decisions they made? We formalize this question as the problem of learning social welfare functions belonging to the well-studied family of power mean functions. We focus on two learning tasks; in the first, the input is vectors of utilities of an action (decision or policy) for individuals in a group and their associated social welfare as judged by a policy maker, whereas in the second, the input is pairwise comparisons between the welfares associated with a given pair of utility vectors. We show that power mean functions are learnable with polynomial sample complexity in both cases, even if the comparisons are social welfare information is noisy. Finally, we design practical algorithms for these tasks and evaluate their performance.</description>

      <title>Pessimism of the Will, Optimism of the Intellect: Fair Protocols with Malicious but Rational Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fairness is a desirable and crucial property of many protocols that handle, for instance, exchanges of message.
  It states that if at least one agent engaging in the protocol is honest, then either the protocol will unfold correctly and fulfill its intended goal for all participants, or it will fail for everyone.
  In this work, we present a game-based framework for the study of fairness protocols, that does not define a priori an attacker model.
  It is based on the notion of strong secure equilibria, and leverages the conceptual and algorithmic toolbox of game theory.
  In the case of finite games, we provide decision procedures with tight complexity bounds for determining whether a protocol is immune to nefarious attacks from a coalition of participants, and whether such a protocol could exist based on the underlying graph structure and objectives.</description>

      <title>Game Connectivity and Adaptive Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10609v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the typical structure of games in terms of the connectivity properties of their best-response graphs. Our central result shows that almost every game that is 'generic' (without indifferences) and has a pure Nash equilibrium and a 'large' number of players is connected, meaning that every action profile that is not a pure Nash equilibrium can reach every pure Nash equilibrium via best-response paths. This has important implications for dynamics in games. In particular, we show that there are simple, uncoupled, adaptive dynamics for which period-by-period play converges almost surely to a pure Nash equilibrium in almost every large generic game that has one (which contrasts with the known fact that there is no such dynamic that leads almost surely to a pure Nash equilibrium in every generic game that has one). We build on recent results in probabilistic combinatorics for our characterisation of game connectivity.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithm for large-scale market equilibrium computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical algorithms for market equilibrium computation such as proportional response dynamics face scalability issues with Internet-based applications such as auctions, recommender systems, and fair division, despite having an almost linear runtime in terms of the product of buyers and goods. In this work, we provide the first quantum algorithm for market equilibrium computation with sub-linear performance. Our algorithm provides a polynomial runtime speedup in terms of the product of the number of buyers and goods while reaching the same optimization objective value as the classical algorithm. Numerical simulations of a system with 16384 buyers and goods support our theoretical results that our quantum algorithm provides a significant speedup.</description>

      <title>Large Model Strategic Thinking, Small Model Efficiency: Transferring Theory of Mind in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05241v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the performance of larger, newer Large Language Models continues to improve for strategic Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks, the demand for these state-of-the-art models increases commensurately. However, their deployment is costly both in terms of processing power and time. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of creating smaller, highly-performing specialized algorithms by way of fine-tuning. To do this, we first present a large pre-trained model with 20 unique scenarios that combine different social contexts with games of varying social dilemmas, record its answers, and use them for Q&amp;A fine-tuning on a smaller model of the same family. Our focus is on in-context game-theoretic decision-making, the same domain within which human interaction occurs and that requires both a theory of mind (or a semblance thereof) and an understanding of social dynamics. The smaller model is therefore trained not just on the answers provided, but also on the motivations provided by the larger model, which should contain advice and guidelines to navigate both strategic dilemmas and social cues. We find that the fine-tuned smaller language model consistently bridged the gap in performance between the smaller pre-trained version of the model and its larger relative and that its improvements extended in areas and contexts beyond the ones provided in the training examples, including on out-of-sample scenarios that include completely different game structures. On average for all games, through fine-tuning, the smaller model showed a 46% improvement measured as alignment towards the behavior of the larger model, with 100% representing indistinguishable behavior. When presented with out-of-sample social contexts and games, the fine-tuned model still displays remarkable levels of alignment, reaching an improvement of 18% and 28% respectively.</description>

      <title>State-Dependent Linear Utility Functions for Monetary Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theory of expected utility with state-dependent linear utility function for monetary returns, that includes results on first order stochastic dominance, mean-preserving spread, increasing-concave linear utility profiles and risk aversion. As an application of the expected utility theory developed here, we analyze the contract that a monopolist would offer in an insurance market that allowed for partial coverage of loss. We also define a utility function for monetary returns that in a certain sense reconciles state-dependent constant average utility of money with loss aversion and the Friedman-Savage hypothesis. As an immediate consequence of such a utility function, we obtain a profile of state-dependent linear utility functions for monetary returns, where states of nature correspond to mutually disjoint intervals in which monetary gains and losses may occur.</description>
