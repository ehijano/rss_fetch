      <title>A Comparative Study of TESS Light Curve Extraction Methods Applied to Blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blazars are characterized by largely aperiodic variability on timescales ranging from minutes to decades across the electromagnetic spectrum. The TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) mission provides continuous sampling of blazar variability on timescales ranging from tens of minutes to 27 days for a single sector observation. Proper removal of the background, thermal ramping, and onboard systematic effects are crucial to the extraction of a reliable blazar light curve. Multiple publicly available procedures have been created to correct for these effects. Using ground based observations from the Zwicky Transit Facility (ZTF) and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) as ``ground truth'' observations, we compare 6 different methods (Regression, Cotrending Basis Vectors (CBV), Pixel Level Decorrelation (PLD), eleanor, quaver, and simple differential photometry (SDP)) to each other, and to our ``ground truth'' observations, to identify which methods properly correct light curves of a sample of 11 bright blazars, including the suspected neutrino source TXS~0506+056. In addition to comparing the resulting light curves, we compare the slopes of the power spectral densities, perform least-square fitting to simultaneous ZTF data, and quantify other statistical qualities generated from the light curves of each method. We find that only three of the six methods compared (Simple Differential Photometry, eleanor, and quaver) produce TESS light curves consistent with the ground-based ZTF and ATLAS observations.</description>

      <title>Background information: a study on the sensitivity of astrophysical gravitational-wave background searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vast majority of gravitational-wave signals from stellar-mass compact binary mergers are too weak to be individually detected with present-day instruments and instead contribute to a faint, persistent background. This astrophysical background is targeted by searches that model the gravitational-wave ensemble collectively with a small set of parameters. The traditional search models the background as a stochastic field and estimates its amplitude by cross-correlating data from multiple interferometers. A different search uses gravitational-wave templates to marginalize over all individual event parameters and measure the duty cycle and population properties of binary mergers. Both searches ultimately estimate the total merger rate of compact binaries and are expected to yield a detection in the coming years. Given the conceptual and methodological differences between them, though, it is not well understood how their results should be mutually interpreted. In this paper, we use the Fisher information to study the implications of a background detection in terms of which region of the Universe each approach probes. Specifically, we quantify how information about the compact binary merger rate is accumulated by each search as a function of the event redshift. For the LIGO Design sensitivity and a uniform-in-comoving-volume distribution of equal-mass 30M_sol binaries, the traditional cross-correlation search obtains 99% of its information from binaries up to redshift 2.5 (average signal-to-noise-ratio &lt;8), and the template-based search from binaries up to redshift 1.0 (average signal-to-noise-ratio ~8). While we do not calculate the total information accumulated by each search, our analysis emphasizes the need to pair any claimed detection of the stochastic background with an assessment of which binaries contribute to said detection.</description>

      <title>Black hole outflows initiated by a large-scale magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accreting black hole sources show variable outflows at different mass scales. For instance, in the case of galactic nuclei, our own galactic center Sgr A* exhibits flares and outbursts in the X-ray and infrared bands. Recent studies suggest that the inner magnetospheres of these sources have a pronounced effect on such emissions. Accreting plasma carries the frozen-in magnetic flux along with it down to the black hole horizon. During the in-fall, the magnetic field intensifies and it can lead to a magnetically arrested state. We investigate the competing effects of inflows at the black hole horizon and the outflows developed in the accreting plasma due to the action of magnetic field in the inner magnetosphere and their implications. We start with a spherically symmetric Bondi-type inflow and introduce the magnetic field. In order to understand the influence of the initial configuration, we start the computations with an aligned magnetic field with respect to the black hole rotation axis. Then we proceed to the case of magnetic fields inclined to the black hole rotation axis. We employ the 2D and 3D versions of HARM code for the aligned field models while using the 3D version for the inclined field and compare the results of computations against each other. We observe how the magnetic lines of force start accreting with the plasma while an equatorial intermittent outflow develops and goes on pushing some material away from the black hole partially along the equatorial plane, and partly ejecting it out of the plane in the vertical direction. In consequence, the accretion rate also fluctuates. The black hole spin direction prevails at later stages and it determines the flow geometry near the event horizon, whereas on larger scales the flow geometry stays influenced by the initial inclination of the field.</description>

      <title>What we can learn about compact binary mergers from their kilonova signals?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact binary mergers are sources of gravitational waves, and can be accompanied by electromagnetic signals. We discuss the possible features in the kilonova emissions which may help distinguish the black hole - neutron star mergers from the binary neutron stars. In addition, the amount of ejected material may depend on whether the system undergoes the creation of a transient hyper-massive, differentially rotating neutron star. In this context, the numerical simulations of post-merger systems and their outflows are important for our understanding of the nature of short GRB progenitor systems. In this article, we present a suite of GR MHD simulations performed by the CTP PAS astrophysics group, to model the neutrino driven disk winds and their contribution to the kilonova emissions. The contribution of the disk wind to the jet collimation and variability is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Including a Luminous Central Remnant in Radiative Transfer Simulations for Type Iax Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Iax supernovae (SNe Iax) are proposed to arise from deflagrations of Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs. Previous deflagration simulations have achieved good agreement with the light curves and spectra of intermediate-luminosity and bright SNe Iax. However, the model light curves decline too quickly after peak, particularly in red optical and NIR bands. Deflagration models with a variety of ignition configurations do not fully unbind the white dwarf, leaving a remnant polluted with $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$. Emission from such a remnant may contribute to the luminosity of SNe Iax. Here we investigate the impact of adding a central energy source, assuming instantaneous powering by $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ decay in the remnant, in radiative transfer calculations of deflagration models. Including the remnant contribution improves agreement with the light curves of SNe Iax, particularly due to the slower post-maximum decline of the models. Spectroscopic agreement is also improved, with intermediate-luminosity and faint models showing greatest improvement. We adopt the full remnant $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ mass predicted for bright models, but good agreement with intermediate-luminosity and faint SNe Iax is only possible for remnant $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ masses significantly lower than those predicted. This may indicate that some of the $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ decay energy in the remnant does not contribute to the radiative luminosity but instead drives mass ejection, or that escape of energy from the remnant is significantly delayed. Future work should investigate the structure of remnants predicted by deflagration models and the potential roles of winds and delayed energy escape, as well as extend radiative transfer simulations to late times.</description>

      <title>Does the Redshift Distribution of Swift Long GRBs Trace the Star-Formation Rate?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are extremely powerful explosions that have been traditionally classified into two categories: long bursts (LGRBs) with an observed duration T90 &gt; 2 s, and short bursts (SGRBs) with an observed duration T90 &lt; 2 s, where T90 is the time interval during which 90% of the fluence is detected. LGRBs are believed to emanate from the core-collapse of massive stars, while SGRBs are believed to result from the merging of two compact objects, like two neutron stars. Because LGRBs are produced by the violent death of massive stars, we expect that their redshift distribution should trace the star-formation rate (SFR). The purpose of our study is to investigate the extent to which the redshift distribution of LGRBs follows and reflects the SFR. We use a sample of 370 LGRBs taken from the Swift catalog, and we investigate different models for the LGRB redshift distribution. We also carry out Monte Carlo simulations to check the consistency of our results. Our results indicate that the SFR can describe the LGRB redshift distribution well for high redshift bursts, but it needs an evolution term to fit the distribution well at low redshift.</description>

      <title>The cause of the difference in the propagation distances between compact and transient jets in black-hole X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accreting black-hole binaries change their properties during evolution, passing through two main luminous states, dominated by either hard or soft X-rays. In the hard state, steady compact jets emitting multiwavelength radiation are present. Those jets are usually observed in radio, and when resolved, their extent is $\lesssim\!10^{15}$ cm. Then, during hard-to-soft transitions, powerful ejecta in the form of blobs appear. They are observed up to distances of $\sim\!10^{18}$ cm, which are $\gtrsim$1000 times larger than the extent of hard-state jets. On the other hand, estimates of the accretion rates during most luminous hard states and the hard-to-soft transitions are very similar, implying that maximum achievable powers of both types of jets are similar and cannot cause the huge difference in their propagation. Instead, we explain the difference in the propagation length by postulating that the ejecta consist of electron-ion plasmas, whereas the hard-state jets consist mostly of electron-positron pairs. The inertia of the ejecta are then much higher than those of compact jets, and the former are not readily stopped by ambient media. A related result is that the accretion flow during the hard state is of Standard and Normal Evolution (SANE), while it is a Magnetically Arrested Disk (MAD) during transient ejections. The pairs in hard-state jets can be produced by collisions of photons of the hard spectrum emitted by hot accretion flows within the jet base. On the other hand, the X-ray spectra during the state transitions are relatively soft and the same process produces much fewer pairs.</description>

      <title>X-ray emission spectrum for axion-photon conversion in magnetospheres of strongly magnetized neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting axionic dark matter (DM) could be possible in an X-ray spectrum from strongly magnetized neutron stars (NSs). We examine the possibility of axion-photon conversion in the magnetospheres of strongly magnetized NSs. In the current work, we investigate how the modified Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff (TOV) system of equations (in the presence of a magnetic field) affects the energy spectrum of axions and axions-converted photon flux. We have considered the distance-dependent magnetic field in the modified TOV equations. We employ three different equations of states (EoSs) to solve these equations. We obtain the axions emission rate by including the Cooper-pair-breaking formation process (PBF) and Bremsstrahlung process in the core of NSs using the NSCool code. We primarily focus on three NSs: PSR B0531+21, PSR J0538+2817, and one Magnificient seven (M7) star RXJ 1856.5-3754. We further investigate the impact of the magnetic field on the actual observables, such as axion`s energy spectrum and axion-photon flux. We also compare our calculated axion-photon flux from all available archival data from PN+MOS+Chandra. Our predicted axion-photon flux values as a function of axion`s energy closely follow the experimentally archival data, which allows us to put bounds on the axion`s mass for the three different EoS.13</description>

      <title>Simulation of radio signals from cosmic-ray cascades in air and ice as observed by in-ice Askaryan radio detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new generation of neutrino observatories, including RNO-G and RET, will search for PeV-EeV neutrinos interacting in the ice by detecting radio pulses. Extended air showers propagating into the ice will form an important background and could be a valuable calibration signal. We present results from a Monte-Carlo simulation framework developed to fully simulate radio emission from cosmic-ray particle cascades as observed by in-ice radio detectors in the polar regions. The framework involves a modified version of CoREAS (a module of CORSIKA 7) to simulate in-air radio emission and a GEANT4-based framework for simulating in-ice radio emission from cosmic-ray showers as observed by in-ice antennas. The particles that reach the surface of the polar ice sheet at the end of the CORSIKA 7 simulation are injected into the GEANT4-based shower simulation code that takes the particles and propagates them further into the ice sheet, using an exponential density profile for the ice. The framework takes into account curved ray paths caused by the exponential refractive index profiles of air and ice. We present the framework and discuss some key features of the radio signal and radio shower footprint for in-ice observers.</description>

      <title>A Classifier-Based Approach to Multi-Class Anomaly Detection for Astronomical Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automating real-time anomaly detection is essential for identifying rare transients in the era of large-scale astronomical surveys. Modern survey telescopes are generating tens of thousands of alerts per night, and future telescopes, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, are projected to increase this number dramatically. Currently, most anomaly detection algorithms for astronomical transients rely either on hand-crafted features extracted from light curves or on features generated through unsupervised representation learning, which are then coupled with standard machine learning anomaly detection algorithms. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach to detecting anomalies: using the penultimate layer of a neural network classifier as the latent space for anomaly detection. We then propose a novel method, named Multi-Class Isolation Forests (MCIF), which trains separate isolation forests for each class to derive an anomaly score for a light curve from the latent space representation given by the classifier. This approach significantly outperforms a standard isolation forest. We also use a simpler input method for real-time transient classifiers which circumvents the need for interpolation in light curves and helps the neural network model inter-passband relationships and handle irregular sampling. Our anomaly detection pipeline identifies rare classes including kilonovae, pair-instability supernovae, and intermediate luminosity transients shortly after trigger on simulated Zwicky Transient Facility light curves. Using a sample of our simulations that matched the population of anomalies expected in nature (54 anomalies and 12,040 common transients), our method was able to discover $41\pm3$ anomalies (~75% recall) after following up the top 2000 (~15%) ranked transients. Our novel method shows that classifiers can be effectively repurposed for real-time anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>A candidate supermassive black hole in a gravitationally-lensed galaxy at $z\approx10$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While supermassive black holes (BHs) are widely observed in the nearby and distant universe, their origin remains debated with two viable formation scenarios with light and heavy seeds. In the light seeding model, the first BHs form from the collapse of massive stars with masses of $10-100 \ \rm{M_{\odot}}$, while the heavy seeding model posits the formation of $10^{4-5} \ \rm{M_{\odot}}$ seeds from direct collapse. The detection of BHs at redshifts $z\gtrsim10$, edging closer to their formation epoch, provides critical observational discrimination between these scenarios. Here, we focus on the JWST-detected galaxy, GHZ 9, at $z\approx10$ that is lensed by the foreground cluster, Abell 2744. Based on 2.1 Ms deep Chandra observations, we detect a candidate X-ray AGN, which is spatially coincident with the high-redshift galaxy, GHZ 9. The BH candidate is inferred to have a bolometric luminosity of $(1.0^{+0.5}_{-0.4})\times10^{46} \ \rm{erg \ s^{-1}}$, which corresponds to a BH mass of $(8.0^{+3.7}_{-3.2})\times10^7 \ \rm{M_{\odot}}$ assuming Eddington-limited accretion. This extreme mass at such an early cosmic epoch suggests the heavy seed origin for this BH candidate. Based on the Chandra and JWST discoveries of extremely high-redshift quasars, we have constructed the first simple AGN luminosity function extending to $z\approx10$. Comparison of this luminosity function with theoretical models indicates an over-abundant $z\approx10$ BH population, consistent with a higher-than-expected seed formation efficiency.</description>

      <title>The Flavor Composition of Supernova Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that standard matter effects in the outer layers of core-collapse supernovae significantly constrain the flavor composition of the neutrino flux, even with the enormous uncertainties originating from self-induced flavor conversions in the supernova core. Under certain conditions, the neutrino flux resulting from self-induced conversions can be represented as a combination of flavor eigenstates in an arbitrary flavor ratio configuration. In this scenario, we find that, for the normal mass ordering, the fraction of neutrinos with electron flavor reaching the Earth, denoted as $f_{\nu_e}$, is constrained to be less than $0.5$ for all energies throughout the emission phase, whereas, for inverted mass ordering, we anticipate neutrinos arriving in near flavor equipartition ($f_{\nu_e}\approx 1/3$). In case adiabaticity is violated in the region of standard matter effects, the result is flavor equipartition for both mass orderings. Subsequently, we elaborate on the impact of wave-packet decoherence during self-induced conversions and explore alternative scenarios that could affect the aforementioned results.</description>

      <title>Strong Coupling of Hydrodynamics and Reactions in Nuclear Statistical Equilibrium for Modeling Convection in Massive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build on the simplified spectral deferred corrections (SDC) coupling of hydrodynamics and reactions to handle the case of nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE) and electron/positron captures/decays in the cores of massive stars. Our approach blends a traditional reaction network on the grid with a tabulated NSE state from a very large, $\mathcal{O}(100)$ nuclei, network. We demonstrate how to achieve second-order accuracy in the simplified-SDC framework when coupling NSE to hydrodynamics, with the ability to evolve the star on the hydrodynamics timestep. We discuss the application of this method to convection in massive stars leading up to core-collapse. We also show how to initialize the initial convective state from a 1D model in a self-consistent fashion. All of these developments are done in the publicly available Castro simulation code and the entire simulation methodology is fully GPU accelerated.</description>

Abstract: We investigated the X-ray emission of HD 149404, a 9.81-day period O-star binary in a post-Roche lobe overflow evolutionary stage. X-ray emission of O-star binaries consists of the intrinsic emission of the individual O stars and a putative additional component arising from the wind-wind interaction. Phase-locked variations in the X-ray spectra can be used to probe the properties of the stellar winds of such systems. XMM-Newton observations of HD 149404 collected at two conjunction phases and a quadrature phase were analysed. X-ray spectra were extracted and flux variations as a function of orbital phase were inferred. The flux ratios were analysed with models considering various origins for the X-ray emission. The highest and lowest X-ray fluxes are observed at conjunction phases respectively with the primary and secondary star in front. The flux variations are nearly grey with only marginal energy dependence. None of the models accounting for photoelectric absorption by homogeneous stellar winds perfectly reproduces the observed variations. Whilst the overall X-ray luminosity is consistent with a pure intrinsic emission, the best formal agreement with the observed variations is obtained with a model assuming pure wind-wind collision X-ray emission. The lack of significant energy-dependence of the opacity most likely hints at the presence of optically thick clumps in the winds of HD 149404.</description>

      <title>Magnetically arrested disks in FR I radio galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A sample of 17 FR I radio galaxies constructed from the 3CR catalog, which is characterized by edge-darkened radio structures, is studied. The optical core luminosities derived from Hubble Space Telescope observation are used to estimate the Eddington ratios which are found to be below $10^{-3.4}$ for this sample. This is supported by the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich optical diagnostic diagrams derived with the spectroscopic observation of Telescopio Nazionale Galileo, suggesting that these sources are of low ionization nuclear Emission-line Regions (LINERs). It implies that the accretion in these FR I sources can be modeled as advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs). Given the low accretion rate, the predicted jet power with a fast-spinning black hole (BH) $a=0.95$ in the Blandford-Znajek mechanics is lower than the estimated one for almost all the sources in our sample. Such powerful jets indicate the presence of magnetically arrested disks (MAD) in the inner region of the ADAF, in the sense that the magnetic fields in the inner accretion zone are strong. Moreover, we show that, even in the MAD scenario, the BH spins in the sample are most likely moderate and/or fast with $a\gtrsim0.5$.</description>

      <title>Global Analysis of LISA Data with Galactic Binaries and Massive Black Hole Binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a planned space-based observatory to measure gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency band. This frequency band is expected to be dominated by signals from millions of Galactic binaries and tens of merging massive black hole binaries. The LISA Data Challenge 2a is focused on the robust signal extraction from a blend of these two types of gravitational wave signals. Here, we introduce a novel high performance and cost-effective global fit pipeline extracting and characterizing galactic binary and massive black hole binary signals and estimate the noise of the residual. We preform the pipeline in a time-evolving weekly analysis starting with and observation time of 1 week until we reach a full year. As expected we detect more galactic binaries and massive black hole binaries bringing the noise estimate of the residual closer to the instrument noise by each week of additional observation time. Furthermore, we present a novel maximum likelihood estimate-based algorithm for extracting multiple massive black hole binaries. Additionally we demonstrate a massive black hole binary signal extraction with a more accurate LISA response, considering higher harmonic modes, in a noisy data set.</description>

      <title>Constraining a relativistic mean field model using neutron star mass-radius measurements I: Nucleonic models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurements of neutron star mass and radius or tidal deformability deliver unique insight into the equation of state (EOS) of cold dense matter. EOS inference is very often done using generalized parametric or non-parametric models which deliver no information on composition. In this paper we consider a microscopic nuclear EOS model based on a field theoretical approach. We show that current measurements from NICER and gravitational wave observations constrain primarily the symmetric nuclear matter EOS. We then explore what could be delivered by measurements of mass and radius at the level anticipated for future large-area X-ray timing telescopes. These should be able to place very strong limits on the symmetric nuclear matter EOS, in addition to constraining the nuclear symmetry energy that determines the proton fraction inside the neutron star.</description>

      <title>Limits on dark matter annihilation in prompt cusps from the isotropic gamma-ray background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies indicate that thermally produced dark matter will form highly concentrated, low-mass cusps in the early universe that often survive until the present. While these cusps contain a small fraction of the dark matter, their high density significantly increases the expected gamma-ray flux from dark matter annihilation, particularly in searches of large angular regions. We utilize 14 years of Fermi-LAT data to set strong constraints on dark matter annihilation through a detailed study of the isotropic gamma-ray background, excluding with 95% confidence dark matter annihilation to $b\bar{b}$ final states for dark matter masses below 120 GeV.</description>

      <title>Testing strengths, limitations and biases of current Pulsar Timing Arrays detection analyses on realistic data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13117v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the-art searches for gravitational waves (GWs) in pulsar timing array (PTA) datasets model the signal as an isotropic, Gaussian and stationary process described by a power-law. In practice, none of these properties are expected to hold for an incoherent superposition of GWs generated by a cosmic ensemble of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), which is expected to be the primary signal in the PTA band. We perform a systematic investigation of the performance of current search algorithms, using a simple power law model to characterize GW signals in realistic datasets. We use, as the baseline dataset, synthetic realisations of timing residuals mimicking the European PTA (EPTA) second data release (DR2). Thus, we include in the dataset uneven time stamps, achromatic and chromatic red noise and multi-frequency observations. We then inject timing residuals from an ideal isotropic, Gaussian, single power-law stochastic process and from a realistic population of SMBHBs, performing a methodical investigation of the recovered signal. We find that current search models are efficient at recovering the GW signal, but several biases can be identified due to the signal-template mismatch, which we identify via probability-probability (P-P) plots and quantify using Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistics. We discuss our findings in light of the signal observed in the EPTA DR2 and corroborate its consistency with an SMBHB origin.</description>

      <title>Formation of Lower Mass-gap Black Hole--Neutron Star Binary Mergers through Super-Eddington Stable Mass Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Super-Eddington accretion of neutron stars (NSs) has been suggested both observationally and theoretically. In this paper, we propose that NSs in close-orbit binary systems with companions of helium (He) stars, most of which systems form after the common-envelope phase, could experience super-Eddington stable Case BB/BC mass transfer (MT), and can sometimes occur accretion-induced collapses (AICs) to form lower mass-gap black holes (mgBHs). Our detailed binary evolution simulations reveal that AIC events tend to happen if the primaries NS have an initial mass $\gtrsim1.7\,M_\odot$ with an accretion rate of $\gtrsim300$ times the Eddington limit. These mgBHs would have a mass nearly equal to or slightly higher than the NS maximum mass. The remnant mgBH--NS binaries after the core collapses of He stars are potential progenitors of gravitational-wave (GW) source. Multimessenger observation between GW and kilonova signals from a population of high-mass binary NS and mgBH--NS mergers formed through super-Eddington stable MT are helpful in constraining the maximum mass and equation of state of NSs. S230529ay, a mgBH--NS merger candidate recently detected in the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, could possibly originate from this formation scenario.</description>

      <title>Awakening of A Blazar at Redshift 2.7 Temporally Coincident with Arrival of Cospatial Neutrino Event IceCube-201221A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on multiwavelength studies of a blazar NVSS J171822+423948, which is identified as the low-energy counterpart of 4FGL J1718.5+4237, the unique $\gamma$-ray source known to be cospatial with the IceCube neutrino event IC-201221A. After a 12-year long quiescent period undetected by Fermi-LAT, $\gamma$-ray activities with a tenfold flux increase emerge soon (a few tens of days) after arrival of the neutrino. Associated optical flares in the ZTF $g$, $r$, and $i$ bands are observed together with elevated WISE infrared fluxes. Synchronized variations suggest that both the $\gamma$-ray emission and the neutrino event are connected to the blazar. Furthermore, the optical spectrum reveals emission lines at a redshift $z$ = 2.68 $\pm$ 0.01. Thus, it is the first candidate for a neutrino-emitting blazar at the redshift above 2. Discussions of theoretical constraints of neutrino production and comparisons with other candidates are presented.</description>

      <title>Comparing jet-shaped point symmetry in cluster cooling flows and supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08544v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I point out similarities between point-symmetric X-ray morphologies in cooling flow groups and clusters of galaxies, which are observed to be shaped by jets, and point-symmetric morphologies of eight core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnants. I use these similarities to strengthen the jittering jet explosion mechanism (JJEM) of CCSNe, which predicts that the last pairs of jets to be launched by the newly born neutron star might shape some CCSN remnants to point-symmetric morphology. The point-symmetric morphologies in both types of objects are composed of two or more pairs of opposite bubbles (cavities), nozzles, some clumps, small protrusions (termed ears), and rims. The typically large volume of a CCSN remnant shaped by jets implies that the shaping jets carry an energy comparable to that of the ejecta, which in turn implies that jets exploded the remnant's massive star progenitor. The morphological similarities studied here add to the similarity of CCSN remnants, not only point-symmetric ones, to planetary nebulae shaped by jets. Together, these similarities solidify the JJEM as the main explosion mechanism of CCSNe. I consider the identification of point-symmetry in CCSNe, as expected by jet-shaping in the JJEM, to be the most severe challenge to the competing neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. I reiterate my earlier claim, but in a more vocal voice, that the main explosion mechanism of CCSNe is the JJEM.</description>

      <title>Listening to the Universe with Next Generation Ground-Based Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.11048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we use simple performance metrics to assess the science capabilities of future ground-based gravitational-wave detector networks -- composed of A+ or Voyager upgrades to the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA observatories and proposed next generation observatories such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope. These metrics refer to coalescences of binary neutron stars (BNSs) and binary black holes (BBHs) and include: (i) network detection efficiency and detection rate of cosmological sources as a function of redshift, (ii) signal-to-noise ratios and the accuracy with which intrinsic and extrinsic parameters would be measured, and (iii) enabling multimessenger astronomy with gravitational waves by accurate 3D localization and early warning alerts. We further discuss the science enabled by the small population of rare and extremely loud events. While imminent upgrades will provide impressive advances in all these metrics, next generation observatories will deliver an improvement of an order-of-magnitude or more in most metrics. In fact, a network containing two or three such facilities will detect half of all the BNS and BBH mergers up to a redshift of $z=1$ and $z=20$, respectively, give access to hundreds of BNSs and ten thousand BBHs with signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 100, readily localize hundreds to thousands of mergers to within $1\,{\rm deg^2}$ on the sky and better than 10% in luminosity distance, respectively, and consequently, enable mutlimessenger astronomy through follow-up surveys in the electromagnetic spectrum several times a week. Such networks will further shed light on potential cosmological merger populations and detect an abundance of high-fidelity BNS and BBH signals which will allow investigations of the high-density regime of matter at an unprecedented level and enable precision tests of general relativity in the strong-filed regime, respectively.</description>

      <title>Supercooling in Radiative Symmetry Breaking: Theory Extensions, Gravitational Wave Detection and Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions, which take place when the symmetries are predominantly broken (and masses are then generated) through radiative corrections, produce observable gravitational waves and primordial black holes. We provide a model-independent approach that is valid for large-enough supercooling to quantitatively describe these phenomena in terms of few parameters, which are computable once the model is specified. The validity of a previously-proposed approach of this sort is extended here to a larger class of theories. Among other things, we identify regions of the parameter space that correspond to the background of gravitational waves recently detected by pulsar timing arrays (NANOGrav, CPTA, EPTA, PPTA) and others that are either excluded by the observing runs of LIGO and Virgo or within the reach of future gravitational wave detectors. Furthermore, we find regions of the parameter space where primordial black holes produced by large over-densities due to such phase transitions can account for dark matter. Finally, it is shown how this model-independent approach can be applied to specific cases, including a phenomenological completion of the Standard Model with right-handed neutrinos and gauged $B-L$ undergoing radiative symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Probing nontensorial gravitational waves with a next-generation ground-based detector network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In General Relativity, there are only two polarizations for gravitational waves. However, up to six polarizations are possible in a generic metric theory of gravity. Therefore, measuring the polarization content of gravitational waves provides an efficient way to test theories of gravity. We analyze the sensitivity of a next-generation ground-based detector network to nontensorial polarizations. We present our method to localize GW signals in the time-frequency domain and construct the model-independent null stream for events with known sky locations. We obtain results based on simulations of binary neutron star mergers in a six-detector network. For a single event at a luminosity distance $D_L=100 \, {\rm Mpc}$, at $5\sigma$ confidence, the smallest amplitude for detection of scalar and vector modes relative to tensor modes are respectively $A_{s}=0.045 $ and $A_{v}=0.014 $. For multiple events in an averaged observing run of 10 years, the detection limits at $5\sigma$ confidence are $A_s=0.05$ and $A_v=0.02$. If we are fortunate, a few strong events might significantly improve the limits.</description>

      <title>High mass function ellipsoidal variables in the Gaia Focused Product Release: searching for black hole candidates in the binary zoo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent Gaia Focused Product Release contains radial velocity time-series for more than 9,000 Gaia long-period photometric variables. Here we search for binary systems with large radial velocity amplitudes to identify candidates with massive, unseen companions. Eight targets have binary mass function $f(M)&gt;1\ M_\odot$, three of which are eclipsing binaries. The remaining five show evidence of ellipsoidal modulations. We fit spectroscopic orbit models to the Gaia radial velocities, and fit the spectral energy distributions of three targets. For the two systems most likely to host dark companions, J0946 and J1640, we use PHOEBE to fit the ASAS-SN light curves and Gaia radial velocities. The derived companion masses are $&gt;3 M_\odot$, but the high Galactic dust extinctions towards these objects limit our ability to rule out main sequence companions or subgiants hotter than the photometric primaries. These systems are similar to other stellar-mass black hole impostors, notably the Unicorn (V723 Mon) and the Giraffe (2M04123153$+$6738486). While it is possible that J1640 and J0946 are similar examples of stripped giant star binaries, high-resolution spectra can be used to determine the nature of their companions.</description>
