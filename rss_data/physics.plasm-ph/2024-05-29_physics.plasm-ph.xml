      <title>Green Synthesis of Ammonium Nitrate (NH$_4$NO$_3$) Fertilizer Production: via Plasma Water Ice Interaction with Air and NH$_3$ Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel and ecofriendly method for synthesizing ammonium nitrate using activated prepared through air and ammonia plasma treatments. Initially, PAW containing nitrate ions is produced by treating water with air plasma. This PAW air is then frozen and exposed to low pressure NH$_3$ plasma, introducing ammonium ions to from NH$_4$NO$_3$. We systematically investigate the voltage current characteristics of the air and NH$_3$ plasma, analyze the generated species and radicals to understand the mechanism of NH$_4$NO$_3$ formation, and evaluate the effects of process parameters such as NH$_3$ gas pressure, applied voltage, and treatment time on the properties of PAW. Our results indicate that all examined process parameters positively influence the properties of PAW. Among these parameters, the duration of NH$_3$ plasma treatment of PAW ice exerts the most significant effect. Specifically, the concentration of NH4 ions increased by 134.2 percent when the NH$_3$ treatment time was extended from 0.5 h to 1 h, compared to 12.7 and 33.3 percent increases for NH$_3$ pressure, ranging from 0.25 to 0.55 mbar, and applied voltage, ranging from 500 to 700 V, respectively. Similarly, variations in pH, oxidation reduction potential, and electrical conductivity were substantially higher with increased treatment time than with changes in gas pressure and applied voltage. The PAW exhibited a neutral to slightly basic pH, making it ideal for soil applications, thereby addressing the existing issue of the high acidity of PAW and its use in agriculture.</description>

      <title>Going Beyond the MHD Approximation: Physics-Based Numerical Solution of the CGL Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new numerical model for solving the Chew-Goldberger-Low system of equations describing a bi-Maxwellian plasma in a magnetic field. Heliospheric and geospace environments are often observed to be in an anisotropic state with distinctly different parallel and perpendicular pressure components. The CGL system represents the simplest leading order correction to the common isotropic MHD model that still allows to incorporate the latter's most desirable features. However, the CGL system presents several numerical challenges: the system is not in conservation form, the source terms are stiff, and unlike MHD it is prone to a loss of hyperbolicity if the parallel and perpendicular pressures become too different. The usual cure is to bring the parallel and perpendicular pressures closer to one another; but that has usually been done in an ad hoc manner. We present a physics-informed method of pressure relaxation based on the idea of pitch-angle scattering that keeps the numerical system hyperbolic and naturally leads to zero anisotropy in the limit of very large plasma beta. Numerical codes based on the CGL equations can, therefore, be made to function robustly for any magnetic field strength, including the limit where the magnetic field approaches zero. The capabilities of our new algorithm are demonstrated using several stringent test problems that provide a comparison of the CGL equations in the weakly and strongly collisional limits. This includes a test problem that mimics interaction of a shock with a magnetospheric environment in 2D.</description>

      <title>Isotope effects and Alfven eigenmode stability in JET H, D, T, DT, and He plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While much about Alfven eigenmode (AE) stability has been explored in previous and current tokamaks, open questions remain for future burning plasma experiments, especially regarding exact stability threshold conditions and related isotope effects; the latter, of course, requiring good knowledge of the plasma ion composition. In the JET tokamak, eight in-vessel antennas actively excite stable AEs, from which their frequencies, toroidal mode numbers, and net damping rates are assessed. The effective ion mass can also be inferred using measurements of the plasma density and magnetic geometry. Thousands of AE stability measurements have been collected by the Alfven Eigenmode Active Diagnostic in hundreds of JET plasmas during the recent Hydrogen, Deuterium, Tritium, DT, and Helium-4 campaigns. In this novel AE stability database, spanning all four main ion species, damping is observed to decrease with increasing Hydrogenic mass, but increase for Helium, a trend consistent with radiative damping as the dominant damping mechanism. These data are important for confident predictions of AE stability in both non-nuclear (H/He) and nuclear (D/T) operations in future devices. In particular, if radiative damping plays a significant role in overall stability, some AEs could be more easily destabilized in D/T plasmas than their H/He reference pulses, even before considering fast ion and alpha particle drive. Active MHD spectroscopy is also employed on select HD, HT, and DT plasmas to infer the effective ion mass, thereby closing the loop on isotope analysis and demonstrating a complementary method to typical diagnosis of the isotope ratio.</description>

      <title>Effect of insulator end cap thickness on time-dependent Hartmann flow in a rotating mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for analyzing plasma flow in a rotating mirror. By making a series of physical assumptions, we reduce the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations in a three-dimensional cylindrical system to a one-dimensional system in a shallow, cuboidal channel within a transverse magnetic field, similar to the Hartmann flow in the ducts. We then solve the system both numerically and analytically for a range of values of the Hartmann number and calculate the dependence of the plasma flow speed on the thickness of the insulating end cap. We observe that the mean flow overshoots and decelerates before achieving a steady-state value, a phenomenon that the analytical model cannot capture. This overshoot is directly proportional to the thickness of the insulating end cap and the external electric field, with a weak dependence on the external magnetic field. Our simplified model can act as a benchmark for future simulations of the supersonic mirror device Compact Magnetic Fusion Experiment (CMFX), which will employ more sophisticated physics and realistic magnetic field geometries.</description>

      <title>Advances in laser-plasma interactions using intense vortex laser beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-intensity light beams carrying Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM), commonly known as vortex beams, have garnered significant attention due to promising applications in areas ranging from optical trapping to communication. In recent years, there has been a surge in global research exploring the potential of high-intensity vortex laser beams and specifically their interactions with plasmas. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in this area. Compared to conventional laser beams, intense vortex beams exhibit unique properties such as twisted phase fronts, OAM delivery, hollow intensity distribution, and spatially isolated longitudinal fields. These distinct characteristics give rise to a multitude of rich phenomena, profoundly influencing laser-plasma interactions and offering diverse applications. The paper also discusses future prospects and identifies promising general research areas involving vortex beams. These areas include low-divergence particle acceleration, instability suppression, high-energy photon delivery with OAM, and the generation of strong magnetic fields. With growing scientific interest and application potential, the study of intense vortex lasers is poised for rapid development in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Bulk viscosity of the rigid rotor one-component plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bulk viscosity of a plasma consisting of strongly coupled diatomic ions is computed using molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations are based on the rigid rotor one-component plasma, which is introduced as a model system that adds two degrees of molecular rotation to the traditional one-component plasma. It is characterized by two parameters: the Coulomb coupling parameter, $\Gamma$, and the bond length parameter, $\Omega$. Results show that the long-range nature of the Coulomb potential can lead to long rotational relaxation times, which in turn yield large values for bulk viscosity. The bulk-to-shear viscosity ratio is found to span from small to large values depending on the values of $\Gamma$ and $\Omega$. Although bulk viscosity is often neglected in plasma modeling, these results motivate that it can be large in molecular plasmas with rotational degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Conceptual Design of a Doppler Spectrometer for 10$^2$ m/s Cross-Field Flows in Tokamak Divertors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been theoretically predicted that the \ExB drift caused by the spontaneously generated potential in scrape-off-layers (SOLs) and divertors in tokamaks is of a similar size to the poloidal component of the parallel flow and turbulent flow, thereby it significantly impacts on the plasma transport there. Many experiments indeed have implied the role of the electric potential, however, its direct observation through its \ExB flow measurement has never been realized because the drift velocity ($10^2$--$10^3$ m/s) is significantly below the detection limit of existing diagnostics. To realize a cross-field ion flow measurement, variety of systematic uncertainties of the system must be narrowed down. Here, we develop a conceptual design of the Doppler spectrometry that enables to measure the impurity flows with $10^2$-m/s accuracy, based on an in-situ wavelength-calibration techniques developed in astrophysics field, the iodine-cell method. We discuss its properties and applicability. In particular, the scaling relation of the wavelength accuracy and various spectroscopic parameters is newly presented, which suggests the high importance of the wavelength resolution of the system. Based on transport simulations for the JT-60SA divertor, the feasibility of the system is assessed.</description>

      <title>Gyrokinetic Field Theory as a Gauge Transform or: gyrokinetic theory without Lie transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06265</link>
      <description>arXiv:1708.06265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gyrokinetic theory is a basis for treating magnetised plasma dynamics slower than particle gyrofrequencies where the scale of the background is larger than relevant gyroradii. The energy of field perturbations can be comparable to the thermal energy but smaller than the energy of the background magnetic field. Properly applied, it is a low-frequency gauge transform rather than a treatment of particle orbits, and more a representation in terms of gyrocenters rather than particles than an approximation. By making all transformations and approximations in the field/particle Lagrangian one preserves exact energetic consistency so that time symmetry ensures energy conservation and spatial axisymmetry ensures toroidal angular momentum conservation. This method draws on earlier experience with drift-kinetic models while showing the independence of gyrokinetic representation from particularities of Lie transforms or specific ordering limits, and that the essentials of low-frequency magnetohydrodynamics, including the equilibrium, are recovered. It gives a useful basis for total-f electromagnetic gyrokinetic or gyrofluid computation. Various versions of the representation based upon choice of parallel velocity space coordinate are illustrated.</description>

      <title>Massive, Long-Lived Electrostatic Potentials in a Rotating Mirror Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hot plasma is highly conductive in the direction parallel to a magnetic field. This often means that the electrical potential will be nearly constant along any given field line. When this is the case, the cross-field voltage drops in open-field-line magnetic confinement devices are limited by the tolerances of the solid materials wherever the field lines impinge on the plasma-facing components. To circumvent this voltage limitation, it is proposed to arrange large voltage drops in the interior of a device, but coexisting with much smaller drops on the boundaries. To avoid prohibitively large dissipation requires both preventing substantial drift-flow shear within flux surfaces and preventing large parallel electric fields from driving large parallel currents. It is demonstrated here that both requirements can be met simultaneously, which opens up the possibility for magnetized plasma tolerating steady-state voltage drops far larger than what might be tolerated in material media.</description>

      <title>Direct laser acceleration: A model for the electron injection from the walls of a cylindrical guiding structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use analytical methods and particle-in-cell simulation to investigate the origin of electrons accelerated by the process of direct laser acceleration driven by high-power laser pulses in preformed narrow cylindrical plasma channels. The simulation shows that the majority of accelerated electrons are originally located along the interface between the channel wall and the channel interior. The analytical model based on the electron hydrodynamics illustrates the underlying physical mechanism of the release of electrons from the channel wall when irradiated by an intense laser, the subsequent electron dynamics, and the corresponding evolution of the channel density profile. The quantitative predictions of the total charge of released electrons and the average electron density inside the channel are validated by comparison with the simulation results.</description>

      <title>Driver at 10 MJ and 1 shot/30min for inertial confinement fusion at high gain: efficient, compact, low-cost, low laser-plasma instabilities, beam-color selectable from 2 omega/3 omega/4 omega, applicable to multiple laser fusion schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09912v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ignition at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) set off a global wave of research on the inertial fusion energy (IFE). However, IFE requires a necessary target gain G of 30-100, while it is hard to achieve the fusions at such high gain with the energy, configuration, and technical route of the NIF. We will present a conceptual design for the next generation laser driver of 10 MJ, 2~3 PW at the laser wavelength of 0.353 micrometer (or 0.353 micrometer, then the energy and power can be higher), and 1 shot per 30 minutes, which is efficient, compact, low-cost, low laser-plasma instabilities, applicable to multiple laser fusion schemes, and aiming for G &gt; 30.</description>
