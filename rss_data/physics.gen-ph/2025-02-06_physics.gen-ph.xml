      <title>A Mechanistic Study on Environment Gases in Metal Additive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variety of protective or reactive environmental gases have recently gained growing attention in laser-based metal additive manufacturing (AM) technologies due to their unique thermophysical properties and the potential improvements they can bring to the build processes. However, much remains unclear regarding the effects of different gas environments on critical phenomena in laser AM, such as rapid cooling, energy coupling, and defect generation. Through simultaneous high-speed synchrotron x-ray imaging and thermal imaging, we identify distinct effects of various environmental gases in laser AM and gained a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Compared to the commonly used protective gas, argon, it is found that helium has a negligible effect on cooling the part. However, helium can suppress unstable keyholes by decreasing effective energy absorption, thus mitigating keyhole porosity generation and reducing pore size under certain processing conditions. These observations provide guidelines for the strategic use of environmental gases in laser AM to produce parts with improved quality.</description>

      <title>Resolving inconsistencies in Relativistic Thermodynamics with four-entropy and four-heat current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10930v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address long-standing inconsistencies in relativistic thermodynamics, particularly the ambiguities in temperature transformations and entropy evolution in moving or accelerating frames. Traditional approaches often lead to spurious entropy dissipation or generation in accelerating frames, contradicting the second law of thermodynamics. By introducing four-entropy and four-heat current, we resolve the problematic terms related to Lorentz factor dependence, eliminating unphysical entropy production. We also show that transformations like $T^{\prime}=\frac{T}{\gamma}$ and $T^{\prime}=T \gamma$ introduce an additional unphysical source of entropy dissipation or generation without real heat flow, driven by temperature gradients from relative motion. By adopting the covariant transformation $T^{\prime}=T$ and treating heat and entropy as four-vectors, we resolve these inconsistencies and offer a coherent framework for relativistic thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>The machine learning platform for developers of large systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The machine learning system in the form of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has developed steadily since about 2021. RAG could be observed as a version of the knowledge transfer. In the studied case, the large computing systems are observed as the application point of RAG, which includes large language model (LLM), as a partner for the developing team. Such an approach has advantages during the development process and further in exploitation time.</description>
