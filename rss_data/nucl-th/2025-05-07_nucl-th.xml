      <title>Relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics for particles of arbitrary mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing a kinetic framework, we calculate all transport coefficients for relativistic dissipative (second-order) hydrodynamics for arbitrary particle masses in the 14-moment approximation. Taking the non-relativistic limit, it is shown that the relativistic theory reduces to the Grad equations computed in the 'order-of-magnitude' approach.</description>

      <title>Thermal properties of zero sound in asymmetric nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The zero-sound modes at finite temperature are investigated with the relativistic random phase approximation to signal the uncertainty of the equation of state (EOS) of asymmetric nuclear matter. It is observed that in typically selected stiff and soft relativistic mean-field (RMF) models, zero-sound modes arise at low temperature, whereas increasing the temperature gradually breaks the zero sound in soft models, with a smaller density range compared to stiff models. At high density, the presence or absence of zero sound turns out to be correspondingly the character of the stiff or soft RMF EOS. More strikingly, we find by analyzing the dispersion relation and sound velocity that at finite temperature the zero-sound modes in RMF models with the stiff EOS undergo a thermal bifurcation, resulting in the transform of zero sound into the first sound at some momentum $Q&gt;T$. The thermally bifurcated sound branch in the stiff models and the zero-sound branch in the soft models are both highly sensitive to the slope of the symmetry energy, providing promising signals for the pending high-density symmetry energies. In addition, it is found that there exists a nonlinear dispersion relation for both the stiff and soft models that supports the zero sound in the relatively lower density region.</description>

      <title>Allowed and unique first-forbidden stellar electron emission rates of neutron-rich copper isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The allowed charge-changing transitions are the most common weak interaction processes of spin-isospin form that play a crucial role in several nuclear/astrophysical processes. The first-forbidden (FF) transition becomes important, in the circumstances where allowed Gamow-Teller (GT) transitions are unfavored, specifically for neutron-rich nuclei due to phase space considerations. In this paper deformed proton-neutron quasi-particle random phase approximation (pn-QRPA) model is applied, for the first time, for the estimation of allowed GT and unique first-forbidden (U1F) transitions ($|\Delta$J$|$ = 2) of neutron rich copper isotopes in mass range 72 $\leq$ A $\leq$ 82 under stellar conditions. We compared our computed terrestrial $\beta$-decay half-life values with previous calculations and experimental results. It was concluded that the pn-QRPA calculation is in good accordance with measured data. Our study suggests that the addition of rank (0 and 1) operators in FF transitions can further improve the comparison which remain unattended at this stage. The deformed pn-QRPA model was employed for the estimation of GT and U1F stellar electron emission ($\beta$$^{-}$-decay) rates over wide range of stellar temperature (0.01 GK -- 30 GK) and density (10 -- 10$^{11}$ g/cm$^{3}$) domains for astrophysical applications. Our study shows that, in high density and low temperature regions, the contribution of U1F rates to total electron emission rates of neutron-rich copper nuclei is negligible.</description>

      <title>Gamow-Teller strength and lepton captures rates on 66-71Ni in stellar matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge-changing transitions play a significant role in stellar weak-decay processes. The fate of the massive stars is decided by these weak-decay rates including lepton (positron and electron) captures rates, which play a consequential role in the dynamics of core collapse. As per previous simulation results, weak interaction rates on nickel isotopes have significant influence on the stellar core vis-$\grave{a}$-vis controlling the lepton content of stellar matter throughout the silicon shell burning phases of high mass stars up to the presupernova stages. In this paper we perform a microscopic calculation of Gamow-Teller charge-changing transitions, in the $\beta$-decay and electron capture directions, for neutron-rich nickel isotopes ($^{66-71}$Ni). We further compute the associated weak-decay rates for these selected nickel isotopes in stellar environment. The computations are accomplished by employing the deformed proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation (pn-QRPA) model. A recent study showed that the deformed pn-QRPA theory is well suited for the estimation of Gamow-Teller transitions. The astral weak-decay rates are determined over densities in the range of 10 -- 10$^{11}$g/cm$^{3}$ and temperatures in the range of 0.01$\times$10$^{9}$ -- 30$\times$10$^{9}$K. The calculated lepton capture rates are compared with the previous calculation of Pruet and Fuller. The overall comparison demonstrates that, at low stellar densities and high temperatures, our electron captures rates are bigger by as much as two orders of magnitude. Our results show that, at higher temperatures, the lepton capture rates are the dominant mode for the stellar weak rates and the corresponding lepton emission rates may be neglected.</description>

      <title>Nuclear structure and weak rates of heavy waiting point nuclei under rp-process conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure and the weak interaction mediated rates of the heavy waiting point (WP) nuclei $^{80}$Zr, $^{84}$Mo, $^{88}$Ru, $^{92}$Pd and $^{96}$Cd along $N = Z$ line were studied within the interacting boson model-1 (\mbox{IBM-1}) and the proton-neutron quasi-particle random phase approximation (\mbox{pn-QRPA}). The energy levels of the $N$ = $Z$ WP nuclei were calculated by fitting the essential parameters of \mbox{IBM-1} Hamiltonian and their geometric shapes were predicted by plotting potential energy surfaces (PESs). Half-lives, continuum electron capture rates, positron decay rates, electron capture cross sections of WP nuclei, energy rates of $\beta$-delayed protons and their emission probabilities were later calculated using the \mbox{pn-QRPA}. The calculated Gamow-Teller strength distributions were compared with previous calculation. We present positron decay $\&amp;$ continuum electron capture rates on these WP nuclei under $rp$-process conditions using the same model. For the $rp$-process conditions, the calculated total weak rates are twice the Skyrme HF+BCS+QRPA rates for $^{80}$Zr. For remaining nuclei the two calculations compare well. The electron capture rates are significant and compete well with the corresponding positron decay rates under $rp$-process conditions. The finding of the present study supports that electron capture rates form an integral part of the weak rates under $rp$-process conditions and has an important role for the nuclear model calculations.</description>

      <title>Shear viscosity and electrical conductivity of rotating quark matter in Nambu--Jona-Lasinio Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lagrangian for strongly interacting and rotating quark matter is modified with the inclusion of the spinorial connections, which in turn affect the thermodynamic equation of state and transport properties of the medium. In this work, we investigate the transport properties of quark matter under finite rotation, focusing specifically on electrical conductivity and shear viscosity by using a two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. The chiral condensate in the NJL model decreases under rotation, leading to enhanced transport properties. Moreover, rotation induces anisotropy in the transport coefficients, which are calculated within the kinetic theory framework using the Boltzmann transport equation. The Coriolis force is introduced in the force term of the Boltzmann transport equation, like the Lorentz force, which is considered for finite magnetic fields. By using a phenomenological temperature-dependent angular velocity, we observe that the variation of anisotropic components with temperature preserves the traditional valley-shaped pattern. However, the magnitude of the anisotropic components is suppressed compared to the usual component one finds in the absence of rotation. Interestingly, at zero net quark density, Hall-like transport phenomena emerge as significant non-dissipative contributions under rotation, which is not expected under finite magnetic fields due to the cancellation of quark and anti-quark Hall currents.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariance and color charge fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of confinement is connected with color charge. Unfortunately, the color charge densities in QCD, the Noether charge densities associated with the global color invariance, are not invariant under local color rotations. This implies that the expectation values of the net color charge in any region of any physical state in QCD, states that satisfy the color Gauss law, are automatically zero for all components of color. In this paper it is shown that the expectation value of the square of the net color charge in a region, a measure of the color charge fluctuations, is necessarily nonzero when evaluated in physical states and the result, while depending on the scheme and scale by which the theory is regulated, is gauge invariant. This holds despite the formal lack of gauge invariance of the operator. Moreover, there is a particular combination of the color charge fluctuations for the vacuum and for a system describable by a non-trivial density matrix that is independent that has a well-defined continuum limit</description>

      <title>Pole-Expansion of Two-Hadron Imaginary-Time Correlation Function -a new method of analysis for unstable states in lattice QCD-</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the pole expansion of the two-hadron imaginary-time correlation function. We first explain the general idea that the imaginary-time correlation function is expressed as a sum of the pole terms, the Mittag-Leffler expansion, in terms of the uniformization variable, which makes the S-matrix single-valued. We then derive explicit expressions of the pole expansion for the single-channel ($\rho$ meson) and two-channel ($\Lambda(1405)$) examples and demonstrate that the pole expansion actually holds employing phenomenological models, the vector-dominance model for the $\rho$ meson and the chiral unitary model for $\Lambda(1405)$. From this observation we propose the pole expansion as a method to extract information of unstable states such as masses and widths from the two-hadron imaginary-time correlation functions obtained by lattice QCD simulations.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer-Accelerated Ground-State Estimation of Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the stabilizer formalism, in particular highly-entangled stabilizer states, can be used to describe the emergence of many-body shape collectivity from individual constituents, in a symmetry-preserving and classically efficient way. The method that we adopt is based on determining an optimal separation of the Hamiltonian into a stabilizer component and a residual part inducing non-stabilizerness. The corresponding stabilizer ground state is efficiently prepared using techniques of graph states and stabilizer tableaux. We demonstrate this technique in context of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, a fully-connected spin system presenting a second order phase transition from spherical to deformed state. The resulting stabilizer ground state is found to capture to a large extent both bi-partite and collective multi-partite entanglement features of the exact solution in the region of large deformation. We also explore several methods for injecting non-stabilizerness into the system, including ADAPT-VQE, and imaginary-time evolution (ITE) techniques. Stabilizer ground states are found to accelerate ITE convergence due to a larger overlap with the exact ground state. This study motivates applications of the proposed approach to more realistic quantum many-body systems, whose stabilizer ground states can be used in combinations with powerful classical many-body techniques and/or quantum methods.</description>

      <title>A Continuous Galactic Line Source of Axions: The Remarkable Case of 23Na</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that $^{23}$Na is a potentially significant source of galactic axions. For temperatures $\gtrsim 7 \times 10^8$K -- characteristic of carbon burning in the massive progenitors of supernovae and ONeMg white dwarfs -- the 440 keV first excited state of $^{23}$Na is thermally populated, with its repeated decays pumping stellar energy into escaping axions. Odd-A nuclear abundances are typically very low in high-temperature stellar environments (or absent entirely due to burn-up). $^{23}$Na is an exception: $\approx 0.1 M_\odot$ of the isotope is synthesized during carbon burning then maintained at $\approx 10^9$K for times ranging up to $6 \times 10^4$y. Using MESA simulations, a galactic model, and sampling over progenitor masses, locations, and evolutionary stages, we find a continuous flux at earth of $\langle \phi_a \rangle \approx 22$/cm$^2$s for $g^\mathrm{eff}_{aNN} = 10^{-9}$. Some fraction of these axions convert to photons as they propagate through the galactic magnetic field, producing a distinctive 440 keV line $\gamma$ ray detectable by all-sky detectors like the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI). Assuming a 1$\mu$G galactic magnetic field and a sufficiently light axion mass, we find that COSI will be able to probe $| g_{aNN}^\mathrm{eff} g_{a \gamma \gamma} | \gtrsim1.8 \times 10^{-22}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at $3\sigma$ after two years of surveying.</description>

      <title>Study of octupole deformations in Pb-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we present the study of the role of octupole deformation in non-spherical nuclei in most-central Pb--Pb collisions at the LHC energy regime. The sensitivity of octupole deformation $\beta_3$ to the QGP observables is presented by employing the Monte Carlo HYDJET++ model. Motivated by the discrepancies in the $v_2$-to-$v_3$ puzzle found in Pb--Pb collisions and the low-energy nuclear structure calculations of nuclear deformation, we studied the first basic observables necessary for any study in heavy-ion collisions. Using the HYDJET++ framework, we calculate the pseudorapidity distribution, transverse momentum ($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) spectra, and average anisotropic flow ($v_2$ and $v_3$) of primary charged hadrons with different parameters in two geometrical configurations: body-body and tip-tip types of Pb--Pb collisions. The kinematic ranges $0 &lt; p_{\mathrm{T}} &lt; 20~\mathrm{GeV}/c$ and $|\eta| &lt; 0.8$ are considered. We observe that the charged hadron multiplicity and transverse momentum spectra are dependent on the strength of the octupole deformation parameter. The $\langle v_2 \rangle$ and $\langle v_3 \rangle$ in body-body collisions show a weak positive correlation with $\beta_3$, while the average anisotropic flow in tip-tip collisions is weakly correlated with $\beta_3$ in the most-central collision region.</description>

      <title>Digital quantum simulations of scattering in quantum field theories using W states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy particle collisions can convert energy into matter through the inelastic production of new particles. Quantum computers are an ideal platform for simulating the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the collision and the formation of the subsequent many-particle state. In this work, evidence for inelastic particle production is observed in one-dimensional Ising field theory using IBM's quantum computers. The scattering experiment is performed on 100 qubits of ibm_marrakesh and uses up to 6,412 two-qubit gates to access the post-collision dynamics. Integral to these simulations is a new quantum algorithm for preparing the initial state (wavepackets) of a quantum field theory scattering simulation. This method efficiently prepares wavepackets by extending recent protocols for creating W states with mid-circuit measurement and feedforward. The required circuit depth is independent of wavepacket size and spatial dimension, representing a superexponential improvement over previous methods. Our wavepacket preparation algorithm can be applied to a wide range of lattice models and is demonstrated in one-dimensional Ising field theory, scalar field theory, the Schwinger model, and two-dimensional Ising field theory.</description>

      <title>A Centrality-independent Framework for Revealing Genuine Higher-Order Cumulants in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel centrality definition-independent method for analyzing higher-order proton cumulants, specifically addressing the challenge of volume fluctuations that dominate in low-energy heavy-ion collisions. This method reconstructs particle number distributions using the Edgeworth expansion, with parameters optimized via a combination of differential evolution algorithm and Bayesian inference. Its effectiveness is validated using UrQMD model simulations and benchmarked against traditional approaches, including centrality definitions based on particle multiplicity. Our results show that the proposed framework yields cumulant patterns consistent with those obtained using number of participant nucleon ($N_{\text{part}}$) based centrality observables, while eliminating the conventional reliance on centrality determination. This consistency confirms the method's ability to extract genuine physical signals, thereby paving the way for probing the intrinsic thermodynamic properties of the produced medium through event-by-event fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Semi-inclusive direct photon+jet and $\pi^{0}$+jet correlations measured in $p+p$ and central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 200$ GeV</title>

Abstract: The STAR experiment at RHIC reports new measurements of jet quenching based on the semi-inclusive distribution of charged-particle jets recoiling from direct photon ($\gamma_{\rm dir}$) and neutral pion ($\pi^{0}$) triggers in pp and central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV, for triggers in the range $9&lt;E_{\rm T}^{\rm trig}&lt;20$ GeV. The datasets have integrated luminosities of 3.9$ {\rm nb}^{-1}$ for Au+Au and 23$ {\rm pb}^{-1}$ for pp collisions. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-$k_{\rm T}$ algorithm with resolution parameters $R$=0.2 and 0.5. The large uncorrelated jet background in central Au+Au collisions is corrected using a mixed-event approach, which enables precise charged-particle jet measurements at low transverse momentum $p_{\rm T,jet}^{\rm ch}$ and large $R$. Recoil-jet distributions are reported in the range $p_{\rm T,jet}^{\rm ch}&lt;25$ \gev. Comparison of the distributions measured in pp and Au+Au collisions reveals strong medium-induced jet yield suppression for $R=0.2$, with markedly less suppression for $R=0.5$. Comparison is also made to theoretical models incorporating jet quenching. These data provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying jet quenching and the angular dependence of medium-induced jet-energy transport, and provide new constraints on modelling such effects.</description>

      <title>First experimental test of the ratio method for nuclear-reaction analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear halos are very exotic quantal structures observed far from stability. Because of their short lifetime, they are mostly studied through reactions. The ratio method offers a new observable: the ratio of angular differential cross sections for breakup and scattering. It is predicted to be much more sensitive to the projectile structure than individual cross sections thanks to its independence of the reaction process. We test this new observable experimentally for the first time considering the collision of 11Be on C at 22.8 MeV/nucleon. We extend this analysis to similar data recently measured on Pb at 19.1 MeV/nucleon. Both analyses confirm the theoretical predictions, which opens the door to a new era in the study of nuclear structure near the neutron dripline. This should prove invaluable in conjunction with the start of FRIB. The ratio method could also be extended to other fields of quantum physics beyond nuclear reactions.</description>

      <title>Composite nature of the $T_{cc}$ state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2021, LHCb collaboration reported a very narrow state in the $D^0D^0\pi^+$ mass spectrum just below the $D^{*+}D^0$ mass threshold. We consider the influence of the Castillejo-Dalitz-Dyson (CDD) pole in the scattering amplitude to derive a general treatment for the two-body final state interaction near its threshold. The line shape (or the energy dependent event distribution) are then obtained, where the parameters can be fixed by fitting to the experimental data on the $D^0D^0\pi^+$ mass spectrum. Within our method the data are quite well reproduced. The pole structure in the complex energy plane indicates that the $T_{cc}$ state has a large portion of elementary degree of freedom (e.g., the compact tetraquark component) inside its hadron wave function. The compositeness as a measure of molecule component in its wave function is predicted to be $0.23_{-0.09}^{+0.40}$. Clearly, the non-molecular component takes a non-negligible or even dominant portion.</description>

      <title>Constraining first-order phase transition inside neutron stars with application of Bayesian techniques on PSR J0437-4715 NICER data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the existence of exotic matter phases and phase transitions within the core of neutron stars is crucial to advancing our knowledge of cold-dense matter physics. Recent multi-messenger observations, including gravitational waves from neutron star mergers and precise X-ray data from NASA's Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) mission, have significantly constrained the neutron star equation of state (EOS). This study investigates the effects of phase transitions in neutron stars, focusing on NICER's latest observation of PSR J0437--4715. We employ Bayesian inference techniques to evaluate the presence of first-order phase transitions using a piecewise polytropic EOS model. Our analysis incorporates data from multiple NICER sources, to refine constraints on key phase transition parameters, including critical density and transition depth. We find that including data from PSR J0437--4715 improves the evidence of phase transitions and tightens the EOS constraints, especially at higher densities. However, Bayes factor analysis only indicates a slight preference for models without phase transitions and current observational precision is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In particular, this polytropic model identifies the critical phase transition mass of neutron stars as being close to 1.4 solar masses, which coincides with the approximate mass range of PSR J0437--4715. This work emphasizes the importance of precise measurements of PSR J0437--4715 for deepening our understanding of neutron star interiors and exploring potential new physics at extreme densities.</description>

      <title>Calorimetric analysis for long-baseline neutrino experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In neutrino long-baseline experiments the energy of the incoming neutrino must be reconstructed from observations of the final state. We first discuss the problems that arise for energy conservation during the final-state interactions in a momentum-dependent potential. We then show, for the example of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment, that the presence of such a potential is necessarily connected with a large uncertainty in the reconstructed energy. This same uncertainty also affects the determination of energy- and four-momentum-transfers in neutrino-nucleus reactions. We analyze the origins of these uncertainties using transport theory for the description of the evolution of the final state of the reaction. We show that the spectral functions of target nuclei play an essential role not only for the initial neutrino-nucleus interaction but also for the final state evolution.</description>

      <title>The Unitarity-Limit Expansion for Two Nucleons with Perturbative Pions: Digest and Ideas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Unitarity Limit, the NN S-wave binding energies are zero, the scattering lengths infinite, Physics is universal, i.e. insensitive to details of the interactions, and observables display richer symmetries, namely invariance under both scaling and Wigner's combined SU(4) transformation of spin and isospin. This presentation is a digest of the first quantitative exploration of corrections to this picture when pions are included [1] (see there for a more comprehensive list of references). Since the pion mass and decay constant introduce dimensionful scales in the NN system, they explicitly break the symmetries of the Unitarity fixed point. In $\chi$EFT, these symmetries must therefore be classified as emergent. This text focuses on the $\chi$EFT variant with Perturbative ("KSW") Pions at next-to-next-to leading order (N2LO). This leads to the Hypothesis that both scale invariance and Wigner-SU(4) symmetry in the Unitarity Expansion show persistence, i.e. the footprint of both combined dominates even for $k\gtrsim m_\pi$ and is more relevant than chiral symmetry, so that the tensor/Wigner-SU(4) symmetry-breaking part of OPE is suppressed and does not enter before N3LO. Included are also ideas about underlying mechanisms and LO results of $\chi$EFT with Nonperturbative Pions in the expansion about Unitarity.</description>

      <title>Study of electron-positron annihilation into four pions within chiral effective field theory in the low energy region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ chiral effective field theory to study the process of electron-positron annihilation into four pions in the low energy region within $E_{c.m.}\leq 0.6$ GeV. The prediction of the cross-section is obtained through $SU(3)$ chiral perturbation theory up to the next-to-leading order, which is smaller than the experimental data in the energy region [0.6-0.65] GeV, though the data has only a few points and poor statistics. Then, the resonance chiral theory is applied to include the resonance contribution, with the lightest scalars and vectors written in the effective Lagrangians. A series of relevant decay widths and the masses of the vectors are studied to fix the unknown couplings. The resonance contribution should be one order larger than that of the chiral perturbation theory but still one to two orders smaller than the data. The significant discrepancy urged the new experimental measurements to give more guidance. We also compute the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution from the four pion channels to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $(g-2)_\mu$. In the energy range from threshold up to 0.6 GeV within RChT, the contributions are $a_\mu=(0.6678\pm0.0933)\times10^{-16}$ and $a_\mu=(0.4575\pm0.0517)\times10^{-16}$ for the processes of $e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^+\pi^-\pi^-$, $\pi^0\pi^0\pi^+\pi^-$, respectively.</description>
