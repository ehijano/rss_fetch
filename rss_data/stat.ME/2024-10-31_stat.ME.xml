      <title>BAMITA: Bayesian Multiple Imputation for Tensor Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data increasingly take the form of a multi-way array, or tensor, in several biomedical domains. Such tensors are often incompletely observed. For example, we are motivated by longitudinal microbiome studies in which several timepoints are missing for several subjects. There is a growing literature on missing data imputation for tensors. However, existing methods give a point estimate for missing values without capturing uncertainty. We propose a multiple imputation approach for tensors in a flexible Bayesian framework, that yields realistic simulated values for missing entries and can propagate uncertainty through subsequent analyses. Our model uses efficient and widely applicable conjugate priors for a CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) factorization, with a separable residual covariance structure. This approach is shown to perform well with respect to both imputation accuracy and uncertainty calibration, for scenarios in which either single entries or entire fibers of the tensor are missing. For two microbiome applications, it is shown to accurately capture uncertainty in the full microbiome profile at missing timepoints and used to infer trends in species diversity for the population. Documented R code to perform our multiple imputation approach is available at https://github.com/lockEF/MultiwayImputation .</description>

      <title>The Nudge Average Treatment Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The instrumental variable method is a prominent approach to recover under certain conditions, valid inference about a treatment causal effect even when unmeasured confounding might be present. In a groundbreaking paper, Imbens and Angrist (1994) established that a valid instrument nonparametrically identifies the average causal effect among compliers, also known as the local average treatment effect under a certain monotonicity assumption which rules out the existence of so-called defiers. An often-cited attractive property of monotonicity is that it facilitates a causal interpretation of the instrumental variable estimand without restricting the degree of heterogeneity of the treatment causal effect. In this paper, we introduce an alternative equally straightforward and interpretable condition for identification, which accommodates both the presence of defiers and heterogenous treatment effects. Mainly, we show that under our new conditions, the instrumental variable estimand recovers the average causal effect for the subgroup of units for whom the treatment is manipulable by the instrument, a subgroup which may consist of both defiers and compliers, therefore recovering an effect estimand we aptly call the Nudge Average Treatment Effect.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Jump Testing and Estimation in High Dimensions Under Complex Temporal Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most high dimensional changepoint detection methods assume the error process is stationary and changepoints occur synchronously across dimensions. The violation of these assumptions, which in applied settings is increasingly likely as the dimensionality of the time series being analyzed grows, can dramatically curtail the sensitivity or the accuracy of these methods. We propose AJDN (Asynchronous Jump Detection under Nonstationary noise). AJDN is a high dimensional multiscale jump detection method that tests and estimates jumps in an otherwise smoothly varying mean function for high dimensional time series with nonstationary noise where the jumps across dimensions may not occur at the same time. AJDN is correct in the sense that it detects the correct number of jumps with a prescribed probability asymptotically and its accuracy in estimating the locations of the jumps is asymptotically nearly optimal under the asynchronous jump assumption. Through a simulation study we demonstrate AJDN's robustness across a wide variety of stationary and nonstationary high dimensional time series, and we show its strong performance relative to some existing high dimensional changepoint detection methods. We apply AJDN to a seismic time series to demonstrate its ability to accurately detect jumps in real-world high dimensional time series with complex temporal dynamics.</description>

      <title>Conformal inference for cell type annotation with graph-structured constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal inference is a method that provides prediction sets for machine learning models, operating independently of the underlying distributional assumptions and relying solely on the exchangeability of training and test data. Despite its wide applicability and popularity, its application in graph-structured problems remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by developing an approach that leverages the rich information encoded in the graph structure of predicted classes to enhance the interpretability of conformal sets. Using a motivating example from genomics, specifically imaging-based spatial transcriptomics data and single-cell RNA sequencing data, we demonstrate how incorporating graph-structured constraints can improve the interpretation of cell type predictions. This approach aims to generate more coherent conformal sets that align with the inherent relationships among classes, facilitating clearer and more intuitive interpretations of model predictions. Additionally, we provide a technique to address non-exchangeability, particularly when the distribution of the response variable changes between training and test datasets. We implemented our method in the open-source R package scConform, available at https://github.com/ccb-hms/scConform.</description>

      <title>On testing for independence between generalized error models of several time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose new copula-based models for multivariate time series having continuous or discrete distributions, or a mixture of both. These models include stochastic volatility models and regime-switching models. We also propose statistics for testing independence between the generalized errors of these models, extending previous results of Duchesne, Ghoudi and Remillard (2012) obtained for stochastic volatility models. We define families of empirical processes constructed from lagged generalized errors, and we show that their joint asymptotic distributions are Gaussian and independent of the estimated parameters of the individual time series. Moebius transformations of the empirical processes are used to obtain tractable covariances. Several tests statistics are then proposed, based on Cramer-von Mises statistics and dependence measures, as well as graphical methods to visualize the dependence. In addition, numerical experiments are performed to assess the power of the proposed tests. Finally, to show the usefulness of our methodologies, examples of applications for financial data and crime data are given to cover both discrete and continuous cases. ll developed methodologies are implemented in the CRAN package IndGenErrors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate sphericity testing in high-dimensional settings, where existing methods primarily rely on sum-type test procedures that often underperform under sparse alternatives. To address this limitation, we propose two max-type test procedures utilizing the sample covariance matrix and the sample spatial-sign covariance matrix, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce two Cauchy combination test procedures that integrate both sum-type and max-type tests, demonstrating their superiority across a wide range of sparsity levels in the alternative hypothesis. Our simulation studies corroborate these findings, highlighting the enhanced performance of our proposed methodologies in high-dimensional sphericity testi</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method using conformal prediction to generate two-sided or one-sided prediction intervals for survival times. Specifically, the method provides both lower and upper predictive bounds for individuals deemed sufficiently similar to the non-censored population, while returning only a lower bound for others. The prediction intervals offer finite-sample coverage guarantees, requiring no distributional assumptions other than the sampled data points are independent and identically distributed. The performance of the procedure is assessed using both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Improve the Precision of Area Under the Curve Estimation for Recurrent Events Through Covariate Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The area under the curve (AUC) of the mean cumulative function (MCF) has recently been introduced as a novel estimand for evaluating treatment effects in recurrent event settings, capturing a totality of evidence in relation to disease progression. While the Lin-Wei-Yang-Ying (LWYY) model is commonly used for analyzing recurrent events, it relies on the proportional rate assumption between treatment arms, which is often violated in practice. In contrast, the AUC under MCFs does not depend on such proportionality assumptions and offers a clinically interpretable measure of treatment effect. To improve the precision of the AUC estimation while preserving its unconditional interpretability, we propose a nonparametric covariate adjustment approach. This approach guarantees efficiency gain compared to unadjusted analysis, as demonstrated by theoretical asymptotic distributions, and is universally applicable to various randomization schemes, including both simple and covariate-adaptive designs. Extensive simulations across different scenarios further support its advantage in increasing statistical power. Our findings highlight the importance of covariate adjustment for the analysis of AUC in recurrent event settings, offering practical guidance for its application in randomized clinical trials.</description>

      <title>Bayesian hierarchical models with calibrated mixtures of g-priors for assessing treatment effect moderation in meta-analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing treatment effect moderation is critical in biomedical research and many other fields, as it guides personalized intervention strategies to improve participant's outcomes. Individual participant-level data meta-analysis (IPD-MA) offers a robust framework for such assessments by leveraging data from multiple trials. However, its performance is often compromised by challenges such as high between-trial variability. Traditional Bayesian shrinkage methods have gained popularity, but are less suitable in this context, as their priors do not discern heterogeneous studies. In this paper, we propose the calibrated mixtures of g-priors methods in IPD-MA to enhance efficiency and reduce risk in the estimation of moderation effects. Our approach incorporates a trial-level sample size tuning function, and a moderator-level shrinkage parameter in the prior, offering a flexible spectrum of shrinkage levels that enables practitioners to evaluate moderator importance, from conservative to optimistic perspectives. Compared with existing Bayesian shrinkage methods, our extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the calibrated mixtures of g-priors exhibit superior performances in terms of efficiency and risk metrics, particularly under high between-trial variability, high model sparsity, weak moderation effects and correlated design matrices. We further illustrate their application in assessing effect moderators of two active treatments for major depressive disorder, using IPD from four randomized controlled trials.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Hierarchical Model for Synthesizing Registry and Survey Data on Female Breast Cancer Prevalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In public health, it is critical for policymakers to assess the relationship between the disease prevalence and associated risk factors or clinical characteristics, facilitating effective resources allocation. However, for diseases like female breast cancer (FBC), reliable prevalence data at specific geographical levels, such as the county-level, are limited because the gold standard data typically come from long-term cancer registries, which do not necessarily collect needed risk factors. In addition, it remains unclear whether fitting each model separately or jointly results in better estimation. In this paper, we identify two data sources to produce reliable county-level prevalence estimates in Missouri, USA: the population-based Missouri Cancer Registry (MCR) and the survey-based Missouri County-Level Study (CLS). We propose a two-stage Bayesian model to synthesize these sources, accounting for their differences in the methodological design, case definitions, and collected information. The first stage involves estimating the county-level FBC prevalence using the raking method for CLS data and the counting method for MCR data, calibrating the differences in the methodological design and case definition. The second stage includes synthesizing two sources with different sets of covariates using a Bayesian generalized linear mixed model with Zeller-Siow prior for the coefficients. Our data analyses demonstrate that using both data sources have better results than at least one data source, and including a data source membership matters when there exist systematic differences in these sources. Finally, we translate results into policy making and discuss methodological differences for data synthesis of registry and survey data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This book is written to offer a humble, but unified, treatment of e-values in hypothesis testing. The book is organized into three parts: Fundamental Concepts, Core Ideas, and Advanced Topics. The first part includes three chapters that introduce the basic concepts. The second part includes five chapters of core ideas such as universal inference, log-optimality, e-processes, operations on e-values, and e-values in multiple testing. The third part contains five chapters of advanced topics. We hope that, by putting the materials together in this book, the concept of e-values becomes more accessible for educational, research, and practical use.</description>

      <title>Zero-inflated stochastic block modeling of efficiency-security tradeoffs in weighted criminal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Criminal networks arise from the unique attempt to balance a need of establishing frequent ties among affiliates to facilitate the coordination of illegal activities, with the necessity to sparsify the overall connectivity architecture to hide from law enforcement. This efficiency-security tradeoff is also combined with the creation of groups of redundant criminals that exhibit similar connectivity patterns, thus guaranteeing resilient network architectures. State-of-the-art models for such data are not designed to infer these unique structures. In contrast to such solutions we develop a computationally-tractable Bayesian zero-inflated Poisson stochastic block model (ZIP-SBM), which identifies groups of redundant criminals with similar connectivity patterns, and infers both overt and covert block interactions within and across such groups. This is accomplished by modeling weighted ties (corresponding to counts of interactions among pairs of criminals) via zero-inflated Poisson distributions with block-specific parameters that quantify complex patterns in the excess of zero ties in each block (security) relative to the distribution of the observed weighted ties within that block (efficiency). The performance of ZIP-SBM is illustrated in simulations and in a study of summits co-attendances in a complex Mafia organization, where we unveil efficiency-security structures adopted by the criminal organization that were hidden to previous analyses.</description>

      <title>Average Controlled and Average Natural Micro Direct Effects in Summary Causal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the identifiability of average controlled direct effects and average natural direct effects in causal systems represented by summary causal graphs, which are abstractions of full causal graphs, often used in dynamic systems where cycles and omitted temporal information complicate causal inference. Unlike in the traditional linear setting, where direct effects are typically easier to identify and estimate, non-parametric direct effects, which are crucial for handling real-world complexities, particularly in epidemiological contexts where relationships between variables (e.g, genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors) are often non-linear, are much harder to define and identify. In particular, we give sufficient conditions for identifying average controlled micro direct effect and average natural micro direct effect from summary causal graphs in the presence of hidden confounding. Furthermore, we show that the conditions given for the average controlled micro direct effect become also necessary in the setting where there is no hidden confounding and where we are only interested in identifiability by adjustment.</description>

      <title>A Martingale-Free Introduction to Conditional Gaussian Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Conditional Gaussian Nonlinear System (CGNS) is a broad class of nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems. Given the trajectories for a subset of state variables, the remaining follow a Gaussian distribution. Despite the conditionally linear structure, the CGNS exhibits strong nonlinearity, thus capturing many non-Gaussian characteristics observed in nature through its joint and marginal distributions. Desirably, it enjoys closed analytic formulae for the time evolution of its conditional Gaussian statistics, which facilitate the study of data assimilation and other related topics. In this paper, we develop a martingale-free approach to improve the understanding of CGNSs. This methodology provides a tractable approach to proving the time evolution of the conditional statistics by deriving results through time discretization schemes, with the continuous-time regime obtained via a formal limiting process as the discretization time-step vanishes. This discretized approach further allows for developing analytic formulae for optimal posterior sampling of unobserved state variables with correlated noise. These tools are particularly valuable for studying extreme events and intermittency and apply to high-dimensional systems. Moreover, the approach improves the understanding of different sampling methods in characterizing uncertainty. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through a physics-constrained, triad-interaction climate model with cubic nonlinearity and state-dependent cross-interacting noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Split conformal prediction techniques are applied to regression problems with circular responses by introducing a suitable conformity score, leading to prediction sets with adaptive arc length and finite-sample coverage guarantees for any circular predictive model under exchangeable data. Leveraging the high performance of existing predictive models designed for linear responses, we analyze a general projection procedure that converts any linear response regression model into one suitable for circular responses. When random forests serve as basis models in this projection procedure, we harness the out-of-bag dynamics to eliminate the necessity for a separate calibration sample in the construction of prediction sets. For synthetic and real datasets the resulting projected random forests model produces more efficient out-of-bag conformal prediction sets, with shorter median arc length, when compared to the split conformal prediction sets generated by two existing alternative models.</description>

Abstract: Ridge or more formally $\ell_2$ regularization shows up in many areas of statistics and machine learning. It is one of those essential devices that any good data scientist needs to master for their craft. In this brief ridge fest I have collected together some of the magic and beauty of ridge that my colleagues and I have encountered over the past 40 years in applied statistics.</description>

      <title>Denoising and Multilinear Projected-Estimation of High-Dimensional Matrix-Variate Factor Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new multi-linear projection method for denoising and estimation of high-dimensional matrix-variate factor time series. It assumes that a $p_1\times p_2$ matrix-variate time series consists of a dynamically dependent, lower-dimensional matrix-variate factor process and a $p_1\times p_2$ matrix idiosyncratic series. In addition, the latter series assumes a matrix-variate factor structure such that its row and column covariances may have diverging/spiked eigenvalues to accommodate the case of low signal-to-noise ratio often encountered in applications. We use an iterative projection procedure to reduce the dimensions and noise effects in estimating front and back loading matrices and to obtain faster convergence rates than those of the traditional methods available in the literature. We further introduce a two-way projected Principal Component Analysis to mitigate the diverging noise effects, and implement a high-dimensional white-noise testing procedure to estimate the dimension of the matrix factor process. Asymptotic properties of the proposed method are established if the dimensions and sample size go to infinity. We also use simulations and real examples to assess the performance of the proposed method in finite samples and to compare its forecasting ability with some existing ones in the literature. The proposed method fares well in out-of-sample forecasting. In a supplement, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach even when the idiosyncratic terms exhibit serial correlations with or without a diverging white noise effect.</description>

      <title>Max-Rank: Efficient Multiple Testing for Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple hypothesis testing (MHT) commonly arises in various scientific fields, from genomics to psychology, where testing many hypotheses simultaneously increases the risk of Type-I errors. These errors can mislead scientific inquiry, rendering MHT corrections essential. In this paper, we address MHT within the context of conformal prediction, a flexible method for predictive uncertainty quantification. Some conformal prediction settings can require simultaneous testing, and positive dependencies among tests typically exist. We propose a novel correction named $\texttt{max-rank}$ that leverages these dependencies, whilst ensuring that the joint Type-I error rate is efficiently controlled. Inspired by permutation-based corrections from Westfall &amp; Young (1993), $\texttt{max-rank}$ exploits rank order information to improve performance, and readily integrates with any conformal procedure. We demonstrate both its theoretical and empirical advantages over the common Bonferroni correction and its compatibility with conformal prediction, highlighting the potential to enhance predictive uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04952v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assessing the accuracy of the output of causal discovery algorithms is crucial in developing and comparing novel methods. Common evaluation metrics such as the structural Hamming distance are useful for assessing individual links of causal graphs. However, many state-of-the-art causal discovery methods do not output single causal graphs, but rather their Markov equivalence classes (MECs) which encode all of the graph's separation and connection statements. In this work, we propose additional measures of distance that capture the difference in separations of two causal graphs which link-based distances are not fit to assess. The proposed distances have low polynomial time complexity and are applicable to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) as well as to maximal ancestral graph (MAGs) that may contain bidirected edges. We complement our theoretical analysis with toy examples and empirical experiments that highlight the differences to existing comparison metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network interference amounts to the treatment status of one unit affecting the potential outcome of other units in the population. Testing for spillover effects in this setting makes the null hypothesis non-sharp. An interesting approach to tackling the non-sharp nature of the null hypothesis in this setup is constructing conditional randomization tests such that the null is sharp on the restricted population. Such approaches can pose computational challenges as finding these appropriate sub-populations based on experimental design can involve solving an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we view the network amongst the population as a random variable instead of being fixed. We propose a new approach that builds a conditional quasi-randomization test. We build the (non-sharp) null distribution of no spillover effects using random graph null models. We show that our method is exactly valid in finite samples under mild assumptions. Our method displays enhanced power over other methods, substantially improving cluster randomized trials. We illustrate our methodology to test for interference in a weather insurance adoption experiment run in rural China.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Uncertainty: All We Need is the Bootstrap?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty through standard errors, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, and related measures is a fundamental aspect of statistical practice. However, these techniques involve a variety of methods, mathematical formulas, and underlying concepts, which can be complex. Could the non-parametric bootstrap, known for its simplicity and general applicability, serve as a universal alternative? In this study, we address this question through a review of existing literature and a simulation analysis of one- and two-sided confidence intervals across varying sample sizes, confidence levels, data-generating processes, and statistical functionals. Our findings indicate that the double bootstrap consistently performs best and is a promising alternative to traditional methods used for common statistical tasks. These results suggest that the bootstrap, particularly the double bootstrap, could simplify statistical education and practice without compromising effectiveness.</description>

Abstract: We propose a parametric hazard model obtained by enforcing positivity in the damped harmonic oscillator. The resulting model has closed-form hazard and cumulative hazard functions, facilitating likelihood and Bayesian inference on the parameters. We show that this model can capture a range of hazard shapes, such as increasing, decreasing, unimodal, bathtub, and oscillatory patterns, and characterize the tails of the corresponding survival function. We illustrate the use of this model in survival analysis using real data.</description>

      <title>Single CASANOVA? Not in multiple comparisons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When comparing multiple groups in clinical trials, we are not only interested in whether there is a difference between any groups but rather the location. Such research questions lead to testing multiple individual hypotheses. To control the familywise error rate (FWER), we must apply some corrections or introduce tests that control the FWER by design. In the case of time-to-event data, a Bonferroni-corrected log-rank test is commonly used. This approach has two significant drawbacks: (i) it loses power when the proportional hazards assumption is violated [1] and (ii) the correction generally leads to a lower power, especially when the test statistics are not independent [2]. We propose two new tests based on combined weighted log-rank tests. One as a simple multiple contrast test of weighted log-rank tests and one as an extension of the so-called CASANOVA test [3]. The latter was introduced for factorial designs. We propose a new multiple contrast test based on the CASANOVA approach. Our test promises to be more powerful under crossing hazards and eliminates the need for additional p-value correction. We assess the performance of our tests through extensive Monte Carlo simulation studies covering both proportional and non-proportional hazard scenarios. Finally, we apply the new and reference methods to a real-world data example. The new approaches control the FWER and show reasonable power in all scenarios. They outperform the adjusted approaches in some non-proportional settings in terms of power.</description>

      <title>Approximate Bayesian Computation with Statistical Distances for Model Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model selection is a key task in statistics, playing a critical role across various scientific disciplines. While no model can fully capture the complexities of a real-world data-generating process, identifying the model that best approximates it can provide valuable insights. Bayesian statistics offers a flexible framework for model selection by updating prior beliefs as new data becomes available, allowing for ongoing refinement of candidate models. This is typically achieved by calculating posterior probabilities, which quantify the support for each model given the observed data. However, in cases where likelihood functions are intractable, exact computation of these posterior probabilities becomes infeasible. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) has emerged as a likelihood-free method and it is traditionally used with summary statistics to reduce data dimensionality, however this often results in information loss difficult to quantify, particularly in model selection contexts. Recent advancements propose the use of full data approaches based on statistical distances, offering a promising alternative that bypasses the need for summary statistics and potentially allows recovery of the exact posterior distribution. Despite these developments, full data ABC approaches have not yet been widely applied to model selection problems. This paper seeks to address this gap by investigating the performance of ABC with statistical distances in model selection. Through simulation studies and an application to toad movement models, this work explores whether full data approaches can overcome the limitations of summary statistic-based ABC for model choice.</description>

      <title>Controlling Continuous Relaxation for Combinatorial Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16965v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised learning (UL)-based solvers for combinatorial optimization (CO) train a neural network that generates a soft solution by directly optimizing the CO objective using a continuous relaxation strategy. These solvers offer several advantages over traditional methods and other learning-based methods, particularly for large-scale CO problems. However, UL-based solvers face two practical issues: (I) an optimization issue, where UL-based solvers are easily trapped at local optima, and (II) a rounding issue, where UL-based solvers require artificial post-learning rounding from the continuous space back to the original discrete space, undermining the robustness of the results. This study proposes a Continuous Relaxation Annealing (CRA) strategy, an effective rounding-free learning method for UL-based solvers. CRA introduces a penalty term that dynamically shifts from prioritizing continuous solutions, effectively smoothing the non-convexity of the objective function, to enforcing discreteness, eliminating artificial rounding. Experimental results demonstrate that CRA significantly enhances the performance of UL-based solvers, outperforming existing UL-based solvers and greedy algorithms in complex CO problems. Additionally, CRA effectively eliminates artificial rounding and accelerates the learning process.</description>

      <title>Weak Supervision Performance Evaluation via Partial Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Programmatic Weak Supervision (PWS) enables supervised model training without direct access to ground truth labels, utilizing weak labels from heuristics, crowdsourcing, or pre-trained models. However, the absence of ground truth complicates model evaluation, as traditional metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall cannot be directly calculated. In this work, we present a novel method to address this challenge by framing model evaluation as a partial identification problem and estimating performance bounds using Fr\'echet bounds. Our approach derives reliable bounds on key metrics without requiring labeled data, overcoming core limitations in current weak supervision evaluation techniques. Through scalable convex optimization, we obtain accurate and computationally efficient bounds for metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, even in high-dimensional settings. This framework offers a robust approach to assessing model quality without ground truth labels, enhancing the practicality of weakly supervised learning for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Natural Counterfactuals With Necessary Backtracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01607v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning is pivotal in human cognition and especially important for providing explanations and making decisions. While Judea Pearl's influential approach is theoretically elegant, its generation of a counterfactual scenario often requires too much deviation from the observed scenarios to be feasible, as we show using simple examples. To mitigate this difficulty, we propose a framework of \emph{natural counterfactuals} and a method for generating counterfactuals that are more feasible with respect to the actual data distribution. Our methodology incorporates a certain amount of backtracking when needed, allowing changes in causally preceding variables to minimize deviations from realistic scenarios. Specifically, we introduce a novel optimization framework that permits but also controls the extent of backtracking with a naturalness criterion. Empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/GuangyuanHao/natural_counterfactuals.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the Hidden World with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Revealing the underlying causal mechanisms in the real world is the key to the development of science. Despite the progress in the past decades, traditional causal discovery approaches (CDs) mainly rely on high-quality measured variables, usually given by human experts, to find causal relations. The lack of well-defined high-level variables in many real-world applications has already been a longstanding roadblock to a broader application of CDs. To this end, this paper presents Causal representatiOn AssistanT (COAT) that introduces large language models (LLMs) to bridge the gap. LLMs are trained on massive observations of the world and have demonstrated great capability in extracting key information from unstructured data. Therefore, it is natural to employ LLMs to assist with proposing useful high-level factors and crafting their measurements. Meanwhile, COAT also adopts CDs to find causal relations among the identified variables as well as to provide feedback to LLMs to iteratively refine the proposed factors. We show that LLMs and CDs are mutually beneficial and the constructed feedback provably also helps with the factor proposal. We construct and curate several synthetic and real-world benchmarks including analysis of human reviews and diagnosis of neuropathic and brain tumors, to comprehensively evaluate COAT. Extensive empirical results confirm the effectiveness and reliability of COAT with significant improvements.</description>

Abstract: In machine learning, model calibration and predictive inference are essential for producing reliable predictions and quantifying uncertainty to support decision-making. Recognizing the complementary roles of point and interval predictions, we introduce Self-Calibrating Conformal Prediction, a method that combines Venn-Abers calibration and conformal prediction to deliver calibrated point predictions alongside prediction intervals with finite-sample validity conditional on these predictions. To achieve this, we extend the original Venn-Abers procedure from binary classification to regression. Our theoretical framework supports analyzing conformal prediction methods that involve calibrating model predictions and subsequently constructing conditionally valid prediction intervals on the same data, where the conditioning set or conformity scores may depend on the calibrated predictions. Real-data experiments show that our method improves interval efficiency through model calibration and offers a practical alternative to feature-conditional validity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the Elliptical Wishart and Inverse Elliptical Wishart distributions, which play a major role when handling covariance matrices. Similarly to multivariate elliptical distributions, these form a large family of covariance distributions, encompassing, e.g., the Wishart or \textit{t}-Wishart ones. Our first major contribution is to derive a stochastic representation for Elliptical Wishart and Inverse Elliptical Wishart matrices. This later enables us to obtain various key statistical properties of Elliptical Wishart and Inverse Elliptical Wishart distributions such as expectations, variances, and Kronecker moments up to any orders. The stochastic representation also allows us to provide an efficient method to generate random matrices from Elliptical Wishart and Inverse Elliptical Wishart distributions. Finally, the practical interest of Elliptical Wishart distributions - in particular the \textit{t}-Wishart one - is demonstrated through a fitting experiment on real electroencephalographic data. This showcases their effectiveness in accurately modeling real covariance matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20039v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is playing an increasingly important role in scientific research. In conjunction with classical statistical approaches, ML-assisted analytical strategies have shown great promise in accelerating research findings. This has also opened a whole field of methodological research focusing on integrative approaches that leverage both ML and statistics to tackle data science challenges. One type of study that has quickly gained popularity employs ML to predict unobserved outcomes in massive samples, and then uses predicted outcomes in downstream statistical inference. However, existing methods designed to ensure the validity of this type of post-prediction inference are limited to very basic tasks such as linear regression analysis. This is because any extension of these approaches to new, more sophisticated statistical tasks requires task-specific algebraic derivations and software implementations, which ignores the massive library of existing software tools already developed for the same scientific problem given observed data. This severely constrains the scope of application for post-prediction inference. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel statistical framework named PSPS for task-agnostic ML-assisted inference. It provides a post-prediction inference solution that can be easily plugged into almost any established data analysis routines. It delivers valid and efficient inference that is robust to arbitrary choice of ML model, allowing nearly all existing statistical frameworks to be incorporated into the analysis of ML-predicted data. Through extensive experiments, we showcase our method's validity, versatility, and superiority compared to existing approaches.

      <title>Large language model validity via enhanced conformal prediction methods</title>

Abstract: We develop new conformal inference methods for obtaining validity guarantees on the output of large language models (LLMs). Prior work in conformal language modeling identifies a subset of the text that satisfies a high-probability guarantee of correctness. These methods work by filtering claims from the LLM's original response if a scoring function evaluated on the claim fails to exceed a threshold calibrated via split conformal prediction. Existing methods in this area suffer from two deficiencies. First, the guarantee stated is not conditionally valid. The trustworthiness of the filtering step may vary based on the topic of the response. Second, because the scoring function is imperfect, the filtering step can remove many valuable and accurate claims. We address both of these challenges via two new conformal methods. First, we generalize the conditional conformal procedure of Gibbs et al. (2023) in order to adaptively issue weaker guarantees when they are required to preserve the utility of the output. Second, we show how to systematically improve the quality of the scoring function via a novel algorithm for differentiating through the conditional conformal procedure. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on biography and medical question-answering datasets.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Tensor Discriminant Analysis with Incomplete Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor classification is gaining importance across fields, yet handling partially observed data remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to tensor classification with incomplete data, framed within high-dimensional tensor linear discriminant analysis. Specifically, we consider a high-dimensional tensor predictor with missing observations under the Missing Completely at Random (MCR) assumption and employ the Tensor Gaussian Mixture Model (TGMM) to capture the relationship between the tensor predictor and class label. We propose a Tensor Linear Discriminant Analysis with Missing Data (Tensor LDA-MD) algorithm, which manages high-dimensional tensor predictors with missing entries by leveraging the decomposable low-rank structure of the discriminant tensor. Our work establishes convergence rates for the estimation error of the discriminant tensor with incomplete data and minimax optimal bounds for the misclassification rate, addressing key gaps in the literature. Additionally, we derive large deviation bounds for the generalized mode-wise sample covariance matrix and its inverse, which are crucial tools in our analysis and hold independent interest. Our method demonstrates excellent performance in simulations and real data analysis, even with significant proportions of missing data.</description>
