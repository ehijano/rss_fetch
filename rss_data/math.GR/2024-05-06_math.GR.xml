      <title>The Baire property and precompact duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if $G$ is a totally bounded abelian group \st\ its dual group $\widehat{G}_p$ equipped with the finite-open topology is a Baire group, then every compact subset of $G$ must be finite. This solves an open question by Chasco, Dom\'inguez and Tkachenko. {Among other consequences, we obtain an example of a group that is $g$-dense in its completion but is not $g$-barrelled. This solves a question proposed by Au${\beta}$enhofer and Dikranjan.}</description>

      <title>Groups with few finite dimensional unitary representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \emph{Bohr compactification} of an arbitrary topological group $G$ is defined as the group compactification $(bG,b)$ with the following universal property: for every continuous homomorphism $h$ from $G$ into a compact group $K$ there is a continuous homomorphism $h^{b}$ from $bG$ into $K$ extending $h$ in the sense that $h=h^b \circ b$. The Bohr compactification $(bG,b)$ is the unique (up to equivalence) largest compactification of $G$. Although, for locally compact Abelian groups, the Bohr compactification is a big monster, for non-Abelian groups the situation is much more interesting and it can be said that all options are possible. Here we are interested in locally compact groups whose Bohr compactification is \emph{small}. Among other results, we characterize when the Bohr the Bohr compactification of a locally compact group is topologically isomorphic to its Chu or unitary quasi-dual. Our results fixe some incorrect statements appeared in the literature.</description>

      <title>Products of involutions in symplectic groups over general fields (II)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $s$ be an $n$-dimensional symplectic form over a field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic other than $2$, with $n&gt;2$.
  In a previous article, we have proved that if $\mathbb{F}$ is infinite then every element of the symplectic group $\mathrm{Sp}(s)$ is the product of four involutions if $n$ is a multiple of $4$ and of five involutions otherwise.
  Here, we adapt this result to all finite fields with characteristic not $2$, with the sole exception of the very special situation where $n=4$ and $|\mathbb{F}|=3$, a special case which we study extensively.</description>

      <title>Characterizing inner automorphisms and realizing outer automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give elementary proofs of the following two theorems on automorphisms of a finite group G: (1) An automorphism of G is inner if and only if it extends to an automorphism of every finite group containing G. (2) There exists a finite group, whose outer automorphism group is isomorphic to G. The first theorem was proved by Pettet using a graph-theoretical construction of Heineken-Liebeck. A Lie-theoretical proof of the second theorem was sketched by Cornulier in a MathOverflow post. Our proofs are purely group-theoretical.</description>

      <title>A note on adjoint reality in simple complex Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a Lie group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$. In the paper "Reality of unipotent elements in simple Lie groups, Bull. Sci. Math., 185, 2023, 103261" by K. Gongopadhyay and C. Maity, an infinitesimal version of the notion of classical reality, namely adjoint reality, has been introduced. An element $X \in \mathfrak g$ is adjoint real if $-X$ belongs to the adjoint orbit of $X$ in $\mathfrak g$. In this paper, we investigate the adjoint real and the strongly adjoint real semisimple elements in complex simple classical Lie algebras. We also prove that every element in a complex symplectic Lie algebra is adjoint real.</description>

      <title>An elementary proof of the Benjamini-Nekrashevych-Pete conjecture for the semi-direct products $\mathbb{Z}^n\rtimes \mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finitely generated group $G$ is called strongly scale-invariant if there exists an injective homomorphism $f:G\to G$ such that $f(G)$ is a finite index subgroup of $G$ and such that $\cap_{n\geq 0} f^n(G)$ is finite. Nekrashevych and Pete conjectured that all strongly scale-invariant groups are virtually nilpotent, after disproving a stronger conjecture by Benjamini.
  This conjecture is known to be true in some situations. Der\'e proved it for virtually polycyclic groups. In this paper, we provide an elementary proof for those polycyclic groups that can be written as a semi-direct product $\mathbb{Z}^n\rtimes \mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze computational properties of the Diophantine problem (and its search variant) for spherical equations $\prod_{i=1}^m z_i^{-1} c_i z_i = 1$ (and its variants) over the class of finite metabelian groups $G_{p,n}=\mathbb{Z}_p^n \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_p^\ast$, where $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $p$ is prime. We prove that the problem of finding solutions for certain constrained spherical equations is computationally hard on average (assuming that some lattice approximation problem is hard in the worst case).</description>

      <title>On a Completion of Cohomological Functors Generalising Tate Cohomology I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viewing group cohomology as a so-called cohomological functor, G. Mislin has generalised Tate cohomology from finite groups to all discrete groups by defining a completion for cohomological functors in [27]. If $T^{\bullet}: \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{D}$ is any cohomological functor, then we construct its Mislin completion $\widehat{T}^{\bullet}: \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{D}$ under the assumption that the abelian category $\mathcal{C}$ has enough projectives and that in the abelian category $\mathcal{D}$ all countable direct limits exist and are exact. This takes Tate cohomology to settings where it has never been introduced such as in condensed mathematics. Through the latter, one can define Tate cohomology for any $T1$ topological group. More specifically, we generalise four constructions of Mislin completions from the literature, prove that they yield isomorphic cohomological functors and provide explicit formulae for their connecting homomorphisms. For any morphism $f: M \rightarrow N$ in $\mathcal{C}$ we develop formulae for $\widehat{T}^n(f): \widehat{T}^n(M) \rightarrow \widehat{T}^n(N)$ in terms of each construction.</description>

Abstract: Viewing group cohomology as a so-called cohomological functor, G. Mislin has generalised Tate cohomology from finite groups to all discrete groups by defining a completion for cohomological functors in [24]. For any cohomological functor $T^{\bullet}: \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{D}$ we have constructed its Mislin completion $\widehat{T}^{\bullet}: \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{D}$ in [15] under mild assumptions on the abelian categories $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ which generalises Tate cohomology to all $T1$ topological groups. In this paper we investigate the properties of Mislin completions. As their main feature, Mislin completions of Ext-functors detect finite projective dimension of objects in the domain category. We establish a version of dimension shifting, an Eckmann-Shapiro result as well as cohomology products such as external products, cup products and Yoneda products.</description>

      <title>Compact and finite-type support in the homology of big mapping class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any infinite-type surface $S$, a natural question is whether the homology of its mapping class group contains any non-trivial classes that are supported on (i) a compact subsurface or (ii) a finite-type subsurface. Our purpose here is to study this question, in particular giving an almost-complete answer when the genus of $S$ is positive (including infinite) and a partial answer when the genus of $S$ is zero. Our methods involve the notion of shiftable subsurfaces as well as homological stability for mapping class groups of finite-type surfaces.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we exhibit for every non amenable group that is initially sub-amenable (sometimes also referred to as LEA), two sofic approximations that are not conjugate by any automorphism of the universal sofic group.

      <description>arXiv:2306.16974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for every countable group, any sequence of approximate homomorphisms with values in permutations can be realized as the restriction of a sofic approximation of an orbit equivalence relation. Moreover, this orbit equivalence relation is uniquely determined by the invariant random subgroup of the approximate homomorphism. We record applications of this result to recover various known stability and conjugacy characterizations for almost homomorphisms of amenable groups.</description>

      <title>From Relation to Emulation and Interpretation: Computer Algebra Implementation of the Covering Lemma for Finite Transformation Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a practical computer algebra implementation of the Covering Lemma for finite transformation semigroups. The lemma states that given a surjective relational morphism $(X,S)\twoheadrightarrow(Y,T)$, we can establish emulation by a cascade product (subsemigroup of the wreath product): $(X,S)\hookrightarrow (Y,T)\wr (Z,U)$. The dependent component $(Z,U)$ contains the kernel of the morphism, the information lost in the map.
  The implementation complements the existing tools for the holonomy decomposition algorithm. It gives an incremental method to get a coarser decomposition when computing the complete skeleton for holonomy is not feasible. Here, we describe a simplified and generalized algorithm for the lemma and compare it to the holonomy method. Incidentally, the kernel-based method could be the easiest way of understanding the hierarchical decompositions of transformation semigroups and thus the celebrated Krohn-Rhodes theory.</description>

      <title>Co-spectral radius for countable equivalence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.06692v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the co-spectral radius of inclusions $\mathcal{S}\leq \mathcal{R}$ of discrete, probability measure-preserving equivalence relations, as the sampling exponent of a generating random walk on the ambient relation. The co-spectral radius is analogous to the spectral radius for random walks on $G/H$ for inclusion $H\leq G$ of groups. For the proof, we develop a more general version of the 2-3 method we used in another work on the growth of unimodular random rooted trees. We use this method to show that the walk growth exists for an arbitrary unimodular random rooted graph of bounded degree. We also investigate how the co-spectral radius behaves for hyperfinite relations, and discuss new critical exponents for percolation that can be defined using the co-spectral radius.</description>

Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number. We compute the trivial source character tables of finite Frobenius groups $G$ with an abelian Frobenius complement $H$ and an elementary abelian Frobenius kernel of order $p^2$. More precisely, we deal with all infinite families of such groups which occur in the two extremal cases for the fusion of $p$-subgroups: the case in which there exists exactly one $G$-conjugacy class of non-trivial cyclic $p$-subgroups, and the case in which there exist exactly $p+1$ distinct $G$-conjugacy classes of non-trivial cyclic $p$-subgroups.</description>

Let $(B,\nu)$ be the universal topological Poisson $\mu$-boundary of $(G,\mu)$ and $\Pi_s(G)$ the universal minimal strongly proximal $G$-flow. This note is inspired by a recent result of Hartman and Kalantar. We show that for a locally compact second countable group $G$ the following conditions are equivalent: (i) the measure $\nu$ is the unique $\mu$-stationary measure on $B$, (ii) $(B,G) \cong (\Pi_s(G),G)$.</description>
