      <title>A robust framework for frictional fault contact in geological formations using a stabilized augmented Lagrangian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations are essential for evaluating the performance and safety of geological engineered systems such as geologic carbon storage sites, enhanced geothermal fields, and oil and gas reservoirs. A key challenge lies in accurately modeling the frictional contact behavior along fault surfaces. This problem involves inequality constraints that arise from the physics of frictional slip, requiring specialized numerical methods to handle the resulting highly nonlinear and path-dependent behavior. In this work, we address this challenge using an augmented Lagrangian method implemented via the Uzawa algorithm. The formulation employs mixed finite element spaces, combining low-order piecewise linear displacements within the 3D domain cells with piecewise constant tractions defined on the fault surfaces. Furthermore, to ensure stability and satisfy the inf-sup condition, the discrete displacement space is enriched with face bubble functions on both sides of the contact interfaces. This approach offers several advantages over other stabilization techniques that rely on additional terms, as it does not require extra parameters for implementation, and it integrates naturally in the Uzawa framework.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Isospectral Runge--Kutta Methods as Lie group methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compare three different approaches for a conservative integration in time of isospectral flows on quadratic Lie algebras.
  We show that it is possible to choose an equivalent formulation of the original isospectral flow such that, applying a symplectic Runge--Kutta method, the resulting scheme is both conservative and computationally more efficient than other schemes previously proposed.
  In particular, in the case of Hamiltonian systems, we get arbitrarily high-order Lie--Poisson integrators on quadratic Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>A domain decomposition method for computing the scattering matrix of waveguide circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze and develop numerical methods for time-harmonic wave scattering in metallic waveguide structures of infinite extent. We show that radiation boundary conditions formulated via projectors onto outgoing modes determine the coefficients of propagating modes uniquely, even when the structure supports trapped modes. Building on this, we introduce a fast divide-and-conquer solver that constructs solution operators on subdomains as impedance-to-impedance maps and couples them by enforcing continuity conditions across their interfaces. For Dirichlet waveguides, the computation of impedance-to-impedance maps requires the solution of mixed Dirichlet-Impedance boundary value problems. We construct a second-kind Fredholm integral equation that avoids near-hypersingular operators, requiring only integral operators whose kernels are at most weakly singular. Numerical experiments on large structures with many circuit elements demonstrate substantial efficiency gains: the proposed approach typically outperforms state-of-the-art fast iterative and fast direct solvers by one to two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>A Convergent Structure-Preserving Scheme for Dissipative Solutions of the Rotating Shallow Water System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design and analyse a semi-implicit finite volume scheme for the two-dimensional rotating shallow water (RSW) equations that is energy stable, well-balanced (capable of preserving discrete geostrophic steady states), consistent, and covergent. The key idea is the introduction of carefully chosen stabilisation terms into the convective fluxes of the mass and momentum equations, as well as the source terms. Under a CFL-type condition, together with an auxiliary time-step restriction arising from the Coriolis forces, we establish the energy stability of the scheme. The stabilisation terms are constructed to vanish at steady states, thereby ensuring the well-balancing property under an appropriate advective CFL condition. We derive a sufficient time-step restriction that guarantees stability, well-balancing, existence of discrete solutions, and positivity simultaneously. Furthermore, under mild boundedness assumptions, we obtain a priori estimates showing that the stabilisation terms converge to zero as the mesh is refined, which establishes the consistency of the scheme. This in turn enables us to prove that numerical solutions generate a Young measure, identifiable as a dissipative measure-valued solution of the RSW system, thereby yielding convergence of the scheme. Finally, we confirm the theoretical results through extensive numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Root-Finding Algorithm and its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Root-finding method is an iterative process that constructs a sequence converging to a solution of an equation. Householder's method is a higher-order method that requires higher order derivatives of the reciprocal of a function and has disadvantages. Firstly, symbolic computations can take a long time, and numerical methods to differentiate a function can accumulate errors. Secondly, the convergence factor existing in the literature is a rough estimate. In this paper, we propose a higher-order root-finding method using only Taylor expansion of a function. It has lower computational complexity with explicit convergence factor, and can be used to numerically implement Householder's method. As an application, we apply the proposed method to compute pre-images of $q$-ary entropy functions, commonly seen in coding theory. Finally, we study basins of attraction using the proposed method and compare them with other root-finding methods.</description>

      <title>Multiprecision computations with Schwarz methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore and analyze the use of multiprecision arithmetic for several classes of Schwarz methods and preconditioners, where the approximate solution of the local problems is performed at a lower precision, i.e., with fewer digits of accuracy than in the underlying (double precision) computation. Conditions for the appropriate round-off criteria for the lower precision are presented. It is found experimentally that for the model problems about 5 digits of accuracy are sufficient to achieve the theoretical restrictions, and thus, single precision suffices for the local solves. Several numerical experiments illustrate the obtained results.</description>

      <title>Model reduction of parametric ordinary differential equations via autoencoders: structure-preserving latent dynamics and convergence analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a reduced-order modeling approach for nonlinear, parameter-dependent ordinary differential equations (ODE). Dimensionality reduction is achieved using nonlinear maps represented by autoencoders. The resulting low-dimensional ODE is then solved using standard integration in time schemes, and the high-dimensional solution is reconstructed from the low-dimensional one. We investigate the applicability of neural networks for constructing effective autoencoders with the property of reconstructing the input manifold with null representation error. We study the convergence of the reduced-order model to the high-fidelity one. Numerical experiments show the robustness and accuracy of our approach, highlighting its potential to accelerate complex dynamical simulations without sacrificing accuracy. Moreover, we examine how the reduction influences the stability properties of the reconstructed high-dimensional solution.</description>

      <title>Two ADI compact difference methods for variable-exponent diffusion wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study two-dimensional diffusion-wave equations with variable exponent, modeling mechanical diffusive wave propagation in viscoelastic media with spatially varying properties. We first transform the diffusion-wave model into an equivalent form via the convolution method. Two time discretization strategies are then applied to approximate each term in the transformed equation, yielding two fully discrete schemes based on a spatial compact finite difference method. To reduce computational cost, the alternating direction implicit (ADI) technique is employed. We prove that both ADI compact schemes are unconditionally stable and convergent. Under solution regularity, the first scheme achieves $\alpha(0)$-order accuracy in time and fourth-order accuracy in space, while the second scheme attains second-order accuracy in time and fourth-order accuracy in space. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical error estimates and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Explicit and Effectively Symmetric Schemes for Neural SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backpropagation through (neural) SDE solvers is traditionally approached in two ways: discretise-then-optimise, which offers accurate gradients but incurs prohibitive memory costs due to storing the full computational graph (even when mitigated by checkpointing); and optimise-then-discretise, which achieves constant memory cost by solving an auxiliary backward SDE, but suffers from slower evaluation and gradient approximation errors. Algebraically reversible solvers promise both memory efficiency and gradient accuracy, yet existing methods such as the Reversible Heun scheme are often unstable under complex models and large step sizes. We address these limitations by introducing a novel class of stable, near-reversible Runge--Kutta schemes for neural SDEs. These Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) schemes retain the benefits of reversible solvers while overcoming their instability, enabling memory-efficient training without severe restrictions on step size or model complexity. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the superior stability and reliability of our schemes, establishing them as a practical foundation for scalable and accurate training of neural SDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, scientific machine learning has transformed the development of mathematical and computational frameworks for analyzing, modeling, and predicting complex systems. From inverse problems to numerical PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion, model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and (iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable, theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and classical scientific modeling across disciplines.</description>

      <title>Extrapolating Phase-Field Simulations in Space and Time with Purely Convolutional Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase-field models of liquid metal dealloying (LMD) can resolve rich microstructural dynamics but become intractable for large domains or long time horizons. We present a conditionally parameterized, fully convolutional U-Net surrogate that generalizes far beyond its training window in both space and time. The design integrates convolutional self-attention and physics-aware padding, while parameter conditioning enables variable time-step skipping and adaptation to diverse alloy systems. Although trained only on short, small-scale simulations, the surrogate exploits the translational invariance of convolutions to extend predictions to much longer horizons than traditional solvers. It accurately reproduces key LMD physics, with relative errors typically under 5% within the training regime and below 10% when extrapolating to larger domains and later times. The method accelerates computations by up to 16,000 times, cutting weeks of simulation down to seconds, and marks an early step toward scalable, high-fidelity extrapolation of LMD phase-field models.</description>

      <title>Fast 3D Nanophotonic Inverse Design using Volume Integral Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing nanophotonic devices with minimal human intervention has gained substantial attention due to the complexity and precision required in modern optical technologies. While inverse design techniques typically rely on conventional electromagnetic solvers as forward models within optimization routines, the substantial electrical size and subwavelength characteristics of nanophotonic structures necessitate significantly accelerated simulation methods. In this work, we introduce a forward modeling approach based on the volume integral equation (VIE) formulation as an efficient alternative to traditional finite-difference (FD)-based methods. We derive the adjoint method tailored specifically for the VIE framework to efficiently compute optimization gradients and present a novel unidirectional mode excitation strategy compatible with VIE solvers. Comparative benchmarks demonstrate that our VIE-based approach provides multiple orders of magnitude improvement in computational efficiency over conventional FD methods in both time and frequency domains. To validate the practical utility of our approach, we successfully designed two representative nanophotonic components: a selective mode reflector and a 3 dB power splitter. Our results underscore the significant runtime advantages offered by the VIE-based framework, highlighting its promising role in accelerating inverse design workflows for next-generation nanophotonic devices.</description>

      <title>A Fourier/Modal-Spectral-Element Method for the Simulation of High-Reynolds Number Incompressible Stratified Flows in Domains with a Single Non-Periodic Direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the components of a high-order accurate Navier-Stokes solver designed to simulate high-Reynolds-number stratified flows. The proposed numerical model addresses some of the numerical and computational challenges that high-Reynolds-number simulations pose, facilitating the reproduction of stratified turbulent fluid dynamics typically observed in oceanic and atmospheric flows, namely the development of thin regions of high vertical shear, strongly layered turbulence at high Reynolds numbers and internal wave radiation. This Navier-Stokes solver utilizes a Fourier pseudo-spectral method in the horizontal direction and a modal spectral element discretization in the vertical. We adopt an implicit-explicit time discretization scheme that involves solving several one-dimensional Helmholtz problems at each time step. Static condensation and modal boundary-adapted basis functions result in an inexpensive algorithm based on solving many small tridiagonal systems. A series of benchmark studies is presented to demonstrate the robustness of the flow solver. These include two-dimensional and three-dimensional problems, concluding with a turbulent stratified wake generated by a sphere in linear stratification.</description>

      <title>A Reformulation of UVN-Flash for Multicomponent Two-Phase Systems with Application to CO2-rich Mixture Transport in Pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pipeline transport of dense-phase CO2-rich mixtures is a crucial component in carbon capture and storage (CCS). Accurate modeling requires coupling of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, especially during transient events such as depressurization. In this work, we present a unified framework for two-phase multicomponent transport in pipelines that integrates both aspects. Specifically, we employ the homogeneous equilibrium model (HEM) for modeling the transport of two-phase CO2-rich mixture, with thermodynamic closure provided by a Helmholtz energy-based equation of state. Phase equilibrium calculations are performed using UVN-flash, supplemented with a stability analysis procedure to detect phase separation and generate initial guesses for the phase-equilibrium calculations. Specifically, we introduce a novel tailored UVN-flash routine that aligns with the fluid dynamics formulation. This is achieved by introducing an alternative and better-scaled set of variables for the phase-equilibrium calculations. The proposed framework is applied to the depressurization of tanks and pipelines containing CO2-rich mixtures, demonstrating its effectiveness for CCS-relevant applications.</description>

      <title>Unbiased Parameter Estimation of Partially Observed Diffusions using Diffusion Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we consider the estimation of static parameters for partially observed diffusion processes with discrete-time observations over a fixed time interval. In particular, when one only has access to time-discretized solutions of the diffusions we build upon the works of \cite{ub_par,ub_grad} to devise a method that can estimate the parameters without time-discretization bias. We leverage an identity associated to the gradient of the log-likelihood associated to diffusion bridges, which has not been used before. Contrary to the afore mentioned methods, the diffusion coefficient can depend on the parameters and our approach facilitates the use of more efficient Markov chain sampling algorithms. We prove that our estimator is unbiased with finite variance and demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology in several examples.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Neural Networks for Windkessel Parameter Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel method for calibrating Windkessel (WK) parameters in a dimensionally reduced 1D-0D coupled blood flow model. To this end, we design a data-driven neural network (NN)trained on simulated blood pressures in the left brachial artery. Once trained, the NN emulates the pressure pulse waves across the entire simulated domain, i.e., over time, space and varying WK parameters, with negligible error and computational effort. To calibrate the WK parameters on a measured pulse wave, the NN is extended by dummy neurons and retrained only on these. The main objective of this work is to assess the effectiveness of the method in various scenarios -- particularly, when the exact measurement location is unknown or the data are affected by noise.</description>

      <title>The Stochastic Steepest Descent Method for Robust Optimization in Banach Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient methods have been a popular and powerful choice of optimization methods, aimed at minimizing functions. Their advantage lies in the fact that that one approximates the gradient as opposed to using the full Jacobian matrix. One research direction, related to this, has been on the application to infinite-dimensional problems, where one may naturally have a Hilbert space framework. However, there has been limited work done on considering this in a more general setup, such as where the natural framework is that of a Banach space. This article aims to address this by the introduction of a novel stochastic method, the stochastic steepest descent method (SSD). The SSD will follow the spirit of stochastic gradient descent, which utilizes Riesz representation to identify gradients and derivatives. Our choice for using such a method is that it naturally allows one to adopt a Banach space setting, for which recent applications have exploited the benefit of this, such as in PDE-constrained shape optimization. We provide a convergence theory related to this under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the performance of this method on a couple of numerical applications, namely a $p$-Laplacian and an optimal control problem. Our assumptions are verified in these applications.</description>

      <title>Two-level overlapping additive Schwarz preconditioner for training scientific machine learning applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel two-level overlapping additive Schwarz preconditioner for accelerating the training of scientific machine learning applications. The design of the proposed preconditioner is motivated by the nonlinear two-level overlapping additive Schwarz preconditioner. The neural network parameters are decomposed into groups (subdomains) with overlapping regions. In addition, the network's feed-forward structure is indirectly imposed through a novel subdomain-wise synchronization strategy and a coarse-level training step. Through a series of numerical experiments, which consider physics-informed neural networks and operator learning approaches, we demonstrate that the proposed two-level preconditioner significantly speeds up the convergence of the standard (LBFGS) optimizer while also yielding more accurate machine learning models. Moreover, the devised preconditioner is designed to take advantage of model-parallel computations, which can further reduce the training time.</description>

      <title>Frozen Gaussian Grid-point Correction For Semi-classical Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an efficient reconstruction algorithm named the frozen Gaussian grid-point correction (FGGC) for computing the Schr\"odinger equation in the semi-classical regime using the frozen Gaussian approximation (FGA). The FGA has demonstrated its superior efficiency in dealing with semi-classical problems and high-frequency wave propagations. However, reconstructing the wave function from a large number of Gaussian wave-packets is typically computationally intensive. This difficulty arises because these wave-packets propagate along the FGA trajectories to non-grid positions, making the application of the fast Fourier transform infeasible. In this work, we introduce the concept of ``on-grid correction'' and derive the formulas for the least squares approximation of Gaussian wave-packets, and also provide a detailed process of the FGGC algorithm. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that the error introduced by the least squares approximation on each Gaussian wave-packet is independent of the semi-classical parameter $\varepsilon$. Numerical experiments show that the FGGC algorithm can significantly improve reconstruction efficiency while introducing only negligible error, making it a powerful tool for solving the semi-classical Schr\"odinger equation, especially in applications requiring both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Isogeometric Topology Optimization Based on Topological Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topology optimization is a valuable tool in engineering, facilitating the design of optimized structures. However, topological changes often require a remeshing step, which can become challenging. In this work, we propose an isogeometric approach to topology optimization driven by topological derivatives. The combination of a level-set method together with an immersed isogeometric framework allows seamless geometry updates without the necessity of remeshing. At the same time, topological derivatives provide topological modifications without the need to define initial holes [7]. We investigate the influence of higher-degree basis functions in both the level-set representation and the approximation of the solution. Two numerical examples demonstrate the proposed approach, showing that employing higher-degree basis functions for approximating the solution improves accuracy, while linear basis functions remain sufficient for the level-set function representation.</description>

      <title>Expressive Power of Deep Networks on Manifolds: Simultaneous Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09362v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key challenge in scientific machine learning is solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on complex domains, where the curved geometry complicates the approximation of functions and their derivatives required by differential operators. This paper establishes the first simultaneous approximation theory for deep neural networks on manifolds. We prove that a constant-depth $\mathrm{ReLU}^{k-1}$ network with bounded weights--a property that plays a crucial role in controlling generalization error--can approximate any function in the Sobolev space $\mathcal{W}_p^{k}(\mathcal{M}^d)$ to an error of $\varepsilon$ in the $\mathcal{W}_p^{s}(\mathcal{M}^d)$ norm, for $k\geq 3$ and $s&lt;k$, using $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-d/(k-s)})$ nonzero parameters, a rate that overcomes the curse of dimensionality by depending only on the intrinsic dimension $d$. These results readily extend to functions in H\"older-Zygmund spaces. We complement this result with a matching lower bound, proving our construction is nearly optimal by showing the required number of parameters matches up to a logarithmic factor. Our proof of the lower bound introduces novel estimates for the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension and pseudo-dimension of the network's high-order derivative classes. These complexity bounds provide a theoretical cornerstone for learning PDEs on manifolds involving derivatives. Our analysis reveals that the network architecture leverages a sparse structure to efficiently exploit the manifold's low-dimensional geometry. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Weak Adversarial Neural Pushforward Mappings for Fokker-Planck Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for solving Fokker-Planck equations by learning neural samplers via a weak adversarial framework. We represent the solution distribution through a neural pushforward map, bypassing the limitations of density-based methods. A key innovation is our use of computationally efficient plane-wave test functions, whose derivatives are explicitly computed -- a treatment distinct from prior work. This approach handles distributions without densities and naturally enforces probability conservation.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Simulation of a Fluid-Heat System in a Thin, Rough Layer in Contact With a Solid Bulk Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02150v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effective coupling between heat and fluid dynamics within a thin fluid layer in contact with a solid structure via a rough surface. Moreover, the opposing vertical surfaces of the thin layer are in relative motion. This setup is particularly relevant to grinding processes, where cooling lubricants interact with the rough surface of a rotating grinding wheel. The resulting model is non-linearly coupled through(i) temperature-dependent viscosity and (ii) convective heat transport. The underlying geometry is highly heterogeneous due to the thin, rough surface characterized by a small parameter representing both the height of the layer and the periodicity of the roughness. We analyze this non-linear system for existence, uniqueness, and energy estimates and study the limit behavior within the framework of two-scale convergence in thin domains. In this limit, we derive an effective interface model in 3D (a line in 2D) for the heat and fluid interactions inside the fluid. We implement the system numerically and validate the limit problem through direct comparison with the micromodel. Additionally, we investigate the influence of the temperature-dependent viscosity and various geometrical configurations via simulation experiments. The corresponding numerical code is freely available on GitHub.</description>
