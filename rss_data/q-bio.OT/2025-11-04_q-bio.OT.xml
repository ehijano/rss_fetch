      <title>Pharmacovigilance Analysis of Drug-Induced Rhabdomyolysis Based on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aimed to systematically identify and quantify risks for drug-induced rhabdomyolysis (DIR) using real-world data and to propose an evidence-based risk mitigation framework. We conducted a retrospective pharmacovigilance study using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from Q1 2005 to Q1 2025. A two-stage analysis involved initial signal detection using the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), followed by a LASSO-optimized multivariate logistic regression to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for 54 target drugs while controlling for confounders. Our analysis confirmed potent DIR risks for known agents, such as gemfibrozil (aOR 173.67) and statins (lovastatin aOR 97.20, simvastatin aOR 85.12). Crucially, we identified strong, novel risk signals for drugs currently lacking warnings, most notably levetiracetam (aOR 11.02) and donepezil (aOR 8.90). A significant "labeling gap" was quantified: 61.1% of drugs with a statistically significant DIR risk lack a corresponding warning in U.S. drug labels. We subsequently developed a three-tiered risk stratification model. The proposed framework provides a data-driven foundation for developing tiered clinical decision support systems, enhancing prescribing safety, and guiding future regulatory action to bridge the identified evidence-to-labeling gap.</description>

      <title>Theoretical morphology of a cichlid according to the approach of Systemic Morphometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyzed the body structure of the Blackstripe Cichlid Vieja fenestrata (G\"unther, 1860), a species with highly phenotypic variability, by the Systemics Morphometrics Methodology, previously proposed by one of the authors. From this perspective and considering the properties of its bauplan, we describe the expected morphometrics variability of this species. The Infinitesimal Change Rates (IChR) were obtained deriving the allometric equations that relate pairs of morphometric variables, and they demonstrated that the species' growth is continuous throughout its ontogeny. For some of the morphometric variables, relative growth trajectories were traced and their relationship with the IChR showed. Also, the observed and theoretical Systemic Phenotypical Spaces (SPS) were described by using three dimensional graphs and Mahalanobis Quadratic Distances (MQD). This was an alternate approach that allowed the analysis of the phenotypical spaces' properties in a wider, more objective, and analytical manner. We conclude that the morphometric variability observed in V. fenestrata agrees with the variability expected in the times and places sampled, although there are still some issues to be explained. We propose to incorporate the structural variance into the classical phenotypic variance equation, and consider the equality: phenotypic variance = SPS theoretical, (the phenotypic variance is equal to the theoretical Systemic Phenotypic Space), as a point of convergence between Quantitative Genetics and Systemic Morphometry.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Scientific Collaboration in Biomedical LLM Research: Dynamics, Institutional Participation, and Resource Disparities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly transforming biomedical discovery and clinical innovation, yet their impact extends far beyond algorithmic revolution-LLMs are restructuring how scientific collaboration occurs, who participates, and how resources shape innovation. Despite this profound transformation, how this rapid technological shift is reshaping the structure and equity of scientific collaboration in biomedical LLM research remains largely unknown. By analyzing 5,674 LLM-related biomedical publications from PubMed, we examine how collaboration diversity evolves over time, identify institutions and disciplines that anchor and bridge collaboration networks, and assess how resource disparities underpin research performance. We find that collaboration diversity has grown steadily, with a decreasing share of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence authors, suggesting that LLMs are lowering technical barriers for biomedical investigators. Network analysis reveals central institutions, including Stanford University and Harvard Medical School, and bridging disciplines such as Medicine and Computer Science that anchor collaborations in this field. Furthermore, biomedical research resources are strongly linked to research performance, with high-performing resource-constrained institutions exhibiting larger collaboration volume with the top 1% most connected institutions in the network. Together, these findings reveal a complex landscape, where democratizing trends coexist with a persistent, resource-driven hierarchy, highlighting the critical role of strategic collaboration in this evolving field.</description>

      <title>How causal perspectives can inform neuroscience data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10710v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, considerable strides have been made in advancing neuroscientific techniques, yet challenges remain in attributing causality to observed associations. This review addresses a fundamental issue in observational neuroscience studies and advocates for incorporating causal inference frameworks into standard practice. We systematically introduce necessary definitions and concepts, emphasizing how causal assumptions underlie statistical analyses even when not explicitly stated. Through a running example on sleep quality and white matter integrity, we illustrate how persistent challenges, including confounding and selection biases, can be conceptualized and addressed using causal frameworks. We demonstrate practical approaches for making assumption violations transparent through hands-on examples: supplementary case studies using multi-site harmonization and head motion exclusion procedures provide step-by-step diagnostic techniques for checking covariate overlap and identifying selection bias through exclusion pattern analysis. We explore how these causal perspectives can inform both experimental design and analytical choices, particularly for observational studies where traditional randomization is infeasible. Together, we believe this framework offers concrete tools for strengthening causal interpretations and inspiring more robust approaches to problems in neuroscience.</description>

      <title>On the distributions of restriction sites in human and pangolin sarbecoviruses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since early 2020, several theories have suggested that a distribution of restriction endonuclease recognition sites in the SARS-CoV-2 genome indicates a synthetic origin. The most influential of these, a 2022 preprint by Bruttel et al. claimed: "The BsaI/BsmBI restriction map of SARS-CoV-2 is unlike any wild-type coronavirus, and it is unlikely to evolve from its closest relatives." To test this, I reanalyzed the same 11 contested sites using an expanded set of sarbecovirus genomes, including bat coronaviruses published after the Bruttel et al. preprint. For each site, I identified the bat coronaviruses most closely matching SARS-CoV-2 in the surrounding sequences, excluding the sites themselves. The Bruttel et al. hypothesis predicts that these closely related viruses should differ from SARS-CoV-2 at many of the contested sites if restriction sites had been artificially introduced or removed. Contrary to this prediction, one or more of the most closely related bat coronaviruses are identical to SARS-CoV-2 at all 11 sites. Equivalent "synthetic fingerprints" were identified in natural pangolin sarbecoviruses. Finally, I conducted a re-analysis of the dataset that Bruttel et al. used to test where the SARS-CoV-2 BsaI/BsmBI restriction map was significantly more "evenly spaced" than expected in a natural genome. I found technical and conceptual errors that resulted in Bruttel et al. reporting that their chosen metric was 0.07% likely to occur by chance rather than 4.2%, reducing the apparent rarity 60-fold. Using a more informative metric, I tested whether restriction sites in SARS-CoV-2 or two pangolin sarbecoviruses were significantly more evenly spaced than expected and found they were not. These results show that the restriction maps of SARS-CoV-2 and related pangolin viruses are unremarkable in the context of related bat coronaviruses.</description>
