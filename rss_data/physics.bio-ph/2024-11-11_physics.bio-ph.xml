      <title>Exact solutions of the harmonically confined Vicsek model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrete time Vicsek model confined by a harmonic potential explains many aspects of swarm formation in insects. We have found exact solutions of this model without alignment noise in two or three dimensions. They are periodic or quasiperiodic (invariant circle) solutions with positions on a circular orbit or on several concentric orbits and exist for quantized values of the confinement. There are period 2 and period 4 solutions on a line for a range of confinement strengths and period 4 solutions on a rhombus. These solutions may have polarization one, although there are partially ordered period 4 solutions and totally disordered (zero polarization) period 2 solutions. We have explored the linear stability of the exact solutions in two dimensions using the Floquet theorem and verified the stability assignements by direct numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Time in a bottle. A psychophysics study of human time perception through aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time perception is crucial for a coherent human experience. As life progresses, our perception of the passage of time becomes increasingly non-uniform, often feeling as though it accelerates with age. While various causes for this phenomenon have been theorized, a comprehensive mathematical and theoretical framework remains underexplored. This study aims to elucidate the mechanisms behind perceived time dilation by integrating classical and revised psychophysical theorems with a novel mathematical approach. Utilizing Weber-Fechner laws as foundational elements, we develop a model that transitions from exponential to logarithmic functions to represent changes in time perception across the human lifespan. Our results indicate that the perception of time shifts significantly around the age of mental maturity, aligning with a proposed inversion point where sensitivity to temporal stimuli decreases, eventually plateauing out at a constant rate. This model not only explains the underlying causes of time perception changes but also provides analytical values to quantify this acceleration. These findings offer valuable insights into the cognitive and neurological processes influencing how we experience time as we go through life.</description>

      <title>Bending Elasticity of the reversible Freely Jointed Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The freely jointed chain model with reversible hinges (rFJC) is the simplest theoretical model that captures reversible transitions of the local bending stiffness along the polymer chain backbone, e.g. helix-coil-type of local conformational changes or changes due to the binding/unbinding of ligands). In this work, we analyze the bending fluctuations and the bending response of a grafted rFJC in the Gibbs (fixed-force) ensemble. We obtain a recursion relation for the partition function of the grafted rFJC under bending force, which allows, in principle, exact-numerical calculation of the behavior of a rFJC of arbitrary size. In contrast to stretching, we show that under sufficiently stiff conditions, the differential bending compliance and the mean fraction of closed hinges are non-monotonic functions of the force. We also obtain the persistence length $L_p$ of the rFJC, the moments $\langle R^2 \rangle$ (mean-square end-to-end distance), and $\langle z^2 \rangle$ (mean-square transverse deflection) for the discrete chain and take the continuum limit. The tangent vector auto-correlation decays exponentially, as in the wormlike chain model (WLC). Remarkably, the expression of $\langle R^2 \rangle$ as a function of the contour length $L$ becomes the same as that in the WLC. In the thermodynamic limit, we have calculated the exact bending response analytically. As expected, for $L\gg L_p$, the boundary conditions do not matter, and the bending becomes equivalent to stretching. In contrast, for $L_p\gg L$, we have shown the non-monotonicity of the bending response (the compliance and mean fraction of closed hinges).</description>

      <title>Smart navigation through a rotating barrier: Deep reinforcement learning with application to size-based separation of active microagents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ deep reinforcement learning methods to investigate shortest-time navigation strategies for smart active Brownian particles (agents) that self-propel through a rotating, localized potential barrier in an otherwise static and viscous fluid background. The particle motion is prescribed to begin from a specified start point and terminate at a specified destination point. The potential barrier is modeled as a repulsive Gaussian potential with a finite range that rotates with given angular velocities around a fixed center within the plane of motion. We use an advantage actor-critic approach to train the agents and demonstrate that, by leveraging this approach, the rotating potential can be utilized for size-based sorting and separation of the agents. In other words, agents of different (hydrodynamic) radii reach the end-point at sufficiently well-separated times, enabling their separation. The efficiency of particle separation in this context is discussed using specific criteria. We also study the effect of rotational Brownian noise on the quality of the proposed size-based sorting mechanism. Additionally, we demonstrate how the use of noise-induced training can enhance this mechanism in a noisy background within the range of parameters explored in our work. Reinforcement learning in the context of active particles thus offers promising avenues to unravel optimal navigation strategies within complex environments, with potential applications that can be utilized in microfluidic settings.</description>

      <title>Predicting Resistive Pulse Signatures in Nanopores by Accurately Modeling Access Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resistive pulse sensing has been widely used to characterize and count single particles in solution moving through channels under an electric bias, with nanoscale pores more recently providing enough spatial resolution for nucleic acid sequencing at the single-molecule level. At its core, this technique relies on measuring the drop in ionic current through the pore induced by the passage of a molecule and, through conductance models, translating the blockage signal to molecular dimensions. However, there exists no model considering the resistive contributions of the pore exterior, i.e. the access regions, when obstructed by a molecule. This is becoming increasingly important for low aspect ratio pores, with the advent of 2D materials and ultrathin membranes. In this work, a general method by which to model the resistance of the access regions of a pore in the presence of an insulating obstruction is presented. Thin oblate spheroidal slices are used to partition access regions and infer their conductance when blocked by differently shaped objects. We show that our model accurately estimates the blocked-state conductance of 2D and finite-length pores as a function of the distance from the pore in the presence of simple obstructions geometries (e.g. cylindrical and spherical objects) or complex structures (i.e. sequence of simple obstruction sub-units). The model is further shown to capture off-axis effects by predicting deeper blockages for obstructions offset from the pore's central axis. A web-based tool is created to predict the electrical signatures of a wide range of molecule geometries translocating through differently shaped pores. The introduced model will help guide experimental designs and thus presents a straightforward way to extend the quantification of the resistive pulse technique at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Effective and efficient modeling of the hydrodynamics for bacterial flagella</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06093v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic interactions among bacterial cell bodies, flagella, and surrounding boundaries are essential for understanding bacterial motility in complex environments. In this study, we demonstrate that each slender flagellum can be modeled as a series of spheres, and that the interactions between these spheres can be accurately characterized using a resistance matrix. This approach allows us to effectively and efficiently evaluate the propulsive effects of the flagella. Notably, our investigation into bacterial motility near a colloidal sphere reveals significant discrepancies between results derived from the twin multipole moment and those obtained through resistive force theory. Consequently, neglecting the hydrodynamic interactions among cell bodies, flagella, and colloidal spheres may lead to substantial inaccuracies. Our model simplifies bacteria into a series of spheres, making it well-suited for examining bacterial motility near spherical boundaries, as well as the nonlinear deformation dynamics of elastic flagella.</description>
