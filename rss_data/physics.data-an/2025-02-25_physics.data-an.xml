      <title>A Hybrid Neural Network for High-Throughput Attosecond Resolution Single-shot X-ray Pulse Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As scientific facilities transition toward high-throughput, data-intensive experiments, there is a growing need for real-time computing at the edge to support autonomous decision-making and minimize data transmission bottlenecks. Department of Energy (DOE) initiatives emphasize the development of heterogeneous computing architectures that integrate machine learning (ML) models with specialized hardware such as FPGAs, GPUs, and embedded systems to meet the demands of next-generation experiments. These advances are critical for facilities such as X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs), where high-repetition-rate experiments produce terabyte-scale datasets, requiring real-time analysis and control.
  To address this challenge, we introduce DCIFR, a deep learning framework optimized for edge processing and high-speed X-ray diagnostics at SLAC's Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). DCIFR leverages a hybrid neural architecture, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks, and residual neural networks (ResNets) to denoise sinograms, classify X-ray sub-spikes, and extract phase separation with attosecond precision. The model achieves a phase extraction accuracy of 0.04652 radians (29.6 attoseconds at 1.2 um streaking wavelength) with inference latencies of 168.3 us and throughput exceeding 10kHz. Designed for deployment on heterogeneous architectures, DCIFR reduces computational overhead and supports future AI-driven feedback loops for ultrafast experiments. This work demonstrates the potential of edge AI and hardware acceleration to drive scalable, autonomous data analysis in next-generation DOE scientific facilities.</description>

      <title>Realization of discretized response in rare-earth vanadates accessed by AC susceptibility and magnetocaloric methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report presents a new technique to probe the quantitative dynamical response of the magnetic field induced heating/cooling process in rare-earth vanadium materials. The approach combines AC susceptibility and AC caloric measurements to reveal the intrinsic timescale associated with the magnetic relaxation process of rare-earth ions at low temperatures. Utilizing the well-known crystal field effect in YbVO4, we prove and demonstrate a discretized thermal analysis through a common spin-lattice relaxation phenomenon. The demonstration experiment presented in this study provides a general approach to quantitatively address multiple measured quantities in one unified discretized thermal circuit analysis. It can be extended to study other magnetic, dielectric, and elastic materials exhibiting a complex response to an external driving field in the presence of intrinsic interactions and fluctuations, particularly when an energy dissipation process is within an accessible frequency regime.</description>

      <title>Real-time Monitoring of Economic Shocks using Company Websites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the effects of economic shocks on firms is critical for analyzing economic growth and resilience. We introduce a Web-Based Affectedness Indicator (WAI), a general-purpose tool for real-time monitoring of economic disruptions across diverse contexts. By leveraging Large Language Model (LLM) assisted classification and information extraction on texts from over five million company websites, WAI quantifies the degree and nature of firms' responses to external shocks. Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a specific application, we show that WAI is highly correlated with pandemic containment measures and reliably predicts firm performance. Unlike traditional data sources, WAI provides timely firm-level information across industries and geographies worldwide that would otherwise be unavailable due to institutional and data availability constraints. This methodology offers significant potential for monitoring and mitigating the impact of technological, political, financial, health or environmental crises, and represents a transformative tool for adaptive policy-making and economic resilience.</description>

      <title>Dominant misconceptions and alluvial flows between Engineering and Physical Science students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12083v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we assess the comprehension of physics concepts by Physical Science and Engineering students enrolled in their first semester at the University of Johannesburg (UJ), South Africa ($2022$). We employ different graphical measures to explore similarities and differences using the results of both pre- and post-test data from the Force Concept Inventory assessment tool, from which we calculate dominant misconceptions (DMs) and gains. We also use alluvial diagrams to track the choices made by these two groups of students from pre- to post-test stages. In our analysis, we find that DM results indicate that participating Engineering students outperformed Physical Science students on average, however, the same types of normalised DMs persist at the post-test level. We call these DMs "persistent misconceptions." This is very useful when tracking persistent misconceptions, where when using repeated measures and alluvial diagrams with smaller groups of students, we find that Physical Science students tend to make more chaotic choices.</description>

      <title>Analyzing black-hole ringdowns II: data conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series data from observations of black hole ringdown gravitational waves are often analyzed in the time domain by using damped sinusoid models with acyclic boundary conditions. Data conditioning operations, including downsampling, filtering, and the choice of data segment duration, reduce the computational cost of such analyses and can improve numerical stability. Here we analyze simulated damped sinsuoid signals to illustrate how data conditioning operations, if not carefully applied, can undesirably alter the analysis' posterior distributions. We discuss how currently implemented downsampling and filtering methods, if applied too aggressively, can introduce systematic errors and skew tests of general relativity. These issues arise because current downsampling and filtering methods do not operate identically on the data and model. Alternative downsampling and filtering methods which identically operate on the data and model may be achievable, but we argue that the current operations can still be implemented safely. We also show that our preferred anti-alias filtering technique, which has an instantaneous frequency-domain response at its roll-off frequency, preserves the structure of posterior distributions better than other commonly used filters with transient frequency-domain responses. Lastly, we highlight that exceptionally long data segments may need to be analyzed in cases where thin lines in the noise power spectral density overlap with central signal frequencies. Our findings may be broadly applicable to any analysis of truncated time domain data with acyclic boundary conditions.</description>
