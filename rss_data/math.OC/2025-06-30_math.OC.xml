      <title>Fast convex optimization via inertial systems with asymptotic vanishing viscous and Hessian-driven damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the convergence rate of a family of inertial algorithms, which can be obtained by discretization of an inertial system combining asymptotic vanishing viscous and Hessian-driven damping. We establish a fast sublinear convergence rate in case the objective function is convex and satisfies Polyak-\L ojasiewicz inequality. We also establish a linear convergence rate for smooth strongly convex functions. The results can provide more insights into the convergence property of Nesterov's accelerated gradient method.</description>

      <title>Multi-to one-dimensional screening and semi-discrete optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the monopolist's screening problem with a multi-dimensional distribution of consumers and a one-dimensional space of goods. We establish general conditions under which solutions satisfy a structural condition known as nestedness, which greatly simplifies their analysis and characterization. Under these assumptions, we go on to develop a general method to solve the problem, either in closed form or with relatively simple numerical computations, and illustrate it with examples. These results are established both when the monopolist has access to only a discrete subset of the one-dimensional space of products, as well as when the entire continuum is available. In the former case, we also establish a uniqueness result.</description>

      <title>A Model-Based Derivative-Free Optimization Algorithm for Partially Separable Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose UPOQA, a derivative-free optimization algorithm for partially separable unconstrained problems, leveraging quadratic interpolation and a structured trust-region framework. By decomposing the objective into element functions, UPOQA constructs underdetermined element models and solves subproblems efficiently via a modified projected gradient method. Innovations include an approximate projection operator for structured trust regions, improved management of elemental radii and models, a starting point search mechanism, and support for hybrid black-white-box optimization, etc. Numerical experiments on 85 CUTEst problems demonstrate that UPOQA can significantly reduce the number of function evaluations. To quantify the impact of exploiting partial separability, we introduce the speed-up profile to further evaluate the acceleration effect. Results show that the acceleration benefits of UPOQA are marginal in low-precision scenarios but become more pronounced in high-precision scenarios. Applications to quantum variational problems further validate its practical utility.</description>

      <title>Iterative Methods for the Projected Solutions of Quasi-equilibrium Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aussel et al. (J Optim Theory Appl 170 818-837 2016) introduced the concept of projected solutions for the quasi-variational inequalities with a non-self constraint map, that is, the case where the constraint map may take values outside the feasible set. This paper presents two iterative methods to determine the projected solutions for quasi-equilibrium problems (QEP). We prove the convergence of the sequence generated by iterative methods to a projected solution of the QEP under some suitable assumptions. Some encouraging numerical experiments are presented to show the performance of the proposed methods. As an application, we apply the proposed algorithms to solve an electricity market model.</description>

      <title>A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Some Singular Stochastic Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a continuous-time reinforcement learning framework for a class of singular stochastic control problems without entropy regularization. The optimal singular control is characterized as the optimal singular control law, which is a pair of regions of time and the augmented states. The goal of learning is to identify such an optimal region via the trial-and-error procedure. In this context, we generalize the existing policy evaluation theories with regular controls to learn our optimal singular control law and develop a policy improvement theorem via the region iteration. To facilitate the model-free policy iteration procedure, we further introduce the zero-order and first-order q-functions arising from singular control problems and establish the martingale characterization for the pair of q-functions together with the value function. Based on our theoretical findings, some q-learning algorithms are devised accordingly and a numerical example based on simulation experiment is presented.</description>

      <title>Memory-Type Null Controllability of Heat Equations with Delay Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is devoted to the study of null controllability for evolution equations that incorporate both memory and delay effects. The problem is particularly challenging due to the presence of memory integrals and delayed states, which necessitate strengthening the classical controllability requirement to ensure complete rest at the final time. To address this, we adopt the notion of Delay and memory-type null controllability, which demands the vanishing of the state, the accumulated memory term, and the influence of delay at the terminal time. Utilizing duality arguments, we reduce the controllability analysis to proving suitable observability inequalities for the corresponding adjoint system. We begin with finite-dimensional systems and establish rank-type conditions characterizing controllability. These insights are then extended to parabolic partial differential equations with delay and memory terms. By leveraging Carleman estimates and time-dependent control strategies, we derive sufficient conditions under which controllability can be achieved. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical results and illustrate the critical role of moving control regions in neutralizing the effects of memory and delay.</description>

      <title>Phase field approximation for Plateau's problem: a curve geodesic distance penalty approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on a phase field approximation of Plateau's problem. Inspired by Reifenberg's point of view, we introduce a model that combines the Ambrosio-Torterelli energy with a geodesic distance term, which can be considered as a generalization of the approach developed by Bonnivard, Lemenant and Santambrogio to approximate solutions to Steiner's problem. First, we present a Gamma-convergence analysis of this model in the simple case of a single curve located on the edge of a cylinder. In a numerical section, we detail the numerical optimisation schemes used to minimize this energy for numerous examples, for which good approximations of solutions to Plateau's problem are found.</description>

      <title>Second-order methods for provably escaping strict saddle points in composite nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces two second-order methods designed to provably avoid saddle points in composite nonconvex optimization problems: (i) a nonsmooth trust-region method and (ii) a curvilinear linesearch method. These developments are grounded in the forward-backward envelope (FBE), for which we analyze the local second-order differentiability around critical points and establish a novel equivalence between its second-order stationary points and those of the original objective. We show that the proposed algorithms converge to second-order stationary points of the FBE under a mild local smoothness condition on the proximal mapping of the nonsmooth term. Notably, for \( \C^2 \)-partly smooth functions, this condition holds under a standard strict complementarity assumption. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first second-order algorithms that provably escape nonsmooth strict saddle points of composite nonconvex optimization, regardless of the initialization. Our preliminary numerical experiments show promising performance of the developed methods, validating our theoretical foundations.</description>

      <title>Regularized Extragradient Methods for Solving Equilibrium Problems on Hadamard Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing two distinct types of regularization terms, we propose two regularized extragradient methods for solving equilibrium problems on Hadamard manifolds. The sequences generated by these extragradient algorithms converge to a solution of the equilibrium problem without requiring the Lipschitz continuity of the bifunction or imposing additional conditions on the parameters. We establish convergence results for both algorithms and derive global error bounds along with $R$-linear convergence rates in cases where the bifunction is strongly pseudomonotone. Finally, we present numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</description>

      <title>Augmented Lagrangian methods for infeasible convex optimization problems and diverging proximal-point algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the convergence behavior of augmented Lagrangian methods (ALMs) when applied to convex optimization problems that may be infeasible. ALMs are a popular class of algorithms for solving constrained optimization problems. We establish progressively stronger convergence results, ranging from basic sequence convergence to precise convergence rates, under a hierarchy of assumptions. In particular, we demonstrate that, under mild assumptions, the sequences of iterates generated by ALMs converge to solutions of the ``closest feasible problem''.
  This study leverages the classical relationship between ALMs and the proximal-point algorithm applied to the dual problem. A key technical contribution is a set of concise results on the behavior of the proximal-point algorithm when applied to functions that may not have minimizers. These results pertain to its convergence in terms of its subgradients and of the values of the convex conjugate.</description>

      <title>Modification of a Numerical Method Using FIR Filters in a Time-dependent SIR Model for COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Authors Yi-Cheng Chen, Ping-En Lu, Cheng-Shang Chang, and Tzu-Hsuan Liu use the Finite Impulse Response (FIR) linear system filtering method to track and predict the number of people infected and recovered from COVID-19, in a pandemic context in which there was still no vaccine and the only way to avoid contagion was isolation. To estimate the coefficients of these FIR filters, Chen et al. used machine learning methods through a classical optimization problem with regularization (ridge regression). These estimated coefficients are called ridge coefficients. The epidemic mathematical model adopted by these researchers to formulate the FIR filters is the time-dependent discrete SIR. In this paper, we propose a small modification to the algorithm of Chen et al. to obtain the ridge coefficients. We then used this modified algorithm to track and predict the number of people infected and recovered from COVID-19 in the state of Minas Gerais/Brazil, within a prediction window, during the initial period of the pandemic. We also compare the predicted data with the respective real data to check how good the approximation is. In the modified algorithm, we set values for the FIR filter orders and for the regularization parameters, both different from the respective values defined by Chen et al. in their algorithm. In this context, the numerical results obtained by the modified algorithm in some simulations present better approximation errors compared to the respective approximation errors presented by the algorithm of Chen et al.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Formula for Vertex Enumeration in the CUT(n) Polytope via Probabilistic Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cut polytope $\operatorname{CUT}(n)$, defined as the convex hull of cut vectors in the complete graph $K_n$, is a central object in combinatorial optimization, with applications ranging from max-cut problems to correlation analysis. Building on a probabilistic interpretation via agreement probabilities among symmetric Bernoulli random variables, we derive an explicit closed-form formula for enumerating the vertices of the related polytope $1$-$\operatorname{CUT}(n)$. Our approach is based on a natural binary encoding of cut vectors and introduces the alternating cycle function, a map that generates integer sequences with palindromic and recursive structure. This encoding directly captures the vertex structure and reveals that the scaled encoded vertices, perhaps unexpectedly, exhibit an almost-linear behaviour. This work provides the first explicit vertex enumeration formula for this classical polytope family.</description>

      <title>Laser Scan Path Design for Controlled Microstructure in Additive Manufacturing with Integrated Reduced-Order Phase-Field Modeling and Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is a widely recognized additive manufacturing technology for producing intricate metal components with exceptional accuracy. A key challenge in L-PBF is the formation of complex microstructures affecting product quality. We propose a physics-guided, machine-learning approach to optimize scan paths for desired microstructure outcomes, such as equiaxed grains. We utilized a phase-field method (PFM) to model crystalline grain structure evolution. To reduce computational costs, we trained a surrogate machine learning model, a 3D U-Net convolutional neural network, using single-track phase-field simulations with various laser powers to predict crystalline grain orientations based on initial microstructure and thermal history. We investigated three scanning strategies across various hatch spacings within a square domain, achieving a two-orders-of-magnitude speedup using the surrogate model. To reduce trial and error in designing laser scan toolpaths, we used deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to generate optimized scan paths for target microstructure. Results from three cases demonstrate the DRL approach's effectiveness. We integrated the surrogate 3D U-Net model into our DRL environment to accelerate the reinforcement learning training process. The reward function minimizes both aspect ratio and grain volume of the predicted microstructure from the agent's scan path. The reinforcement learning algorithm was benchmarked against conventional zigzag approach for smaller and larger domains, showing machine learning methods' potential to enhance microstructure control and computational efficiency in L-PBF optimization.</description>

      <title>Parameter Identifiability of Linear-Compartmental Mammillary Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear compartmental models are a widely used tool for analyzing systems arising in biology, medicine, and more. In such settings, it is essential to know whether model parameters can be recovered from experimental data. This is the identifiability problem. For a class of linear compartmental models with one input and one output, namely, those for which the underlying graph is a bidirected tree, Bortner et al. completely characterized which such models are structurally identifiability, which means that every parameter is generically locally identifiable. Here, we delve deeper, by examining which individual parameters are locally versus globally identifiable. Specifically, we analyze mammillary models, which consist of one central compartment which is connected to all other (peripheral) compartments. For these models, which fall into five infinite families, we determine which individual parameters are locally versus globally identifiable, and we give formulas for some of the globally identifiable parameters in terms of the coefficients of input-output equations. Our proofs rely on a combinatorial formula due to Bortner et al. for these coefficients.</description>

      <title>An Effective Two-Phase Genetic Algorithm for Solving the Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note presents a simple and effective variation of genetic algorithm (GA) for solving RCPSP, denoted as 2-Phase Genetic Algorithm (2PGA). The 2PGA implements GA parent selection in two phases: Phase-1 includes the best current solutions in the parent pool, and Phase-2 excludes the best current solutions from the parent pool. The 2PGA carries out the GA evolution by alternating the two phases iteratively. In exploring a solution space, the Phase-1 emphasizes intensification in current neighborhood, while the Phase-2 emphasizes diversification to escape local traps. The 2PGA was tested on the standard benchmark problems in PSPLIB, the results have shown that the algorithm is effective and has improved some of the best heuristic solutions.</description>

      <title>Linear-Quadratic Discrete-Time Dynamic Games with Unknown Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering linear-quadratic discrete-time games with unknown input/output/state (i/o/s) dynamics and state, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of feedback Nash equilibria (FNE) in the finite-horizon game, based entirely on offline input/output data. We prove that the finite-horizon unknown-dynamics game and its corresponding known-dynamics game have the same FNEs, and provide detailed relationships between their respective FNE matrices. To simplify the computation of FNEs, we provide an invertibility condition and a corresponding algorithm that computes one FNE by solving a finite number of linear equation systems using offline data. For the infinite-horizon unknown-dynamics game, limited offline data restricts players to computing optimal strategies only over a finite horizon. We prove that the finite-horizon strategy ``watching $T$ steps into the future and moving one step now,'' which is commonly used in classical optimal control, exhibits convergence in both the FNE matrices and the total costs in the infinite-horizon unknown-dynamics game, and further provide an analysis of the convergence rate of the total cost. The corresponding algorithm for the infinite-horizon game is proposed and its efficacy is demonstrated through a non-scalar numerical example.</description>

      <title>RM-Dijkstra: A surface optimal path planning algorithm based on Riemannian metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dijkstra algorithm is a classic path planning method, which operates in a discrete graph space to determine the shortest path from a specified source point to a target node or all other nodes based on non-negative edge weights. Numerous studies have focused on the Dijkstra algorithm due to its potential application. However, its application in surface path planning for mobile robots remains largely unexplored. In this letter, a surface optimal path planning algorithm called RM-Dijkstra is proposed, which is based on Riemannian metric model. By constructing a new Riemannian metric on the 2D projection plane, the surface optimal path planning problem is therefore transformed into a geometric problem on the 2D plane with new Riemannian metric. Induced by the standard Euclidean metric on surface, the constructed new metric reflects environmental information of the robot and ensures that the projection map is an isometric immersion. By conducting a series of simulation tests, the experimental results demonstrate that the RM-Dijkstra algorithm not only effectively solves the optimal path planning problem on surfaces, but also outperforms traditional path planning algorithms in terms of path accuracy and smoothness, particularly in complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>Relaxation enhancement by controlling incompressible fluid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a PDE-controllability based approach to the enhancement of diffusive mixing for passive scalar fields. Unlike in the existing literature, our relaxation enhancing fields are not prescribed $\textit{ab initio}$ at every time and at every point of the spatial domain. Instead, we prove that time-dependent relaxation enhancing vector fields can be obtained as $\textit{state trajectories of control systems described by the incompressible Euler equations}$ either driven by finite-dimensional controls or by controls localized in space. The main ingredient of our proof is a new approximate controllability theorem for the incompressible Euler equations on $\mathbb{T}^2$, ensuring the approximate tracking of the full state all over the considered time interval. Combining this with a continuous dependence result yields enhanced relaxation for the passive scalar field. Another essential tool in our analysis is the exact controllability of the incompressible Euler system driven by spatially localized forces.</description>

      <title>Exploration from a Primal-Dual Lens: Value-Incentivized Actor-Critic Methods for Sample-Efficient Online RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) with complex function approximations such as transformers and deep neural networks plays a significant role in the modern practice of artificial intelligence. Despite its popularity and importance, balancing the fundamental trade-off between exploration and exploitation remains a long-standing challenge; in particular, we are still in lack of efficient and practical schemes that are backed by theoretical performance guarantees. Motivated by recent developments in exploration via optimistic regularization, this paper provides an interpretation of the principle of optimism through the lens of primal-dual optimization. From this fresh perspective, we set forth a new value-incentivized actor-critic (VAC) method, which optimizes a single easy-to-optimize objective integrating exploration and exploitation -- it promotes state-action and policy estimates that are both consistent with collected data transitions and result in higher value functions. Theoretically, the proposed VAC method has near-optimal regret guarantees under linear Markov decision processes (MDPs) in both finite-horizon and infinite-horizon settings, which can be extended to the general function approximation setting under appropriate assumptions.</description>

      <title>Global relaxation-based LP-Newton method for multiple hyperparameter selection in support vector classification with feature selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Support vector classification (SVC) is an effective tool for classification tasks in machine learning. Its performance relies on the selection of appropriate hyperparameters. This paper focuses on optimizing the regularization hyperparameter C and determining feature bounds for feature selection within SVC, leading to a potentially large hyperparameter space. It is well known in machine learning that this can lead to the so-called curse of dimensionality. To address this challenge of multiple hyperparameter selection, the problem is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem, which is then transformed into a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC). Our primary contributions are twofold. First, we establish the satisfaction of the MPEC-MFCQ for our problem reformulation. Furthermore, we introduce a novel global relaxation-based linear programming (LP)-Newton method (GRLPN) for solving this problem and provide corresponding convergence results. Typically, in global relaxation methods for MPECs, the algorithm for the corresponding subproblem is treated as a black box. Possibly for the first time in the literature, the subproblem is specifically studied in detail. Numerical experiments demonstrate GRLPN's superiority in efficiency and accuracy over both grid search and traditional global relaxation methods solved using the well-known nonlinear programming solver SNOPT.</description>

      <title>Stability of Primal-Dual Gradient Flow Dynamics for Multi-Block Convex Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine stability properties of primal-dual gradient flow dynamics for composite convex optimization problems with multiple, possibly nonsmooth, terms in the objective function under the generalized consensus constraint. The proposed dynamics are based on the proximal augmented Lagrangian and they provide a viable alternative to ADMM which faces significant challenges from both analysis and implementation viewpoints in large-scale multi-block scenarios. In contrast to customized algorithms with individualized convergence guarantees, we develop a systematic approach for solving a broad class of challenging composite optimization problems. We leverage various structural properties to establish global (exponential) convergence guarantees for the proposed dynamics. Our assumptions are much weaker than those required to prove (exponential) stability of primal-dual dynamics as well as (linear) convergence of discrete-time methods such as standard two-block and multi-block ADMM and EXTRA algorithms. Finally, we show necessity of some of our structural assumptions for exponential stability and provide computational experiments to demonstrate the convenience of the proposed approach for parallel and distributed computing applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with time-fractional stochastic Navier-Stokes equations, which are characterized by the coexistence of stochastic noise and a fractional power of the Laplacian. We establish sufficient conditions for the existence and approximate controllability of a unique mild solution to time-fractional stochastic Navier-Stokes equations. Using a fixed point technique, we first demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of a mild solution to the equation under consideration. We then establish approximate controllability results by using the concepts of fractional calculus, semigroup theory, functional analysis and stochastic analysis.</description>

      <title>Inertial dynamics with vanishing Tikhonov regularization for multiobjective optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce, in a Hilbert space setting, a second order dynamical system with asymptotically vanishing damping and vanishing Tikhonov regularization that approaches a multiobjective optimization problem with convex and differentiable components of the objective function. Trajectory solutions are shown to exist in finite dimensions. We prove fast convergence of the function values, quantified in terms of a merit function. Based on the regime considered, we establish both weak and, in some cases, strong convergence of trajectory solutions towards a weak Pareto optimal point. To achieve this, we apply Tikhonov regularization individually to each component of the objective function. Furthermore, we conduct numerical experiments to validate the theoretical results and investigate the qualitative behavior of the dynamical system. This work extends results from convex single objective optimization into the multiobjective setting. The results presented in this paper lay the groundwork for the development of fast gradient and proximal point methods in multiobjective optimization, offering strong convergence guarantees.</description>

      <title>Toward a Unified Theory of Gradient Descent under Generalized Smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the classical optimization problem $\min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d} f(x)$ and analyze the gradient descent (GD) method in both nonconvex and convex settings. It is well-known that, under the $L$-smoothness assumption ($\|\nabla^2 f(x)\| \leq L$), the optimal point minimizing the quadratic upper bound $f(x_k) + \langle\nabla f(x_k), x_{k+1} - x_k\rangle + \frac{L}{2} \|x_{k+1} - x_k\|^2$ is $x_{k+1} = x_k - \gamma_k \nabla f(x_k)$ with step size $\gamma_k = \frac{1}{L}$. Surprisingly, a similar result can be derived under the $\ell$-generalized smoothness assumption ($\|\nabla^2 f(x)\| \leq \ell(\|\nabla f(x)\|)$). In this case, we derive the step size $$\gamma_k = \int_{0}^{1} \frac{d v}{\ell(\|\nabla f(x_k)\| + \|\nabla f(x_k)\| v)}.$$ Using this step size rule, we improve upon existing theoretical convergence rates and obtain new results in several previously unexplored setups.</description>

Abstract: Given a positive noncommutative polynomial $f$, equivalently a sum of Hermitian squares (SOHS), there exists a positive semidefinite Gram matrix that encrypts all the structural essence of $f$. There are no available methods for extending a noncommutative polynomial to a SOHS keeping the Gram matrices unperturbed. As a remedy, we introduce an equally significant notion of Gram-like matrices and provide linear algebraic techniques to get the desired extensions. We further use positive semidefinite completion problem to get SOHS and provide criteria in terms of chordal graphs and 2-regular projective algebraic sets.</description>

      <title>Nested Stochastic Algorithm for Generalized Sinkhorn distance-Regularized Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) is a powerful technique to train robust models against data distribution shift. This paper aims to solve regularized nonconvex DRO problems, where the uncertainty set is modeled by a so-called generalized Sinkhorn distance and the loss function is nonconvex and possibly unbounded. Such a distance allows to model uncertainty of distributions with different probability supports and divergence functions. For this class of regularized DRO problems, we derive a novel dual formulation taking the form of nested stochastic optimization, where the dual variable depends on the data sample. To solve the dual problem, we provide theoretical evidence to design a nested stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm, which leverages stochastic approximation to estimate the nested stochastic gradients. We study the convergence rate of nested SGD and establish polynomial iteration and sample complexities that are independent of the data size and parameter dimension, indicating its potential for solving large-scale DRO problems. We conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

Abstract: We study a family of Mean Field Games arising in modeling the behavior of strategic economic agents which move across space maximizing their utility from consumption and have the possibility to accumulate resources for production (such as human capital). The resulting mean field game PDE system is not covered in the actual literature on the topic as it displays weaker assumptions on the regularity of the data (in particular Lipschitz continuity and boundedness of the objective are lost), state constraints, and a non-standard interaction term. We obtain a first result on the existence of solution of the mean field game PDE system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10017v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intercepting a criminal using limited police resources presents a significant challenge in dynamic crime environments, where the criminal's location continuously changes over time. The complexity is further heightened by the vastness of the transportation network. To tackle this problem, we propose a layered graph representation, in which each time step is associated with a duplicate of the transportation network. For any given set of attacker strategies, a near-optimal defender strategy is computed using the A-Star heuristic algorithm applied to the layered graph. The defender's goal is to maximize the probability of successful interdiction. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method by comparing it with a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approach used for the defender. The comparison considers both computational efficiency and solution quality. The results demonstrate that our approach effectively addresses the complexity of the problem and delivers high-quality solutions within a short computation time.</description>

      <title>Finite-Horizon Strategy in Infinite-Horizon Linear-Quadratic Discrete-Time Dynamic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a finite-horizon strategy, ``watching $T$ steps into the future and moving one step now,'' in an $N$-person infinite-horizon discrete-time linear-quadratic dynamic game. The game involves linear input/output/state dynamics and quadratic cost functions with heterogeneous discount factors. For the finite-horizon version, which forms the basis of the infinite-horizon game, we analyze the structure of the coupled generalized discrete Riccati difference equations related to the feedback Nash equilibrium (FNE) and derive a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of the finite-horizon FNE. Under this condition, the FNE can be efficiently computed via the proposed algorithm. In the infinite-horizon game, assume all players adopt this finite-horizon strategy. If the iterations of the coupled equations related to the FNE converge, and the invertibility and stability conditions hold, we prove the convergence of each player's total cost under the finite-horizon strategy, even when players use individual prediction horizons. Furthermore, we provide an explicit upper bound on the cost difference between the finite-horizon strategy and the infinite-horizon FNE associated with the limiting matrices, expressed via the distance between their feedback strategy matrices. This bound vanishes as $T$ tends to infinity, implying convergence to the infinite-horizon FNE cost. A non-scalar numerical example illustrates the convergence behavior.</description>
