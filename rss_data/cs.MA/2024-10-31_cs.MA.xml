      <title>Relational Weight Optimization for Enhancing Team Performance in Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an approach to improve team performance in a Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandit (MAMAB) framework using Fastest Mixing Markov Chain (FMMC) and Fastest Distributed Linear Averaging (FDLA) optimization algorithms. The multi-agent team is represented using a fixed relational network and simulated using the Coop-UCB2 algorithm. The edge weights of the communication network directly impact the time taken to reach distributed consensus. Our goal is to shrink the timescale on which the convergence of the consensus occurs to achieve optimal team performance and maximize reward. Through our experiments, we show that the convergence to team consensus occurs slightly faster in large constrained networks.</description>

      <title>Resource Governance in Networked Systems via Integrated Variational Autoencoders and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework that integrates variational autoencoders (VAE) with reinforcement learning (RL) to balance system performance and resource usage in multi-agent systems by dynamically adjusting network structures over time. A key innovation of this method is its capability to handle the vast action space of the network structure. This is achieved by combining Variational Auto-Encoder and Deep Reinforcement Learning to control the latent space encoded from the network structures. The proposed method, evaluated on the modified OpenAI particle environment under various scenarios, not only demonstrates superior performance compared to baselines but also reveals interesting strategies and insights through the learned behaviors.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Network Intervention for Complex Systems: A Hierarchical Graph Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective governance and steering of behavior in complex multi-agent systems (MAS) are essential for managing system-wide outcomes, particularly in environments where interactions are structured by dynamic networks. In many applications, the goal is to promote pro-social behavior among agents, where network structure plays a pivotal role in shaping these interactions. This paper introduces a Hierarchical Graph Reinforcement Learning (HGRL) framework that governs such systems through targeted interventions in the network structure. Operating within the constraints of limited managerial authority, the HGRL framework demonstrates superior performance across a range of environmental conditions, outperforming established baseline methods. Our findings highlight the critical influence of agent-to-agent learning (social learning) on system behavior: under low social learning, the HGRL manager preserves cooperation, forming robust core-periphery networks dominated by cooperators. In contrast, high social learning accelerates defection, leading to sparser, chain-like networks. Additionally, the study underscores the importance of the system manager's authority level in preventing system-wide failures, such as agent rebellion or collapse, positioning HGRL as a powerful tool for dynamic network-based governance.</description>

      <title>Keep on Swimming: Real Attackers Only Need Partial Knowledge of a Multi-Model System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent approaches in machine learning often solve a task using a composition of multiple models or agentic architectures. When targeting a composed system with adversarial attacks, it might not be computationally or informationally feasible to train an end-to-end proxy model or a proxy model for every component of the system. We introduce a method to craft an adversarial attack against the overall multi-model system when we only have a proxy model for the final black-box model, and when the transformation applied by the initial models can make the adversarial perturbations ineffective. Current methods handle this by applying many copies of the first model/transformation to an input and then re-use a standard adversarial attack by averaging gradients, or learning a proxy model for both stages. To our knowledge, this is the first attack specifically designed for this threat model and our method has a substantially higher attack success rate (80% vs 25%) and contains 9.4% smaller perturbations (MSE) compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments focus on a supervised image pipeline, but we are confident the attack will generalize to other multi-model settings [e.g. a mix of open/closed source foundation models], or agentic systems</description>

      <title>Abstract Continuation Semantics for Multiparty Interactions in Process Calculi based on CCS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop denotational and operational semantics designed with continuations for process calculi based on CCS extended with mechanisms offering support for multiparty interactions. We investigate the abstractness of this continuation semantics. We show that our continuation-based denotational models are weakly abstract with respect to the corresponding operational models.

      <title>Knowledge Equivalence in Digital Twins of Intelligent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.07481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A digital twin contains up-to-date data-driven models of the physical world being studied and can use simulation to optimise the physical world. However, the analysis made by the digital twin is valid and reliable only when the model is equivalent to the physical world. Maintaining such an equivalent model is challenging, especially when the physical systems being modelled are intelligent and autonomous. The paper focuses in particular on digital twin models of intelligent systems where the systems are knowledge-aware but with limited capability. The digital twin improves the acting of the physical system at a meta-level by accumulating more knowledge in the simulated environment. The modelling of such an intelligent physical system requires replicating the knowledge-awareness capability in the virtual space. Novel equivalence maintaining techniques are needed, especially in synchronising the knowledge between the model and the physical system. This paper proposes the notion of knowledge equivalence and an equivalence maintaining approach by knowledge comparison and updates. A quantitative analysis of the proposed approach confirms that compared to state equivalence, knowledge equivalence maintenance can tolerate deviation thus reducing unnecessary updates and achieve more Pareto efficient solutions for the trade-off between update overhead and simulation reliability.</description>

      <title>Seeding with Differentially Private Network Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16590v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In public health interventions such as the distribution of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention, decision makers rely on seeding algorithms to identify key individuals who can amplify the impact of their interventions. In such cases, building a complete sexual activity network is often infeasible due to privacy concerns. Instead, contact tracing can provide influence samples, that is, sequences of sexual contacts without requiring complete network information. This presents two challenges: protecting individual privacy in contact data and adapting seeding algorithms to work effectively with incomplete network information. To solve these two problems, we study privacy guarantees for influence maximization algorithms when the social network is unknown and the inputs are samples of prior influence cascades that are collected at random and need privacy protection. Building on recent results that address seeding with costly network information, our privacy-preserving algorithms introduce randomization in the collected data or the algorithm output and can bound the privacy loss of each node (or group of nodes) in deciding to include their data in the algorithm input. We provide theoretical guarantees of seeding performance with a limited sample size subject to differential privacy budgets in both central and local privacy regimes. Simulations on synthetic random graphs and empirically grounded sexual contacts of men who have sex with men reveal the diminishing value of network information with decreasing privacy budget in both regimes and graceful decrease in performance with decreasing privacy budget in the central regime. Achieving good performance with local privacy guarantees requires relatively higher privacy budgets that confirm our theoretical expectations.</description>

      <title>LLM-Agent-UMF: LLM-based Agent Unified Modeling Framework for Seamless Integration of Multi Active/Passive Core-Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an era where vast amounts of data are collected and processed from diverse sources, there is a growing demand to develop sophisticated AI systems capable of intelligently fusing and analyzing this information. To address these challenges, researchers have turned towards integrating tools into LLM-powered agents to enhance the overall information fusion process. However, the conjunction of these technologies and the proposed enhancements in several state-of-the-art works followed a non-unified software architecture resulting in a lack of modularity and terminological inconsistencies among researchers. To address these issues, we propose a novel LLM-based Agent Unified Modeling Framework (LLM-Agent-UMF) that aims to establish a clear foundation for agent development from both functional and software architectural perspectives. Our framework distinguishes between the different components of an LLM-based agent, setting LLMs, and tools apart from a new element, the core-agent, playing the role of the central coordinator of the agent. This pivotal entity comprises five modules: planning, memory, profile, action, and security - the latter often neglected in previous works. By classifying core-agents into passive and active types based on their authoritative natures, we propose various multi-core agent architectures that combine unique characteristics of distinctive agents to tackle complex tasks more efficiently. We evaluate our framework by applying it to thirteen state-of-the-art agents, thereby demonstrating its alignment with their functionalities and clarifying the overlooked architectural aspects. Moreover, we thoroughly assess five of our proposed architectures through the integration of existing agents into new hybrid active/passive core-agents architectures. This analysis provides insights into potential improvements and highlights challenges involved in combining specific agents.</description>
