      <title>The Radon-Nikod$\acute{Y}$m property of $\mathbb{L}$-Banach spaces and the dual representation theorem of $\mathbb{L}$-Bochner function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first introduce $\mathbb{L}$-$\mu$-measurable functions and $\mathbb{L}$-Bochner integrable functions on a finite measure space $(S,\mathcal{F},\mu),$ and give an $\mathbb{L}$-valued analogue of the canonical $L^{p}(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mu).$ Then we investigate the completeness of such an $\mathbb{L}$-valued analogue and propose the Radon-Nikod$\acute{y}$m property of $\mathbb{L}$-Banach spaces. Meanwhile, an example constructed in this paper shows that there do exist an $\mathbb{L}$-Banach space which fails to possess the Radon-Nikod$\acute{y}$m property. Finally, based on above work, we establish the dual representation theorem of $\mathbb{L}$-Bochner integrable function spaces, which extends and improves the corresponding classical result.</description>

      <title>Maximal hyperplane sections of the unit ball of $l_p$ for $p&gt;2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maximal hyperplane section of the $l_\infty^n$-ball, i.e. of the $n$-cube, is the one perpendicular to 1/sqrt 2 (1,1,0, ... ,0), as shown by Ball. Eskenazis, Nayar and Tkocz extended this result to the $l_p^n$-balls for very large $p \ge 10^{15}$. We show that the analogue of Ball's result essentially holds for all $26.265 \simeq p_0 \le p &lt; \infty$. By Oleszkiewicz, Ball's result does not transfer to $l_p^n$ for $2 &lt; p &lt; p_0$. Then the hyperplane section perpendicular to the main diagonal yields a counterexample for large dimensions $n$. In this case, we give an asymptotic upper bound for $20 &lt; p &lt; p_0$.</description>

      <title>Manifolds of absolutely continuous functions with values in an infinite-dimensional manifold and regularity properties of half-Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06512v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $p\in [1,\infty]$, we define a smooth manifold structure on the set of absolutely continuous functions $\gamma\colon [a,b]\to N$ with $L^p$-derivatives for each smooth manifold $N$ modeled on a sequentially complete locally convex topological vector space which admits a local addition. Smoothness of natural mappings between spaces of absolutely continuous functions is discussed. For $1\leq p &lt;\infty$ and $r\in \mathbb{N}$ we show that the right half-Lie groups $\text{Diff}_K^r(\mathbb{R})$ and $\text{Diff}^r(M)$ are $L^p$-semiregular. Here $K$ is a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $M$ is a compact smooth manifold. For the preceding examples, the evolution map $\text{Evol}$ is continuous.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Quantum Zeno and Strong Damping Limits in Strong Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequent applications of a mixing quantum operation to a quantum system slow down its time evolution and eventually drive it into the invariant subspace of the named operation. We prove this phenomenon, the quantum Zeno effect, and its continuous variant, strong damping, in a unified way for infinite-dimensional open quantum systems, while merely demanding that the respective mixing convergence holds pointwise for all states. Both results are quantitative in the following sense: Given the speed of convergence for the mixing limits, we can derive bounds on the convergence speed for the corresponding quantum Zeno and strong damping limits. We apply our results to prove quantum Zeno and strong damping limits for the photon loss channel with an explicit bound on the convergence speed.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis of Dirac operators for dislocated potentials with a purely imaginary jump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a complete spectral analysis of Dirac operators with non-Hermitian matrix potentials of the form $i\operatorname{sgn}(x)+V(x)$ where $V\in L^1$. For $V=0$ we compute explicitly the matrix Green function. This allows us to determine the spectrum, which is purely essential, and its different types. It also allows us to find sharp enclosures for the pseudospectrum and its complement, in all parts of the complex plane. Notably, this includes the instability region, corresponding to the interior of the band that forms the numerical range. Then, with the help of a Birman-Schwinger principle, we establish in precise manner how the spectrum and pseudospectrum change when $V\not=0$, assuming the hypotheses $\|V\|_{L^1}&lt;1$ or $V\in L^1\cap L^p$ where $p&gt;1$. We show that the essential spectra remain unchanged and that the $\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum stays close to the instability region for small $\varepsilon$. We determine sharp asymptotic for the discrete spectrum, whenever $V$ satisfies further conditions of decay at infinity. Finally, in one of our main findings, we give a complete description of the weakly-coupled model.</description>

      <title>Enzyme kinetic reactions as interacting particle systems: Stochastic averaging and parameter inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic model of multistage Michaelis--Menten (MM) type enzyme kinetic reactions describing the conversion of substrate molecules to a product through several intermediate species. The high-dimensional, multiscale nature of these reaction networks presents significant computational challenges, especially in statistical estimation of reaction rates. This difficulty is amplified when direct data on system states are unavailable, and one only has access to a random sample of product formation times. To address this, we proceed in two stages. First, under certain technical assumptions akin to those made in the Quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) literature, we prove two asymptotic results: a stochastic averaging principle that yields a lower-dimensional model, and a functional central limit theorem that quantifies the associated fluctuations. Next, for statistical inference of the parameters of the original MM reaction network, we develop a mathematical framework involving an interacting particle system (IPS) and prove a propagation of chaos result that allows us to write a product-form likelihood function. The novelty of the IPS-based inference method is that it does not require information about the state of the system and works with only a random sample of product formation times. We provide numerical examples to illustrate the efficacy of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Ball separation characterization of dentability and related properties in Banach spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we first analyze the dual connection between ball separation property and the three properties in Banach spaces : Ball Dentable Property (BDP), Ball Huskable Property (BHP) and Ball Small Comination of Slice Property (BSCSP). We also introduce some related concepts in point version, namely the notion of semi w^*-Point of Continuity and semi w^* -Small Combination of Slice point in B_{X^*} and establish their ball separation characterization. The characterization of semi w^*-PC plays a key role in establishing a new formulation of Property (II). We show that every point in S_{X^*} is semi w^*-PC of B_{X^*} if and only if X has property (II). At the end of this article, we introduce the notion of A-Small Combination of Slice point in B_{X^*} and obtain a necessary ball separation condition for its existence. This allows us to prove a more general version of the result given in [BB, Proposition 2.5].</description>

      <title>Envelopes in the class of Banach algebras of polynomial growth and $C^\infty$-functions of a finite number of free variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10199v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of envelope of a topological algebra (in particular, an arbitrary associative algebra) with respect to a class of Banach algebras. In the case of the class of real Banach algebras of polynomial growth, i.e., admitting a $C^\infty$-functional calculus for every element, we get a functor that maps the algebra of polynomials in $k$ variables to the algebra of $C^\infty$-functions on $\R^k$. The envelope of a general commutative or non-commutative algebra can be treated as an algebra of $C^\infty$-functions on some commutative or non-commutative space. In particular, we describe the envelopes of the universal enveloping algebra of finite-dimensional Lie algebras, the coordinate algebras of the quantum plane and quantum $SL(2)$ and also look at some commutative examples. A result on algebras of `free $C^\infty$-functions', i.e., the envelopes of free associative algebras of finite rank $k$, is announced for general $k$ and proved for $k\le 2$.</description>

      <title>On the metric of the jet bundle and similarity on weighted Dirichlet spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In general, it is more difficult to formulate a sufficient condition for similarity than a necessary condition. We give sufficient conditions for a Cowen-Douglas operator with a positivity condition to be similar to the backward shift operator on weighted Dirichlet space. This condition involves the holomorphic jet bundle of the eigenvector bundle of the operator.</description>

      <title>Bimodule coefficients, Riesz transforms on Coxeter groups and strong solidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.00588v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In deformation-rigidity theory it is often important to know whether certain bimodules are weakly contained in the coarse bimodule. Consider a bimodule $H$ over the group algebra $\mathbb{C}[\Gamma]$, with $\Gamma$ a discrete group. The starting point of this paper is that if a dense set of the so-called coefficients of $H$ is contained in the Schatten $\mathcal{S}_p$ class $p \in [2, \infty)$ then the $n$-fold tensor power $H^{\otimes n}_\Gamma$ for $n \geq p/2$ is quasi-contained in the coarse bimodule. We apply this to gradient bimodules associated with the carr\'e du champ of a symmetric quantum Markov semi-group.
  For Coxeter groups we give a number of characterizations of having coefficients in $\mathcal{S}_p$ for the gradient bimodule constructed from the word length function. We get equivalence of: (1) the gradient-$\mathcal{S}_p$ property introduced by the second named author, (2) smallness at infinity of a natural compactification of the Coxeter group, and for a large class of Coxeter groups: (3) walks in the Coxeter diagram called parity paths.
  We derive several strong solidity results. In particular, we extend current strong solidity results for right-angled Hecke von Neumann algebras beyond right-angled Coxeter groups that are small at infinity. Our general methods also yield a concise proof of a result by T. Sinclair for discrete groups admitting a proper cocycle into a $p$-integrable representation.</description>

      <title>Local theory of stable polynomials and bounded rational functions of several variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.07507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide detailed local descriptions of stable polynomials in terms of their homogeneous decompositions, Puiseux expansions, and transfer function realizations. We use this theory to first prove that bounded rational functions on the polydisk possess non-tangential limits at every boundary point. We relate higher non-tangential regularity and distinguished boundary behavior of bounded rational functions to geometric properties of the zero sets of stable polynomials via our local descriptions. For a fixed stable polynomial $p$, we analyze the ideal of numerators $q$ such that $q/p$ is bounded on the bi-upper half plane. We completely characterize this ideal in several geometrically interesting situations including smooth points, double points, and ordinary multiple points of $p$. Finally, we analyze integrability properties of bounded rational functions and their derivatives on the bidisk.</description>
