      <title>A table-top high-sensitivity gyroscope based on slow light and cavity enhanced photon drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high-sensitivity gyroscope is vital for both investigation of the fundamental physics and monitor of the subtle variation of Earth's behaviors. However, it is challenge to realize a portable gyroscope with sensitivity approaching a small fraction of the Earth's rotation rate. Here, we theoretically propose a method for implementing a table-top gyroscope with remarkably high sensitivity based on photon drag in a rotating dielectric object. By inserting an $\text{Er}^{3+}$-doped glass rod in a Fabry-P\'{e}rot optical cavity with only 20 cm length, we theoretically show that the giant group refractive index and the narrowing cavity linewidth due to slow light can essentially increase the nonreciprocal phase shift due to the photon drag to achieve a rotation sensitivity of $26$ frad/s/$\sqrt{Hz}$. This work paves the way to accurately detect tiny variations of the Earth's rotation rate and orientation, and even can test the geodetic and frame-dragging effects predicted by the general relativity with a small-volume equipment.</description>

      <title>Optimization of a fiber Fabry-Perot resonator for low-threshold modulation instability Kerr frequency combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a theoretical and experimental investigation of fiber Fabry-Perot cavities aimed at enhancing Kerr frequency comb generation. The modulation instability (MI) power threshold is derived from the linear stability analysis of a generalized Lugiato-Lefever equation. By combining this analysis with the concepts of power enhancement factor (PEF) and optimal coupling, we predict the ideal manufacturing parameters of fiber Fabry-Perot (FFP) cavities for the MI Kerr frequency comb generation. Our findings reveal a distinction between the optimal coupling for modulation instability and that of the cold cavity. Consequently, mirror reflectivity must be adjusted to suit the specific application. We verified the predictions of our theory by measuring the MI power threshold as a function of detuning for three different cavities.</description>

      <title>A Silicon Photonic 32-Input Coherent Combiner for Turbulence Mitigation in Free Space Optics Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A photonic integrated circuit (PIC) for the coherent combination of 32 input optical signals into a single output fiber is reported. The PIC was fabricated using a low-loss thick silicon-on-insulator (SOI) process and packaged with 32 input and 1 output fibers. The basic building block is a 2x2 Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with an external (to the MZI branches) and an internal thermal phase shifter, and a bandwidth in excess of 80 kHz. The PIC monolithically integrates 31 MZIs and 31 germanium photodetectors, and is suitable in principle for turbulence mitigation in LEO-ground and horizontal free space optics links. Improvements to the device for the coherent combination of 64 inputs and for the reduction of insertion losses are also discussed</description>

      <title>Multi-state Chiral Switching Through Adiabaticity Control in Encircling Exceptional Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic encircling of exceptional points has attracted significant interest in recent years, as it can facilitate chiral transmission selectivity due to a nontrivial eigenstate evolution. Recently, multi-state systems have been explored, associated with more complex topologies supporting a larger number of exceptional points, but chiral switching among multiple eigenstates has remained elusive in experiments. Here, we overcome this challenge by dividing the eigenstate space into multiple subspaces by controlling the adiabaticity. The eigenstates in different subspaces can evolve without crosstalk, and chiral switching occurs as the eigenstates within each subspace are subject to a non-adiabatic transition while they encircle exceptional points. We experimentally demonstrate this phenomenon by reporting chiral switching for two groups of optical modes at telecom wavelengths in a four-state optical system, and theoretically demonstrate that our approach can be extended to higher-order systems. Our findings pave new avenues for studying chiral dynamics based on exceptional-point physics in multi-state systems, and offer opportunities to develop multiplexed photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Nonlinear Frequency Conversion Bandwidth through Birefringence induced Mode Hybridization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-chip quantum information network requires qubit transfer between different wavelengths while preserving quantum coherence and entanglement, which needs broadband up-conversion available. Herein, we demonstrate a mode-hybridization based broadband nonlinear frequency conversion on X-cut thin film lithium niobate. With the spontaneous quasi-phase matching and quasi groupvelocity matching being simultaneously satisfied, broadband second harmonic generation with a 3-dB bandwidth up to 13 nm has been achieved in a micro-racetrack resonator. The same mechanism can work on the frequency conversion of the ultra-short pulse in the bent waveguide structure. This work will be beneficial to on-chip tunable frequency conversion and quantum light source generation on integrated photonic platforms, and further enable on-chip large-capacity multiplexing, multichannel optical information processing, and large quantum information networks.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic properties of electrochromic doped metal oxides investigated through Kubelka Munk formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials with broadband tunable optical properties are looked for in smart windows applications. Doped metal oxides presenting dual band visible (VIS) near infrared (NIR) electrochromic properties can be used for solving such a challenge, and their accurate optical characterization is therefore of prime importance. Kubelka Munk model is a state of the art way to optically quantify the absorption properties of materials and is occasionally applied to plasmonic materials, even if great care should be taken to meet the formalism hypotheses. In the present work, Kubelka Munk theory is discussed in the context of particles of indium tin oxide and molybdenum tungsten oxide formulations that are used as single NIR and both VIS and NIR active advanced electrochromic materials, respectively. An analytical model is derived for particles of much smaller dimensions than the incident wavelength and is experimentally verified. A dilution method is applied to verify the plasmonic characteristics of the particles. This study is key for efficient characterization of optical properties of metal oxides, and plasmonic materials in general, from diffuse reflectance measurements.</description>

      <title>A general design method for ultra-long optical path length multipass matrix cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the first time, we propose a general design method for ultra-long optical path length (OPL) multipass matrix cells (MMCs) based on multi-cycle mode of two-sided field mirrors. The design idea of the dual circulation mode with two-sided field mirrors is elaborated in detail with the example of MMC based on dual Pickett Bradley White cell (PBWC), and the simple design methods of the other three MMCs based on the dual circulation mode of PBWC and Bernstein Herzberg White cell (BHWC) are given. Further, we propose a general design method for ultra-long OPL MMCs with multi-cycle mode by adding cyclic elements. The OPL of the MMCs designed by this method can reach the order of kilometers or even tens of kilometers. The novel MMCs have the advantages of simple structure, strong spot formation regularity, easy expansion, high mirror utilization ratio, high reuse times of spot spatial position, good stability and extremely high ratio of the optical path length to the volume (RLV). In order to evaluate the performance of the new MMCs, an open-path methane gas sensor with the MMC based on triple PBWC was constructed, which was used to continuously measure the methane in the laboratory, and the feasibility, effectiveness and practicability of the new design method were verified. The design method proposed in this paper provides a new idea for the design of multipass cell (MPC), and the new MMCs designed have great potential application value in the field of high-precision trace gas monitoring.</description>

      <title>Closed forms for spatiotemporal optical vortices and sagittal skyrmionic pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOVs) are short pulses that present a vortex whose axis is perpendicular to the main propagation direction. We present analytic expressions for these pulses that satisfy exactly Maxwell's equation, by applying appropriate differential operators to complex focus pulses with Poisson-like frequency spectrum. We also provide a simple ray picture for understanding the deformation of these pulses under propagation. Finally, we use these solutions to propose a type of pulse with sagittal skyrmionic polarization distribution covering all states of transverse polarization.</description>

      <title>InGaP $\chi^{(2)}$ integrated photonics platform for broadband, ultra-efficient nonlinear conversion and entangled photon generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear optics plays an important role in many areas of science and technology. The advance of nonlinear optics is empowered by the discovery and utilization of materials with growing optical nonlinearity. Here we demonstrate an indium gallium phosphide (InGaP) integrated photonics platform for broadband, ultra-efficient second-order nonlinear optics. The InGaP nanophotonic waveguide enables second-harmonic generation with a normalized efficiency of $128,000\%$/W/cm$^2$ at 1.55 $\mu$m pump wavelength, nearly two orders of magnitude higher than the state of the art in the telecommunication C band. Further, we realize an ultra-bright, broadband time-energy entangled photon source with a pair generation rate of 97 GHz/mW and a bandwidth of 115 nm centered at the telecommunication C band. The InGaP entangled photon source shows high coincidence-to-accidental counts ratio CAR $&gt;10^4$ and two-photon interference visibility $&gt;98\%$. The InGaP second-order nonlinear photonics platform will have wide-ranging implications for non-classical light generation, optical signal processing, and quantum networking.</description>

      <title>Transient infrared nanoscopy resolves the millisecond photoswitching dynamics of single lipid vesicles in water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the biophysical and biochemical properties of molecular nanocarriers under physiological conditions and with minimal interference is crucial for advancing nanomedicine, photopharmacology, drug delivery, nanotheranostics and synthetic biology. Yet, analytical methods struggle to combine precise chemical imaging and measurements without perturbative labeling. This challenge is exemplified for azobenzene-based photoswitchable lipids, which are intriguing reagents for controlling nanocarrier properties on fast timescales, enabling, e.g., precise light-induced drug release processes. Here, we leverage the chemical recognition and high spatio-temporal resolution of scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) to demonstrate non-destructive, label-free mid-infrared (MIR) imaging and spectroscopy of photoswitchable liposomes below the diffraction limit and the tracking of their dynamics down to 50 ms resolution. The vesicles are adsorbed on an ultrathin 10-nm SiN membrane, which separates the sample space from the tip space for stable and hour-long observations. By implementing a transient nanoscopy approach, we accurately resolve, for the first time, photoinduced changes in both the shape and the MIR spectral signature of individual vesicles and reveal abrupt change dynamics of the underlying photoisomerization process. Our findings highlight the methods potential for future studies on the complex dynamics of unlabeled nanoscale soft matter, as well as, in a broader context, for host-guest systems, energy materials or drugs.</description>

      <title>Memory Capacity Analysis of Time-delay Reservoir Computing Based on Silicon Microring Resonator Nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon microring resonators (MRRs) have shown strong potential in acting as the nonlinear nodes of photonic reservoir computing (RC) schemes. By using nonlinearities within a silicon MRR, such as the ones caused by free-carrier dispersion (FCD) and thermo-optic (TO) effects, it is possible to map the input data of the RC to a higher dimensional space. Furthermore, by adding an external waveguide between the through and add ports of the MRR, it is possible to implement a time-delay RC (TDRC) with enhanced memory. The input from the through port is fed back into the add port of the ring with the delay applied by the external waveguide effectively adding memory. In a TDRC, the nodes are multiplexed in time, and their respective time evolutions are detected at the drop port. The performance of MRR-based TDRC is highly dependent on the amount of nonlinearity in the MRR. The nonlinear effects, in turn, are dependent on the physical properties of the MRR as they determine the lifetime of the effects. Another factor to take into account is the stability of the MRR response, as strong time-domain discontinuities at the drop port are known to emerge from FCD nonlinearities due to self-pulsing (high nonlinear behaviour). However, quantifying the right amount of nonlinearity that RC needs for a certain task in order to achieve optimum performance is challenging. Therefore, further analysis is required to fully understand the nonlinear dynamics of this TDRC setup. Here, we quantify the nonlinear and linear memory capacity of the previously described microring-based TDRC scheme, as a function of the time constants of the generated carriers and the thermal of the TO effects. We analyze the properties of the TDRC dynamics that generate the parameter space, in terms of input signal power and frequency detuning range, over which conventional RC tasks can be satisfactorily performed by the TDRC scheme.</description>

      <title>Depolarization diagrams for circularly polarized light scattering for biological particle monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significance: The depolarization of circularly polarized light caused by scattering in turbid media reveals structural information about the dispersed particles, such as their size, density, and distribution, which is useful for investigating the state of biological tissue. However, the correlation between depolarization strength and tissue parameters is unclear. Aim: We aimed to examine the generalized correlations of depolarization strength with the particle size and wavelength, yielding depolarization diagrams. Approach: The correlation between depolarization intensity and size parameter were examined for single and multiple scattering using the Monte Carlo simulation method. Expanding the wavelength width allows us to obtain depolarization distribution diagrams as functions of wavelength and particle diameter for reflection and transparent geometries. Results: Circularly polarized light suffers intensive depolarization in a single scattering against particles of various specific sizes for its wavelength, which becomes more noticeable in the multiple scattering regime. Conclusions: The depolarization diagrams with particle size and wavelength as independent variables were obtained, which are particularly helpful for investigating the feasibility of various particle-monitoring methods. Based on the obtained diagrams, several applications have been proposed, including blood cell monitoring, early embryogenesis, and antigen-antibody interactions.</description>

      <title>3D Imaging of Complex Specular Surfaces by Fusing Polarimetric and Deflectometric Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and fast 3D imaging of specular surfaces still poses major challenges for state-of-the-art optical measurement principles. Frequently used methods, such as phase-measuring deflectometry (PMD) or shape-from-polarization (SfP), rely on strong assumptions about the measured objects, limiting their generalizability in broader application areas like medical imaging, industrial inspection, virtual reality, or cultural heritage analysis. In this paper, we introduce a measurement principle that utilizes a novel technique to effectively encode and decode the information contained in a light field reflected off a specular surface. We combine polarization cues from SfP with geometric information obtained from PMD to resolve all arising ambiguities in the 3D measurement. Moreover, our approach removes the unrealistic orthographic imaging assumption for SfP, which significantly improves the respective results. We showcase our new technique by demonstrating single-shot and multi-shot measurements on complex-shaped specular surfaces, displaying an evaluated accuracy of surface normals below $0.6^\circ$.</description>

      <title>Deriving the size and shape of the ALBA electron beam with optical synchrotron radiation interferometry using aperture masks: technical choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore non-redundant aperture masking to derive the size and shape of the ALBA synchrotron light source at optical wavelengths using synchrotron radiation interferometry. We show that non-redundant masks are required due to phase fluctuations arising within the experimental set-up. We also show, using closure phase, that the phase fluctuations are factorizable into element-based errors. We employ multiple masks, including 2, 3, 5, and 6 hole configurations. We develop a process for self-calibration of the element-based amplitudes (square root of flux through the aperture), which corrects for non-uniform illumination over the mask, in order to derive visibility coherences and phases, from which the source size and shape can be derived. We explore the optimal procedures to obtain the most reliable results with the 5-hole mask, based on the temporal scatter in measured coherences and closure phases. We find that the closure phases are very stable, and close to zero (within $2^o$). Through uv-modeling, we consider the noise properties of the experiment and conclude that our visibility measurements per frame are likely accurate to an rms scatter of $\sim 1\%$.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of superior communication through thermodynamically free channels in an optical quantum switch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The release of causal structure of physical events from a well-defined order to an indefinite one stimulates remarkable enhancements in various quantum information tasks. Some of these advantages, however, are questioned for the ambiguous role of the control system in the quantum switch that is an experimentally realized process with indefinite causal structure. In communications, for example, not only the superposition of alternative causal orders, but also the superposition of alternative trajectories can accelerate information transmissions. Here, we follow the proposal of Liu et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 230604 (2022)], and examine the information enhancement effect of indefinite causal orders with the toolkit of thermodynamics in a photonic platform. Specifically, we simulate the thermal interaction between a system qubit and two heat baths embedded in a quantum switch by implementing the corresponding switched thermal channels. Although its action on the system qubit only is thermally free, our results suggest that the quantum switch should be seen as a resource when the control qubit is also considered. Moreover, we characterize the non-Markovian property in this scenario by measuring the information backflows from the heat baths to the system qubit.</description>

      <title>Velocity Scanning Tomography for Room-Temperature Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation offers an analog approach for exploring exotic quantum phenomena using controllable platforms, typically necessitating ultracold temperatures to maintain the quantum coherence. Superradiance lattices (SLs) have been harnessed to simulate coherent topological physics at room temperature, but the thermal motion of atoms remains a notable challenge in accurately measuring the physical quantities. To overcome this obstacle, we invent and validate a velocity scanning tomography technique to discern the responses of atoms with different velocities, allowing cold-atom spectroscopic resolution within room-temperature SLs. By comparing absorption spectra with and without atoms moving at specific velocities, we can derive the Wannier-Stark ladders of the SL across various effective static electric fields, their strengths being proportional to the atomic velocities. We extract the Zak phase of the SL by monitoring the ladder frequency shift as a function of the atomic velocity, effectively demonstrating the topological winding of the energy bands. Our research signifies the feasibility of room-temperature quantum simulation and facilitates their applications in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Deep imaging inside scattering media through virtual spatiotemporal wavefront shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08793v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multiple scattering of light makes materials opaque and obstructs imaging. Wavefront shaping can reverse the scattering process, but imaging with physical wavefront shaping has limitations such as requiring physical guidestars, being restricted within a small isoplanatic volume, and relying on slow wavefront updates, with some approaches only working for planar targets outside the scattering media. Here, we introduce scattering matrix tomography (SMT): measure the hyperspectral scattering matrix of the sample, use it to digitally scan a synthesized confocal spatiotemporal focus and construct a volumetric image of the sample, and then use the tomograms as virtual guidestars in a nonconvex optimization to find the pulse shape, input wavefront, and output wavefront that can compensate for aberrations and scattering. SMT combines the strengths of wavefront shaping, spatiotemporal gating, and computational adaptive optics, eliminating physical guidestars and enabling digital double-path wavefront corrections tailored for every isoplanatic volume. We demonstrate sub-micron lateral resolution and one-micron axial resolution at one millimeter beneath ex vivo mouse brain tissue and over three transport mean free paths inside an opaque colloid, where existing imaging methods all fail due to the overwhelming multiple scattering. As a noninvasive and label-free method that works both inside and outside the scattering media, SMT may be applied broadly across medical imaging, biological science, device inspection, and colloidal physics.</description>

      <title>Super-sensing: 100-Fold enhancement in THz time-domain spectroscopy contrast via superoscillating waveform shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superoscillations are a phenomenon where a band-limited wave may locally oscillate faster than its highest Fourier component. They are a product of destructive interference between the wave's constituent harmonics. In this article, we demonstrate that superoscillations enable a new functionality in linear optical sensing -- the 100-fold enhancement in the optical contrast of the terahertz wave passing through two similar samples. To achieve this enhancement, we optimize the optical contrast in the time domain in a short observation window by varying the relative phases between the fundamental harmonics that make up the input terahertz wave. We find that the contrast is maximized when the wave intensity is minimized locally within the observation window, which naturally leads to the emergence of the superoscillations. We observe the 100-fold contrast enhancement both in our numerical simulations with Gaussian time-domain harmonics and in our experimental realization with narrow-band quasi-sinusoidal terahertz harmonics. Our results will have profound influence on terahertz sensing and imaging applications in medicine, pharmaceuticals, stand-off hazard detection, and nondestructive evaluation.</description>

      <title>A practical guide to Digital Micro-mirror Devices (DMDs) for wavefront shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital micromirror devices have gained popularity in wavefront shaping, offering a high frame rate alternative to liquid crystal spatial light modulators. They are relatively inexpensive, offer high resolution, are easy to operate, and a single device can be used in a broad optical bandwidth. However, some technical drawbacks must be considered to achieve optimal performance. These issues, often undocumented by manufacturers, mostly stem from the device's original design for video projection applications. Herein, we present a guide to characterize and mitigate these effects. Our focus is on providing simple and practical solutions that can be easily incorporated into a typical wavefront shaping setup.</description>

      <title>Space-time non-separable dynamics of ultrashort vortex pulse with power exponential spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrashort optical pulses with orbital angular momentum (OAM) owing to their various applications in classical as well as quantum domains attract a lot of research attention. The evolution of their spatio-temporal dynamics is of particular interest. In the present work, we numerically explore the spatio-temporal evolution of ultrashort Laguerre Gauss (LG) vortex with power exponential spectrum, also called power exponential (PE) pulse, in dispersive and nonlinear media. We in particular address the evolution of space-time non-separable ultrashort vortex pulse. The study reveals the asymmetric spatio-temporal evolution and splitting in the spatio-temporal plane. We observe compression at the trailing edge of the pulse with increase in the strength of the nonlinearity. The study further reveals that the temporal, spectral and, chirp evolution patterns of the pulse vary uniquely across different spatial regions and this variation depends upon the strength of nonlinearity and propagation distance. In weak nonlinear regime, a redshift in spectrum is noted as we move radially outward from the bright caustic of ultrashort LG vortex while a blue shifted spectrum emerges on approaching towards the phase singularity. Interestingly, as the pulse furthers in the medium, nonlinearity induced trends in spectral shift is witnessed. With stronger nonlinearity, a complex spectral evolution is observed. Furthermore, we study the evolution of frequency chirp with propagation distance both with weak and strong nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Optimizaci\'on del sistema de iluminaci\'on y proyecci\'on para un sensor multiparam\'etrico acusto-\'optico</title>

Abstract: In previous works we presented a novel multiparametric sensor to simultaneously measure the refractive index and the speed of sound in a liquid by means of the acousto-optic effect. The sensor requires an illumination system that expands the laser beam so that it interacts effectively with the liquid under study. Also, a projection system is necessary in order to adequately capture the diffraction pattern at the cell exit. In this article, we present the optimization of the sensor illumination and projection system using the optical design computational tool Zemax OpticStudio. The considered range of refractive indices of the liquid samples is between 1.33 and 1.51. The results show a correct expansion of the incident beam on the cell, and the projection system achieves an image with very few aberrations and an adequate angular separation between the maxima of the diffraction pattern. Based on the resulting dimensions of the sensor after optimizing the illumination and projection system, we confirm that it is compact and portable.</description>

      <title>Nonclassical optical response of particle plasmons with quantum informed local optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the dimensions of plasmonic structures or the field confinement length approach the mean free path of electrons, mesoscopic optical response effects, including nonlocality, electron density spill-in or spill-out, and Landau damping, are expected to become observable. In this work, we present a quantum-informed local analogue model (QILAM) that maps these nonclassical optical responses onto a local dielectric film. The primary advantage of this model lies in its compatibility with the highly efficient boundary element method (BEM), which includes retardation effects and eliminates the need to incorporate wavevector-dependent permittivity. Furthermore, our approach offers a unified framework that connects two important semiclassical theories: the generalized nonlocal optical response (GNOR) theory and the Feibelman d-parameters formalism. We envision that QILAM could evolve into a multiscale electrodynamic tool for exploring nonclassical optical responses in diverse plasmonic structures in future. This could be achieved by directly translating mesoscopic effects into observable phenomena, such as resonance energy shifts and linewidth broadening in the scattering spectrum.</description>

      <title>Entangled Photon-pair Generation in Nonlinear Thin-films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a fully vectorial and non-paraxial formalism to describe spontaneous parametric down-conversion in nonlinear thin films. The formalism is capable of treating slabs with a sub-wavelength thickness, describe the associated Fabry-P\'erot effects, and even treat absorptive nonlinear materials. With this formalism, we perform an in-depth study of the dynamics of entangled photon-pair generation in nonlinear thin films, to provide a needed theoretical understanding for such systems that have recently attracted much experimental attention as sources of photon pairs. As an important example, we study the far-field radiation properties of photon pairs generated from a high-refractive-index nonlinear thin-film with Zinc-Blende structure, that is deposited on a linear low-refractive-index substrate. In particular, we study the thickness-dependent effect of Fabry-P\'erot interferences on the far-field radiation pattern of the photon pairs. We also pay special attention to study of entanglement generation, and find the conditions under which maximally polarization-entangled photon pairs can be generated and detected in such nonlinear thin-films.</description>
