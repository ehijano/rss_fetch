      <title>MUSEQuBES: Physical conditions, origins, and multi-element abundances of the circumgalactic medium of an isolated, star-forming dwarf galaxy at z=0.57</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In dwarf galaxy models, outflows expel metal-enriched interstellar medium (ISM) into the circumgalactic medium (CGM) to reproduce their observed low metallicities, but measurements of dwarf CGM properties are scarce. We present a study of the CGM of an isolated dwarf at $z=0.5723$ with a stellar mass of $\approx5\times10^7\rm\,M_{\odot}$ and star-formation rate ($\approx0.05\,\rm M_\odot\,yr^{-1}$) and ISM metallicity ($\rm [O/H]\approx-0.9$) consistent with the star-forming main sequence and mass-metallicity relation. A background quasar sightline with archival UV spectra probes the dwarf's CGM at a projected distance of 28 kpc, corresponding to approximately half of the estimated virial radius. The dwarf's CGM is detected in H I, intermediate metal ions of C III, O III, and O IV, and kinematically broader, highly-ionized O VI, but is undetected in N IV and Ne VIII. Photoionization modeling of the intermediate ions indicates a modest volume-filling factor ($\sim 6\%$ along the sightline or $\sim 2\%$ globally), and a mass of $\sim2\times10^8 {\rm\,M_\odot}$, $\sim4\times$ higher than the dwarf's stellar mass, but $\sim10\times$ less than the highly ionized CGM. The O VI kinematics are comparable to the dwarf's estimated virial velocity, suggesting it is likely associated with cool, photoionized, and volume-filling CGM, with bulk motion or turbulence dominating over thermal pressure. The metallicity inferred for the intermediate ions is $\rm [O/H]=-0.6$, but with low relative abundances of $\rm [C/O]=-0.6$ and $\rm [N/O]&lt;-0.9$. The [N/O] is below levels expected of the dwarf's ISM, but consistent with core-collapse supernova ejecta, suggesting that supernova-enriched gas escaped the dwarf without mixing significantly with ISM enriched in nitrogen from evolved, low-mass stars.</description>

      <title>Beyond the stars: Linking H$\alpha$ sizes, kinematics, and star formation in galaxies at $z\approx 4-6$ with JWST grism surveys and $\texttt{geko}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how galaxies assemble their mass during the first billion years of cosmic time is a central goal of extragalactic astrophysics, yet joint constraints on their sizes and kinematics remain scarce. We present one of the first statistical studies of the $\mathrm{H}\alpha$ size-mass relation at high redshift with a sample of 213 galaxies at spectroscopic redshifts of $z\approx 4-6$ from the FRESCO and CONGRESS NIRCam grism surveys. We measure the $\mathrm{H}\alpha$ morphology and kinematics of our sample using the novel forward modelling Bayesian inference tool $\texttt{geko}$, and complement them with stellar continuum sizes in the rest-frame FUV, NUV, and optical, obtained from modelling of imaging data from the JADES survey with $\texttt{Pysersic}$. At $z\approx5$, we find that the average H$\alpha$ sizes are larger than the stellar continuum (FUV, NUV and optical), with $r_{\rm e, H\alpha}= 1.17 \pm 0.05$ kpc and $r_{\rm e,cont} \approx 0.9$ kpc for galaxies with $\log(M_{\star} ~\rm [M_{\odot}])= 9.5$. However, we find no significant differences between the stellar continuum sizes at different wavelengths, suggesting that galaxies are not yet steadily growing inside-out at these epochs. Instead, we find that the ratio $r_{\rm e, H\alpha}/r_{\rm e, NUV}$ increases with the distance above the star-forming main sequence ($\Delta \rm MS$), consistent with an expansion of H$\alpha$ sizes during episodes of enhanced star formation caused by an increase in ionising photons. As galaxies move above the star-forming main sequence, we find an increase of their rotational support $v/\sigma$, which could be tracing accreting gas illuminated by the \Ha\ emission. Finally, we find that about half of the elongated systems ($b/a &lt; 0.5$) are not rotationally supported, indicating a potential flattened/prolate galaxy population at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Comparing XRISM cluster velocity dispersions with predictions from cosmological simulations: are feedback models too ejective?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of the intra-cluster medium (ICM), the hot plasma that fills galaxy clusters, are shaped by gravity-driven cluster mergers and feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBH) in the cluster cores. XRISM measurements of ICM velocities in several clusters offer insights into these processes. We compare XRISM measurements for nine galaxy clusters (Virgo, Perseus, Centaurus, Hydra A, PKS\,0745--19, A2029, Coma, A2319, Ophiuchus) with predictions from three state-of-the-art cosmological simulation suites, TNG-Cluster, The Three Hundred Project GADGET-X, and GIZMO-SIMBA, that employ different models of feedback. In cool cores, XRISM reveals systematically lower velocity dispersions than the simulations predict, with all ten measurements below the median simulated values by a factor $1.5-1.7$ on average and all falling within the bottom $10\%$ of the predicted distributions. The observed kinetic-to-total pressure ratio is also lower, with a median value of $2.2\%$, compared to the predicted $5.0-6.5\%$ for the three simulations. Outside the cool cores and in non-cool-core clusters, simulations show better agreement with XRISM measurements, except for the outskirts of the relaxed, cool-core cluster A2029, which exhibits an exceptionally low kinetic pressure support ($&lt;1\%$), with none of the simulated systems in either of the three suites reaching such low levels. The non-cool-core Coma and A2319 exhibit dispersions at the lower end but within the simulated spread. Our comparison suggests that the three numerical models may overestimate the kinetic effects of SMBH feedback in cluster cores. Additional XRISM observations of non-cool-core clusters will clarify if there is a systematic tension in the gravity-dominated regime as well.</description>

      <title>Preferential Accretion onto the Secondary Black Hole Strengthens Gravitational Wave Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays have recently found evidence for nanohertz gravitational waves that are consistent with being produced by a cosmological population of binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, the amplitude of this gravitational wave background is larger than predicted from theoretical and empirical models of SMBH binary populations. We investigate preferential accretion onto the secondary, less massive SMBH of the binary as a potential solution to this discrepancy. We carry out the first observationally-based analysis of the effect of preferential accretion on the SMBH binary population, and we find that preferential accretion onto the secondary SMBH increases the binary SMBH mass ratio, causing many minor galaxy mergers to lead to major SMBH mergers. The fraction of SMBH mergers that are major mergers increases by a factor of 2-3 when preferential accretion is included. Further, we find that only a small amount of preferential accretion (10% total SMBH mass growth) is needed to bring the predicted gravitational wave background amplitude into agreement with observations. Preferential accretion has an even larger effect on gravitational wave signals detected by LISA, which will probe SMBH binaries at higher redshifts where the environment is more gas-rich, and can also help explain the rapid build up of overmassive black holes at high redshifts observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. It also shortens the time to the first detection of an individual SMBH binary emitting continuous waves. Preferential accretion strengthens the gravitational wave signals produced by any binary embedded in a circumbinary disk, including LIGO sources.</description>

      <title>Asymmetries in stellar streams induced by a galactic merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar streams are sensitive to perturbations from, e.g., giant molecular clouds, bars and spiral arms, infalling dwarf galaxies, or globular clusters which can imprint gaps, clumps, spurs, and asymmetries in tails. In addition to these effects, the impact of a galactic major merger on a population of stellar streams remains to be explored. Here, we focus on the emergence and longevity of asymmetries between the leading and trailing tails of streams caused by such interactions. We run collisionless N-body simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy hosting 36 globular cluster streams and merging with a perturber galaxy. We propose a new asymmetry metric to quantify the structural differences between both tails from their respective cumulative density profiles. We find that the over- and under-densities along streams induced by the merger depend on the orbital characteristics of their progenitors. The non-simultaneity of this effect from stream to stream implies that global asymmetry signatures are less prominent than in individual cases. These population-averaged imprints remain detectable over only 2.5 Gyr but asymmetric signatures can persist over much longer periods for individual streams with wide orbits that have been perturbed prior to coalescence. We thus caution that the interpretation of streams' morphology in the context of dark matter mapping is strongly subject to degeneracies and should be performed considering the merger history of the host.</description>

      <title>A Walk on the Retrograde Side (WRS) project. II. Chemistry to disentangle in situ and accreted components in Thamnos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of the first systematic and dedicated high-resolution chemical analysis of the Thamnos substructure, a candidate relic of the process of hierarchical merger of the Milky Way. The analysis is perfomed in comparison with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) remnant, within the fully self-consistent and homogeneous framework established by the WRS project. We analyse high-resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio spectra obtained with UVES at VLT for 212 Red Giant Branch stars classified as candidate members of Thamnos and GSE, based on selections in the space of the integrals of motion. We derive precise abundances for 16 atomic species. Compared to GSE, stars attributed to the Thamnos substructure are, on average, more metal-poor, yet most of them show relatively higher [X/Fe] abundance ratios in several elements, like Na, Mg, Al, Ca, Cu, Zn, as well as lower [Eu/Fe]. The majority of candidate Thamnos stars show chemical signatures more consistent with the in situ Milky Way halo rather than a typical low-mass accreted dwarf galaxy. Our findings are further supported by comparisons with tailored galactic chemical evolution models, which fall short in reproducing the observed enhancement in the $\alpha$-elements, but are able to fit the more metal-poor component present in the Thamnos substructure. These results confirm a high level of contamination in the Thamnos substructure from the in situ population and to a lesser degree from GSE, while still leaving room for a genuine accreted population from a small disrupted dwarf galaxy.</description>

      <title>MEGATRON: Disentangling Physical Processes and Observational Bias in the Multi-Phase ISM of High-Redshift Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Now detected out to redshifts of $z\sim 14.5$, the rest-frame ultraviolet and optical spectra of galaxies encode numerous physical properties of the interstellar medium (ISM). Accurately extracting these properties from spectra remains a key challenge that numerical simulations are uniquely suited to address. We present a study of the observed ISM of galaxies in MEGATRON: a suite of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations coupled to on-the-fly non-equilibrium thermochemistry, with multiple prescriptions for star formation/feedback and parsec-scale resolution; capable of directly predicting spectroscopic properties of early galaxies. We find that irrespective of feedback physics used, the ISM of high-redshift galaxies is denser, less metal enriched, and subject to higher ionization parameters and radiation fields compared to similar mass galaxies in the local Universe -- in agreement with interpretations of JWST observations. Using common observational techniques to infer bulk galaxy properties, we find that ISM gas density controls the slope of the mass-metallicity relation. Similarly, at the densities reached in some high-redshift galaxies, O32 becomes a density tracer rather than one of ionization parameter. This motivates the use of other line ratios like C43 and N43 to infer the ionization state of the gas. Finally, various feedback models populate different regions of strong-line diagnostic diagrams as the line ratios are sensitive to the feedback-modulated density-temperature structure of the ISM. Therefore, observed strong-line diagnostics can provide a strong constraint on the underlying physics of star formation and feedback in the high-redshift Universe.</description>

      <title>Evidence of violation of Case B recombination in Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Little Red Dots (LRDs) are a new class of compact extragalactic objects, with a v-shaped optical spectral energy distribution breaking close to the Balmer break wavelength, and broad, typically exponentially-shaped lines. They are believed to be supermassive black holes surrounded by very dense, ionized gas, leading us to explore for any departures from Case B recombination by examining the ratios of multiple hydrogen Balmer lines: $H\alpha$, $H\beta$, $H\gamma$, and $H\delta$. We analyze a dozen high-S/N LRDs with JWST/NIRSpec, measuring Balmer ratios in the seven objects with coverage of at least three lines. We decompose the line ratios into their respective broad and narrow components. Broad line ratios are consistent with Case B plus dust extinction in all objects but one, RUBIES EGS-49140, which departs from Case B expectations by more than $5\sigma$. The narrow components are consistent with minimal dust attenuation, while two objects exhibit narrow $H\alpha$/$H\beta \approx 1.8$. Such low decrements are observed in highly ionized density bounded nebulae, associated with starburst environments. Nevertheless, both flat decrement cases can be reconciled assuming an unresolved absorption feature. RUBIES EGS-49140, shows a high broad $H\alpha$/$H\beta$, but $H\gamma$/$H\alpha$ and $H\delta$/$H\alpha$ ratios are lower than expected for extinction-modified Case B, hinting at an unphysically steep dust law. These line ratios may be due to increased optical depth in the Balmer lines, as a direct effect of high density (log$n_e$ &gt; 9) gas surrounding the black hole. If Case B recombination does hold in most LRDs, they must be moderate-to-heavily dust obscured ($A_V\simeq1-8$) while the host-galaxy should be dust-free, suggesting that the extinction in the broad lines is local to the LRD and not due to the general ISM of the host galaxy.</description>

      <title>The rise and fall of Little Red Dots could be driven by the environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Little Red Dot (LRD) paradigm comprises three main unknowns that are intrinsically connected: (1) What is the nature of these sources? (2) How do they form? (3) How do they evolve? Larger spectroscopic samples and high-resolution data are needed to delve deeper into the mechanisms ruling these sources. Understanding their formation and evolution requires identifying the rise and fall of the key features that characterize these systems, such as their compactness and ``V''-shaped spectral energy distributions. In this work, we present a galaxy system nicknamed The Stingray that was identified in the Canadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). This group contains three sources at $z_{\mathrm{spec}} = 5.12$, including an active galactic nucleus (AGN), a Balmer break galaxy, and a star-forming satellite. The latter resembles a Building Block System in which interactions boost stellar mass and black hole mass growth beyond what is expected from secular processes alone. The AGN in this system exhibits features indicative of a transitional object, bridging a normal AGN and an LRD phase. These are a blue rest-frame ultraviolet slope, compact size, and a broad H$\alpha$ line (all of which are characteristic of LRDs), but a flatter rest-frame optical slope compared to that observed in LRDs. The features in this source point to the emergence or fading of an LRD, potentially triggered by environmental effects.</description>

      <title>Ionized gas components in low surface brightness galaxy AGC 111629</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present integral field spectroscopy of ionized gas components in AGC 111629, an edge-on low surface brightness galaxy (LSBG) with a stellar mass of 5.7$\times$10$^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$. AGC 111629 displays an irregular H$\alpha$ morphology and an arch-like structure in the extraplanar region, which is absent in continuous stellar image. The irregular H$\alpha$ morphology may be related to a past merger event with its satellite galaxy AGC 748815. A peanut-shaped structure at the center in the integrated [OIII]$\lambda$5007 map, with a position angle that differs from that of the main stellar disk. This structure exhibits a higher [OIII]$\lambda$5007/H$\beta$ flux ratio, a larger equivalent width (EW) of [OIII]$\lambda$5007, and a lower H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ flux radio ($&lt;$ 2.86). Some spaxels associated with the peanut-shaped structure fall within the composite region of the BPT diagram based on [NII]$\lambda$6583. These features may be associated with the central AGN. Additionally, a sub-peak in the southern disk is clearly visible in the [OIII]$\lambda$5007 map. An extended region ($\sim$ 2 kpc) with an extremely low value of H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ flux ratio is observed near this sub-peak. We interpret the sub-peak as a superbubble likely driven by supernova explosions in the southern disk. We derive the gas-phase metallicity, 12+log(O/H), using the [NII]$\lambda$6583/H$\alpha$ diagnostic and find that AGC 111629 exhibits low central metallicity.

      <title>Formation of A Nuclear Star Cluster Through A Merger Event In The Low Surface Brightness Galaxy AGC 223218</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the properties of the nuclear star cluster (NSC) in the low surface brightness galaxy AGC 223218. The disk of the galaxy can be modeled using two S$\acute{\rm e}$rsic components with distinct central positions: one representing the inner bright disk and the other corresponding to the extended outer disk. We estimate the stellar masses of the NSC and the host galaxy using two methods: spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting and mass-to-light versus color relations (MLCRs). The stellar mass ratio of the NSC to AGC 223218 is 0.094 based on the SED method and 0.072 using MLCRs. The NSC presents a younger stellar population and a lower [Fe/H] value than the host, as determined from SDSS and LAMOST spectra analysis using pPXF fitting. AGC 223218 is located at the boundary between the Seyfert and star-forming regions in the [SII]-BPT diagram, whereas in the [NII]-BPT diagram, it falls in the track of star-forming SDSS galaxies. This suggests the presence of strong shocks in AGC 223218. We propose that the NSC in AGC 223218 may have formed as a result of a merger event. Furthermore, the observed X-ray luminosity of AGC 223218 with eROSITA is two orders of magnitude higher than the expected X-ray luminosity from X-ray binaries, suggesting the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the NSC. To account for the observed X-ray luminosity, we estimate the IMBH accretion rate to be approximately 0.001.</description>

      <title>The Star-forming Main Sequence and Bursty Star-formation Histories at $z&gt;1.4$ in JADES and AURORA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze JWST spectroscopic and HST+JWST photometric observations of 659 star-forming galaxies at $1.4 &lt; z &lt; 9$ from DR3 of the JADES survey and the AURORA Cycle 1 program. We measure the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) for galaxies above $10^{8.5}\rm\ M_\odot$ where the sample is largely representative, estimating star-formation rates (SFRs) using the H$\alpha$ line flux and rest-frame far UV (1600\AA) continuum measurements, each independently corrected for dust attenuation. We find that the intrinsic, measurement-error-subtracted scatter in the SFMS ($\sigma_{\rm int}$) increases with decreasing stellar mass for the H$\alpha$-based SFMS, and we find no mass dependence of $\sigma_{\rm int}$ in the UV-based SFMS. Additionally, we find that $\sigma_{\rm int}$ decreases with increasing redshift, from $0.36^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ dex to $0.22^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ dex (H$\alpha$ SFMS), and from $0.28^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ dex to $0.20^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ dex (UV SFMS) between $z\sim2$ and $z\sim 6.5$. We also measure the redshift evolution of the specific SFR and find that, assuming $\rm sSFR\propto (1+z)^\gamma$, $\gamma=1.89^{+0.16}_{-0.15}$ for the H$\alpha$-based SFMS, and $\gamma=1.36^{+0.13}_{-0.13}$ for the UV-based SFMS. Analyzing the observed H$\alpha$/UV luminosity ratios and star-formation histories from the {\sc prospector} fitting code, we find that 41--60\% of the sample is inconsistent with having a constant star-formation history. Finally, we find tentative evidence for shorter SFR burst timescales with increasing redshift based on the distribution of $\rm L_{H\alpha}/\nu L_{\nu,1600}$ vs. $\Delta\rm \log(L_{H\alpha})$. Taken together, these results are consistent with theoretical predictions of bursty star formation in the early Universe and provide valuable constraints for theoretical models of galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Spectropolarimetry of NGC 1275 reveals a narrow-line radio galaxy with polarization parallel to its radio jet axis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concomitant with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observation of the Perseus cluster, we obtained optical spectropolarimetry of its central active galactic nucleus, NGC 1275, using the Alhambra Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (ALFOSC) on the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT). While the total-light spectrum confirms its edge-on, core obscured (type-2) classification, the polarized spectrum shows a polarization angle aligned with the arcsecond radio jet axis -- an exceptional behavior for type-2 objects. Our polarization analysis also reveals wavelength-dependent linear polarization at level 2-3% in the continuum, likely rising from a combination of variable syn</description>

      <title>3D B-fieLds in the InterStellar medium and Star-forming regions (3D-BLISS): I. Using Starlight Polarization in Massive IRDC Filament G11.11-0.12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional magnetic fields (3D B-fields) are essential to understand the formation and evolution of the interstellar medium and multi-scale star formation; however, the accurate measurement of 3D B-fields is still challenging. The angle of dust polarization by magnetically aligned grains provides the projected B-fields onto the plane-of-sky, while the degree of dust polarization provides the B-field's inclination angles with respect to the line-of-sight. Our previous theoretical studies proposed a new method of probing 3D B-fields using dust polarization combined with the Radiative Torque (RAT) alignment theory and demonstrated the accurate inference of B-field inclination angles using synthetic polarization data. In this paper, we report the first application of the new technique to study 3D B-fields and dust properties in the G11.11-0.12 filament (hereafter G11) from starlight polarization observations taken by ISRF/SIRPOL at $2.19\,\rm\mu m$. Using both observed starlight polarization and optical dust extinction curve from Gaia mission, we constrained the maximum grain size of $0.25\,\rm\mu m$ and the grain elongation with an axial ratio of $s\gtrsim 1.4$ in the outer regions of G11. We calculated the alignment properties in the G11 by using the \textsc{DustPOL\_py} code based on the RAT theory. The B-field's inclination angles are then inferred from the observed starlight polarization efficiency when the grain alignment is included, showing the inclined B-fields in the G11 with a mean angle of $\sim 50$ degrees. From these inferred inclination angles, we found evidence of the local 3D arc-shaped B-field structure toward the sightline. These findings are important for fully understanding 3D B-field's roles in the formation and evolution of massive filamentary clouds.</description>

      <title>Warm absorber outflows in radio-loud active galactic nucleus 3C~59</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both jets and ionized outflows in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are thought to play important roles in affecting the star formation and evolution of host galaxies, but their relationship is still unclear. As a pilot study, we performed a detailed spectral analysis for a radio-loud (RL) AGN 3C~59 ($z=0.1096$) by systematically considering various factors that may affect the fitting results, and thereby establishing a general spectral fitting strategy for subsequent research with larger sample. 3C~59 is one rare target for simultaneously studying jets and warm absorbers (WAs) that is one type of ionized outflows. Based on the multi-wavelength data from near-infrared (NIR) to hard X-ray bands detected by DESI, GALEX, and XMM-Newton, we used SPEX code to build broadband continuum models and perform photoionization modeling with PION code to constrain the physical parameters of WAs in 3C~59. We found two WAs with ionization parameter of $\log [\xi/(\rm{erg\ cm\ s}^{-1})] = 2.65^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$ and $1.65\pm 0.11$, respectively, and their outflowing velocities are $v_{\rm out} = -528^{+163}_{-222}\ \rm{km\ s}^{-1}$ and $-228^{+121}_{-122}\ \rm{km\ s}^{-1}$, respectively. These WAs are located between outer torus and narrow (emission-)line region, and their positive $v_{\rm out}$-$\xi$ relation can be explained by the radiation-pressure-driven mechanism. We found that the estimations of these physical properties are affected by the different spectral fitting strategies, such as the inclusion of NIR to ultra-violet data, the choice of energy range of spectrum, or the composition of the spectral energy distribution. Based on the same fitting strategy, this work presents a comparative study of outflow driven mechanism between a RL AGN (3C 59) and a radio-quiet AGN (NGC 3227), which suggests a similar driven mechanism of their WA outflows and a negligible role of jets in this process.</description>

      <title>A Sample of HeII {\lambda}4686 "Changing-Look" Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first systematic search for "changing-look" ("CL") behavior in the broad He ii {\lambda}4686 emission line in quasars, utilizing repeated spectroscopy from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The He ii line, originating from high-ionization gas and powered by extreme ultraviolet photons, serves as a sensitive tracer of changes in the ionizing continuum. After applying strict spectral selection criteria and visual inspection to a parent sample of over 9,000 quasars with multi-epoch spectra, we identify a sample of 34 He ii "changing-look" quasars that show a significant appearance or disappearance of the broad He ii {\lambda}4686 line. Compared with previously known H\{beta} "CL" quasars, the He ii "CL" sample exhibits similarly strong continuum variability and broad-line flux changes, yet shows a preference for higher Eddington ratios and lower host-galaxy contamination. These results highlight the value of He ii line in studying the central variable engines of AGNs and uncovering a more complete census of extreme quasar variability. A comparison with H\{beta} "CL" further underscores the profound selection biases inherent in "changing-look" studies, especially those associated with line strength, host-galaxy contamination, and spectral signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>JWST observations of photodissociation regions: II. Warm molecular Hydrogen spectroscopy in the Horsehead nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: H2 is the most abundant molecule in the interstellar medium and is a useful tool to study photodissociation regions, where radiative feedback from massive stars on molecular clouds is dominant. The James Webb Space Telescope, with its high spatial resolution, sensitivity, and wavelength coverage provides unique access to the detection of most of H2 lines and the analysis of its spatial morphology. Our goal is to use H2 line emission detected with the JWST in the Horsehead nebula to constrain the physical parameters (e.g., extinction, gas temperature, thermal pressure) throughout the PDR and its geometry. The study of H2 morphology reveals that FUV-pumped lines peak closer to the edge of the PDR than thermalized lines. From H2 lines, we estimate the value of extinction throughout the PDR. We find that AV is increasing from the edge of the PDR to the second and third H2 filaments. Then, we study the H2 excitation in different regions across the PDR. The temperature profile shows that the observed gas temperature is quite constant throughout the PDR, with a slight decline in each of the dissociation fronts. This study also reveals that the OPR is far from equilibrium. We observe a spatial separation of para and ortho rovibrational levels, indicating that efficient ortho-para conversion and preferential ortho self-shielding are driving the spatial variations of the OPR. Finally, we derive a thermal pressure in the first filament around P &gt; 6x10$^6$ K cm$^{-3}$, about ten times higher than that of the ionized gas. We highlight that template stationary 1D PDR models cannot account for the intrinsic 2D structure and the very high temperature observed in the Horsehead nebula. We argue the highly excited, over-pressurized H2 gas at the edge of the PDR interface could originate from the mixing between the cold and hot phase induced by the photo-evaporation of the cloud.</description>

      <title>MEGATRON: The environments of Population III stars at Cosmic Dawn and their connection to present day galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results of Pop. III formation in the MEGATRON suite of simulations, which self-consistently follows radiation and non-equilibrium chemistry, and resolves gas at near-pc resolution of a Milky Way-mass halo at Cosmic Dawn. While the very first Pop. III stars form in halos with masses well below the atomic cooling limit, whose cooling is dominated by molecular hydrogen, the majority of Pop. III stars form in more massive systems above the $10^4$~K atomic cooling threshold. The shift in cooling regime of halos hosting new Pop. III stars occurs within $100$ Myr of the first Pop. III star as the Lyman-Werner (LW) background rapidly increases to $10^{-21}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,Hz^{-1}\,sr^{-1}$. We find that the global Pop. III star formation rate stabilizes to a value of $10^{-3}\,\rm M_\odot\,yr^{-1}$ at $z=20$. Among the three processes that quench Pop. III star formation in mini-halos, the LW background, gas starvation, and external chemical enrichment, the LW background is most important. A small fraction of haloes undergo multiple episodes of Pop. III star formation when the earlier forming stars all directly collapse to black holes. If the halos become massive enough, they can form up to $\sim100$ Pop. III stars in a single burst, which may be observable by JWST with moderate gravitational lensing. Pop. III stars form at a wide range of distances from UV-bright galaxies, with only $0.06\%$ of Pop. III stars forming within the virial radius of galaxies with $M_{\rm UV} &lt; -17$. Finally, by tracking Pop. III star remnants down to $z=0$, we find that $75-80\,$% reside in the stellar halo of our simulated Milky Way analogue, while the remainder are gravitationally bound to lower-mass systems, including satellite halos.</description>

      <title>Unlocking AGN Variability with Custom ZTF Photometry for High-Fidelity Light Curves and Robust Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged)We explore the potential of optical variability selection methods to identify AGN, including those challenging to detect with conventional techniques. Using the unprecedented combination of depth, sky coverage, and cadence of the ZTF survey, we target even starlight-dominated AGN, known for their redder colours, weaker variability signals, and difficult nuclear photometry due to their resolved hosts. We perform aperture photometry on ZTF reference-subtracted images for 40 million sources across 8,000 deg^2, assemble light curves and classify objects employing an RF algorithm into 14 classes, including 341,938 candidate AGN. We compare variability metrics derived from our photometry to those obtained from ZTF Data Release light curves (DR11-psf), to assess the impact of our analysis. We find that the fraction of low-z quiescent galaxies exhibiting significant variability drops dramatically (from 98\% of the sample to 7\%) when replacing the DR11-psf light curves with our difference image, aperture photometry (DI-Ap) version. The overall number of variable low-z AGN remains high (99\% when using DR11-psf lightcurves, 83\% when using DI-Ap), however, implying that our photometry can detect the fainter variability in host dominated AGN. The classifier effectively distinguishes between AGN and other sources, demonstrating high recovery rates even for AGN in resolved nearby galaxies. AGN candidates in eROSITA's eFEDS field, detected in X-rays and bright enough for ZTF optical observations, were classified as AGN (79\%) and non-variable galaxies (20\%). These groups show a 2 dex difference in X-ray luminosity but not in X-ray flux. A significant fraction of X-ray AGN are optically too faint for ZTF, and conversely, a quarter of ZTF AGN in the eFEDS area lack X-ray detections, highlighting a wide range of X-ray-to-optical flux ratios in AGN.</description>

      <title>The radial acceleration relation at the EDGE of galaxy formation: testing its universality in low-mass dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tight correlation between the baryonic and observed acceleration of galaxies has been reported over a wide range of mass ($10^8 &lt; M_{\rm bar}/{\rm M}_\odot &lt; 10^{11}$) - the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR). This has been interpreted as evidence that dark matter is actually a manifestation of some modified weak-field gravity theory. In this paper, we study the radially resolved RAR of 12 nearby dwarf galaxies, with baryonic masses in the range $10^4 &lt; M_{\rm bar}/{\rm M}_\odot &lt; 10^{7.5}$, using a combination of literature data and data from the MUSE-Faint survey. We use stellar line-of-sight velocities and the Jeans modelling code GravSphere to infer the mass distributions of these galaxies, allowing us to compute the RAR. We compare the results with the EDGE simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies with similar stellar masses in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We find that most of the observed dwarf galaxies lie systematically above the low-mass extrapolation of the RAR. Each galaxy traces a locus in the RAR space that can have a multi-valued observed acceleration for a given baryonic acceleration, while there is significant scatter from galaxy to galaxy. Our results indicate that the RAR does not apply to low-mass dwarf galaxies and that the inferred baryonic acceleration of these dwarfs does not contain enough information, on its own, to derive the observed acceleration. The simulated EDGE dwarfs behave similarly to the real data, lying systematically above the extrapolated RAR. We show that, in the context of modified weak-field gravity theories, these results cannot be explained by differential tidal forces from the Milky Way, nor by the galaxies being far from dynamical equilibrium, since none of the galaxies in our sample seems to experience strong tides. As such, our results provide further evidence for the need for invisible dark matter in the smallest dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Globular Cluster Evolution with Multiple Stellar Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of stars with light-element abundance variations in globular clusters and the subsequent dynamical evolution of these multiple populations remains an open question. One of the most widely discussed is the AGB scenario, in which chemically processed material from the envelopes of AGB stars mixes with re-accreted primordial gas flowing into the center of the cluster. Based on this scenario, more than two hundred MOCCA simulations of cluster evolution have been carried out, incorporating additional physical processes related to the external environment of globular clusters and the initial properties of multiple stellar populations. Analysis of the simulations shows that most observed properties of multiple stellar populations and the global parameters of Milky Way clusters are well reproduced, with the exception of the correlation between cluster mass and the fraction of second-population stars. We present a speculative scenario of globular cluster evolution that may account for the observed properties of Milky Way clusters, including the correlation between cluster mass and the fraction of enriched stars. The scenario further predicts that, under certain conditions, the pristine first population can be more centrally concentrated than the enriched second population, as observed in some clusters. \end{abstract</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Techniques to Distinguish Giant Stars from Dwarf Stars Using Only Photometry -- Pushing Redwards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our photometric method, which combines Subaru/HSC $NB515$, g, and i band filters to distinguish giant stars in Local Group galaxies from Milky Way dwarf contamination. The $NB515$ filter is a narrow-band filter that covers the MgI+MgH features at $5150$ \r{A}, and is sensitive to stellar surface gravity. Using synthetic photometry derived from large empirical stellar spectral libraries, we model the $NB515$ filter's sensitivity to stellar atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances. Our results demonstrate that the $NB515$ filter effectively separates dwarfs from giants, even for the reddest and coolest M-type stars. To further enhance this separation, we develop machine learning models that improve the classification on the two-color ($g-i$, $NB515-g$) diagram. We apply these models to photometric data from the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy and two fields of M31, successfully identifying red giant branch stars in these galaxies.</description>

      <title>The formation of Gaia BH3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gaia collaboration announced the discovery of a massive black hole (BH) with a low-mass giant star companion, Gaia BH3, located in the ED-2 stellar stream. The properties of Gaia BH3 bridge the gap between known Milky Way BHs and extragalactic BHs found with gravitational waves (GWs). We aim to determine the most likely formation scenario for Gaia BH3 in the progenitor cluster of the ED-2 stream. We perform $N$-body simulations of that progenitor cluster and find that, most likely, Gaia BH3 formed from a stellar binary that formed during cluster formation, which then underwent multiple dynamical interactions that significantly altered its properties, including exchanging the companion star. We highlight the importance of cluster dynamics and discard a formation scenario where it evolved in quasi-isolation.</description>

      <title>Beyond diagnostic-diagrams: A critical exploration on the classification of ionization processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical emission-line diagnostic diagrams, such as the classical BPT, are widely used to identify ionisation mechanisms in galaxies but often suffer from degeneracies, especially when multiple sources coexist. We critically evaluate the effectiveness of these diagnostics in distinguishing star-forming galaxies, retired galaxies (RGs), and active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and propose refined methods to reduce misclassifications. Using a large sample of nearby galaxies from the NASA-Sloan Atlas cross-matched with SDSS spectroscopy, we define representative subsamples of late-type/star-forming galaxies, early-type/RGs, and multiwavelength-selected AGNs. Their distributions are analysed across traditional and modern diagnostics, including WHaN, WHaD, and the newly introduced WHaO diagram, which combine H{\alpha} equivalent width with [N II]/H{\alpha}, {\sigma}(H{\alpha}), and [O III]/[O II], respectively. Quantitative comparisons reveal that classical BPT diagrams overestimate star-forming galaxies by ~10% and misclassify up to 45% of AGNs and nearly all RGs. Diagnostics incorporating EW(H{\alpha}) achieve improved accuracy, reducing misclassifications to {\sim} 20\ % for AGNs and {\sim} 15\% for RGs. A revised classification scheme based on EW(H{\alpha}) thresholds and consistent WHaD/WHaO results yields the highest purity (8-25% misclassifications) and better reflects underlying physical conditions. Our analysis demonstrates that BPT-based methods fail to reliably separate ionisation mechanisms, particularly in galaxies hosting weak AGNs or evolved stellar populations. Updated EW(H{\alpha})-based diagnostics offer a more accurate framework for studying galaxy ionisation and should replace traditional schemes in future population studies.</description>

      <title>Confirming Near- to Mid-IR Photometrically-Identified Obscured AGNs in the JWST era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the underlying assumptions for the identification of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) through near- and mid-infrared photometry and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting out to z ~ 3. For massive galaxies, log(M) &gt; 9.5, our high resolution spectra of the rest optical range generally confirm the results of SED fitting, which relies primarily on excesses above the stellar emission between 1 and 6 microns to identify AGN. However, the method is undermined if the redshift used for the SED fitting is incorrect. Low mass galaxies, log(M) &lt; 9:5, can contain relatively warm dust that emits in the 4 - 6 micron range. We show that the potential contamination of AGN samples by purely star forming low-mass galaxies can be avoided by the use of the infrared properties of Haro 11 as a limiting star-forming SED template. However, relatively few star forming galaxies emit as strongly in the 3 - 6 micron range as this template, so this could result in missing some obscured AGNs to avoid a minor contamination. Including the behavior of the galaxies at rest lamda ~ 13.5 microns can mitigate this problem and yield more complete samples of bona fide AGN. JWST/MIRI supports this approach out to z ~ 0.6.</description>

      <title>A Deep Look into the Intermediate-Age Open Cluster NGC 2506: What Binary Systems Reveal About Cluster Distance and Age</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using high-precision observations from the space-based \textit{Gaia} and \textit{TESS} missions, complemented by ground-based spectroscopic data and multi-band photometric surveys, we perform a detailed investigation of the Galactic open cluster NGC~2506. We present a new analysis of the intermediate-age open cluster NGC~2506, using joint fits to the radial velocities (RVs) and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of five double-lined binary systems, including two eclipsing binaries. The analysis yields self-consistent estimates of the cluster's age, distance, and extinction, based on 18 free parameters: 10 stellar masses, 5 orbital inclinations, and common values for age, distance, and $A_V$. The SED fitting incorporates stellar isochrones, and the resulting parameters are examined through HR diagrams (R--$T_{\rm eff}$, R--M, and M--$T_{\rm eff}$) to assess evolutionary consistency. The age we derive for the cluster is $1.94 \pm 0.03$ Gyr for an assumed [Fe/H] = -0.30, and a fitting formula is given for extrapolation to other metallicities. The distance we find from the SED fitting is $3189 \pm 53$ pc, and this is to be compared with our own inference from the Gaia data which is $3105 \pm 75$ pc, based on 919 stars identified as cluster members. Our results demonstrate the power of binary systems in tightly constraining cluster-wide age and distance at this evolutionary stage. This approach represents one of the most accurate characterizations of an intermediate-age open cluster using multiple binary systems.</description>

      <title>A chemodynamical study of $r$-process-enhanced stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $r$-process enrichment in the Galaxy still remains elusive with regard to its nucleosynthesis conditions and the astrophysical sites where it occurs. As part of ongoing efforts to pinpoint the origin of chemically peculiar $r$-process-enhanced (RPE) stars, we concentrate in this study on the kinematics of RPE stars to investigate possible variations in the $r$-process enrichment among the Galactic components. We calculate the orbital parameters of a sample of 472 metal-poor RPE stars and associate them to the Galactic bulge, disk and halo populations using a physically motivated classification based on apocenter distance and maximum absolute vertical height of the orbit. We show that the Toomre diagram does not properly separate stars in the disk and halo components when they are on highly eccentric and/or retrograde orbits. The Galactic disk and halo share a similar fraction of RPE stars, in contrast to the earlier perception that the majority of RPE stars belong to the halo. We find that the stars most likely to be accreted belong to the halo. However, 3/4 of the stars lie in a mixed-zone. The inner disk, inner halo and outer halo stars exhibit similar abundance trends for the n-capture elements.</description>

      <title>Low-noise Fourier Transform Spectroscopy Enabled by Superconducting On-Chip Filterbank Spectrometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Historically employed spectroscopic architectures used for large field of view mapping spectroscopy in millimetere and sub-millimetre astronomy suffer from significant drawbacks. On-chip filterbank spectrometers are a promising technology in this respect; however, they must overcome an orders-of-magnitude increase in detector counts, efficiency loss due to dielectric properties, and stringent fabrication tolerances that currently limit scaling to resolutions of order 1000 over a large array. We propose coupling a medium-resolution Fourier transform spectrometer to a low-resolution filterbank spectrometer focal plane, which serves as a post-dispersion element. In this arrangement, medium resolution imaging spectroscopy is provided by the Fourier transform spectrometer, while the low resolution filterbank spectrometer serves to decrease the photon noise inherent in typical broadband Fourier transform spectrometer measurements by over an order of magnitude. This is achieved while maintaining the excellent imaging advantages of both architectures. We present predicted mapping speeds for a filterbank-dispersed Fourier transform spectrometer from a ground-based site and a balloon-borne platform. We also demonstrate the potential that an instrument of this type has for an R~1000 line intensity mapping experiment using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as an example platform. We demonstrate that a filterbank-dispersed Fourier transform spectrometer would be capable of R~1000 measurements of CO power spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10--100 with surveys of $10^5$--$10^6$ spectrometer hours.</description>

      <title>When vacuum breaks: a self-consistency test for astrophysical environments in extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave signals are typically interpreted under the vacuum hypothesis, i.e. assuming negligible influence from the astrophysical environment. This assumption is expected to break down for low-frequency sources such as extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), which are prime targets for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and are expected to form, at least in part, in dense environments such as Active Galactic Nuclei or dark-matter spikes/cores. Modeling environmental effects parametrically is challenging due to the large uncertainties in their underlying physics. We propose a non-parametric test for environmental effects in EMRIs, based on assessing the self-consistency of vacuum parameter posteriors inferred from different portions of the signal. Our results demonstrate that this approach can reveal the presence of astrophysical environments, or even deviations from General Relativity, without introducing additional parameters or assumptions about the underlying physics.</description>

      <title>Disk fraction among free-floating planetary-mass objects in Upper Scorpius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPs) have been detected through direct imaging within several young, nearby star-forming regions. The properties of circumstellar disks around these objects may provide a valuable probe into their origin, but is currently limited by the small sizes of the sample explored. We aim to perform a statistical study of the occurrence of circumstellar disks down to the planetary-mass regime. We performed a systematic survey of disks among the population identified in the 5-10 Myr-old Upper Scorpius association (USC), restricted to members outside the younger, embedded Ophiuchus region and with estimated masses below 105 M_Jup. We took advantage of unWISE photometry to search for mid-infrared excesses in the WISE (W1-W2) color. We implemented a Bayesian outlier detection method that models the photospheric sequence and computes excess probabilities for each object, enabling statistically sound estimation of disk fractions. We explore disk fractions across an unprecedentedly fine mass grid, reaching down to objects as low as ~6 M_Jup assuming 5 Myr or ~8 M_Jup assuming 10 Myr, thus extending the previous lower boundary of disk fraction studies. Depending on the age, our sample includes between 17 and 40 FFPs. We confirm that the disk fraction steadily rises with decreasing mass and exceeds 30% near the substellar-to-planetary mass boundary at ~13 M_Jup. We find hints of a possible flattening in this trend around 25-45 M_Jup, potentially signaling a transition in the dominant formation processes. This change of trend should be considered with caution and needs to be confirmed with more sensitive observations. Our results are consistent with the gradual dispersal of disks over time, as disk fractions in Upper Scorpius appear systematically lower than those in younger regions.</description>

      <title>The cosmic web's Lyman-$\alpha$ glow at $z \approx 2.5$; varying hydrodynamic models, dust, and wide-field, narrow-band imaging detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffuse glow of the cosmic web in Lyman-$\alpha$ emission has long been predicted, yet remained elusive to direct wide field detection. We present theoretical calculations that, when compared with recent observations made using the Condor Array Telescope in New Mexico reported in Lanzetta et al. 2024, point to its discovery at $z \approx 2.5$. Synthetic Lyman-$\alpha$ surface brightness maps are constructed from five state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations (Illustris-TNG, SIMBA, EAGLE, CROCODILE, and Sherwood), incorporating dust attenuation, star formation, collisional excitation, and recombination physics. Our cosmic web Lyman-$\alpha$ surface brightness predictions are consistent with the UV excess detected at high significance in the recent deep, wide field, narrow-band imaging Condor data. The calculations presented here thus demonstrate that diffuse Lyman-$\alpha$ emission is observable with current (and next-generation) wide field low surface brightness facilities, opening the path to direct cartographic mapping of the cosmic web. These findings mark a turning point: for the first time, cosmology moves beyond inference from absorption and high-density peaks, into panoramic imaging of the faint intergalactic scaffolding that underpins structure formation in the Universe.</description>

Abstract: Although substantial progress has been made in reconciling LCDM simulations with the observed abundance and distribution of satellite galaxies, important tensions persist. Studying satellite systems around spiral galaxies thus remains key in addressing these tensions. In this series of papers we report the first results of an on-going systematic survey of faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the vicinity of the bright late-type spiral NGC 253 galaxy, the brightest member of the Sculptor filament located at a distance of 3.7 Mpc. We performed a new NGC 253 satellite search by means of visual inspection using co-added image cutouts reprocessed in the DESI Legacy image surveys, reaching a very low surface brightness regime (28.0--29.0 mag arcsec-2). Five new dwarf galaxy candidates have been discovered in the vicinity of NGC 253, that we named them Do V, Do VI, Do VII, Do VIII and Do IX. Assuming they are associated to NGC 253, their total absolute V-magnitudes fall in the -7 to -9 mag range, which is typical for dwarf satellites in the local Universe. The central surface brightness tend to be extremely low for all the discovered dwarfs and fall roughly in the range of 25--26 mag arcsec-2 in g-band. We present a new list of galaxies located around the giant spiral NGC 253. With the inclusion of these additional satellite candidates, the overall spatial distribution of the system becomes less flattened and is now broadly consistent with analogs drawn from Lambda-CDM expectations. Interestingly, the distribution appears to be rather lopsided. Yet, firm conclusions on the presence of absence of a correlated satellite structure are hampered since distance information is lacking, the census of observed dwarfs in the system remains far from complete, and spectroscopic velocities are not even available for most known satellites.</description>

      <title>A Semi-analytic Framework of Population III and Subsequent Galaxy Formation on Cosmological N-body Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new semi-analytic framework of Population (Pop) III and subsequent galaxy formation designed to run on dark matter halo merger trees. In our framework, we consider the effect of the Lyman-Werner flux from Pop III and II stars and the dark matter baryon streaming velocity on the critical halo mass for the Pop III formation. Our model incorporates the Lyman-Werner feedback in a self-consistent way, therefore, the spatial variation of Lyman-Werner feedback naturally emerges. The Pop III mass depends on the properties of a halo as reproducing radiative hydrodynamical simulation results. We perform statistical studies of Pop III stars by applying this framework to high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations with a maximum box size of 16 Mpc/h and enough mass resolution to resolve Pop III-forming halos. A top-heavy initial mass function emerges and two peaks corresponding to the H$_2$ ($20 \lesssim z \lesssim 25$) and atomic cooling halos ($z \lesssim 15$) exist in the distribution. Supermassive stars can be formed in the atomic cooling halos, and the fractions of such supermassive stars increase with the value of streaming velocity. At least an 8 Mpc/h simulation box and the self-consistent model for the Lyman-Werner feedback are necessary to correctly model the Pop III formation in the atomic cooling halos. Our model predicts one supermassive star per halo with several $10^9$ Msun at z=7.5, which is enough to reproduce a high redshift quasar.</description>

      <title>The Southern Photometrical Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS): searching for metal-poor dwarf galaxies</title>

Abstract: The metal content of a galaxy's interstellar medium reflects the interplay between different evolutionary processes such as feedback from massive stars and the accretion of gas from the intergalactic medium. Despite the expected abundance of low-luminosity galaxies, the low-mass and low-metallicity regime remains relatively understudied. Since the properties of their interstellar medium resemble those of early galaxies, identifying such objects in the Local Universe is crucial to understand the early stages of galaxy evolution. We used the DR3 catalog of the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) to select low-metallicity dwarf galaxy candidates based on color selection criteria typical of metal-poor, star-forming, low-mass systems. The final sample contains approximately 50 candidates. Spectral energy distribution fitting of the 12 S-PLUS bands reveals that $\sim$ 60% of the candidates are best fit by models with low stellar metallicities. We obtained long-slit observations with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph to follow-up a pilot sample and confirm whether these galaxies have low metallicities. We find oxygen abundances in the range $7.28&lt;$ 12 + log(O/H) $&lt; 7.82$ (4% to 13% of the solar value), confirming their metal-poor nature. Most targets are outliers in the mass-metallicity relation, i.e. they display a low metal content relative to their observed stellar masses. In some cases, perturbed optical morphologies might give evidence of dwarf-dwarf interactions or mergers. These results suggest that the low oxygen abundances may be associated with an external event causing the accretion of metal-poor gas, which dilutes the oxygen abundance in these systems.</description>

      <title>AGN ruled out as the dominant source of cosmic reionization</title>

Abstract: Cosmic reionization represents the latest phase transition in the Universe, when the Lyman continuum (LyC) photons turned the intergalactic medium (IGM) from neutral to highly ionized. It has long been debated whether galaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are the major source of LyC photons responsible for reionization. Previous observations slightly favored galaxies as the major ionizing source. However, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) recently discovered an unexpectedly high density of AGN candidates at high redshift, which has largely enhanced the influence of AGNs. Here we derive a definitive upper bound on the AGN contribution to reionization using the latest JWST data, and conclusively rule out AGNs as the dominant ionizing source during the peak epoch of reionization (EoR). We build a sample of galaxies and AGNs in a specific redshift range $7.15 \leq z \leq 7.75$ with a high completeness. Each object is then decomposed into a point-source component and an extended component in their rest-frame far-UV JWST images. We assume all point-source components are AGNs. Our fiducial AGN sample reaches an unprecedentedly low luminosity of $M_{\rm UV} \approx -15$ mag. Based on this sample, AGNs can contribute at most one third of the LyC photons budget required at $z\sim7.5$. Our result implies that galaxies dominate the ionizing source during the EoR.</description>

      <title>Forming the local starburst galaxy Haro 11 through hydrodynamical merger simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Haro 11 is a metal-poor, starburst galaxy believed to be the result of an ongoing merger, which is shaping the properties of the galaxy. In this study, we carry out a large suite of numerical simulations of a merger between two disc galaxies, to study possible origins of Haro 11 and understand under which conditions various features of the galaxy are formed. By varying galaxy parameters describing the orbital configurations, masses, and their inclination, we perform a total of $\sim$500 simulations. We demonstrate that a two-disc galaxy merger reproduces key, observed features of Haro 11, including its morphology, gas kinematics, star formation history, and stellar population ages and masses. In particular, we present a fiducial Haro 11 model that produces the single observed tidal tail, three stellar knots, and inner gas morphology and kinematics. The resulting orbit and galactic morphology are robust against small variations of the initial parameters. By performing mock observations, we compare with the results of observational data and discuss possible origins for various features. Furthermore, we present newly gathered observational data that confirms the presence of a stellar tidal tail with similar length and morphology as our simulations.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Perpendicular Superdiffusion and Parallel Mirror Diffusion in a Partially Ionized and Turbulent Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding cosmic ray (CR) diffusion in a partially ionized medium is both crucial and challenging. In this study, we investigate CR perpendicular superdiffusion and parallel transport in turbulent, partially ionized media using high-resolution 3D two-fluid simulations that treat ions and neutrals separately. We examine the influence of neutral-ion decoupling and the associated damping of turbulence on CR propagation in both transonic and supersonic conditions. Our simulations demonstrate that neutral-ion decoupling significantly damps velocity and magnetic field fluctuations at small scales, producing spectral slopes steeper than those of Kolmogorov and Burgers scaling. In supersonic turbulence, large-scale shock motion is not subject to damping and generates small-scale density enhancements. Moreover, the damping of magnetic field fluctuations substantially decreases pitch-angle scattering, which, however, only slightly affects the CR parallel mean free path $\lambda_\|$, due to the nonresonant mirror interactions of CRs. In the direction perpendicular to the mean magnetic field, we identify two regimes of the perpendicular superdiffusion of CRs: a diffusive regime ($\lambda_\|&lt;L_{\rm inj}$, where $L_{\rm inj}$ is turbulence injection scale) with perpendicular separation of CR proportional to $t^{3/4}$, and a ballistic-like regime ($\lambda_\|&gt;L_{\rm inj}$), with perpendicular separation scaling as $t^{3/2}$. At initially large pitch angles, the effects of magnetic mirroring-naturally arising in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence-become significant, enhancing the confinement of CRs and resulting in $\lambda_\|&lt;L_{\rm inj}$, despite the damping effect. These results imply that large-pitch-angle CRs can be well confined in the cold ISM, such as molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>The hot circumgalactic medium in stacked X-rays: observations vs simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current cosmological simulations rely on active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback to quench star formation and match observed stellar mass distributions, but models for AGN feedback are poorly constrained. The circumgalactic medium (CGM) provides a valuable laboratory to study this process, as its metallicity, temperature, and density distributions are directly shaped by AGN activity. Recent observations from the eROSITA instrument provide constraints on the CGM through measurements of extended soft X-ray emission. In this work, we generate synthetic eROSITA observations from the EAGLE and SIMBA cosmological simulations and compare them to observations of galaxies stacked by stellar mass, halo mass, and star-formation rate. SIMBA outperforms EAGLE in matching observed surface brightness profiles, but neither simulation achieves consistent agreement with observations across the full range of galaxy properties we studied. We find that variations in CGM X-ray emission between simulations are primarily driven by density differences at $R \lesssim 0.2 R_{200c} $, and temperature and metallicity changes at larger radii. These results highlight the need for further refinement of AGN feedback models in cosmological simulations and demonstrate the power of stacked X-ray observations as a tool for constraining feedback physics.</description>

      <title>Distribution of Europium in The Milky Way Disk; Its Connection to Planetary Habitability and The Source of The R-Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The energy provided in the radioactive decay of thorium (Th) and uranium (U) isotopes, embedded in planetary mantles, sustains geodynamics important for surface habitability such as the generation of a planetary magnetic dynamo. In order to better understand the thermal evolution of nearby exoplanets, stellar photospheric abundances can be used to infer the material composition of orbiting planets. Here we constrain the intrinsic dispersion of the r-process element europium (Eu) (measured in relative abundance [Eu/H]) as a proxy for Th and U in local F, G, and K type dwarf stars. Adopting stellar-chemical data from two high quality spectroscopic surveys, we have determined a small intrinsic scatter of 0.025 dex in [Eu/H] within the disk. We further investigate the stellar anti-correlation in [Eu/$\alpha$] vs [$\alpha$/H] at late metallicities to probe in what regimes planetary radiogenic heating may lead to periods of extended dynamo collapse. We find that only near-solar metallicity stars in the disk have Eu inventories supportive of a persistent dynamo in attendant planets, supporting the notion of a ``metallicity Goldilocks zone'' in the galactic disk. The observed anti-correlation further provides novel evidence regarding the nature of r-processes injection by substantiating $\alpha$ element production is decoupled from Eu injection. This suggests either a metallicity-dependent r-process in massive core-collapse supernovae, or that neutron-star merger events dominate r-process production in the recent universe.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with One Galaxy: Auto-Encoding the Galaxy Properties Manifold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations like CAMELS and IllustrisTNG characterize hundreds of thousands of galaxies using various internal properties. Previous studies have demonstrated that machine learning can be used to infer the cosmological parameter $\Omega_m$ from the internal properties of even a single randomly selected simulated galaxy. This ability was hypothesized to originate from galaxies occupying a low-dimensional manifold within a higher-dimensional galaxy property space, which shifts with variations in $\Omega_m$. In this work, we investigate how galaxies occupy the high-dimensional galaxy property space, particularly the effect of $\Omega_m$ and other cosmological and astrophysical parameters on the putative manifold. We achieve this by using an autoencoder with an Information-Ordered Bottleneck (IOB), a neural layer with adaptive compression, to perform dimensionality reduction on individual galaxy properties from CAMELS simulations, which are run with various combinations of cosmological and astrophysical parameters. We find that for an autoencoder trained on the fiducial set of parameters, the reconstruction error increases significantly when the test set deviates from fiducial values of $\Omega_m$ and $A_{\text{SN1}}$, indicating that these parameters shift galaxies off the fiducial manifold. In contrast, variations in other parameters such as $\sigma_8$ cause negligible error changes, suggesting galaxies shift along the manifold. These findings provide direct evidence that the ability to infer $\Omega_m$ from individual galaxies is tied to the way $\Omega_m$ shifts the manifold. Physically, this implies that parameters like $\sigma_8$ produce galaxy property changes resembling natural scatter, while parameters like $\Omega_m$ and $A_{\text{SN1}}$ create unsampled properties, extending beyond the natural scatter in the fiducial model.</description>

      <title>Investigating dusty Red Supergiant outflows in Westerlund 1 with 3D Hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations towards Westerlund 1 revealed extensive nebular emission associated with the cluster. Given the age of the region and proximity of that material to massive stars it cannot be primordial star forming gas and the origin is uncertain. We aim to determine whether the nebular emission in Westerlund 1 could be due to ablation flows from Red Supergiant (RSG) stars embedded in the cluster wind driven by the Wolf-Rayet stars in the cluster core. We also aim to explore the efficiency of mass-loading for the RSG wind in this scenario. We use 3D hydrodynamic simulations with the \textsc{pion} code to study the interaction between the cluster and RSG winds. We compare with the JWST observations by generating synthetic dust-emission maps. We find that the ablation flow morphology is consistent with the observations towards Westerlund 1, with clumps and instabilities. Synthetic observations at 11 $\mu$m predict fluxes in the ablation flow of $\sim1000-6000$ MJy ster$^{-1}$ which is consistent with the unsaturated components of the JWST F1130W observations in the vicinity of the red supergiants in the region. This good agreement is achieved without any consideration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have a known 11.3 $\mu$m feature that appears in the F1130W band. This suggests that the ablation flow is PAH depleted. Ablation of RSG winds can explain the observed nebulosity in Westerlund 1, at least in the vicinity of the RSGs. Further observations are encouraged to enable detailed studies of these interactions.</description>

      <title>Prospects of future MeV telescopes in probing weak-scale Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04907v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galactic weak-scale Dark Matter (DM) particles annihilating into lepton-rich channels not only produce gamma-rays via prompt radiation but also generate abundant energetic electrons and positrons, which subsequently emit through bremsstrahlung or inverse Compton scattering (collectively called `secondary-radiation photons'). While the prompt gamma-rays concentrate at high-energy, the secondary emission falls in the MeV range, which a number of upcoming experiments (AMEGO, E-ASTROGAM, MAST...) will probe. We investigate the sensitivity of these future telescopes for weak-scale DM, focusing for definiteness on observations of the galactic center. We find that they have the potential of probing a wide region of the DM parameter space which is currently unconstrained. Namely, in rather optimistic configurations, future MeV telescopes could probe thermally-produced DM with a mass up to the TeV range, or GeV DM with an annihilation cross section 2 to 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the current bounds, precisely thanks to the significant leverage provided by their sensitivity to secondary emissions. We comment on astrophysical and methodological uncertainties, and compare with the reach of high-energy gamma ray experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider neutrinos scattering off Milky Way dark matter and the impact of this scattering on supernovae neutrinos. This can take the form of attenuation on the initial flux of neutrinos and a time-delayed flux of scattered neutrinos. Considering dark matter masses above 100 MeV and past Milky Way supernovae, we find this time-delayed flux is nearly constant in time. We call this flux the Dark Matter Diffused Supernova Neutrino Background (DMDSNB), and use Super-K limits on the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB) flux to set limits on the dark matter-neutrino scattering cross section. We find $\sigma_{\rm DM-\nu}/m_{\rm DM} \lesssim 2.4 \times 10^{-24} \mathrm{cm^2}$/GeV for $m_{\rm DM} \gtrsim 1$ GeV, which is the strongest bound to date on dark matter-neutrino scatterings at MeV energies, and stronger than bounds set from SN1987A neutrino attenuation by an order of magnitude. We end by discussing how the DMDSNB could be distinguished from the DSNB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03888v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Synthesizer, a fast, flexible, modular and extensible platform for modelling synthetic astrophysical observables. Synthesizer can be used for a number of applications, but is predominantly designed for generating mock observables from analytical and numerical galaxy formation simulations. These use cases include (but are not limited to) analytical modelling of the star formation and metal enrichment histories of galaxies, the creation of mock images and integral field unit observations from particle based simulations, detailed photoionisation modelling of the central regions of active galactic nuclei, and spectro-photometric fitting. We provide a number of stellar population synthesis models, photoionisation code configurations, dust models, and imaging configurations that can be used 'out-of-the-box' interactively. The code can be used to quantitatively test the dependence of forward modelled observables on various model and parameter choices, and rapidly explore large parameter ranges for calibration and inference tasks. We invite and encourage the community to use, test and develop the code, and hope that the foundation developed will provide a flexible framework for a number of tasks in forward and inverse modelling of astrophysical observables. The code is publicly available at https://synthesizer-project.github.io/</description>

      <title>Magnetars in Binaries as the Engine of Actively Repeating Fast Radio Bursts</title>

Abstract: The association between FRB 20200428D and the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 makes magnetars the leading engine of cosmological fast radio bursts (FRBs). However, there is a list of puzzles for this magnetar-for-all-FRBs scenario: known Galactic magnetars are all isolated and none of them are active repeaters; some cosmological repeaters have extremely high repetition rates but without any measurable spin-related periodicity; some show long-term periodic active windows; and some show diverse rotation measure (RM) evolution patterns, such as quasi-periodic fluctuations, sign reversals, and abrupt RM flares. Here we propose a unified theoretical framework for FRBs within the framework of magnetar engine: Most active repeating FRBs originate from magnetars in binary systems with nearly aligned rotation and magnetic axes, some of which with a triple-aligned geometry, i.e. with an alignment with the orbital axis as well; whereas apparent non-repeaters and inactive repeaters originate from magnetars in isolated systems or in binaries with a misaligned geometry. By studying various magnetar formation channels using population syntheses, we show that a few percent of magnetars in the universe can be in binary systems, most with a massive star companion and some with aligned geometry. We suggest that such binary systems can account for the rich phenomenology of active repeaters. We suggest that the existence of a companion helps to maintain the aligned geometry and that the companion may play an active role in triggering FRBs in an active repeater source.</description>

      <title>Hyper Suprime-Cam Y3 results: photo-$z$ bias calibration with lensing shear ratios and cosmological constraints from cosmic shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21681v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an independent calibration of the photometric redshift (photo-$z$) distributions for source galaxies in the HSC-Y3 weak lensing survey using small-scale galaxy-galaxy lensing. By measuring the tangential shear around spectroscopic lens galaxies from GAMA, SDSS, and DESI, divided into fifteen narrow redshift bins, we compute shear ratios that are sensitive to the mean redshift of source galaxies. Using a blinded analysis, we derive constraints on the photo-$z$ bias parameters in source bins 2, 3 and 4, achieving signal-to-noise ratios of 59, 75, and 62, respectively. Our constraints for $\Delta z_2$, $\Delta z_3$ and $\Delta z_4$ are consistent with those from HSC-Y3 cosmic shear modeling. We observe a mild shift in the $\Delta z_3$-$\Delta z_4$ plane due to the heterogeneous depth of the lens sample, which disappears when using only DESI-DR1 lenses. Combining shear-ratio measurements with cosmic shear data, we obtain joint constraints on cosmological parameters: $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.304_{-0.029}^{+0.03}$ and $S_8 = 0.773_{-0.031}^{+0.031}$, consistent with cosmic shear-only results. This work demonstrates the utility of small-scale lensing as an independent probe for calibrating photometric redshift bias in weak lensing cosmology.</description>

Abstract: Aims. We have determined Sr abundance in a sample of 31 red giant branch stars located in the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tuc with the aim to identify potential differences in the Sr abundance between first population (1P, Na-poor) and second population (2P, Na-rich) stars. Methods. We derived the Na and Sr abundances from the archival spectra obtained with the UVES spectrograph. To do this, we used 1D ATLAS9 model atmospheres and a 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium spectral synthesis method. Particular attention was paid to assessing the potential impact of CN line blending on the obtained Sr abundances. Furthermore, we evaluated the potential influence of convection on the Sr line formation by using 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres computed with the CO5BOLD code. Results. Our results suggest a weak correlation between the abundances of Sr and Na. Together with a similar correlation between the abundances of Zr and Na determined in our previous study, our analysis of Sr suggests that polluters that have enriched 2P stars with light elements may have produced some s-process elements as well. The mean Sr abundance determined in 31 red giant branch stars of 47~Tuc is $\langle {\rm [Sr/Fe]} \rangle = 0.18\pm0.08$ (the error denotes the standard deviation due to the star-to-star abundance scatter). This value is within the range of the Sr abundance variation that is observed in Galactic field stars of similar metallicity. The mean [Sr/Zr] abundance ratio in our sample stars suggests that the two s-process elements could have been synthesized by either low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars ($M=1-4 {\rm M}_{\odot}$) or massive ($M=10-20 {\rm M}_{\odot}$) fast-rotating ($v_{\rm rot}=200-300$ km/s) stars.</description>
