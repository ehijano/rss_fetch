      <title>Attosecond gamma-ray flashes and electron-positron pairs in dyadic laser interaction with micro-wire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beams of photons and charged particles of high energy and high brightness find application across a range of disciplines in both fundamental and applied sciences. The interaction of an ultra-intense laser with matter has been shown to be an efficient source of high-energy particles, but typical schemes generate spatially broad distributions with high-divergence and low-brightness. In this paper we report on emission of highly collimated, ultrabright, attosecond $\gamma$-photons and generation of dense electron-positron pairs via a tunable particle generation scheme which utilises the interaction of two high-power lasers with metallic micro-wire target. Irradiating the target with a radially polarised laser pulse first produces a series of high charge, short duration, electron bunches with low transverse momentum. These electron bunches subsequently collide with a counter-propagating high intensity laser. Depending on the intensity of the counter-propagating laser, the scheme can be used to generate either highly collimated ultra-bright MeV-GeV $\gamma$-beams or electron-positron bunches with densities approaching the solid density level.</description>

      <title>Results of the 2022 ECFA Early-Career Researchers Panel survey on career prospects and diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This document presents the outcomes of a comprehensive survey conducted among early career researchers (ECRs) in academic particle physics. Running from September 24, 2022, to March 3, 2023, the survey gathered responses from 759 ECRs employed in 39 countries. The study aimed to gain insights into the career prospects and experiences of ECRs while also delving into diversity and sociological aspects within particle physics research. The survey results are presented in a manner consistent with the survey choices. The document offers insights for the particle physics community, and provides a set of recommendations for enhancing career prospects, fostering diversity, and addressing sociological dimensions within this field.</description>

      <title>Extreme plasmons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanosciences largely rely on plasmons which are quasiparticles constituted by collective oscillations of quantum electron gas composed of conduction band electrons that occupy discrete quantum states. Our work has introduced non-perturbative plasmons with oscillation amplitudes that approach the extreme limit set by breakdown in characteristic coherence. In contrast, conventional plasmons are small-amplitude oscillations. Controlled excitation of extreme plasmons modeled in our work unleashes unprecedented Petavolts per meter fields. In this work, an analytical model of this new class of plasmons is developed based on quantum kinetic framework. A controllable extreme plasmon, the surface "crunch-in" plasmon, is modeled here using a modified independent electron approximation which takes into account the quantum oscillation frequency. Key characteristics of such realizable extreme plasmons that unlock unparalleled possibilities, are obtained.</description>
