      <title>Designing Band Gaps with Randomly Distributed Sub-Wavelength Helmholtz Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that band gaps, in the frequency domain, can be achieved by using periodic metamaterials. However it has been challenging to design materials with broad band gaps or that have multiple overlapping band gaps. For periodic materials this difficulty arises because many different length scales would have to be repeated periodically within the same structure to have multiple overlapping band gaps. Here we present an alternative: to design band gaps with disordered materials. We show how to tailor band gaps by choosing any combination of Helmholtz resonators that are positioned randomly within a host acoustic medium. One key result is that we are able to reach simple formulae for the effective material properties, which work over a broad frequency range, and can therefore be used to rapidly design tailored metamaterials. We show that these formulae are robust by comparing them with high-fidelity Monte Carlo simulations over randomly positioned resonant scatterers.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Two Methods to Solve Static Electromagnetic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09955</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.09955v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In electromagnetic statics, the standard procedure to determine the electric scalar potential or magnetic vector potential in a bounded space is to solve Poisson's equation subject to certain boundary conditions. On the other hand, as a direct generalization of Coulomb's law or Biot-Savart law, the static electromagnetic potentials may also be obtained by directly integrating the electric charge or current distributions over the region (either volume or surface) where they are spread out. What is the relation between these two formalisms? In this article, we prove that they are in fact equivalent to each other in mathematics. Examples are also presented to explicitly show the validity of this equivalence.</description>
