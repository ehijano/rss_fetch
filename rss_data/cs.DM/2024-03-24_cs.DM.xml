      <title>Recognizing Relating Edges in Graphs without Cycles of Length 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is well-covered if all maximal independent sets are of the same cardinality. Let $w:V(G) \longrightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be a weight function. Then $G$ is $w$-well-covered if all maximal independent sets are of the same weight. An edge $xy \in E(G)$ is relating if there exists an independent set $S$ such that both $S \cup \{x\}$ and $S \cup \{y\}$ are maximal independent sets in the graph. If $xy$ is relating then $w(x)=w(y)$ for every weight function $w$ such that $G$ is $w$-well-covered. Relating edges play an important role in investigating $w$-well-covered graphs.
  The decision problem whether an edge in a graph is relating is NP-complete. We prove that the problem remains NP-complete when the input is restricted to graphs without cycles of length $6$. This is an unexpected result because recognizing relating edges is known to be polynomially solvable for graphs without cycles of lengths $4$ and $6$, graphs without cycles of lengths $5$ and $6$, and graphs without cycles of lengths $6$ and $7$.
  A graph $G$ belongs to the class $W_2$ if every two pairwise disjoint independent sets in $G$ are included in two pairwise disjoint maximum independent sets. It is known that if $G$ belongs to the class $W_2$, then it is well-covered. A vertex $v \in V(G)$ is shedding if for every independent set $S \subseteq V(G)-N[v]$, there exists a vertex $u \in N(v)$ such that $S \cup \{u\}$ is independent. Shedding vertices play an important role in studying the class $W_2$. Recognizing shedding vertices is co-NP-complete, even when the input is restricted to triangle-free graphs. We prove that the problem is co-NP-complete for graphs without cycles of length $6$.</description>

      <title>Establishing a leader in a pairwise comparisons method</title>

Abstract: Abstract Like electoral systems, decision-making methods are also vulnerable to manipulation by decision-makers. The ability to effectively defend against such threats can only come from thoroughly understanding the manipulation mechanisms. In the presented article, we show two algorithms that can be used to launch a manipulation attack. They allow for equating the weights of two selected alternatives in the pairwise comparison method and, consequently, choosing a leader. The theoretical considerations are accompanied by a Monte Carlo simulation showing the relationship between the size of the PC matrix, the degree of inconsistency, and the ease of manipulation. This work is a continuation of our previous research published in the paper (Szybowski et al., 2023)</description>

      <title>Ellipsoidal embeddings of graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their flexibility to represent almost any kind of relational data, graph-based models have enjoyed a tremendous success over the past decades. While graphs are inherently only combinatorial objects, however, many prominent analysis tools are based on the algebraic representation of graphs via matrices such as the graph Laplacian, or on associated graph embeddings. Such embeddings associate to each node a set of coordinates in a vector space, a representation which can then be employed for learning tasks such as the classification or alignment of the nodes of the graph. As the geometric picture provided by embedding methods enables the use of a multitude of methods developed for vector space data, embeddings have thus gained interest both from a theoretical as well as a practical perspective. Inspired by trace-optimization problems, often encountered in the analysis of graph-based data, here we present a method to derive ellipsoidal embeddings of the nodes of a graph, in which each node is assigned a set of coordinates on the surface of a hyperellipsoid. Our method may be seen as an alternative to popular spectral embedding techniques, to which it shares certain similarities we discuss. To illustrate the utility of the embedding we conduct a case study in which analyse synthetic and real world networks with modular structure, and compare the results obtained with known methods in the literature.</description>

      <title>Transition Graph Properties of Target Class Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Target class classification is a mixed classification and transition model whose integrated goal is to assign objects to a certain, so called target or normal class. The classification process is iterative, and in each step an object in a certain class undergoes an action attached to that class, initiating the transition of the object to one of the classes. The sequence of transitions, which we call class transitions, must be designed to provide the final assignment of objects to the target class. The transition process can be described in the form of a directed graph, and the success of the final classification is mainly due to the properties of this graph. In our previous research we showed that the desirable structure of the transition graph is an oriented rooted tree with orientation towards the root vertex, which corresponds to the normal class. It is clear that the transition graph of an arbitrary algorithm (policy) may not have this property. In this paper we study the structure of realistic transition graphs, which makes it possible to find classification inconsistencies, helping to transfer it into the desired form. The medical interpretation of dynamic treatment regime considered in the article further clarifies the investigated framework.</description>

      <title>On the Weighted Top-Difference Distance: Axioms, Aggregation, and Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a family of distance functions on rankings that allow for asymmetric treatments of alternatives and consider the distinct relevance of the top and bottom positions for ordered lists. We provide a full axiomatic characterization of our distance. In doing so, we retrieve new characterizations of existing axioms and show how to effectively weaken them for our purposes. This analysis highlights the generality of our distance as it embeds many (semi)metrics previously proposed in the literature. Subsequently, we show that, notwithstanding its level of generality, our distance is still readily applicable. We apply it to preference aggregation, studying the features of the associated median voting rule. It is shown how the derived preference function satisfies many desirable features in the context of voting rules, ranging from fairness to majority and Pareto-related properties. We show how to compute consensus rankings exactly, and provide generalized Diaconis-Graham inequalities that can be leveraged to obtain approximation algorithms. Finally, we propose some truncation ideas for our distances inspired by Lu and Boutilier (2010). These can be leveraged to devise a Polynomial-Time-Approximation Scheme for the corresponding rank aggregation problem.</description>

      <title>Flip-Breakability: A Combinatorial Dichotomy for Monadically Dependent Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A conjecture in algorithmic model theory predicts that the model-checking problem for first-order logic is fixed-parameter tractable on a hereditary graph class if and only if the class is monadically dependent. Originating in model theory, this notion is defined in terms of logic, and encompasses nowhere dense classes, monadically stable classes, and classes of bounded twin-width. Working towards this conjecture, we provide the first two combinatorial characterizations of monadically dependent graph classes. This yields the following dichotomy.
  On the structure side, we characterize monadic dependence by a Ramsey-theoretic property called flip-breakability. This notion generalizes the notions of uniform quasi-wideness, flip-flatness, and bounded grid rank, which characterize nowhere denseness, monadic stability, and bounded twin-width, respectively, and played a key role in their respective model checking algorithms. Natural restrictions of flip-breakability additionally characterize bounded treewidth and cliquewidth and bounded treedepth and shrubdepth.
  On the non-structure side, we characterize monadic dependence by explicitly listing few families of forbidden induced subgraphs. This result is analogous to the characterization of nowhere denseness via forbidden subdivided cliques, and allows us to resolve one half of the motivating conjecture: First-order model checking is AW[$*$]-hard on every hereditary graph class that is monadically independent. The result moreover implies that hereditary graph classes which are small, have almost bounded twin-width, or have almost bounded flip-width, are monadically dependent.
  Lastly, we lift our result to also obtain a combinatorial dichotomy in the more general setting of monadically dependent classes of binary structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a class of graphs which we call average hereditary graphs. Most graphs that occur in the usual graph theory applications belong to this class of graphs. Many popular types of graphs fall under this class, such as regular graphs, trees and other popular classes of graphs. We prove a new upper bound for the chromatic number of a graph in terms of its maximum average degree and show that this bound is an improvement on previous bounds. From this, we show a relationship between the average degree and the chromatic number of an average hereditary graph. This class of graphs is explored further by proving some interesting properties regarding the class of average hereditary graphs. An equivalent condition is provided for a graph to be average hereditary, through which we show that we can decide if a given graph is average hereditary in polynomial time. We then provide a construction for average hereditary graphs, using which an average hereditary graph can be recursively constructed. We also show that this class of graphs is closed under a binary operation, from this another construction is obtained for average hereditary graphs, and we see some interesting algebraic properties this class of graphs has. We then explore the effect on the complexity of graph 3-coloring problem when the input is restricted to average hereditary graphs.</description>

      <title>The ultrametric backbone is the union of all minimum spanning forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minimum spanning trees and forests are powerful sparsification techniques that remove cycles from weighted graphs to minimize total edge weight while preserving node connectivity. They have applications in computer science, network science, and graph theory. Despite their utility and ubiquity, they have several limitations, including that they are only defined for undirected networks, they significantly alter dynamics on networks, and they do not generally preserve important network features such as shortest distances, shortest path distribution, and community structure. In contrast, distance backbones, which are subgraphs formed by all edges that obey a generalized triangle inequality, are well defined in both directed and undirected graphs and preserve those and other important network features. The backbone of a graph is defined with respect to a specified path-length operator that aggregates weights along a path to define its length, thereby associating a cost to indirect connections. The backbone is the union of all shortest paths between each pair of nodes according to the specified operator. One such operator, the max function, computes the length of a path as the largest weight of the edges that compose it (a weakest link criterion). It is the only operator that yields an algebraic structure for computing shortest paths that is consistent with De Morgan's laws. Applying this operator yields the ultrametric backbone of a graph in that (semi-triangular) edges whose weights are larger than the length of an indirect path connecting the same nodes (i.e., those that break the generalized triangle inequality based on max as a path-length operator) are removed. We show that the ultrametric backbone is the union of all minimum spanning forests in undirected graphs and provides a new generalization of minimum spanning trees to directed graphs.</description>

      <title>Aharoni's rainbow cycle conjecture holds up to an additive constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05697v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2017, Aharoni proposed the following generalization of the Caccetta-H\"{a}ggkvist conjecture: if $G$ is a simple $n$-vertex edge-colored graph with $n$ color classes of size at least $r$, then $G$ contains a rainbow cycle of length at most $\lceil n/r \rceil$.
  In this paper, we prove that, for fixed $r$, Aharoni's conjecture holds up to an additive constant. Specifically, we show that for each fixed $r \geq 1$, there exists a constant $c_r$ such that if $G$ is a simple $n$-vertex edge-colored graph with $n$ color classes of size at least $r$, then $G$ contains a rainbow cycle of length at most $n/r + c_r$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Firstly studied by Kempa and Prezza in 2018 as the cement of text compression algorithms, string attractors have become a compelling object of theoretical research within the community of combinatorics on words. In this context, they have been studied for several families of finite and infinite words. In this paper, we obtain string attractors of prefixes of particular infinite words generalizing k-bonacci words (including the famous Fibonacci word) and related to simple Parry numbers. In fact, our description involves the numeration systems classically derived from the considered morphisms. This extends our previous work published in the international conference WORDS 2023.</description>

      <title>No distributed quantum advantage for approximate graph coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an almost complete characterization of the hardness of $c$-coloring $\chi$-chromatic graphs with distributed algorithms, for a wide range of models of distributed computing. In particular, we show that these problems do not admit any distributed quantum advantage. To do that: 1) We give a new distributed algorithm that finds a $c$-coloring in $\chi$-chromatic graphs in $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{\frac{1}{\alpha}})$ rounds, with $\alpha = \bigl\lfloor\frac{c-1}{\chi - 1}\bigr\rfloor$. 2) We prove that any distributed algorithm for this problem requires $\Omega(n^{\frac{1}{\alpha}})$ rounds.
  Our upper bound holds in the classical, deterministic LOCAL model, while the near-matching lower bound holds in the non-signaling model. This model, introduced by Arfaoui and Fraigniaud in 2014, captures all models of distributed graph algorithms that obey physical causality; this includes not only classical deterministic LOCAL and randomized LOCAL but also quantum-LOCAL, even with a pre-shared quantum state.
  We also show that similar arguments can be used to prove that, e.g., 3-coloring 2-dimensional grids or $c$-coloring trees remain hard problems even for the non-signaling model, and in particular do not admit any quantum advantage. Our lower-bound arguments are purely graph-theoretic at heart; no background on quantum information theory is needed to establish the proofs.</description>

      <title>Dually conformal hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00098v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$, the dual hypergraph of $\mathcal{H}$ is the hypergraph of all minimal transversals of $\mathcal{H}$. The dual hypergraph is always Sperner, that is, no hyperedge contains another. A special case of Sperner hypergraphs are the conformal Sperner hypergraphs, which correspond to the families of maximal cliques of graphs. All these notions play an important role in many fields of mathematics and computer science, including combinatorics, algebra, database theory, etc. In this paper we study conformality of dual hypergraphs and prove several results related to the problem of recognizing this property. In particular, we show that the problem is in co-NP and can be solved in polynomial time for hypergraphs of bounded dimension. In the special case of dimension $3$, we reduce the problem to $2$-Satisfiability. Our approach has an implication in algorithmic graph theory: we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing graphs in which all minimal transversals of maximal cliques have size at most $k$, for any fixed $k$.</description>
