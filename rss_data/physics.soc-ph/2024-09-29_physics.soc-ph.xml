      <title>Kaleidoscopic reorganization of network communities across different scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of structural heterogeneity is pervasive in real networks, and their community organization is no exception. Still, a vast majority of community detection methods assume neatly hierarchically organized communities of a characteristic scale for a given hierarchical level. In this work, we demonstrate that the reality of scale-dependent community reorganization is convoluted with simultaneous processes of community splitting and merging, challenging the conventional understanding of community-scale adjustment. We provide the mathematical argument on the modularity function, the results from the real-network analysis, and a simple network model for a comprehensive understanding of the nontrivial community reorganization process characterized by a local dip in the number of communities as the resolution parameter varies. This study suggests a need for a paradigm shift in the study of network communities, which emphasizes the importance of considering scale-dependent reorganization to better understand the genuine structural organization of networks.</description>

      <title>Scale Free Projections Arise from Bipartite Random Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The degree distribution of a real world network -- the number of links per node -- often follows a power law, with some hubs having many more links than traditional graph generation methods predict. For years, preferential attachment and growth have been the proposed mechanisms that lead to these scale free networks. However, the two sides of bipartite graphs like collaboration networks are usually not scale free, and are therefore not well-explained by these processes. Here we develop a bipartite extension to the Randomly Stopped Linking Model and show that mixtures of geometric distributions lead to power laws according to a Central Limit Theorem for distributions with high variance. The two halves of the actor-movie network are not scale free and can be represented by just 5 geometric distributions, but they combine to form a scale free actor-actor unipartite projection without preferential attachment or growth. This result supports our claim that scale free networks are the natural result of many Bernoulli trials with high variance of which preferential attachment and growth are only one example.</description>

      <title>Bounds and Bugs: The Limits of Symmetry Metrics to Detect Partisan Gerrymandering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two symmetry metrics to detect partisan gerrymandering: the Mean-Median Difference (MM) and Partisan Bias (PB). To lay the groundwork for our main results, we first assert that the foundation of a partisan gerrymander is to draw a map so that the preferred party wins an extreme number of seats, and that both the Mean-Median Difference and Partisan Bias have been used to detect partisan gerrymandering.
  We then provide both a theoretical and empirical analysis of the Mean-Median Difference and Partisan Bias. In our theoretical analysis, we consider vote-share, seat-share pairs (V,S) for which one can construct election data having vote share V and seat share S, and turnout is equal in each district. We calculate the range of values that MM and PB can achieve on that constructed election data. In the process, we find the range of vote-share, seat share pairs (V,S) for which there is constructed election data with vote share V , seat share S, and MM = 0, and see that the corresponding range for PB is the same set of (V,S) pairs. We show how the set of such (V,S) pairs allowing for MM = 0 (and PB = 0) changes when turnout in each district is allowed to be different.
  By observing the results of this theoretical analysis, we give examples of how these two metrics are unable to detect when a map has an extreme number of districts won. Because these examples are constructed, we follow this with our empirical study, in which we show on 18 different U.S. maps that these two metrics are unable to detect when a map has an extreme number of districts won.</description>
