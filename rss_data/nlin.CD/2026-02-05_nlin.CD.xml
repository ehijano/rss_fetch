      <title>A phenomenological description of critical slowing down at period-doubling bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a phenomenological description of the critical slowing down associated with period-doubling bifurcations in discrete dynamical systems. Starting from a local Taylor expansion around the fixed point and the bifurcation parameter, we derive a reduced description that captures the convergence towards stationary state both at and near criticality. At the bifurcation point, three universal critical exponents are obtained, characterising the short-time behaviour, the asymptotic decay, and the crossover between these regimes. Away from criticality, a fourth exponent governing the relaxation time is identified. We show this phenomenology, well established for one-dimensional maps, extends naturally to two-dimensional mappings. By projecting the dynamics onto the centre manifold, we demonstrate that the local normal form of a two-dimensional period-doubling bifurcation reduces to the same universal structure found in one dimension. The theoretical predictions are validated numerically using the H\'enon and Ikeda maps, showing excellent agreement for all scaling laws and critical exponents.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Structure of the Advection--Diffusion Spectrum in Mixed Phase Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the spectral structure of the two-dimensional advection-diffusion operator in flows with mixed phase space at very large Peclet number. Using Fourier discretization combined with symmetry reduction and Krylov-Arnoldi methods, we compute on the order of one hundred leading eigenpairs reliably in the asymptotic, weak-diffusion regime. While the principal eigenvalue is asymptotically diffusive and localized on the largest regular region, the broader spectrum exhibits a rich organization controlled by local Lagrangian phase-space geometry. In particular, exponential mixing in chaotic regions rapidly suppresses correlations, whereas algebraic mixing in integrable regions generates long-lived coherent structures that dominate the slow and intermediate parts of the spectrum. We identify three distinct classes of eigenmodes: advective modes associated with transport on invariant tori, diffusive modes and, within the duffusive branch, tunneling modes arising from weak coupling between dynamically separated regular regions. Drawing on a semiclassical analogy, we assign quantum-number-like labels to these families and predict the appearance, scaling, and ordering of their sub-spectra directly from the Hamiltonian phase-space structure. The coexistence of these families implies that no uniform control of the spectral gap exists across the full spectrum: although the slowest mode is diffusive, arbitrarily small gaps arise between competing families at higher mode numbers. As a result, finite-time advection-diffusion dynamics is generically governed by persistent modal competition rather than single-mode dominance, even at asymptotically large Peclet number.</description>

      <title>Correspondence between classical and quantum resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04793v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bifurcations take place in molecular Hamiltonian nonlinear systems as the excitation energy increases, this leading to the appearance of different classical resonances. In this paper, we study the quantum manifestations of these classical resonances in the isomerizing system CN-Li$\leftrightarrows$Li-CN. By using a correlation diagram of eigenenergies versus Planck constant, we show the existence of different series of avoided crossings, leading to the corresponding series of quantum resonances, which represent the quantum manifestations of the classical resonances. Moreover, the extrapolation of these series to $\hbar=0$ unveils the correspondence between the bifurcation energy of classical resonances and the energy of the series of quantum resonances in the semiclassical limit $\hbar\to0$. Additionally, in order to obtain analytical expressions for our results, a semiclassical theory is developed.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Dynamics in Extremal Black Holes: A Challenge to the Chaos Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate chaotic dynamics in extremal black holes by analyzing the motion of massless particles in both Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m and Kerr geometries. Two complementary approaches (i) taking the extremal limit of non-extremal solutions and (ii) working directly in the extremal background, yield consistent results. We find that, contrary to naive extrapolation of the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford (MSS) chaos bound, the Lyapunov exponent remains positive even at zero temperature. For Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black holes, chaos diminishes but persists at extremality, while for Kerr black holes it strengthens with increasing spin. These results demonstrate that extremal black holes exhibit residual chaotic dynamics that violate the MSS bound, establishing them as qualitatively distinct dynamical phases of gravity.</description>

      <title>Deterministic scale-invariant dynamics in a logistic Game-of-Life model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scale invariance is a hallmark of criticality in complex dynamical systems. While random external inputs or tunable stochastic interactions are typically required to produce critical behavior, it remains unclear whether scale-invariant dynamics can emerge from purely deterministic interactions. Here, we address this question by studying the asymptotic dynamics of the logistic Game of Life (GOL), a deterministic-parameter extension of Conway's GOL. In this system, we identify three distinct asymptotic phases separated by two fundamentally different critical points. The first critical point, associated with an unusual form of self-organized criticality, separates a sparse-static phase from a sparse-dynamic phase. The second critical point corresponds to a deterministic percolation transition between the sparse-dynamic phase and a third, dense-dynamic phase. In addition, we observe power-law cluster size distributions with unconventional critical exponents not found in standard equilibrium systems. Overall, our work paves the way for studying emergent scale invariance in purely deterministic systems.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Transfer Operators in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator, as a linear representation of a nonlinear dynamical system, has been attracting attention in many fields of science. Recently, Koopman operator theory has been combined with another concept that is popular in data science: reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We follow this thread into Gaussian process methods, and illustrate how these methods can alleviate two pervasive problems with kernel-based Koopman algorithms. The first being sparsity: most kernel methods do not scale well and require an approximation to become practical. We show that not only can the computational demands be reduced, but also demonstrate improved resilience against sensor noise. The second problem involves hyperparameter optimization and dictionary learning to adapt the model to the dynamical system. In summary, the main contribution of this work is the unification of Gaussian process regression and dynamic mode decomposition.</description>

      <title>Mean-field theory of the DNLS equation at positive and negative absolute temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Discrete Non Linear Schr\"odinger (DNLS) model, due to the existence of two conserved quantities, displays an equilibrium transition between a homogeneous phase at positive absolute temperature and a localized phase at negative absolute temperature. Here, we provide a mean-field theory of DNLS through a suitable approximation of the grandcanonical partition function which makes it factorizable. By comparing our mean-field results with numerically exact ones, we show that this approximation is semi-quantitatively correct in the whole grandcanonical phase diagram, becoming increasingly accurate in proximity of the transition line and exact along the line itself. Our mean-field theory suggests that the passage from stable positive-temperature to metastable negative-temperature states is smooth and allows for a more accurate description of the metastable region.</description>

      <title>Invariant density statistical quantifiers and a temperature for the logistic map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the dynamics of the logistic map based on a probabilistic characterization in terms of the invariant density. We analyze the relevant regimes of the dynamics (regular, oscillatory, onset chaotic and fully chaotic) in terms of the Fisher information and the Cr\'amer-Rao (CR) complexity. We have found that these informational quantifiers allow to distinguish the dynamical regions of the map, by maximizing the Fisher information in the regular behavior and with the CR complexity exhibiting variations and a maximum near to the Pameau-Maneville scenario. Fisher information as a function of time is examined in the light of Frieden's informational interpretation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. We apply the Equipartition Theorem to propose a definition of temperature for the logistic map, providing a macroscopic signature of the dynamics.</description>
