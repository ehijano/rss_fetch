      <title>Phase transitions and dynamics of one-dimensional solitons in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Bose mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation, stability, and dynamics of solitons in a one-dimensional binary Bose-Einstein condensate under the action of the spin-orbit-coupling (SOC) and Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) correction to the underlying system of the Gross-Pitaevskii equations. We identify the semi-dipole (SD) family of solitons and thoroughly analyze its properties. The numerical analysis reveals intricate bifurcations, including transitions from real to complex-valued stationary wavefunctions of the SD solitons and norm-dependent dynamical instabilities. Stability maps in the plane of the solitons' norm and interaction strength exhibit areas of monostability, oscillatory behavior, and soliton splitting. Solitons with complex stationary wavefunctions emerge as ground states in broad parameter areas, due to the effects of the LHY terms. The other soliton species, in the form of mixed modes (MMs), does not feature the compexification bifurcation. In the LHY-dominated regime, the SD and MM solitons exhibit identical values of the energy for the same norm. The results deepen the understanding of nonlinear matter-wave states and reveal multi-stable ones in quantum gases.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in imbalanced bilayer Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the bilayer model with two layers of imbalanced densities coupled by the interlayer hybridization. Using the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we discovered that increased hybridization induces a transition in the superconducting pairing from $d$-wave to $s^{\pm}$-wave and the superconducting $T_c$ of $d$-wave pairing exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the density imbalance. Remarkably, the optimal SC occurs at a moderate imbalance, whose SC is solely hosted by the layer with higher density (lower hole doping). Our results support the possibility of $T_c$ enhancement in composite picture where the underdoped layer provides the pairing strength while the overdoped layer promotes the phase coherence. The uncovered SC hosted by a single layer is reminiscent of our recent exploration on the trilayer Hubbard model. Our present study thus provides new insight that the SC can be enhanced via the layer differentiation.</description>

      <title>Entanglement area law and Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem in long-range interacting systems, and symmetry-enforced long-range entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish multiple interrelated, fundamental results in quantum many-body systems that can have long-range interactions. For a sufficiently long quantum spin chain, we first show that if the multi-spin interactions in the Hamiltonian decay fast enough as their ranges increase and the Hamiltonian is gapped, then the ground states satisfy the entanglement area law, even if there is a ground state degeneracy due to a spontaneously broken discrete symmetry. This area law also holds for certain excited states. Second, if such a long-range interacting Hamiltonian has an anomalous symmetry, then the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem applies, i.e., the Hamiltonian cannot have a unique gapped symmetric ground state. If the Hamiltonian contains only 2-spin interactions, these results hold when the interactions decay faster than $1/r^2$, with $r$ the distance between the two interacting spins. Third, we show that pure states with an anomalous symmetry, which may not be a ground state of any natural Hamiltonian, must be long-range entangled. The symmetries we consider include on-site internal symmetries combined with lattice translation symmetries, and they can also extend to purely internal but non-on-site symmetries. Moreover, these internal symmetries can be discrete or continuous. We explore the applications of these results through various examples.</description>
