      <title>Advancing Operational Efficiency: Airspace Users' Perspective on Trajectory-Based Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the evolution of the Flight Operations Center (FOC) and flight trajectory exchange tools within Trajectory-Based Operations (TBO), emphasizing the benefits of the ICAO's Flight and Flow Information for a Collaborative Environment (FF-ICE) messaging framework and Electronic Flight Bags (EFBs). It highlights the collaborative management of four-dimensional flight trajectories, serving as a common reference for decision-making among stakeholders, including Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs), airspace users, and airport operators.
  Key enabling technologies such as Performance Based Navigation (PBN), data communications, and System-wide Information Management (SWIM) are discussed, showcasing their roles in rapid information exchange and trajectory optimization. A live flight case study demonstrates TBO concepts through international collaboration, indicating significant improvements in safety, efficiency, and sustainability.
  The paper presents results from TBO prototype implementations, including enhanced trajectory accuracy, improved flight path efficiency, and real-time adjustments based on evolving conditions. The integration of advanced trajectory optimization engines and automation within the FOC has led to more effective flight planning, allowing airlines to negotiate trajectory changes dynamically and optimize operations throughout the flight lifecycle.
  Findings suggest that TBO can enhance operational predictability, flexibility, and strategic planning while reducing uncertainty and improving alignment between strategic and tactical actions. Key conclusions include: TBO is feasible with most currently flying commercial aircraft; full TBO implementation can lead to a greener, more efficient aviation industry with widespread benefits; and continued collaboration among stakeholders is essential for the further development and realization of TBO.</description>

      <title>Labits: Layered Bidirectional Time Surfaces Representation for Event Camera-based Continuous Dense Trajectory Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event cameras provide a compelling alternative to traditional frame-based sensors, capturing dynamic scenes with high temporal resolution and low latency. Moving objects trigger events with precise timestamps along their trajectory, enabling smooth continuous-time estimation. However, few works have attempted to optimize the information loss during event representation construction, imposing a ceiling on this task. Fully exploiting event cameras requires representations that simultaneously preserve fine-grained temporal information, stable and characteristic 2D visual features, and temporally consistent information density, an unmet challenge in existing representations. We introduce Labits: Layered Bidirectional Time Surfaces, a simple yet elegant representation designed to retain all these features. Additionally, we propose a dedicated module for extracting active pixel local optical flow (APLOF), significantly boosting the performance. Our approach achieves an impressive 49% reduction in trajectory end-point error (TEPE) compared to the previous state-of-the-art on the MultiFlow dataset. The code will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Brain-inspired AI Agent: The Way Towards AGI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), widely regarded as the fundamental goal of artificial intelligence, represents the realization of cognitive capabilities that enable the handling of general tasks with human-like proficiency. Researchers in brain-inspired AI seek inspiration from the operational mechanisms of the human brain, aiming to replicate its functional rules in intelligent models. Moreover, with the rapid development of large-scale models in recent years, the concept of agents has garnered increasing attention, with researchers widely recognizing it as a necessary pathway toward achieving AGI. In this article, we propose the concept of a brain-inspired AI agent and analyze how to extract relatively feasible and agent-compatible cortical region functionalities and their associated functional connectivity networks from the complex mechanisms of the human brain. Implementing these structures within an agent enables it to achieve basic cognitive intelligence akin to human capabilities. Finally, we explore the limitations and challenges for realizing brain-inspired agents and discuss their future development.</description>

      <title>Integrating Vision Systems and STPA for Robust Landing and Take-Off in VTOL Aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are versatile platforms widely used in applications such as surveillance, search and rescue, and urban air mobility. Despite their potential, the critical phases of take-off and landing in uncertain and dynamic environments pose significant safety challenges due to environmental uncertainties, sensor noise, and system-level interactions. This paper presents an integrated approach combining vision-based sensor fusion with System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) to enhance the safety and robustness of VTOL UAV operations during take-off and landing. By incorporating fiducial markers, such as AprilTags, into the control architecture, and performing comprehensive hazard analysis, we identify unsafe control actions and propose mitigation strategies. Key contributions include developing the control structure with vision system capable of identifying a fiducial marker, multirotor controller and corresponding unsafe control actions and mitigation strategies. The proposed solution is expected to improve the reliability and safety of VTOL UAV operations, paving the way for resilient autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Spectral Convolutional Neural Network Chip for In-sensor Edge Computing of Incoherent Natural Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are representative models of artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, the considerable power consumption and limited computing speed of electrical computing platforms restrict further CNN development on edge devices. Optical neural networks are considered next-generation physical implementations of ANNs, but their capabilities are limited by on-chip integration scale and requirement for coherent light sources. This study proposes a spectral convolutional neural network (SCNN) of incoherent natural light by an optical convolutional layer (OCL) and a reconfigurable electrical backend. The OCL is implemented by integrating very large-scale, pixel-aligned spectral filters on a CMOS image sensor on a 12-inch wafer, facilitating highly parallel spectral vector-inner products of incident light. It accepts broadband incoherent natural light containing two spatial and one spectral dimension directly as input with the function of matter meta-imaging. This unique optoelectronic framework empowers in-sensor optical analog computing at extremely high energy efficiency because the OCL is driven by the energy of the information carrier, i. e. natural light. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first integrated optical computing utilizing natural light. We employ the same SCNN chip for completely different real-world complex tasks,and achieve accuracies of over 96% for pathological diagnosis and almost 100% for face anti-spoofing at video rates. The SCNN framework has an unprecedented new function of substance identification, provides a feasible optoelectronic and integrated optical CNN implementation for edge devices or cellphones, providing them with practical and powerful edge computing abilities and facilitating diverse applications, such as intelligent robotics, industrial automation, medical diagnosis, and remote sensing.</description>

      <title>KANQAS: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Quantum Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17630v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum architecture Search (QAS) is a promising direction for optimization and automated design of quantum circuits towards quantum advantage. Recent techniques in QAS emphasize Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)-based deep Q-networks. However, their interpretability remains challenging due to the large number of learnable parameters and the complexities involved in selecting appropriate activation functions. In this work, to overcome these challenges, we utilize the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) in the QAS algorithm, analyzing their efficiency in the task of quantum state preparation and quantum chemistry. In quantum state preparation, our results show that in a noiseless scenario, the probability of success is 2 to 5 times higher than MLPs. In noisy environments, KAN outperforms MLPs in fidelity when approximating these states, showcasing its robustness against noise. In tackling quantum chemistry problems, we enhance the recently proposed QAS algorithm by integrating curriculum reinforcement learning with a KAN structure. This facilitates a more efficient design of parameterized quantum circuits by reducing the number of required 2-qubit gates and circuit depth. Further investigation reveals that KAN requires a significantly smaller number of learnable parameters compared to MLPs; however, the average time of executing each episode for KAN is higher.</description>
