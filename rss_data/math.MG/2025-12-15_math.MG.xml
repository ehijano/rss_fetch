      <title>Tiling with Boundaries: Dense digital images have large connected components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If most of the pixels in an $n \times m$ digital image are the same color, must the image contain a large connected component? How densely can a given set of connected components pack in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ without touching? We answer these two closely related questions for both 4-connected and 8-connected components. In particular, we use structural arguments to upper bound the "white" pixel density of infinite images whose white (4- or 8-)connected components have size at most $k$. Explicit tilings show that these bounds are tight for at least half of all natural numbers $k$ in the 4-connected case, and for all $k$ in the 8-connected case. We also extend these results to finite images.
  To obtain the upper bounds, we define the exterior site perimeter of a connected component and then leverage geometric and topological properties of this set to partition images into nontrivial regions called polygonal tiles. Each polygonal tile contains a single white connected component and satisfies a certain maximality property. We then use isoperimetric inequalities to precisely bound the area of these tiles. The solutions to these problems represent new statistics on the connected component distribution of digital images.</description>

      <title>The Honeycomb Conjecture in normed planes and an alpha-convex variant of a theorem of Dowker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10622v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Honeycomb Conjecture states that among tilings with unit area cells in the Euclidean plane, the average perimeter of a cell is minimal for a regular hexagonal tiling. This conjecture was proved by L. Fejes T\'oth for convex tilings, and by Hales for not necessarily convex tilings. In this paper we investigate the same question for tilings of a given normed plane, and show that among normal, convex tilings in a normed plane, the average squared perimeter of a cell is minimal for a tiling whose cells are translates of a centrally symmetric hexagon. We also show that the question whether the same statement is true for the average perimeter of a cell is closely related to an $\alpha$-convex variant of a theorem of Dowker on the area of polygons circumscribed about a convex disk. Exploring this connection we find families of norms in which the average perimeter of a cell of a tiling is minimal for a hexagonal tiling, and prove some additonal related results. Finally, we apply our method to give a partial answer to a problem of Steinhaus about the isoperimetric ratios of cells of certain tilings in the Euclidean plane, appeared in an open problem book of Croft, Falconer and Guy.</description>

      <title>Some topological properties of the intrinsic volume metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to derive certain basic, but previously unrecorded, topological properties of the intrinsic volume metrics $\delta_1,\ldots,\delta_d$ on the space of convex bodies in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Our main results show that for every $2\leq j\leq d-1$, the topology induced by $\delta_j$ does not control the Hausdorff metric on the class of $j$-dimensional convex bodies; in particular, the condition $\delta_j(K_n,K)\to 0$ does not imply uniform boundedness in the ambient space. Furthermore, for every $2\leq j\leq d-1$, the metric space $(K_j^d,\delta_j)$ is incomplete, and remains incomplete even after adjoining the empty set.
  Our main results demonstrate that the intrinsic volume metric behaves in a fundamentally different way from the familiar Hausdorff and symmetric difference metrics. We describe the geometric mechanism that produces these phenomena and discuss implications for geometric tomography, metric stability theory and integral geometry.</description>

      <title>Minimal projections onto spaces of polynomials on real euclidean spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12123v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate projection constants within classes of multivariate polynomials over finite-dimensional real Hilbert spaces. Specifically, we consider the projection constant for spaces of spherical harmonics and spaces of homogeneous polynomials as well as for spaces of polynomials of finite degree on the unit sphere. We establish a connection between these quantities and certain weighted $L_1$-norms of specific Jacobi polynomials. As a consequence, we present exact formulas, computable expressions and asymptotically accurate estimates for them. The real case we address is considerably more nuanced than its complex counterpart.</description>
