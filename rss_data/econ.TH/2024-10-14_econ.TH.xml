      <title>Optimal Allocation with Peer Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study allocation problems without monetary transfers where agents hold private information about one another, modeled as a general form of correlated information. Such peer information is relevant in a number of settings, including science funding, allocation of targeted aid, or intra-firm allocation. We characterize optimal dominant-strategy incentive-compatible (DIC) mechanisms using techniques from the theory of perfect graphs. Optimal DIC mechanisms tend to be complex and involve allocation lotteries that cannot be purified without upsetting incentives. In rich type spaces, nearly all extreme points of the set of DIC mechanisms are stochastic. Finding an optimal deterministic DIC mechanism is NP-hard. We propose the simple class of ranking-based mechanisms and show that they are approximately optimal when agents are informationally small. These mechanisms allocate to agents ranked highly by their peers but strategically deny the allocation to agents suspected of having evaluated their peers dishonestly.</description>

      <title>Slow Convergence of Interacting Kalman Filters in Word-of-Mouth Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider word-of-mouth social learning involving $m$ Kalman filter agents that operate sequentially. The first Kalman filter receives the raw observations, while each subsequent Kalman filter receives a noisy measurement of the conditional mean of the previous Kalman filter. The prior is updated by the $m$-th Kalman filter. When $m=2$, and the observations are noisy measurements of a Gaussian random variable, the covariance goes to zero as $k^{-1/3}$ for $k$ observations, instead of $O(k^{-1})$ in the standard Kalman filter. In this paper we prove that for $m$ agents, the covariance decreases to zero as $k^{-(2^m-1)}$, i.e, the learning slows down exponentially with the number of agents. We also show that by artificially weighing the prior at each time, the learning rate can be made optimal as $k^{-1}$. The implication is that in word-of-mouth social learning, artificially re-weighing the prior can yield the optimal learning rate.</description>

      <title>Term structure shapes and their consistent dynamics in the Svensson family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the shapes attainable by the forward- and yield-curve in the widely-used Svensson family, including the Nelson-Siegel and Bliss subfamilies. We provide a complete classification of all attainable shapes and partition the parameter space of each family according to these shapes. Building upon these results, we then examine the consistent dynamic evolution of the Svensson family under absence of arbitrage. Our analysis shows that consistent dynamics further restrict the set of attainable shapes, and we demonstrate that certain complex shapes can no longer appear after a deterministic time horizon. Moreover a single shape (either inverse of normal curves) must dominate in the long-run.</description>
