      <title>MasHost Builds It All: Autonomous Multi-Agent System Directed by Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Multi-agent systems (Mas) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for tackling complex real-world tasks. However, existing Mas construction methods typically rely on manually crafted interaction mechanisms or heuristic rules, introducing human biases and constraining the autonomous ability. Even with recent advances in adaptive Mas construction, existing systems largely remain within the paradigm of semi-autonomous patterns. In this work, we propose MasHost, a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based framework for autonomous and query-adaptive Mas design. By formulating Mas construction as a graph search problem, our proposed MasHost jointly samples agent roles and their interactions through a unified probabilistic sampling mechanism. Beyond the accuracy and efficiency objectives pursued in prior works, we introduce component rationality as an additional and novel design principle in Mas. To achieve this multi-objective optimization, we propose Hierarchical Relative Policy Optimization (HRPO), a novel RL strategy that collaboratively integrates group-relative advantages and action-wise rewards. To our knowledge, our proposed MasHost is the first RL-driven framework for autonomous Mas graph construction. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that MasHost consistently outperforms most competitive baselines, validating its effectiveness, efficiency, and structure rationality.</description>

      <title>Joint Routing and Control Optimization in VANET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce DynaRoute, an adaptive joint optimization framework for dynamic vehicular networks that simultaneously addresses platoon control and data transmission through trajectory-aware routing and safety-constrained vehicle coordination. DynaRoute guarantees continuous vehicle movement via platoon safety control with optimizing transmission paths through real-time trajectory prediction and ensuring reliable data. Our solution achieves three key objectives: (1) maintaining platoon stability through accurate data transmission, (2) enabling adaptive routing based on vehicle movement patterns, and (3) enhancing overall intelligent transportation system performance. DynaRoute equires predefined traffic models and adapts to dynamic network conditions using local vehicle state information. We present comprehensive simulation results demonstrating that DynaRoute maintains control and transmission performance in multiple complex scenarios while significantly improving throughput and reliability compared to traditional approaches.</description>

      <title>CAF-I: A Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework for Enhanced Irony Detection with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) have become mainstream methods in the field of sarcasm detection. However, existing LLM methods face challenges in irony detection, including: 1. single-perspective limitations, 2. insufficient comprehensive understanding, and 3. lack of interpretability. This paper introduces the Collaborative Agent Framework for Irony (CAF-I), an LLM-driven multi-agent system designed to overcome these issues. CAF-I employs specialized agents for Context, Semantics, and Rhetoric, which perform multidimensional analysis and engage in interactive collaborative optimization. A Decision Agent then consolidates these perspectives, with a Refinement Evaluator Agent providing conditional feedback for optimization. Experiments on benchmark datasets establish CAF-I's state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. Achieving SOTA on the vast majority of metrics, CAF-I reaches an average Macro-F1 of 76.31, a 4.98 absolute improvement over the strongest prior baseline. This success is attained by its effective simulation of human-like multi-perspective analysis, enhancing detection accuracy and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Confidence Boosts Trust-Based Resilience in Cooperative Multi-Robot Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless communication-based multi-robot systems open the door to cyberattacks that can disrupt safety and performance of collaborative robots. The physical channel supporting inter-robot communication offers an attractive opportunity to decouple the detection of malicious robots from task-relevant data exchange between legitimate robots. Yet, trustworthiness indications coming from physical channels are uncertain and must be handled with this in mind. In this paper, we propose a resilient protocol for multi-robot operation wherein a parameter {\lambda}t accounts for how confident a robot is about the legitimacy of nearby robots that the physical channel indicates. Analytical results prove that our protocol achieves resilient coordination with arbitrarily many malicious robots under mild assumptions. Tuning {\lambda}t allows a designer to trade between near-optimal inter-robot coordination and quick task execution; see Fig. 1. This is a fundamental performance tradeoff and must be carefully evaluated based on the task at hand. The effectiveness of our approach is numerically verified with experiments involving platoons of autonomous cars where some vehicles are maliciously spoofed.</description>

      <title>Agentic Neural Networks: Self-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems via Textual Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging multiple Large Language Models(LLMs) has proven effective for addressing complex, high-dimensional tasks, but current approaches often rely on static, manually engineered multi-agent configurations. To overcome these constraints, we present the Agentic Neural Network(ANN), a framework that conceptualizes multi-agent collaboration as a layered neural network architecture. In this design, each agent operates as a node, and each layer forms a cooperative "team" focused on a specific subtask. Agentic Neural Network follows a two-phase optimization strategy: (1) Forward Phase-Drawing inspiration from neural network forward passes, tasks are dynamically decomposed into subtasks, and cooperative agent teams with suitable aggregation methods are constructed layer by layer. (2) Backward Phase-Mirroring backpropagation, we refine both global and local collaboration through iterative feedback, allowing agents to self-evolve their roles, prompts, and coordination. This neuro-symbolic approach enables ANN to create new or specialized agent teams post-training, delivering notable gains in accuracy and adaptability. Across four benchmark datasets, ANN surpasses leading multi-agent baselines under the same configurations, showing consistent performance improvements. Our findings indicate that ANN provides a scalable, data-driven framework for multi-agent systems, combining the collaborative capabilities of LLMs with the efficiency and flexibility of neural network principles. We plan to open-source the entire framework.</description>

      <title>Incentive-based Platoon Formation: Optimizing the Personal Benefit for Drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00570v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Platooning or cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) has been investigated for decades, but debate about its lasting impact is still ongoing. While the benefits of platooning and the formation of platoons are well understood for trucks, they are less clear for passenger cars, which have a higher heterogeneity in trips and drivers' preferences. Most importantly, it remains unclear how to form platoons of passenger cars in order to optimize the personal benefit for the individual driver. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel platoon formation algorithm that optimizes the personal benefit for drivers of individual passenger cars. For computing vehicle-to-platoon assignments, the algorithm utilizes a new metric that we propose to evaluate the personal benefits of various driving systems, including platooning. By combining fuel and travel time costs into a single monetary value, drivers can estimate overall trip costs according to a personal monetary value for time spent. This provides an intuitive way for drivers to understand and compare the benefits of driving systems like human driving, adaptive cruise control (ACC), and, of course, platooning. Unlike previous similarity-based methods, our proposed algorithm forms platoons only when beneficial for the driver, rather than solely for platooning. We demonstrate the new metric for the total trip cost in a numerical analysis and explain its interpretation. Results of a large-scale simulation study demonstrate that our proposed platoon formation algorithm outperforms normal ACC as well as previous similarity-based platooning approaches by balancing fuel savings and travel time, independent of traffic and drivers' time cost.</description>

      <title>FREIDA: A Framework for developing quantitative agent based models based on qualitative expert knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00505v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agent Based Models (ABMs) often deal with systems where there is a lack of quantitative data or where quantitative data alone may be insufficient to fully capture the complexities of real-world systems. Expert knowledge and qualitative insights, such as those obtained through interviews, ethnographic research, historical accounts, or participatory workshops, are critical in constructing realistic behavioral rules, interactions, and decision-making processes within these models. However, there is a lack of systematic approaches that are able to incorporate both qualitative and quantitative data across the entire modeling cycle. To address this, we propose FREIDA (FRamework for Expert-Informed Data-driven Agent-based models), a systematic mixed-methods framework to develop, train, and validate ABMs, particularly in data-sparse contexts. Our main technical innovation is to extract what we call Expected System Behaviors (ESBs) from qualitative data, which are testable statements that can be evaluated on model simulations. Divided into Calibration Statements (CS) for model calibration and Validation Statements (VS) for model validation, they provide a quantitative scoring mechanism on the same footing as quantitative data. In this way, qualitative insights can inform not only model specification but also its parameterization and assessment of fitness for purpose, which is a long standing challenge. We illustrate the application of FREIDA through a case study of criminal cocaine networks in the Netherlands.</description>

      <title>Edge Computing based Human-Robot Cognitive Fusion: A Medical Case Study in the Autism Spectrum Disorder Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, edge computing has served as a paradigm that enables many future technologies like AI, Robotics, IoT, and high-speed wireless sensor networks (like 5G) by connecting cloud computing facilities and services to the end users. Especially in medical and healthcare applications, it provides remote patient monitoring and increases voluminous multimedia. From the robotics angle, robot-assisted therapy (RAT) is an active-assistive robotic technology in rehabilitation robotics, attracting researchers to study and benefit people with disability like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) children. However, the main challenge of RAT is that the model capable of detecting the affective states of ASD people exists and can recall individual preferences. Moreover, involving expert diagnosis and recommendations to guide robots in updating the therapy approach to adapt to different statuses and scenarios is a crucial part of the ASD therapy process. This paper proposes the architecture of edge cognitive computing by combining human experts and assisted robots collaborating in the same framework to achieve a seamless remote diagnosis, round-the-clock symptom monitoring, emergency warning, therapy alteration, and advanced assistance.</description>

      <title>Innate-Values-driven Reinforcement Learning based Cooperative Multi-Agent Cognitive Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In multi-agent systems (MAS), the dynamic interaction among multiple decision-makers is driven by their innate values, affecting the environment's state, and can cause specific behavioral patterns to emerge. On the other hand, innate values in cognitive modeling reflect individual interests and preferences for specific tasks and drive them to develop diverse skills and plans, satisfying their various needs and achieving common goals in cooperation. Therefore, building the awareness of AI agents to balance the group utilities and system costs and meet group members' needs in their cooperation is a crucial problem for individuals learning to support their community and even integrate into human society in the long term. However, the current MAS reinforcement learning domain lacks a general intrinsic model to describe agents' dynamic motivation for decision-making and learning from an individual needs perspective in their cooperation. To address the gap, this paper proposes a general MAS innate-values reinforcement learning (IVRL) architecture from the individual preferences angle. We tested the Multi-Agent IVRL Actor-Critic Model in different StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) settings, which demonstrated its potential to organize the group's behaviours to achieve better performance.</description>

      <title>FlickerFusion: Intra-trajectory Domain Generalizing Multi-Agent RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15876v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing complex cooperative tasks across various real-world applications. However, existing MARL approaches often rely on the restrictive assumption that the number of entities (e.g., agents, obstacles) remains constant between training and inference. This overlooks scenarios where entities are dynamically removed or added during the inference trajectory -- a common occurrence in real-world environments like search and rescue missions and dynamic combat situations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of intra-trajectory dynamic entity composition under zero-shot out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, where such dynamic changes cannot be anticipated beforehand. Our empirical studies reveal that existing MARL methods suffer significant performance degradation and increased uncertainty in these scenarios. In response, we propose FlickerFusion, a novel OOD generalization method that acts as a universally applicable augmentation technique for MARL backbone methods. FlickerFusion stochastically drops out parts of the observation space, emulating being in-domain when inferenced OOD. The results show that FlickerFusion not only achieves superior inference rewards but also uniquely reduces uncertainty vis-\`a-vis the backbone, compared to existing methods. Benchmarks, implementations, and model weights are organized and open-sourced at flickerfusion305.github.io, accompanied by ample demo video renderings.</description>
