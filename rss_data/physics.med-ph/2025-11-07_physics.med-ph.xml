      <title>Dexterous Intramyocardial Needle Ablation (d-INA): Design, Fabrication, and In-Vivo Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiofrequency ablation is widely used to prevent ventricular tachycardia (VT) by creating lesions to inhibit arrhythmias; however, the current surface ablation catheters are limited in creating lesions that are deeper within the left ventricle (LV) wall. Intramyocardial needle ablation (INA) addresses this limitation by penetrating the myocardium and delivering energy from within. Yet, existing INA catheters lack adequate dexterity to navigate the highly asymmetric, trabeculated LV chamber and steer around papillary structures, limiting precise targeting. This work presents a novel dexterous INA (d-INA) toolset designed to enable effective manipulation and creation of deep ablation lesions. The system consists of an outer sheath and an inner catheter, both bidirectionally steerable, along with an integrated ablation needle assembly. Benchtop tests demonstrated that the sheath and catheter reached maximum bending curvatures of 0.088~mm$^{-1}$ and 0.114~mm$^{-1}$, respectively, and achieved stable C-, S-, and non-planar S-shaped configurations. Ex-vivo studies validated the system's stiffness modulation and lesion-creation capabilities. In-vivo experiments in two swine demonstrated the device's ability to reach previously challenging regions such as the LV summit, and achieved a 219\% increase in ablation depth compared with a standard ablation catheter. These results establish the proposed d-INA as a promising platform for achieving deep ablation with enhanced dexterity, advancing VT treatment.</description>

      <title>Computed Tomography (CT)-derived Cardiovascular Flow Estimation Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks Improves with Sinogram-based Training: A Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Non-invasive imaging-based assessment of blood flow plays a critical role in evaluating heart function and structure. Computed Tomography (CT) is a widely-used imaging modality that can robustly evaluate cardiovascular anatomy and function, but direct methods to estimate blood flow velocity from movies of contrast evolution have not been developed.
  Purpose: This study evaluates the impact of CT imaging on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN)-based flow estimation and proposes an improved framework, SinoFlow, which uses sinogram data directly to estimate blood flow.
  Methods: We generated pulsatile flow fields in an idealized 2D vessel bifurcation using computational fluid dynamics and simulated CT scans with varying gantry rotation speeds, tube currents, and pulse mode imaging settings. We compared the performance of PINN-based flow estimation using reconstructed images (ImageFlow) to SinoFlow.
  Results: SinoFlow significantly improved flow estimation performance by avoiding propagating errors introduced by filtered backprojection. SinoFlow was robust across all tested gantry rotation speeds and consistently produced lower mean squared error and velocity errors than ImageFlow. Additionally, SinoFlow was compatible with pulsed-mode imaging and maintained higher accuracy with shorter pulse widths.
  Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of SinoFlow for CT-based flow estimation, providing a more promising approach for non-invasive blood flow assessment. The findings aim to inform future applications of PINNs to CT images and provide a solution for image-based estimation, with reasonable acquisition parameters yielding accurate flow estimates.</description>

      <title>From Radiation Dose to Cellular Dynamics: A Discrete Model for Simulating Cancer Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiation therapy is one of the most common cancer treatments, and dose optimization and targeting of radiation are crucial since both cancerous and healthy cells are affected. Different mathematical and computational approaches have been developed for this task. The most common mathematical approach, dating back to the late 1970's, is the linear-quadratic (LQ) model for the survival probability given the radiation dose. Most simulation models consider tissue as a continuum rather than consisting of discrete cells. While reasonable for large-scale models (e.g., human organs), continuum approaches necessarily neglect cellular-scale effects, which may play a role in growth, morphology, and metastasis of tumors. Here, we propose a method for modeling the effect of radiation on cells based on the mechanobiological \textsc{CellSim3D} simulation model for growth, division, and proliferation of cells. To model the effect of a radiation beam, we incorporate a Monte Carlo procedure into \textsc{CellSim3D} with the LQ model by introducing a survival probability at each beam delivery. Effective removal of dead cells by phagocytosis was also implemented. Systems with two types of cells were simulated: stiff slowly proliferating healthy cells and soft rapidly proliferating cancer cells. For model verification, the results were compared to prostate cancer (PC-3 cell line) data for different doses and we found good agreement. In addition, we simulated proliferating systems and analyzed the probability density of the contact forces. We determined the state of the system with respect to the jamming transition and found very good agreement with experiments.</description>
