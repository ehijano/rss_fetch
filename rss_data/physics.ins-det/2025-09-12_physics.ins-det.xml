      <title>Uplink Pre-Compensation for Ground-to-Space Optical Communications Using Downlink Tomographic Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uplink pre-compensation in ground-to-satellite optical links remains a problem, with an appropriate measurement of the wavefront error in the uplink path often not being available. We present a method that uses successive measurements of the readily accessible downlink beam to perform a tomographic reconstruction of the volume of atmosphere common to the downlink beam and the ground-station field-of-view. These measurements are done through the existing downlink wavefront sensor. From here, an estimate of the wavefront error along the uplink path can be obtained. We evaluate this method in simulation over representative atmospheric conditions and find good performance, especially for situations where the satellite point-ahead angle is many times greater than the atmosphere's isoplanatic angle. Compared to pre-compensation directly using the downlink phase, we find that this method estimates the uplink path with a residual mean-square wavefront error that is up to 8.6 times less. The hardware simplicity of this method makes it a promising solution for uplink pre-compensation implementations targeted at optical communications.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of thin planar radiopure foils with 82Se for the SuperNEMO Demonstrator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SuperNEMO Demonstrator, designed to search for double beta decay using enriched 82Se, has been assembled in the Modane Underground Laboratory under the French Alps. Thin foils with radio - purified and enriched 82Se are installed centrally in the detector. A novel foil fabrication method has been developed, improving the radiopurity achieved in the previous generation experiment. It consists of wrapping standalone selenium pads in raw Mylar, combined with selenium purified by a new reverse-chromatography method. This paper describes the features of these foils, their fabrication process, the characterization results, and the integration of the foils into the SuperNEMO Demonstrator.</description>

      <title>HitPix3 -- a new HV-CMOS active pixel sensor for ion beam therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle therapy is a well-established clinical treatment of tumors and so far, more than one hundred centers are in operation around the world. High accuracy on position and dose rate in beam monitoring are major cornerstones of clinical success in particle therapy. A high voltage CMOS (HV-CMOS) monolithic active pixel sensor was developed for this beam monitoring system. The HV-CMOS technology has demonstrated many advantages over other technologies in dealing with radiation tolerance. This HV-CMOS sensor was produced with a 180 nm commercial technology on high-resistivity substrate. The HitPix sensor features several specific design details for operation in a high-intensity ion beam environment: hit-counting pixels, on-sensor projection calculation, radiation tolerant design and frame-based readout. It has a 9775 $\mu$m $\times$ 10110 $\mu$m sensor area with 200 $\mu$m $\times$ 200 $\mu$m pixel size. The new HitPix3 has a number of improvements, including a modified in-pixel amplifier, on-sensor calculation of beam profile projection in two dimensions, and in-pixel threshold tuning capacity. The functionality of these features was confirmed in laboratory tests of unirradiated HitPix3 sensors, making the HitPix3 an important step in developing a sensor for use in ion beam monitoring.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic geometric anti-spring vibration isolation system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of low temperature and low vibration levels is key for ultrasensitive sensing applications such as scanning probe microscopy, large-mass quantum mechanics, and gravitational wave detection. Unfortunately, closed-cycle cryostats using pulse tube or GM coolers introduce strong low-frequency vibrations starting at 1 Hz. Mass-spring systems allow passive isolation, but for low-frequency applications the required spring constants and masses become impractical. Blade-based geometric anti-spring systems are compact isolators that operate from sub-Hz frequencies, but have not been demonstrated at cryogenic temperatures. Here, we characterize a geometric anti-spring system tuned to operate at cryogenic temperatures. Our cryogenic filter uses radially arranged titanium blade springs whose effective spring constant can be tuned in-situ using a magnetic actuator. Our system achieves a vertical resonance frequency of 185 mHz at 7K, which allows reduction of vibrations at the problematic 1 Hz cooler frequency by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>TCT-based monitoring of LGAD radiation hardness for ATLAS-HGTD production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Production of the High Granularity Timing Detector for the ATLAS experiment at High Luminosity LHC requires over 21000 silicon sensors based on Low Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD) technology. Their radiation hardness is monitored as a part of the production quality control. Dedicated test structures from each wafer are irradiated with neutrons and a fast and comprehensive characterization is required. We introduce a new test method based on Transient Current Technique (TCT) performed in the interface region of two LGAD devices. The measurement enables extraction of numerous sensor performance parameters, such as LGAD gain layer depletion voltage, LGAD gain dependence on bias voltage, sensor leakage current and effective interpad distance. Complementary capacitance-voltage measurements and charge collection measurements with 90Sr on the same samples have been performed to calibrate the TCT results in terms of charge collection and define acceptance criteria for wafer radiation hardness in the ATLAS-HGTD project.</description>

      <title>Study of a Compact Device for Water Attenuation Length Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the development and validation of a compact device for measuring the water attenuation length (WAL), utilizing photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), optical fibers, and LEDs. An 8 m water tank and the device was constructed and validated in the laboratory. The device is capable of measuring WAL values up to 50 m. The stray light was blocked mainly by a custom-designed shutter. Toy Monte Carlo simulations were employed to evaluate the measurement uncertainty, which was found to be within reasonable limits. These simulations further indicate that the uncertainty can be reduced and more accurately predicted for a larger-scale device with a length of 30 m. Real-time monitoring was achieved by integrating the device into a water purification circulation system, providing a practical, scalable solution for WAL measurement in future large-scale water Cherenkov detectors.</description>

      <title>New results from fast timing iLGAD sensor on Timepix4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) the number of collisions per bunch crossing increases. To cope with these high rates in the pixel trackers, per-pixel time measurements are required, which implies the need for fast sensors. The inverse Low-Gain Avalanche Detector (iLGAD) is one of the fast sensor options that is being investigated. This paper will show the results of an inverse Low-Gain Avalanche Detector (iLGAD) with a pitch of 55 \textmu m, a thickness of 250~\textmu m and a large-area (2~cm$^2$), bump bonded to a Timepix4 ASIC. Timepix4 has 195~ps time binning on each pixel and therefore an excellent ASIC to test the sensor. The sensor is characterised with radio-active source measurements in the lab, and during beam test at the CERN SPS North Area H8 beamline, where the Timepix4 telescope was used. The telescope has a time reference of 12~ps and a pointing resolution of 2.4 $\pm$ 0.1~\textmu m. The iLGAD shows an almost uniform gain of approximately 4 and an efficiency of 99.6 $\pm$ 0.1\%. Without any corrections the obtained time resolution is about 750~ps. After timewalk and clock corrections the time resolution becomes 377 $\pm$ 7~ps. Grazing angle measurements have been done, which allow to measure the time resolution as function of depth of the charge deposition in the sensor. This provides more insight for the perpendicular time resolution.</description>

      <title>Novel Room-Temperature Synthesis of Tellurium-Loaded Liquid Scintillators for Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study establishes an innovative room-temperature synthesis approach for tellurium-diol (Te-diol) compounds, which are crucial components in tellurium-loaded liquid scintillator (Te-LS). The synthesis involves the direct reaction of telluric acid with diols (e.g., 1,2-hexanediol) in methanol under ambient conditions (20$\pm$5{\deg}C) , with the key features of lower energy consumption, enhanced safety, and improved scalability. Mechanistic studies reveal that methanol serves not merely as a solvent but also as a catalyst, playing a critical role in the room-temperature synthesis. The organic amine N,N-dimethyldodecylamine demonstrates dual functionality as both catalyst and stabilizer. The Te-diol compounds enable fabrication of high-performance Te-LS exhibiting exceptional optical transparency ($\Delta Abs$(430nm) $\leq$ 0.0003 per 1% Te loading), achieving long-term spectral stability exceeding or approaching one year for both 1% and 3% Te formulations, and demonstrating a light yield comparable to that achieved by the azeotropic distillation method. The developed protocol offers a green, efficient alternative for large-scale Te-LS production, particularly valuable for next-generation neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments.</description>

      <title>Chromatic Calorimetry -- A Novel Approach to Validate Energy Resolution and Particle Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chromatic calorimetry (CCAL) analyses particle detection by utilizing scintillators with distinct emission wavelengths to measure the longitudinal energy deposition of particle showers in high-energy physics, improving particle identification (PID) and energy resolution. By stacking scintillators in order of decreasing emission wavelength, CCAL enables layer-specific energy measurements, analyzed via amplitude fractions ($f_i = A_i / \sum_j A_j$) and center of gravity ($\langle z_{\text{cog}} \rangle = \sum_i z_i E_i / \sum_i E_i$). This thesis presents results from two CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) experiments conducted in 2023 and 2024, complemented by GEANT4 simulations of a quantum dot (QD)-based CCAL design, to validate its potential for future colliders such as the Future Circular Collider (FCC).</description>

      <title>Gain characterization of LGAD sensors with beta particles and 28-MeV protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low Gain Avalanche Diodes, also known as LGADs, are widely considered for fast-timing applications in high energy physics, nuclear physics, space science, medical imaging, and precision measurements of rare processes. Such devices are silicon-based and feature an intrinsic gain due to a $p{^+}$-doped layer that allows the production of a controlled avalanche of carriers, with multiplication on the order of 10-100. This technology can provide time resolution on the order of 20-30 ps, and variants of this technology can provide precision tracking too. The characterization of LGAD performance has so far primarily been focused on the interaction of minimum ionizing particles for high energy and nuclear physics applications. This article expands the study of LGAD performance to highly-ionizing particles, such as 28-MeV protons, which are relevant for several future scientific applications, e.g. in biology and medical physics, among others. These studies were performed with a beam of 28-MeV protons from a tandem Van de Graaff accelerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory and beta particles from a $^{90}{\rm Sr}$ source; these were used to characterize the response and the gain of an LGAD as a function of bias voltage and collected charge. The experimental results are also compared to TCAD simulations.</description>

      <title>Early Career Researcher Input to the European Strategy for Particle Physics Update: White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19862v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This document, written by early career researchers (ECRs) in particle physics, aims to represent the perspectives of the European ECR community and serves as input for the 2025--2026 update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics. With input from a community-wide survey, it highlights key challenges faced by ECRs -- career stability, funding access and long-term research opportunities -- while proposing policy recommendations and targeted initiatives. It underscores the importance of practices fostering diverse, equitable, inclusive and healthy workplaces, as well as of stronger ECR communities, and highlights how effective communication and interdisciplinary collaborations reinforce the societal relevance of particle physics and promote continued support for large-scale and long-term projects. Finally, the future of both collider and beyond-collider experiments is addressed, emphasising the critical role of ECRs in shaping future projects. The ECR contribution is formed of two parts: the ten-page executive summary submitted as input to the European Strategy for Particle Physics Update and, as backup document, this extended white paper providing additional context.</description>

      <title>Geometric Optical Throughput and Etendue Revisited: Introducing the Optogeometric Factor for Pixel Level Quantitative Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper formally defines the optogeometric factor $F_{\mathrm{opg}}$ as a pixel level quantity of geometric optical throughput, with units of $\text{m}^2\cdot\text{sr}$ (or $\text{m}^2$ in reduced form), derived from \'etendue. Whereas \'etendue is conventionally used to characterise the throughput of entire optical systems, the optogeometric factor is localised to the level of a single detector pixel, providing a new way to link scene radiance to the radiant flux actually collected by that pixel.
  Although examples are drawn from infrared thermography, the formulation is general and applies equally to visible, ultraviolet, and Xray imaging systems.
  The underlying radiometric principle is well established: classical radiometry already relates radiance, area, and solid angle. The new contribution of this work is to isolate that pixel level term, to name it as $F_{\mathrm{opg}}$, and to derive its explicit forms. In this way, $F_{\mathrm{opg}}$ acts as a compact and universal descriptor of pixel level radiometric throughput.
  The present study builds on an earlier quantitative thermography equation that already expressed the radiant flux collected by an individual pixel. In that formulation, the scene based form of the optogeometric factor was present only implicitly, embedded in the derivation. Here, $F_{\mathrm{opg}}$ is made explicit as an independent radiometric quantity, providing a more transparent and general framework that links pixel level geometry to radiometric throughput.
  Two formulations of $F_{\mathrm{opg}}$ are derived: a scene based form, expressed through the pixel footprint area and instantaneous field of view, and a sensor based form, expressed through the pixel pitch and optical $f$number. They coincide numerically under the paraxial approximation and other conditions discussed in this work.</description>
