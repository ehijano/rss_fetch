      <title>ALICE highlights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent ALICE results on hard probes, focusing on open heavy flavor, quarkonia, and jet measurements in pp and Pb--Pb collisions are presented. During the LHC Run 3, the continuous readout of the upgraded Time Projection Chamber (TPC) with GEM technology, along with improved tracking from ITS2 and the newly installed Muon Forward Tracker (MFT), have enabled high-precision studies of quarkonia and heavy flavour production, and jet modification in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). These new measurements provide crucial constraints on parton energy loss mechanisms and heavy-quark dynamics in hot QCD matter. Future upgrades planned for Run 4, as well as the long-term ALICE 3 with an all-silicon tracking system, will further enhance the ability to study the properties of QGP with unprecedented accuracy.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic systems for the TUCAN EDM experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The TUCAN (TRIUMF UltraCold Advanced Neutron) Collaboration is completing a new ultracold neutron (UCN) source. The UCN source will deliver UCNs to a neutron electric dipole moment (EDM) experiment. The EDM experiment is projected to be capable of an uncertainty of $1\times 10^{-27}~e$cm, competitive with other planned projects, and a factor of ten more precise than the present world's best. The TUCAN source is based on a UCN production volume of superfluid helium (He-II), held at 1~K, and coupled to a proton-driven spallation target. The production rate in the source is expected to be in excess of $10^7$~UCN/s; since UCN losses can be small in superfluid helium, this should allow us to build up a large number of UCNs. The spallation-driven superfluid helium technology is the principal aspect making the TUCAN project unique. The superfluid production volume was recently cooled, for the first time, and successfully filled with superfluid helium. The design principles of the UCN source are described, along with some of the challenging cryogenic milestones that were recently passed.</description>

      <title>Energy Correlators: A Journey From Theory to Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collider experiments offer a unique opportunity to explore the Standard Model (SM), and to search for new physics, new interactions, and new principles of nature. The theoretical abstraction of a collider, namely the study of correlations in asymptotic fluxes, provides one of the most basic examples of an observable in quantum field theory (QFT) and quantum gravity. Energy flux is described in QFT by energy flow operators, a particular example of light-ray operators. In addition to their central role in the theoretical description of collider physics, energy flow operators play an important role in diverse areas of formal QFT and gravity, providing a connection between real world collider phenomenology, and the deep underlying principles of QFT.
  Recently it has become possible to measure correlation functions of energy flow operators in a wide variety of collider experiments, providing an exciting new connection between collider physics and formal theory. In this review, we provide a survey of recent progress in our understanding of energy operators and their correlators, highlighting their importance in both formal theory and collider phenomenology, and in particular, their great potential for bridging these areas to provide new ways to understand the real world. We intend this article as a resource for both formal theorists interested in understanding how light-ray operators are being applied in particle and nuclear physics, as well as for experimentalists interested in the theoretical motivation for these observables. Most importantly, we aim to stimulate further interaction between the formal, phenomenological and experimental communities through the common lens of energy correlators.</description>

      <title>Spin alignment of Quarkonia: A Possible Probe of a Deconfined QCD matter in Heavy-ion Collisions at TeV Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the influence of deconfined QCD matter on quarkonium spin alignment in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We estimate the spin alignment of charmonium ($J/\psi$, and $\psi$(2S)) and bottomonium ($\Upsilon$(1S), and $\Upsilon$(2S)) states by calculating the energy eigenvalues in a thermal rotating medium. We solve the Schr\"odinger equation with a medium-modified color-singlet potential considering the coupling of spin with vorticity and magnetic field. Furthermore, we evaluate the effect of medium temperature, vorticity, magnetic field, and momentum-space anisotropy on the elements of the spin density matrix. Our findings reveal that vorticity increases the spin alignment, while the magnetic fields and anisotropy modify the observables in a state-dependent manner. These findings deepen our understanding of quarkonium spin alignment in an anisotropic magneto-vortical thermal medium, shedding light on spin transport phenomena in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Heavy Quark State Production via p-p and O-O Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we have considered $J/\Psi$ is a normal charmonium meson, while $\Psi(2S)$ is a mixed hybrid charmonium meson. Similarly $\Upsilon(1S)$ and$\Upsilon(2S)$ are normal upsilon mesons, while $\Upsilon(3S)$ is a mixed hybrid upsilon meson. We discuss the differential rapidity cross sections for $J/\Psi$, $\Psi(2S)$, $\Upsilon(1S)$, $\Upsilon(2S)$, $\Upsilon(3S)$ production via p-p, and O-O collisions at proton-proton energy $\equiv \sqrt{s_{pp}}$= 5.44 TeV. The rapidity taken for the present study goes from y=-1 to 1.</description>

      <title>Modern approach to muonic x-ray spectroscopy demonstrated through the measurement of stable Cl radii</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in muonic x-ray experiments have reinvigorated efforts in measurements of absolute nuclear charge radii. Here, a modern approach is presented, and demonstrated through determination of the charge radii of the two stable chlorine nuclides $^{35}$Cl and $^{37}$Cl. Knowledge of these radii has implications for fundamental studies in nuclear and atomic physics. For this purpose, a state-of-the-art experiment was performed at the $\pi$E1 beamline in the Paul Scherrer Institute (Switzerland), using a large-scale HPGe detector array in order to extract precise energies of the muonic $^{35}$Cl and $^{37}$Cl $np1s$ transitions. The nuclear charge radius extraction relies on modern calculations for QED effects and nuclear polarization with rigorous uncertainty quantification, including effects that were not accounted for in older studies. Additionally, we established a new method for applying the nuclear shape correction directly from energy density functionals, which are amenable to isotopes for which no high-quality electron scattering experiments are available. The resulting charge radii are $3.3335(23) fm$ for $^{35}$Cl and $3.3445(23) fm$ for $^{37}$Cl, thus improving the uncertainty of the available electron scattering values by a factor of seven. The correlation of several observables was evaluated between the different isotopes in order to produce a more precise value of the differential mean square charge radius $\delta \langle r^2 \rangle^{37, 35}=+0.0771(66) fm^{2}$. In this case, improvement of the uncertainty by more than one order of magnitude was achieved compared to the literature value. This precision is sufficient to use this differential as input for isotope shift factor determination.</description>

      <title>New Angles on Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy correlators have recently come to the forefront of jet substructure studies at colliders due to their remarkable properties: they naturally separate physics at different scales, are robust to contamination from soft radiation, and offer a direct connection with quantum field theory. The current parametrization used for energy correlators, however, is based on redundant pairwise angles with complex phase space restrictions. In this Letter, we introduce a new parametrization of energy correlators that features a simpler phase space structure and preserves information about the orientation of jet constituents. Further, our parametrization drastically reduces the computational cost to compute energy correlators on experimental data; whereas the time to compute a traditional projected $N$-point energy correlator scales as $M^N/N!$ on a jet with $M$ particles, our new parametrization achieves a scaling of $M^2 \log M$, remarkably independently of N. Even for N=3, this improved scaling is particularly important for studies of heavy ion collisions, and higher values of $N$ will enable new qualitative understanding of gauge theories. Theoretical calculations for our new energy correlators differ from those of traditional parametrizations only at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy and beyond, and we expect that our simpler phase space structure will simplify those calculations. We also discuss how to extend our parametrization to resolved $N$-point energy correlators that encode angular distances between greater numbers of particles, yielding intuitive visualizations of jet substructure that are qualitatively different for different jet samples. We propose two possible generalizations for probing multi-prong jets and testing jet scaling behavior.</description>

      <title>NNPDFpol2.0: a global determination of polarised PDFs and their uncertainties at next-to-next-to-leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present NNPDFpol2.0, a new set of collinear helicity parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton based on legacy measurements of structure functions in inclusive neutral-current longitudinally polarised deep-inelastic scattering (DIS), and of W -boson, single-inclusive, and di-jet production asymmetries in longitudinally polarised proton-proton collisions. The determination is accurate to next-to-next-to-leading order in the strong coupling, and includes heavy quark mass corrections in the analysis of DIS data. Uncertainties due to missing higher-order corrections are systematically incorporated by means of a covariance matrix determined by scale variations. NNPDFpol2.0 is based on a machine learning methodology, that makes use of Monte Carlo sampling for the representation of uncertainties into PDFs, of a neural network for the parametrisation of PDFs, of stochastic gradient descent for the optimisation of PDF parameters, and of hyperoptimisation for the selection of the best fitting model. We study the impact on PDFs of higher-order corrections, of the positivity constraint, and of the data. We demonstrate two phenomenological applications of NNPDFpol2.0, specifically the determination of the proton spin fraction carried by gluons and quarks, and of theoretical predictions for single-hadron production in longitudinally polarised DIS and proton-proton collisions.</description>
