      <title>Bluetooth Fingerprint Identification Under Domain Shift Through Transient Phase Derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based radio frequency fingerprinting (RFFP) has become an enabling physical-layer security technology, allowing device identification and authentication through received RF signals. This technology, however, faces significant challenges when it comes to adapting to domain variations, such as time, location, environment, receiver and channel. For Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices, addressing these challenges is particularly crucial due to the BLE protocol's frequency-hopping nature. In this work, and for the first time, we investigated the frequency hopping effect on RFFP of BLE devices, and proposed a novel, low-cost, domain-adaptive feature extraction method. Our approach improves the classification accuracy by up to 58\% across environments and up to 80\% across receivers compared to existing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Enhanced Covert Dual-Functional Radar-Communication: Joint Beamforming and Antenna Position Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has emerged as a promising technology to flexibly reconfigure wireless channels by adjusting antenna placement. In this paper, we study a dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) system enhanced with movable antennas. To ensure communication security, we aim to maximize the achievable sum rate by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming vectors, receiving filter, and antenna placement, subject to radar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance and transmission covertness constraints. To tackle this challenging optimization problem, we first employ a Lagrangian dual transformation process to reformulate it into a more tractable form. Subsequently, the problem is solved by introducing a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm, incorporating semidefinite relaxation (SDR), projected gradient descent (PGD), and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the covert sum rate, and achieve a satisfactory balance between the communication and radar performance compared with existing benchmark schemes by leveraging the flexibility of movable antennas.</description>

      <title>Active IRS Assisted Joint Uplink and Downlink Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided wireless communication system, where active IRSs (AIRSs) are deployed to assist communication between a base station (BS) and users of both the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL). We aim to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) of UL and DL communications through joint optimization of BS, AIRS beamforming, and AIRS element allocation. First, we study three deployment schemes, namely distributed AIRSs, BS-side AIRS, and user-side AIRS. For distributed AIRSs, both optimal and near-optimal solutions are derived in closed form. To draw useful insights, we analytically compare the deployment schemes in terms of the rate performance under the single-user setup. For the multi-user case, we consider two beamforming setups at the distributed AIRSs to balance performance and complexity tradeoffs. Regarding the user-adaptive AIRS beamforming, different AIRS beamforming vectors are adopted for each user; while for the static AIRS beamforming, all users share the same beamforming vectors, with identical phase shifts but different amplitudes for UL and DL. With the user-adaptive AIRS beamforming, we focus on the optimization of element allocation for rate maximization. With static AIRS beamforming, we solve the rate maximization problem by optimizing the BS transmit/receive beamformers, user beamforming, and AIRS beamforming. Despite its non-convexity, we develop an efficient alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm that solves each sub-problem optimally. Numerical results validate the practical advantages of distributed AIRSs compared to passive IRS (PIRS), BS-side AIRS, and user-side AIRS, and highlight the benefits of dynamic IRS beamforming.</description>

      <title>MIMO Radar Meets Polarization-Reconfigurable Antennas: A BCRB Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a novel multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar system aided by phase shifter based polarization-reconfigurable antennas (PRAs). Specifically, a base station (BS) equipped with multiple PRAs at both the transmitter and the receiver aims to sense the unknown and random angular location parameter of a point target via sending wireless signals and processing the received echo signals reflected by the target, where only prior distribution information about the location parameter is available for exploitation. Firstly, we characterize the sensing performance of this novel PRA-based MIMO radar system by deriving the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (BCRB) of the mean-squared error (MSE) in estimating the desired location parameter with prior distribution information. Then, to fully exploit the new design degrees-of-freedom (DoF) empowered by PRAs, we study the joint optimization of the transmit sample covariance matrix as well as the transmit and receive phase shift vectors to minimize the sensing BCRB subject to a transmit power constraint. This problem is non-convex and difficult to solve due to the coupling among optimization variables. To resolve this issue, we develop an alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm which iteratively obtains the closed-form optimal solution to each variable with the others being fixed at each time, thus being guaranteed to converge to at least a stationary point of the joint optimization problem. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Synchrosqueezed windowed linear canonical transform: A method for mode retrieval from multicomponent signals with crossing instantaneous frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In nature, signals often appear in the form of the superposition of multiple non-stationary signals. The overlap of signal components in the time-frequency domain poses a significant challenge for signal analysis. One approach to addressing this problem is to introduce an additional chirprate parameter and use the chirplet transform (CT) to elevate the two-dimensional time-frequency representation to a three-dimensional time-frequency-chirprate representation. From a certain point of view, the CT of a signal can be regarded as a windowed special linear canonical transform of that signal, undergoing a shift and a modulation.
  In this paper, we develop this idea to propose a novel windowed linear canonical transform (WLCT), which provides a new time-frequency-chirprate representation. We discuss four types of WLCTs. In addition, we use a special X-ray transform to further sharpen the time-frequency-chirprate representation. Furthermore, we derive the corresponding three-dimensional synchrosqueezed transform, demonstrating that the WLCTs have great potential for three-dimensional signal separation.</description>

      <title>Multi-Carrier Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers with Enhanced Bandwidth Feature for Communication and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their ultra-high sensitivity. Although capable of precisely detecting the amplitude and phase of weak signals, conventional RAQRs face inherent limitations in accurately receiving wideband RF signals, due to the discrete nature of atomic energy levels and their intrinsic instantaneous bandwidth constraints. These limitations hinder their direct application to multi-carrier communication and sensing. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multi-carrier Rydberg atomic quantum receiver (MC-RAQR) structure with five energy levels. We derive the amplitude and phase of the MC-RAQR and extract the baseband electrical signal for signal processing. In terms of multi-carrier communication and sensing, we analyze the channel capacity and accuracy of angle of arrival (AoA) and distance parameters, respectively. Numerical results validate our proposed model, showing that the MC-RAQR can achieve up to a bandwidth of 14 MHz, which is 56-fold larger than the conventional RAQRs. As a result, the channel capacity and the resolution for multi-target sensing are improved significantly. Specifically, the channel capacity of MC-RAQR is 22-fold and 3-fold larger than the conventional antennas and RAQRs, respectively. For sensing performance, the MSE of AoA estimation for MC-RAQR is 0.16% of the conventional RAQR and the MSE of distance estimation is 0.01% of the CRB of conventional antennas, showing the superior performance of the MC-RAQR. This demonstrates its compatibility with waveforms such as orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and its significant advantages for multi-carrier signal reception.</description>

      <title>Graph Signal Wiener Filtering in the Linear Canonical Domain: Theory and Method Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The graph linear canonical transform (GLCT)-based filtering methods often optimize transform parameters and filters separately, which results in high computational costs and limited stability. To address this issue, this paper proposes a trainable joint optimization framework that combines GLCT parameters and Wiener filtering into an end-to-end learning process, allowing for synergistic optimization between transform domain construction and filtering operations. The proposed method not only eliminates the cumbersome grid search required by traditional strategies but also significantly enhances the flexibility and training stability of the filtering system. Experimental results on real-world graph data show the proposed method outperforms existing methods in denoising tasks, featuring superior denoising performance, higher robustness and lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>SVD-based ugmt-gft on directed product graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional directed graph signal processing generally depends on fixed representation matrices, whose rigid structures limit the model's ability to adapt to complex graph topologies. To address this issue, this study employed the unified graph representation matrix (UGRM) to propose a generalized graph Fourier transform (UGRM-GFT) method based on singular value decomposition (SVD) for signal analysis on directed graphs and Cartesian product graphs. We defined UGRM-GFT for general directed graphs by introducing a parameterized UGRM that incorporates traditional representations such as the Laplacian matrix and adjacency matrix. The SVD is used to construct spectral transform pairs with both left and right singular vectors. We extended this approach to two types of UGRM-GFTs applied to directed Cartesian product graphs. UGRM-GFT-I performs SVD directly on the composite UGRM matrix of the two-dimensional graph structure, suitable for globally coupled graph signals. UGRM-GFT-II separately applies SVD to the UGRMs of the two-factor graphs and then combines the results, significantly reducing computational complexity while preserving spectral expressiveness. Theoretical analysis confirmed the monotonicity of the proposed method with respect to the parameters alpha and k embedded in the UGRM. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrated that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional fixed-matrix approaches in denoising tasks, with a particular emphasis on signal-to-noise ratio and bandwidth efficiency.</description>

      <title>Data Integration Using Multivariate Mode Decomposition for Physiological Sensing with Multiple Millimeter-Wave Radar Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a multi-radar system for non-contact physiological sensing across arbitrary body orientations. In integrating signals obtained from different radar viewpoints, we adopt a multivariate variational mode decomposition method to extract the common respiratory component. Experiments conducted with six subjects under varying distances and orientations demonstrate that, compared with a single-radar setup, the proposed system reduced the root mean square error of the respiratory interval by 35.5%, decreased the mean absolute error of the respiratory rate by 30.8%, and improved accuracy by 9.4 percentage points. These results highlight that combining multiple radar viewpoints with signal integration enables stable respiratory measurement regardless of body orientation.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model-Empowered Channel Prediction and Predictive Beamforming for LEO Satellite Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate channel prediction and effective beamforming are essential for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications to enhance system capacity and enable high-speed connectivity. Most existing channel prediction and predictive beamforming methods are limited by model generalization capabilities and struggle to adapt to time-varying wireless propagation environments. Inspired by the remarkable generalization and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), this work proposes an LLM-based channel prediction framework, namely CPLLM, to forecast future channel state information (CSI) for LEO satellites based on historical CSI data. In the proposed CPLLM, a dedicated CSI encoder is designed to map raw CSI data into the textual embedding space, effectively bridging the modality gap and enabling the LLM to perform reliable reasoning over CSI data. Additionally, a CSI decoder is introduced to simultaneously predict CSI for multiple future time slots, substantially reducing the computational burden and inference latency associated with the inherent autoregressive decoding process of LLMs. Then, instead of training the LLM from scratch, we adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, i.e., LoRA, for CPLLM, where the pretrained LLM remains frozen and trainable low-rank matrices are injected into each Transformer decoder layer to enable effective fine-tuning. Furthermore, we extend CPLLM to directly generate beamforming strategies for future time slots based on historical CSI data, namely BFLLM. This extended framework retains the same architecture as CPLLM, while introducing a dedicated beamforming decoder to output beamforming strategies. Finally, extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in channel prediction and predictive beamforming for LEO satellite communications.</description>

      <title>Covert Waveform Design for Integrated Sensing and Communication System in Clutter Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system covert waveform design method for complex clutter environments, with the core objective of maximizing the signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR). The design achieves efficient clutter suppression while meeting the covertness requirement through joint optimization of the transmit waveform and receive filter, enabling cooperative radar detection and wireless communication. This study presents key innovations that explicitly address target Doppler shift uncertainty, significantly enhancing system robustness against Doppler effects. To ensure communication reliability, the method incorporates phase difference constraints between communication signal elements in the waveform design, along with energy constraint, covert constraint, and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) constraint. The original non-convex optimization problem is transformed into a tractable convex optimization form through convex optimization technique. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimized waveform not only satisfies the covertness requirement in complex clutter environment, but also achieves superior target detection performance. It also ensures reliable communication and confirms the effectiveness of propose method.</description>

      <title>A Parametric Power Model of Upper Mid-Band (FR3) Base Stations for 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing attention is given to the upper mid-band or Frequency Range 3 (FR3), from 7 to 24 GHz, in the research towards sixth-generation (6G) networks. Promises of offering large data rates at favorable propagation conditions are leading to novel FR3 base station (BS) architectures, with up to thousands of antenna elements and radio-frequency (RF) chains. This work investigates the power consumption of prospective FR3 BSs and its relation to the delivered data rates. We model the power consumed by digital and analog signal processing, power amplifiers (PAs), and supply and cooling during four phases (data, signaling, micro-sleep, and idle) in downlink and uplink. Hybrid partially-connected beamforming is compared to fully-digital one. Results show that, for BS arrays with $1024$ antennas at $30\%$ of load, the PA consumes most of the power when $64$ or less RF chains are utilized, while the digital and analog processing consumption takes over when the number of RF chains is $512$ or more. The digital plus analog processing consumes $2\times$ to $4\times$ more than the PA for fully-digital beamforming. Hybrid beamforming achieves $1.3$ Gbit/s/user in downlink while improving the energy efficiency by $1.4\times$ compared to fully-digital beamforming.</description>

      <title>HYPERDOA: Robust and Efficient DoA Estimation using Hyperdimensional Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation techniques face a critical trade-off, as classical methods often lack accuracy in challenging, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, while modern deep learning approaches are too energy-intensive and opaque for resource-constrained, safety-critical systems. We introduce HYPERDOA, a novel estimator leveraging Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC). The framework introduces two distinct feature extraction strategies -- Mean Spatial-Lag Autocorrelation and Spatial Smoothing -- for its HDC pipeline, and then reframes DoA estimation as a pattern recognition problem. This approach leverages HDC's inherent robustness to noise and its transparent algebraic operations to bypass the expensive matrix decompositions and ``black-box'' nature of classical and deep learning methods, respectively. Our evaluation demonstrates that HYPERDOA achieves ~35.39% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods in low-SNR, coherent-source scenarios. Crucially, it also consumes ~93% less energy than competing neural baselines on an embedded NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX platform. This dual advantage in accuracy and efficiency establishes HYPERDOA as a robust and viable solution for mission-critical applications on edge devices.</description>

      <title>Spatially Filtered Sparse Bayesian Learning for Direction-of-Arrival Estimation with Leaky-Wave Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation with leaky-wave antennas (LWAs) offers a compact and cost-effective alternative to conventional antenna arrays but remains challenging in the presence of coherent sources. To address this issue, we propose a spatially filtered sparse Bayesian learning (SF-SBL) framework. Firstly, the field of view (FoV) is divided into angular sectors according to the frequency beam-scanning property of LWAs, and Bayesian inverse problems are then solved within each sector to improve efficiency and reduce computational cost. Both on-grid SBL and off-grid SBL formulations are developed. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves robust and accurate DoA estimation, even with coherent sources.</description>

      <title>Spatial Signal Focusing and Noise Suppression for Direction-of-Arrival Estimation in Large-Aperture 2D Arrays under Demanding Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direction-of-Arrival (DOA) estimation in sensor arrays faces limitations under demanding conditions, including low signal-to-noise ratio, single-snapshot scenarios, coherent sources, and unknown source counts. Conventional beamforming suffers from sidelobe interference, adaptive methods (e.g., MVDR) and subspace algorithms (e.g., MUSIC) degrade with limited snapshots or coherent signals, while sparse-recovery approaches (e.g., L1-SVD) incur high computational complexity for large arrays. In this article, we construct the concept of the optimal spatial filter to solve the DOA estimation problem under demanding conditions by utilizing the sparsity of spatial signals. By utilizing the concept of the optimal spatial filter, we have transformed the DOA estimation problem into a solution problem for the optimal spatial filter. We propose the Spatial Signal Focusing and Noise Suppression (SSFNS) algorithm, which is a novel DOA estimation framework grounded in the theoretical existence of an optimal spatial filter, to solve for the optimal spatial filter and obtain DOA. Through experiments, it was found that the proposed algorithm is suitable for large aperture two-dimensional arrays and experiments have shown that our proposed algorithm performs better than other algorithms in scenarios with few snapshots or even a single snapshot, low signal-to-noise ratio, coherent signals, and unknown signal numbers in two-dimensional large aperture arrays.</description>

      <title>Dual-Waveguide Pinching Antennas for PLS: Parallel Placement or Orthogonal Placement?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching antennas (PAs), as an emerging flexible-antenna technology, enables movable PAs deployed along waveguides to customize channel conditions over a large scale. This paper investigates an application of PAs to enable physical-layer security (PLS) by enlarging the channel condition diversity between legitimate users (LUs) and eavesdroppers (Eves). Particularly, we focus on the dual-waveguide scenario, where the two waveguides employs multiple PAs to serve multiple LUs in the presence of an Eve. Specifically, we consider two waveguide placement strategies, i.e., parallel placement and orthogonal placement. Meanwhile, we incorporate two channel models, i.e., in-waveguide phase shifts, and in-waveguide phase shifts and attenuation. We formulate the secure sum rate (SSR) and secure energy efficiency (SEE) maximization problems, and propose a two-stage algorithm to solve them. The first stage adopts a particle swarm optimization (PSO) method with an improved feasibility module, termed FeaPSO, for PA placement, and the second stage employs the successive convex approximate (SCA) method to optimize beamforming and artificial noise vectors. Furthermore, we conduct numerical comparisons between the two placement strategies in terms of average performance and a special case where an Eve is positioned in front of LUs. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate that PAs can significantly improve both SSR and SEE. Additionally, the necessity of orthogonal waveguide placement is explicitly verified.</description>

      <title>The Post-Electromagnetic Era: A Vision for Wireless Communication Beyond 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) communication is nearing its physical and thermodynamic limits, where further performance gains through spectrum optimization alone have become increasingly unsustainable. Finite bandwidth, propagation loss at higher frequencies, and the inherent trade-offs between energy and information constrain the scalability of 6G and beyond systems. These limitations drive the search for alternative mechanisms for information transfer beyond conventional EM propagation. This work introduces a state-centric framework for post-6G communication, in which information is conveyed by manipulating physical, biological, and cognitive states rather than EM waves. It identifies ten foundational paradigms that define potential carriers and interaction mechanisms for the post-electromagnetic era and outlines a research roadmap toward self-organizing, cognitively integrated networks. Together, these developments envision a new class of communication systems that are energy-aware, adaptive, and capable of uniting matter, life, and intelligence within a single informational continuum. By establishing the conceptual basis for this transition, the work provides a foundation for future research aimed at realizing communication paradigms that transcend the limitations of spectrum-bound systems.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Dual-Use Nature and Security Implications of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces in Next-Generation Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology offers significant promise in enhancing wireless communication systems, but its dual-use potential also introduces substantial security risks. This survey explores the security implications of RIS in next-generation wireless networks. We first highlight the dual-use nature of RIS, demonstrating how its communication-enhancing capabilities can be exploited by adversaries to compromise legitimate users. We identify a new class of security vulnerabilities termed ``passive-active hybrid attacks,'' where RIS, despite passively handling signals, can be reconfigured to actively engage in malicious activities, enabling various RIS-assisted attacks, such as eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle (MITM), replay, reflection jamming, and side-channel attacks. Furthermore, we reveal how adversaries can exploit the openness of wireless channels to introduce adversarial perturbations in artificial intelligence-driven RIS networks, disrupting communication terminals and causing misclassifications or errors in RIS reflection predictions. Despite these risks, RIS technology also plays a critical role in enhancing security and privacy across radio frequency (RF) and visible light communication (VLC) systems. By synthesizing current insights and highlighting emerging threats, we provide actionable insights into cross-layer collaboration, advanced adversarial defenses, and the balance between security and cost. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of RIS technology's security landscape and underscores the urgent need for robust security frameworks in the development of future wireless systems.</description>

      <title>CSI Prediction Using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acquiring accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical for reliable and efficient wireless communication, but challenges such as high pilot overhead and channel aging hinder timely and accurate CSI acquisition. CSI prediction, which forecasts future CSI from historical observations, offers a promising solution. Recent deep learning approaches, including recurrent neural networks and Transformers, have achieved notable success but typically learn deterministic mappings, limiting their ability to capture the stochastic and multimodal nature of wireless channels. In this paper, we introduce a novel probabilistic framework for CSI prediction based on diffusion models, offering a flexible design that supports integration of diverse prediction schemes. We decompose the CSI prediction task into two components: a temporal encoder, which extracts channel dynamics, and a diffusion-based generator, which produces future CSI samples. We investigate two inference schemes-autoregressive and sequence-to-sequence- and explore multiple diffusion backbones, including U-Net and Transformer-based architectures. Furthermore, we examine a diffusion-based approach without an explicit temporal encoder and utilize the DDIM scheduling to reduce model complexity. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our diffusion-based models significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Normalized Ambiguity Function Characteristics of OFDM, OTFS, AFDM, and CP-AFDM for ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified and system-agnostic analysis of the ambiguity function (AF) characteristics of four representative multicarrier waveforms, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), and chirp-permuted AFDM (CP-AFDM), which are considered as key candidates for enabling integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in future sixth generation (6G) networks. The AF of each waveform is obtained directly from its discrete-time definition and enhanced via ideal fractional interpolation, enabling precise characterization of its continuous-time delay-Doppler response. Two signaling modes are examined: a communication-oriented case with random information symbols suitable only for monostatic scenarios, and a sensing-oriented case with fixed unimodular symbols suitable for general multi-static scenarios. Furthermore, the AFs and the ambiguity metrics including the 3dB mainlobe width, peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSLR), and integrated sidelobe ratio (ISLR), are evaluated in normalized delay-Doppler units, enabling direct translation to any physical system configuration defined by bandwidth, sampling frequency, or symbol duration, while ensuring straightforward and consistent comparison across waveforms. The results establish a consistent benchmark for comparing waveform sensing capabilities in ISAC design, consolidating known behaviors: OFDM exhibits excellent delay resolution and sidelobe behavior but poor Doppler response, whereas advanced waveforms achieve improved balance between delay and Doppler resolution with varying sidelobe characteristics. The simulation code of the smooth AFs, is openly shared to promote reproducibility and support future ISAC waveform research.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Graph Bi-Fractional Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph signal processing (GSP) advances spectral analysis on irregular domains. However, existing two-dimensional graph fractional Fourier transform (2D-GFRFT) employs a single fractional order for both factor graphs, thereby limiting its adaptability to heterogeneous signals. We proposed the two-dimensional graph bi-fractional Fourier transform (2D-GBFRFT), which assigns independent fractional orders to the factor graphs of a Cartesian product while preserving separability. We established invertibility, unitarity, and index additivity, and developed two filtering schemes: a Wiener-style design through grid search and a differentiable framework that jointly optimizes transform orders and diagonal spectral filters. We further introduced a hybrid interpolation with the joint time-vertex fractional Fourier transform (JFRFT), controlled by a tunable parameter that balances the two methods. In the domains of synthetic Cartesian product graph signals, authentic temporal graph datasets, and dynamic image deblurring, 2D-GBFRFT consistently surpasses 2D-GFRFT and enhances JFRFT. Experimental results confirmed the versatility and superior performance of 2D-GBFRFT for filtering in GSP.</description>

      <title>Channel-Aware Deep Learning for Superimposed Pilot Power Allocation and Receiver Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superimposed pilot (SIP) schemes face significant challenges in effectively superimposing and separating pilot and data signals, especially in multiuser mobility scenarios with rapidly varying channels. To address these challenges, we propose a novel channel-aware learning framework for SIP schemes, termed CaSIP, that jointly optimizes pilot-data power (PDP) allocation and a receiver network for pilot-data interference (PDI) elimination, by leveraging channel path gain information, a form of large-scale channel state information (CSI). The proposed framework identifies user-specific, resource element-wise PDP factors and develops a deep neural network-based SIP receiver comprising explicit channel estimation and data detection components. To properly leverage path gain data, we devise an embedding generator that projects it into embeddings, which are then fused with intermediate feature maps of the channel estimation network. Simulation results demonstrate that CaSIP efficiently outperforms traditional pilot schemes and state-of-the-art SIP schemes in terms of sum throughput and channel estimation accuracy, particularly under high-mobility and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Watermarking Technique for Matching Communication Addresses with Cars in a Visual Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a problem faced by an intelligent roadside unit (RSU) monitoring a roadway by a video camera. Suppose the RSU notices that a particular car in its visual field needs to execute a specific evasive maneuver to avoid danger. It would like to send a packet addressed to that particular car with this suggestion. The problem is that while all the cars are communicating with the RSU, the RSU does not know which car in the video is associated with what IP address. So, it does not know which IP address to send the packet to. Indeed, the problem of matching addresses with cars in the visual field is a fundamental open problem. We provide an active solution employing dynamic watermarking that was originally developed for the security of cyber-physical systems. This technique calls for a car to superpose a small random excitation onto its actuation commands for steering angle or throttle/brake positions. The car sends this random waveform to the RSU in a packet containing its IP address. By signal processing of the video stream of a car at the RSU it can verify whether it matches with the waveform in the packet and thereby associates that the IP address of the packet with that car in the visual field. The RSU thereby determines which IP address is associated with which car in its visual field. We present two demonstrations of performance. We demonstrate experimental results on a laboratory transportation automated vehicles, a vision system, and a network, as well as on the field with two passenger sedans in practice. The results demonstrate that employing the dynamic watermarking method enables an RSU to distinguish the communication of a target vehicle from that of other IP addresses of nearby vehicles.</description>

      <title>CIRSense: Rethinking WiFi Sensing with Channel Impulse Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WiFi sensing based on channel state information (CSI) collected from commodity WiFi devices has shown great potential across a wide range of applications, including vital sign monitoring and indoor localization. Existing WiFi sensing approaches typically estimate motion information directly from CSI. However, they often overlook the inherent advantages of channel impulse response (CIR), a delay-domain representation that enables more intuitive and principled motion sensing by naturally concentrating motion energy and separating multipath components. Motivated by this, we revisit WiFi sensing and introduce CIRSense, a new framework that enhances the performance and interpretability of WiFi sensing with CIR. CIRSense is built upon a new motion model that characterizes fractional delay effects, a fundamental challenge in CIR-based sensing. This theoretical model underpins technical advances for the three challenges in WiFi sensing: hardware distortion compensation, high-resolution distance estimation, and subcarrier aggregation for extended range sensing. CIRSense, operating with a 160 MHz channel bandwidth, demonstrates versatile sensing capabilities through its dual-mode design, achieving a mean error of approximately 0.25 bpm in respiration monitoring and 0.09 m in distance estimation. Comprehensive evaluations across residential spaces, far-range scenarios, and multi-target settings demonstrate CIRSense's superior performance over state-of-the-art CSI-based baselines. Notably, at a challenging sensing distance of 20 m, CIRSense achieves at least 3x higher average accuracy with more than 4.5x higher computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Propagation in Finite Impulse Response Filters: Evaluating the Gaussian Assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common assumption in signal processing is that underlying data numerically conforms to a Gaussian distribution. It is commonly utilized in signal processing to describe unknown additive noise in a system and is often justified by citing the central limit theorem for sums of random variables, although the central limit theorem applies only to sums of independent identically distributed random variables. However, many linear operations in signal processing take the form of weighted sums, which transforms the random variables such that their distributions are no longer identical. One such operation is a finite impulse response (FIR) filter. FIR filters are commonly used in signal processing applications as a pre-processing step. FIR output noise is generally assumed to be Gaussian. This article examines the FIR output response in the presence of uniformly distributed quantization noise. We express the FIR output uncertainty in terms of the input quantization uncertainty and filter coefficients. We show that the output uncertainty cannot be assumed to be Gaussian, but depending on the application a Gaussian estimation may still be useful. Then, we show through detailed numerical simulations that the output uncertainty distribution of the filter can be estimated through its most dominant coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) chips become more powerful, the thermal management capabilities of conventional silicon (Si) substrates become insufficient for 3D-stacked designs. This work integrates electrically insulative and thermally conductive hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) interposers into AI chips for effective thermal management. Using COMSOL Multiphysics, the effects of High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) distributions and thermal interface material configurations on heat dissipation and hotspot mitigation were studied. A 20 {\deg}C reduction in hot spots was achieved using h-BN interposers compared to Si interposers. Such an improvement could reduce AI chips' power leakage by 22% and significantly enhance their thermal performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the impact of position and attitude perturbations on the beamforming performance of multi-satellite systems. The system under analysis is a formation of small satellites equipped with direct radiating arrays that synthesise a large virtual antenna aperture. The results show that performance is highly sensitive to the considered perturbations. However, by incorporating position and attitude information into the beamforming process, nominal performance can be effectively restored. These findings support the development of control-aware beamforming strategies that tightly integrate the attitude and orbit control system with signal processing to enable robust beamforming and autonomous coordination.</description>

      <title>Toward Efficient and Privacy-Aware eHealth Systems: An Integrated Sensing, Computing, and Semantic Communication Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11514v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time and contactless monitoring of vital signs, such as respiration and heartbeat, alongside reliable communication, is essential for modern healthcare systems, especially in remote and privacy-sensitive environments. Traditional wireless communication and sensing networks fall short in meeting all the stringent demands of eHealth, including accurate sensing, high data efficiency, and privacy preservation. To overcome the challenges, we propose a novel integrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (ISCSC) framework. In the proposed system, a service robot utilises radar to detect patient positions and monitor their vital signs, while sending updates to the medical devices. Instead of transmitting raw physiological information, the robot computes and communicates semantically extracted health features to medical devices. This semantic processing improves data throughput and preserves the clinical relevance of the messages, while enhancing data privacy by avoiding the transmission of sensitive data. Leveraging the estimated patient locations, the robot employs an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter to actively track patient motion, thereby enabling robust beam steering for continuous and reliable monitoring. We then propose a joint optimisation of the beamforming matrices and the semantic extraction ratio, subject to computing capability and power budget constraints, with the objective of maximising both the semantic secrecy rate and sensing accuracy. Simulation results validate that the ISCSC framework achieves superior sensing accuracy, improved semantic transmission efficiency, and enhanced privacy preservation compared to conventional joint sensing and communication methods.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Use-and-then-Forget (UatF) Bound: Fixed Point Algorithms for Statistical Max-Min Power Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce mathematical tools and fixed point algorithms for optimal statistical max-min power control in cellular and cell-less massive MIMO systems. Unlike previous studies that rely on the use-and-then-forget (UatF) lower bound on Shannon achievable (ergodic) rates, our proposed framework can deal with alternative bounds that explicitly consider perfect or imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the decoder. In doing so, we address limitations of UatF-based algorithms, which inherit the shortcomings of the UatF bound. For example, the UatF bound can be overly conservative: in extreme cases, under fully statistical (nonadaptive) beamforming in zero-mean channels, the UatF bound produces trivial (zero) rate bounds. It also lacks scale invariance: merely scaling the beamformers can change the bound drastically, especially when simple beamforming strategies are employed. In contrast, our framework is compatible with information-theoretic bounds that do not suffer from the above drawbacks. We illustrate the framework by solving a max-min power control problem considering a standard bound that exploits instantaneous CSI at the decoder.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Self-Calibration and Parametric Channel Estimation for 6G Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate channel estimation is essential for both high-rate communication and high-precision sensing in 6G wireless systems. However, a major performance limitation arises from calibration mismatches when operating phased-array antennas under real-world conditions. To address this issue, we propose to integrate antenna element self-calibration into a variational sparse Bayesian learning (VSBL) algorithm for parametric channel estimation. We model antenna gain and phase deviations as latent variables and derive explicit update equations to jointly infer these calibration parameters and the channel parameters: the model order, complex amplitudes, delays, angles, and the noise variance. The resulting algorithm operates online and adapts in real time to hardware-induced mismatches. We assess its performance in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE) and the optimal subpattern-assignment (OSPA) metric, demonstrating consistent improvements over conventional VSBL without calibration. Our results demonstrate that embedding self-calibration within Bayesian inference significantly enhances the robustness of channel estimation.</description>

      <title>Leaky Wave Antennas for Next Generation Wireless Applications in sub-THz Frequencies: Current Status and Research Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ever-growing demand for ultra-high data rates, massive connectivity, and joint communication-sensing capabilities in future wireless networks is driving research into sub-terahertz (sub-THz) communications. While these frequency bands offer abundant spectrum, they also pose severe propagation and hardware design challenges, motivating the search for alternative antenna solutions beyond conventional antenna arrays. Leaky-wave antennas (LWAs) have emerged as a promising candidate for sub-THz systems due to their simple feed structure, low fabrication cost, and inherent angle-frequency coupling, which enables frequency-controlled beamsteering with simple hardware. In this article, we review the fundamentals of the LWA technology, highlight their unique properties, and showcase their potential in multi-user wideband sub-THz wireless communications. We present representative studies demonstrating that LWAs can simultaneously support high-rate multi-user communications and accurate localization using only a single antenna element. Finally, several key open challenges are outlined, spanning algorithm design, signal processing, information theory, standardization, and hardware implementation, that need to be addressed to fully harness LWAs as a cost-effective and scalable enabler of next generations of wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Generative Models for Helmholtz Equation Solutions: A Dataset of Acoustic Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate simulation of wave propagation in complex acoustic materials is crucial for applications in sound design, noise control, and material engineering. Traditional numerical solvers, such as finite element methods, are computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large-scale or real-time scenarios. In this work, we introduce a dataset of 31,000 acoustic materials, named HA30K, designed and simulated solving the Helmholtz equations. For each material, we provide the geometric configuration and the corresponding pressure field solution, enabling data-driven approaches to learn Helmholtz equation solutions. As a baseline, we explore a deep learning approach based on Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, a state-of-the-art model for image generation. Unlike classical solvers, our approach leverages GPU parallelization to process multiple simulations simultaneously, drastically reducing computation time. By representing solutions as images, we bypass the need for complex simulation software and explicit equation-solving. Additionally, the number of diffusion steps can be adjusted at inference time, balancing speed and quality. We aim to demonstrate that deep learning-based methods are particularly useful in early-stage research, where rapid exploration is more critical than absolute accuracy.</description>

      <title>Secret-Key Agreement Through Hidden Markov Modeling of Wavelet Scattering Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Secret-key generation and agreement based on wireless channel reciprocity offers a promising avenue for securing IoT networks. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on the similarity of instantaneous channel measurement samples between communicating devices. This narrow view of reciprocity is often impractical, as it is highly susceptible to noise, asynchronous sampling, channel fading, and other system-level imperfections -- all of which significantly impair key generation performance. Furthermore, the quantization step common in traditional schemes introduces irreversible errors, further limiting efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel approach for secret-key generation by using wavelet scattering networks to extract robust and reciprocal CSI features. Dimensionality reduction is applied to uncover hidden cluster structures, which are then used to build hidden Markov models for efficient key agreement. Our approach eliminates the need for quantization and effectively captures channel randomness. It achieves a 5x improvement in key generation rate compared to traditional benchmarks, providing a secure and efficient solution for key generation in resource-constrained IoT environments.</description>

      <title>A High-Performance Training-Free Pipeline for Robust Random Telegraph Signal Characterization via Adaptive Wavelet-Based Denoising and Bayesian Digitization Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random telegraph signal (RTS) analysis is increasingly important for characterizing meaningful temporal fluctuations in physical, chemical, and biological systems. The simplest RTS arises from discrete stochastic switching events between two binary states, quantified by their transition amplitude and dwell times in each state. Quantitative analysis of RTSs provides valuable insights into microscopic processes such as charge trapping in semiconductors. However, analyzing RTS becomes considerably complex when signals exhibit multi-level structures or are corrupted by background white or pink noise. To address these challenges and support high-throughput RTS analysis, we introduce a modular and scalable signal processing pipeline combining dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) denoising with a Bayesian digitization strategy. The adaptive DTCWT-based denoiser incorporates autonomous parameter selection rules for its decomposition level and thresholds, optimizing white noise suppression without manual tuning. Complementing this denoiser, our probabilistic digitizer effectively resolves binary trap states even under residual notorious background pink noise. The overall approach enables robust performance across varying noise levels and multi-trap scenarios, improving mean dwell time estimation and RTS reconstruction over classical and neural baselines. The method is up to 83x faster, training-free, and suitable for real-time or large-scale analysis. Evaluations confirm its generalizability, speed, and reliability, providing a strong foundation for future fully adaptive and automated RTS pipelines.</description>

      <title>Structured identification of multivariable modal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physically interpretable models are essential for next-generation industrial systems, as these representations enable effective control, support design validation, and provide a foundation for monitoring strategies. The aim of this paper is to develop a system identification framework for estimating modal models of complex multivariable mechanical systems from frequency response data. To achieve this, a two-step structured identification algorithm is presented, where an additive model is first estimated using a refined instrumental variable method and subsequently projected onto a modal form. The developed identification method provides accurate, physically-relevant, minimal-order models, for both generally-damped and proportionally damped modal systems. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experimental validation on a prototype wafer-stage system, which features a large number of spatially distributed actuators and sensors and exhibits complex flexible dynamics.</description>

      <title>Conformal Inference for Time Series over Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trustworthy decision making in networked, dynamic environments calls for innovative uncertainty quantification substrates in predictive models for graph time series. Existing conformal prediction (CP) methods have been applied separately to multivariate time series and static graphs, but they either ignore the underlying graph topology or neglect temporal dynamics. To bridge this gap, here we develop a CP-based sequential prediction region framework tailored for graph time series. A key technical innovation is to leverage the graph structure and thus capture pairwise dependencies across nodes, while providing user-specified coverage guarantees on the predictive outcomes. We formally establish that our scheme yields an exponential shrinkage in the volume of the ellipsoidal prediction set relative to its graph-agnostic counterpart. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the novel uncertainty quantification framework maintains desired empirical coverage while achieving markedly smaller (up to 80% reduction) prediction regions than existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Robust Photoplethysmography Signal Denoising via Mamba Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is widely used in wearable health monitoring, but its reliability is often degraded by noise and motion artifacts, limiting downstream applications such as heart rate (HR) estimation. This paper presents a deep learning framework for PPG denoising with an emphasis on preserving physiological information. In this framework, we propose DPNet, a Mamba-based denoising backbone designed for effective temporal modeling. To further enhance denoising performance, the framework also incorporates a scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) loss to promote waveform fidelity and an auxiliary HR predictor (HRP) that provides physiological consistency through HR-based supervision. Experiments on the BIDMC dataset show that our method achieves strong robustness against both synthetic noise and real-world motion artifacts, outperforming conventional filtering and existing neural models. Our method can effectively restore PPG signals while maintaining HR accuracy, highlighting the complementary roles of SI-SDR loss and HR-guided supervision. These results demonstrate the potential of our approach for practical deployment in wearable healthcare systems.</description>

      <title>Basis for a hands free blood flow measurement with automated vessel focus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is one of the essential tools to ensure oxygen supply during cardiac arrest. However, the precise effects of chest compression are not quantifiable to this day. This often results in a low quality of chest compressions even if performed by health-care professionals. One solution could be provided by quantification of blood flow via ultrasonic Doppler measurements, to guide first responders in their efforts. This paper presents an approach to address the issue of limited time, anatomical know how and limitations of system configuration during emergency scenarios. An approach for automated vessel identification with three different phases was developed, featuring a new sensor probe for ultrasonic measurements with non symmetrically angled piezo ceramics. The probe was used with prototype ultrasound hardware in a laboratory setup for Pulsed Wave Doppler (PW Doppler). In an initial measurement a qualitative flow was approximated to examine valuable measurement positions on a phantom. Afterwards an iterative mode was used for depth depending frequency measurements with score calculation of flow periodicity and signal power. The configuration with the best score was used for a prolonged monitoring mode. Flow values were compared to data of an industrial flow-sensor. Flow-sensor data showed an average coefficient of determination of 0.97 with an average root mean square error of 3.84 ml/s. With the proposed hardware and software solutions a basis for future developments was made, which could lead to a fully automated vessel identification during CPR. This device could provide first responders as well as clinical staff with vital information about CPR efficiency that has yet to be included into the therapy of people during cardiac arrest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Connection graphs (CGs) extend traditional graph models by coupling network topology with orthogonal transformations, enabling the representation of global geometric consistency. They play a key role in applications such as synchronization, Riemannian signal processing, and neural sheaf diffusion. In this work, we address the inverse problem of learning CGs directly from observed signals. We propose a principled framework based on maximum pseudo-likelihood under a consistency assumption, which enforces spectral properties linking the connection Laplacian to the underlying combinatorial Laplacian. Based on this formulation, we introduce the Structured Connection Graph Learning (SCGL) algorithm, a block-optimization procedure over Riemannian manifolds that jointly infers network topology, edge weights, and geometric structure. Our experiments show that SCGL consistently outperforms existing baselines in both topological recovery and geometric fidelity, while remaining computationally efficient.</description>

      <title>Repeated-and-Offset QPSK for DFT-s-OFDM in Satellite Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the convergence of terrestrial cellular networks with satellite networks, we consider an adaptation of offset quadrature phase shift keying (OQPSK), used with single-carrier waveform in traditional satellite systems, to discrete Fourier transform spread (DFT-s-) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexed (OFDM) waveform employed in the uplink of terrestrial systems. We introduce a new order-one constellation modulation, termed repeated-and-offset QPSK (RO-QPSK), derive its basic properties, and compare it with pi/2-BPSK with frequency-domain spectral shaping (FDSS), as supported in 5G. RO-QPSK naturally produces a Hann-window-shaped spectrum, resulting in a very low maximum peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) on the order of 2 dB. Moreover, with single-tap equalization and symbol combining at the receiver, RO-QSPK can improve the signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) compared to pi/2-BPSK with FDSS, in narrowband and/or moderately frequency-selective channels, as encountered in satellite communications. A moderate FDSS can also be combined with RO-QSPK to further reduce the PAPR while providing similar performance. Of independent interest, general SINR expressions for DFT-s-OFDM are also provided.</description>

      <title>ILD-VIT: A Unified Vision Transformer Architecture for Detection of Interstitial Lung Disease from Respiratory Sounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) represents a group of restrictive chronic pulmonary diseases that impair oxygen acquisition by causing irreversible changes in the lungs such as fibrosis, scarring of parenchyma, etc. ILD conditions are often diagnosed by various clinical modalities such as spirometry, high-resolution lung imaging techniques, crackling respiratory sounds (RSs), etc. In this letter, we develop a novel vision transformer (VIT)-based deep learning framework namely, ILD-VIT, to detect the ILD condition using the RS recordings. The proposed framework comprises three major stages: pre-processing, mel spectrogram extraction, and classification using the proposed VIT architecture using the mel spectrogram image patches. Experimental results using the publicly available BRACETS and KAUH databases show that our proposed ILD-VIT achieves an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 84.86%, 82.67%, and 86.91%, respectively, for subject-independent blind testing. The successful onboard implantation of the proposed framework on a Raspberry-pi-4 microcontroller indicates its potential as a standalone clinical system for ILD screening in a real clinical scenario.</description>

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely used in healthcare applications, such as arrhythmia detection and sleep monitoring, making accurate ECG analysis critically essential. Traditional deep learning models for ECG are task-specific, with limited generalization and narrow functionality. Foundation models (FMs), or large pre-training models, have recently advanced representation learning, enabling strong performance across diverse tasks and motivating their adoption for ECG analysis. Here, we present the first comprehensive review dedicated to ECG foundation models (ECG-FMs). We map the current landscape of architectures, pre-training paradigms, and adaptation strategies, and critically examine their strengths, limitations, and clinical potential. By consolidating this emerging field, we aim to accelerate the development of robust, generalizable ECG-FMs and chart future directions for their integration into healthcare practice.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Enhanced Networked Integrated Sensing and Communication System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09426v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key technology for future 6G networks. Most existing studies focus on monostatic and/or bistatic setups with limited coverage and capabilities. Networked ISAC systems with distributed base stations (BSs) can overcome these limitations. Moreover, movable antenna (MA) architectures offer improved ISAC performance over fixed-position antennas (FPAs) by enabling adaptable antenna movement. In this paper, we utilize the MA to promote communication capability with guaranteed sensing performance via jointly designing beamforming, power allocation, receiving filters and position configuration of transmit/receive MA towards maximizing the sum rate for both downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) users. The optimization problem is highly difficult due to the unique channel model derived from the position coefficient of the MA. To resolve this challenge, via leveraging the cutting-the-edge majorization-minimization (MM) method, we develop an efficient solution that optimizes all variables via convex optimization techniques. Extensive simulation results verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and demonstrate the substantial performance promotion by deploying the MA framework in the networked ISAC system.</description>

      <title>A New Interpretation of the Time-Interleaved ADC Mismatch Problem: A Tracking-Based Hybrid Calibration Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-interleaved ADCs (TI-ADCs) achieve high sampling rates by interleaving multiple sub-ADCs in parallel. Mismatch errors between the sub-ADCs, however, can significantly degrade the signal quality, which is a main performance bottleneck. This paper presents a hybrid calibration approach by interpreting the mismatch problem as a tracking problem, and uses the extended Kalman filter for online estimation and compensation of the mismatch errors. After estimation, the desired signal is reconstructed using a truncated fractional delay filter and a high-pass filter. Simulations demonstrate that our algorithm substantially outperforms the existing hybrid calibration method in both mismatch estimation and compensation.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Deep Learning for Robust Channel Extrapolation in Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) offer remarkable spatial flexibility but face significant challenges in acquiring high-resolution channel state information (CSI), leading to considerable overhead. To address this issue, we propose CANet, a robust deep learning model for channel extrapolation in FAS. CANet combines context-adaptive modeling with a cross-scale attention mechanism and is built on a ConvNeXt v2 backbone to improve extrapolation accuracy for unobserved antenna ports. To further enhance robustness, we introduce a novel spatial amplitude perturbation strategy, inspired by frequency-domain augmentation techniques in image processing. This motivates the incorporation of a Fourier-domain loss function, capturing frequency-domain consistency, alongside a spectral structure consistency loss that reinforces learning stability under perturbations. Our simulation results demonstrate that CANet outperforms benchmark models across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Beamforming Design Using Target Beam Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a deep learning-based beamforming design framework that directly maps a target beam pattern to optimal beamforming vectors across multiple antenna array architectures, including digital, analog, and hybrid beamforming. The proposed method employs a lightweight encoder-decoder network where the encoder compresses the complex beam pattern into a low-dimensional feature vector and the decoder reconstructs the beamforming vector while satisfying hardware constraints. To address training challenges under diverse and limited channel station information (CSI) conditions, a two-stage training process is introduced, which consists of an offline pre-training for robust feature extraction using an auxiliary module, followed by online training of the decoder with a composite loss function that ensures alignment between the synthesized and target beam patterns in terms of the main lobe shape and side lobe suppression. Simulation results based on NYUSIM-generated channels show that the proposed method can achieve spectral efficiency close to that of fully digital beamforming under limited CSI and outperforms representative existing methods.</description>

      <title>Towards channel foundation models (CFMs): Motivations, methodologies and opportunities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a pivotal enabler for next-generation wireless communication systems. However, conventional AI-based models encounter several limitations, such as heavy reliance on labeled data, limited generalization capability, and task-specific design. To address these challenges, this paper introduces, for the first time, the concept of channel foundation models (CFMs)-a novel and unified framework designed to tackle a wide range of channel-related tasks through a pretrained, universal channel feature extractor. By leveraging advanced AI architectures and self-supervised learning techniques, CFMs are capable of effectively exploiting large-scale unlabeled data without the need for extensive manual annotation. We further analyze the evolution of AI methodologies, from supervised learning and multi-task learning to self-supervised learning, emphasizing the distinct advantages of the latter in facilitating the development of CFMs. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive review of existing studies on self-supervised learning in this domain, categorizing them into generative, discriminative and the combined paradigms. Given that the research on CFMs is still at an early stage, we identify several promising future research directions, focusing on model architecture innovation and the construction of high-quality, diverse channel datasets.</description>

      <title>Joint Active and Passive Beamforming for Energy-Efficient STARS with Quantization and Element Selection in ISAC Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STARS)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems in support of full-space energy-efficient data transmissions and target sensing. We formulate an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem that jointly optimizes a dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC)-empowered base station (BS), considering its ISAC-based active beamforming, along with the passive STARS beamforming configurations of amplitudes, phase shifts, quantization levels, and element selection. Furthermore, relaxed/independent/coupled STARS are considered to examine architectural flexibility. To tackle the non-convex and mixed-integer problem, we propose a joint active-passive beamforming, quantization and element selection (AQUES) scheme based on the alternating optimization: Lagrangian dual and Dinkelbach's transformation tackle fractional equations, whereas successive convex approximation (SCA) convexifies the non-solvable problem; Penalty dual decomposition (PDD) framework and penalty-based convex-concave programming (PCCP) procedure solve amplitude and phase-shifts with the equality constraint; Heuristic search iteratively decides the optimal quantization level; Integer relaxation deals with the discrete element selection variables. Simulation results demonstrate that STARS-ISAC with the proposed AQUES scheme significantly enhances EE while meeting communication rates and sensing quality requirements. The coupled STARS further highlights its superior EE performance over independent and relaxed STARS thanks to its reduced hardware complexity. Moreover, AQUES outperforms existing configurations and benchmark methods in the open literature across various network parameters and deployment scenarios.</description>

      <title>Radar and Acoustic Sensor Fusion using a Transformer Encoder for Robust Drone Detection and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of drones in a wide range of applications is steadily increasing. However, this has also raised critical security concerns such as unauthorized drone intrusions into restricted zones. Therefore, robust and accurate drone detection and classification mechanisms are required despite significant challenges due to small size of drones, low-altitude flight, and environmental noise. In this letter, we propose a multi-modal approach combining radar and acoustic sensing for detecting and classifying drones. We employ radar due to its long-range capabilities, and robustness to different weather conditions. We utilize raw acoustic signals without converting them to other domains such as spectrograms or Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. This enables us to use fewer number of parameters compared to the stateof-the-art approaches. Furthermore, we explore the effectiveness of the transformer encoder architecture in fusing these sensors. Experimental results obtained in outdoor settings verify the superior performance of the proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Explainable Deep Neural Network for Multimodal ECG Signals: Intermediate vs Late Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The limitations of unimodal deep learning models, particularly their tendency to overfit and limited generalizability, have renewed interest in multimodal fusion strategies. Multimodal deep neural networks (MDNN) have the capability of integrating diverse data domains and offer a promising solution for robust and accurate predictions. However, the optimal fusion strategy, intermediate fusion (feature-level) versus late fusion (decision-level) remains insufficiently examined, especially in high-stakes clinical contexts such as ECG-based cardiovascular disease (CVD) classification. This study investigates the comparative effectiveness of intermediate and late fusion strategies using ECG signals across three domains: time, frequency, and time-frequency. A series of experiments were conducted to identify the highest-performing fusion architecture. Results demonstrate that intermediate fusion consistently outperformed late fusion, achieving a peak accuracy of 97 percent, with Cohen's d &gt; 0.8 relative to standalone models and d = 0.40 compared to late fusion. Interpretability analyses using saliency maps reveal that both models align with the discretized ECG signals. Statistical dependency between the discretized ECG signals and corresponding saliency maps for each class was confirmed using Mutual Information (MI). The proposed ECG domain-based multimodal model offers superior predictive capability and enhanced explainability, crucial attributes in medical AI applications, surpassing state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous Polarimetry with Zak-OTFS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19185v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarimetry, which is the ability to measure the scattering response of the environment across orthogonal polarizations, is fundamental to enhancing wireless communication and radar system performance. In this paper, we utilize the Zak-OTFS modulation to enable instantaneous polarimetry within a single transmission frame. We transmit a Zak-OTFS carrier waveform and a spread carrier waveform mutually unbiased to it simultaneously over orthogonal polarizations. The mutual unbiasedness of the two waveforms enables the receiver to estimate the full polarimetric response of the scattering environment from a single received frame. Unlike existing methods for instantaneous polarimetry with computational complexity quadratic in the time-bandwidth product, the proposed method enables instantaneous polarimetry at near-linear complexity in the time-bandwidth product. Via numerical simulations, we show ideal polarimetric target detection and parameter estimation results with the proposed method, with improvements in computational complexity and greater clutter resilience over comparable baselines.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Beamforming for Networked Integrated Communication and Multi-TMT Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Networked integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has gained significant attention as a promising technology for enabling next-generation wireless systems. To further enhance networked ISAC, delegating the reception of sensing signals to dedicated target monitoring terminals (TMTs) instead of base stations (BSs) offers significant advantages in terms of sensing capability and deployment flexibility. Despite its potential, the coordinated beamforming design for networked integrated communication and time-of-arrival (ToA)-based multi-TMT localization remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study to fill this gap. Specifically, we first establish signal models for both communication and localization, and, for the first time, derive a closed-form Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) to characterize the localization performance. Subsequently, we exploit this CRLB to formulate two optimization problems, focusing on sensing-centric and communication-centric criteria, respectively. For the sensing-centric problem, we develop a globally optimal algorithm based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) when each BS is equipped with more antennas than the total number of communication users. While for the communication-centric problem, we design a globally optimal algorithm for the single-BS case using bisection search. For the general case of both problems, we propose a unified successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm, which is suboptimal yet efficient, and further extend it from single-target scenarios to more practical multi-target scenarios. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, reveal the intrinsic performance trade-offs between communication and localization, and further show that deploying more TMTs is always preferable to deploying more BSs in networked ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Pre-Training and Personalized Fine-Tuning via Over-the-Air Federated Meta-Learning: Convergence-Generalization Trade-Offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11569v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For modern artificial intelligence (AI) applications such as large language models (LLMs), the training paradigm has recently shifted to pre-training followed by fine-tuning. Furthermore, owing to dwindling open repositories of data and thanks to efforts to democratize access to AI models, pre-training is expected to increasingly migrate from the current centralized deployments to federated learning (FL) implementations. Meta-learning provides a general framework in which pre-training and fine-tuning can be formalized. Meta-learning-based personalized FL (meta-pFL) moves beyond basic personalization by targeting generalization to new agents and tasks. This paper studies the generalization performance of meta-pFL for a wireless setting in which the agents participating in the pre-training phase, i.e., meta-learning, are connected via a shared wireless channel to the server. Adopting over-the-air computing, we study the trade-off between generalization to new agents and tasks, on the one hand, and convergence, on the other hand. The trade-off arises from the fact that channel impairments may enhance generalization, while degrading convergence. Extensive numerical results validate the theory.</description>

      <title>Stimulus Modality Matters: Impact of Perceptual Evaluations from Different Modalities on Speech Emotion Recognition System Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10762v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) systems rely on speech input and emotional labels annotated by humans. However, various emotion databases collect perceptional evaluations in different ways. For instance, the IEMOCAP dataset uses video clips with sounds for annotators to provide their emotional perceptions. However, the most significant English emotion dataset, the MSP-PODCAST, only provides speech for raters to choose the emotional ratings. Nevertheless, using speech as input is the standard approach to training SER systems. Therefore, the open question is the emotional labels elicited by which scenarios are the most effective for training SER systems. We comprehensively compare the effectiveness of SER systems trained with labels elicited by different modality stimuli and evaluate the SER systems on various testing conditions. Also, we introduce an all-inclusive label that combines all labels elicited by various modalities. We show that using labels elicited by voice-only stimuli for training yields better performance on the test set, whereas labels elicited by voice-only stimuli.</description>

      <title>Joint Source-Environment Adaptation of Data-Driven Underwater Acoustic Source Ranging Based on Model Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adapting pre-trained deep learning models to new and unknown environments remains a major challenge in underwater acoustic localization. We show that although the performance of pre-trained models suffers from mismatch between the training and test data, they generally exhibit a higher uncertainty in environments where there is more mismatch. Additionally, in the presence of environmental mismatch, spurious peaks can appear in the output of classification-based localization approaches, which inspires us to define and use a method to quantify the "implied uncertainty" based on the number of model output peaks. Leveraging this notion of implied uncertainty, we partition the test samples into sets with more certain and less certain samples, and implement a method to adapt the model to new environments by using the certain samples to improve the labeling for uncertain samples, which helps to adapt the model. Thus, using this efficient method for model uncertainty quantification, we showcase an innovative approach to adapt a pre-trained model to unseen underwater environments at test time. This eliminates the need for labeled data from the target environment or the original training data. This adaptation is enhanced by integrating an independent estimate based on the received signal energy. We validate the approach extensively using real experimental data, as well as synthetic data consisting of model-generated signals with real ocean noise. The results demonstrate significant improvements in model prediction accuracy, underscoring the potential of the method to enhance underwater acoustic localization in diverse, noisy, and unknown environments.</description>

      <title>Lightweight and Interpretable Transformer via Mixed Graph Algorithm Unrolling for Traffic Forecast</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlike conventional "black-box" transformers with classical self-attention mechanism, we build a lightweight and interpretable transformer-like neural net by unrolling a mixed-graph-based optimization algorithm to forecast traffic with spatial and temporal dimensions. We construct two graphs: an undirected graph $\mathcal{G}^u$ capturing spatial correlations across geography, and a directed graph $\mathcal{G}^d$ capturing sequential relationships over time. We predict future samples of signal $\mathbf{x}$, assuming it is "smooth" with respect to both $\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$, where we design new $\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$-norm variational terms to quantify and promote signal smoothness (low-frequency reconstruction) on a directed graph. We design an iterative algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and unroll it into a feed-forward network for data-driven parameter learning. We insert graph learning modules for $\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$ that play the role of self-attention. Experiments show that our unrolled networks achieve competitive traffic forecast performance as state-of-the-art prediction schemes, while reducing parameter counts drastically.

      <title>Multi-Functional RIS-Enabled in SAGIN for IoT: A Hybrid Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach with Compressed Twin-Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) for Internet of Things (IoT) network architecture is investigated, empowered by multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (MF-RIS) capable of simultaneously reflecting, amplifying, and harvesting wireless energy. The MF-RIS plays a pivotal role in addressing the energy shortages of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites operating in the shadowed regions, while accounting for both communication and computing energy consumption across the SAGIN nodes. To maximize the long-term energy efficiency (EE) of IoT devices, we formulate a joint optimization problem over the MF-RIS parameters, including signal amplification, phase-shifts, energy harvesting ratio, and active element selection as well as the SAGIN parameters of beamforming vectors, high-altitude platform station (HAPS) deployment, IoT device association, and computing capability. The formulated problem is highly non-convex and non-linear and contains mixed discrete-continuous parameters. To tackle this, we conceive a compressed hybrid twin-model enhanced multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (CHIMERA) framework, which integrates semantic state-action compression and parametrized sharing under hybrid reinforcement learning to efficiently explore suitable complex actions. The simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed CHIMERA scheme substantially outperforms the conventional benchmarks, including fixed-configuration or non-harvesting MF-RIS, traditional RIS, and no-RIS cases, as well as centralized and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning baselines in terms of the highest EE. Moreover, the proposed SAGIN-MF-RIS architecture in IoT network achieves superior EE performance due to its complementary coverage, offering notable advantages over either standalone satellite, aerial, or ground-only deployments.</description>

      <title>ORCAS Codes: A Flexible Generalization of Polar Codes with Low-Complexity Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the need for channel codes with low-complexity soft-decision decoding algorithms, we consider the recursive Plotkin concatenation of optimal low-rate and high-rate codes based on simplex codes and their duals. These component codes come with low-complexity maximum likelihood (ML) decoding which, in turn, enables efficient successive cancellation (SC)-based decoding. As a result, the proposed optimally recursively concatenated simplex (ORCAS) codes achieve a performance that is at least as good as that of polar codes. For practical parameters, the proposed construction significantly outperforms polar codes in terms of block error rate by up to 0.5 dB while maintaining similar decoding complexity. Furthermore, the codes offer greater flexibility in codeword length than conventional polar codes.</description>

      <title>Detecting Malicious Pilot Contamination in Multiuser Massive MIMO Using Decision Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MMIMO) is essential to modern wireless communication systems, like 5G and 6G, but it is vulnerable to active eavesdropping attacks. One type of such attack is the pilot contamination attack (PCA), where a malicious user copies pilot signals from an authentic user during uplink, intentionally interfering with the base station's (BS) channel estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose to use a Decision Tree (DT) algorithm for PCA detection at the BS in a multi-user system. We present a methodology to generate training data for the DT classifier and select the best DT according to their depth. Then, we simulate different scenarios that could be encountered in practice and compare the DT to a classical technique based on likelihood ratio testing (LRT) submitted to the same scenarios. The results revealed that a DT with only one level of depth is sufficient to outperform the LRT. The DT shows a good performance regarding the probability of detection in noisy scenarios and when the malicious user transmits with low power, in which case the LRT fails to detect the PCA. We also show that the reason for the good performance of the DT is its ability to compute a threshold that separates PCA data from non-PCA data better than the LRT's threshold. Moreover, the DT does not necessitate prior knowledge of noise power or assumptions regarding the signal power of malicious users, prerequisites typically essential for LRT and other hypothesis testing methodologies.</description>
