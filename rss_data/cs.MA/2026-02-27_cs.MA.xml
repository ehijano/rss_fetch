      <title>Sustainable Multi-Agent Crowdsourcing via Physics-Informed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crowdsourcing platforms face a four-way tension between allocation quality, workforce sustainability, operational feasibility, and strategic contractor behaviour--a dilemma we formalise as the Cold-Start, Burnout, Utilisation, and Strategic Agency Dilemma. Existing methods resolve at most two of these tensions simultaneously: greedy heuristics and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods achieve Day-1 quality but cause catastrophic burnout, while bandit algorithms eliminate burnout only through operationally infeasible 100% workforce utilisation.To address this, we introduce FORGE, a physics-grounded $K+1$ multi-agent simulator in which each contractor is a rational agent that declares its own load-acceptance threshold based on its fatigue state, converting the standard passive Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) into a genuine Stackelberg game. Operating within FORGE, we propose a Neural-Linear UCB allocator that fuses a Two-Tower embedding network with a Physics-Informed Covariance Prior derived from offline simulator interactions. The prior simultaneously warm-starts skill-cluster geometry and UCB exploration landscape, providing a geometry-aware belief state from episode 1 that measurably reduces cold-start regret.Over $T = 200$ cold-start episodes, the proposed method achieves the highest reward of all non-oracle methods ($\text{LRew} = 0.555 \pm 0.041$) at only 7.6% workforce utilisation--a combination no conventional baseline achieves--while maintaining robustness to workforce turnover up to 50% and observation noise up to $\sigma = 0.20$.</description>

      <title>QSIM: Mitigating Overestimation in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning via Action Similarity Weighted Q-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Value decomposition (VD) methods have achieved remarkable success in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, their reliance on the max operator for temporal-difference (TD) target calculation leads to systematic Q-value overestimation. This issue is particularly severe in MARL due to the combinatorial explosion of the joint action space, which often results in unstable learning and suboptimal policies. To address this problem, we propose QSIM, a similarity weighted Q-learning framework that reconstructs the TD target using action similarity. Instead of using the greedy joint action directly, QSIM forms a similarity weighted expectation over a structured near-greedy joint action space. This formulation allows the target to integrate Q-values from diverse yet behaviorally related actions while assigning greater influence to those that are more similar to the greedy choice. By smoothing the target with structurally relevant alternatives, QSIM effectively mitigates overestimation and improves learning stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QSIM can be seamlessly integrated with various VD methods, consistently yielding superior performance and stability compared to the original algorithms. Furthermore, empirical analysis confirms that QSIM significantly mitigates the systematic value overestimation in MARL. Code is available at https://github.com/MaoMaoLYJ/pymarl-qsim.</description>

      <title>ClawMobile: Rethinking Smartphone-Native Agentic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smartphones represent a uniquely challenging environment for agentic systems. Unlike cloud or desktop settings, mobile devices combine constrained execution contexts, fragmented control interfaces, and rapidly changing application states. As large language models (LLMs) evolve from conversational assistants to action-oriented agents, achieving reliable smartphone-native autonomy requires rethinking how reasoning and control are composed.
  We introduce ClawMobile as a concrete exploration of this design space. ClawMobile adopts a hierarchical architecture that separates high-level language reasoning from structured, deterministic control pathways, improving execution stability and reproducibility on real devices. Using ClawMobile as a case study, we distill the design principles for mobile LLM runtimes and identify key challenges in efficiency, adaptability, and stability. We argue that building robust smartphone-native agentic systems demands principled coordination between probabilistic planning and deterministic system interfaces. The implementation is open-sourced~\footnote{https://github.com/ClawMobile/ClawMobile} to facilitate future exploration.</description>

      <title>TWICE: An LLM Agent Framework for Simulating Personalized User Tweeting Behavior with Long-term Temporal Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: User simulators are often used to generate large amounts of data for various tasks such as generation, training, and evaluation. However, existing approaches concentrate on collective behaviors or interactive systems, struggling with tasks that require modeling temporal characteristics. To address this limitation, we propose TWICE, an LLM-based framework that leverages the long-term temporal and personalized features of social media data. This framework integrates personalized user profiling, an event-driven memory module, and a workflow for personalized style rewriting, enabling simulation of personalized user tweeting behavior while capturing long-term temporal characteristics. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation with a focus on analyzing tweeting style and event-based changes in behavior. Experiment results demonstrate that our framework improves personalized user simulation by effectively incorporating temporal dynamics, providing a robust solution for long-term behavior tracking.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Multichain Blockchain: A Multiobjective Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blockchains are widely used for secure transaction processing, but their scalability remains limited, and existing multichain designs are typically static even as demand and capacity shift. We cast blockchain configuration as a multiagent resource-allocation problem: applications and operators declare demand, capacity, and price bounds; an optimizer groups them into ephemeral chains each epoch and sets a chain-level clearing price. The objective maximizes a governance-weighted combination of normalized utilities for applications, operators, and the system. The model is modular -- accommodating capability compatibility, application-type diversity, and epoch-to-epoch stability -- and can be solved off-chain with outcomes verifiable on-chain. We analyze fairness and incentive issues and present simulations that highlight trade-offs among throughput, decentralization, operator yield, and service stability.</description>

      <title>Agent Behavioral Contracts: Formal Specification and Runtime Enforcement for Reliable Autonomous AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional software relies on contracts -- APIs, type systems, assertions -- to specify and enforce correct behavior. AI agents, by contrast, operate on prompts and natural language instructions with no formal behavioral specification. This gap is the root cause of drift, governance failures, and frequent project failures in agentic AI deployments. We introduce Agent Behavioral Contracts (ABC), a formal framework that brings Design-by-Contract principles to autonomous AI agents. An ABC contract C = (P, I, G, R) specifies Preconditions, Invariants, Governance policies, and Recovery mechanisms as first-class, runtime-enforceable components. We define (p, delta, k)-satisfaction -- a probabilistic notion of contract compliance that accounts for LLM non-determinism and recovery -- and prove a Drift Bounds Theorem showing that contracts with recovery rate gamma &gt; alpha (the natural drift rate) bound behavioral drift to D* = alpha/gamma in expectation, with Gaussian concentration in the stochastic setting. We establish sufficient conditions for safe contract composition in multi-agent chains and derive probabilistic degradation bounds. We implement ABC in AgentAssert, a runtime enforcement library, and evaluate on AgentContract-Bench, a benchmark of 200 scenarios across 7 models from 6 vendors. Results across 1,980 sessions show that contracted agents detect 5.2-6.8 soft violations per session that uncontracted baselines miss entirely (p &lt; 0.0001, Cohen's d = 6.7-33.8), achieve 88-100% hard constraint compliance, and bound behavioral drift to D* &lt; 0.27 across extended sessions, with 100% recovery for frontier models and 17-100% across all models, at overhead &lt; 10 ms per action.</description>

      <title>Robust Information Design for Multi-Agent Systems with Complementarities: Smallest-Equilibrium Threshold Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study information design in multi-agent systems (MAS) with binary actions and strategic complementarities, where an external designer influences behavior only through signals. Agents play the smallest-equilibrium of the induced Bayesian game, reflecting conservative, coordination-averse behavior typical in distributed systems. We show that when utilities admit a convex potential and welfare is convex, the robustly implementable optimum has a remarkably simple form: perfect coordination at each state: either everyone acts or no one does. We provide a constructive threshold rule: compute a one-dimensional score for each state, sort states, and pick a single threshold (with a knife-edge lottery for at most one state). This rule is an explicit optimal vertex of a linear program (LP) characterized by feasibility and sequential obedience constraints. Empirically, in both vaccination and technology-adoption domains, our constructive policy matches LP optima, scales as $O(|\Theta|\log|\Theta|)$, and avoids the inflated welfare predicted by obedience-only designs that assume the designer can dictate the (best) equilibrium. The result is a general, scalable recipe for robust coordination in MAS with complementarities.</description>

      <title>A Decision-Theoretic Formalisation of Steganography With Applications to LLM Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models are beginning to show steganographic capabilities. Such capabilities could allow misaligned models to evade oversight mechanisms. Yet principled methods to detect and quantify such behaviours are lacking. Classical definitions of steganography, and detection methods based on them, require a known reference distribution of non-steganographic signals. For the case of steganographic reasoning in LLMs, knowing such a reference distribution is not feasible; this renders these approaches inapplicable. We propose an alternative, \textbf{decision-theoretic view of steganography}. Our central insight is that steganography creates an asymmetry in usable information between agents who can and cannot decode the hidden content (present within a steganographic signal), and this otherwise latent asymmetry can be inferred from the agents' observable actions. To formalise this perspective, we introduce generalised $\mathcal{V}$-information: a utilitarian framework for measuring the amount of usable information within some input. We use this to define the \textbf{steganographic gap} -- a measure that quantifies steganography by comparing the downstream utility of the steganographic signal to agents that can and cannot decode the hidden content. We empirically validate our formalism, and show that it can be used to detect, quantify, and mitigate steganographic reasoning in LLMs.</description>

      <title>ParamMem: Augmenting Language Agents with Parametric Reflective Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-reflection enables language agents to iteratively refine solutions, yet often produces repetitive outputs that limit reasoning performance. Recent studies have attempted to address this limitation through various approaches, among which increasing reflective diversity has shown promise. Our empirical analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between reflective diversity and task success, further motivating the need for diverse reflection signals. We introduce ParamMem, a parametric memory module that encodes cross-sample reflection patterns into model parameters, enabling diverse reflection generation through temperature-controlled sampling. Building on this module, we propose ParamAgent, a reflection-based agent framework that integrates parametric memory with episodic and cross-sample memory. Extensive experiments on code generation, mathematical reasoning, and multi-hop question answering demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. Further analysis reveals that ParamMem is sample-efficient, enables weak-to-strong transfer across model scales, and supports self-improvement without reliance on stronger external model, highlighting the potential of ParamMem as an effective component for enhancing language agents.</description>

      <title>HyperAgent: Leveraging Hypergraphs for Topology Optimization in Multi-Agent Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10611v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language model-powered multi-agent systems have demonstrated remarkable collective intelligence through effective communication. However, existing approaches face two primary challenges: (i) \textit{Ineffective group collaboration modeling}, as they rely on pairwise edge representations in graph structures, limiting their ability to capture relationships among multiple agents; and (ii) \textit{Limited task-adaptiveness in communication topology design}, leading to excessive communication cost for simple tasks and insufficient coordination for complex scenarios. These issues restrict the scalability and practical deployment of adaptive collaboration frameworks. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{HyperAgent}, a hypergraph-based framework that optimizes communication topologies and effectively captures group collaboration patterns using direct hyperedge representations. Unlike edge-based approaches, HyperAgent uses hyperedges to link multiple agents within the same subtask and employs hypergraph convolutional layers to achieve one-step information aggregation in collaboration groups. Additionally, it incorporates a variational autoencoder framework with sparsity regularization to dynamically adjust hypergraph topologies based on task complexity. Experiments highlight the superiority of HyperAgent in both performance and efficiency. For instance, on GSM8K, HyperAgent achieves 95.07\% accuracy while reducing token consumption by 25.33\%, demonstrating the potential of hypergraph-based optimization for multi-agent communication.</description>

      <title>Scaling Inference-Time Computation via Opponent Simulation: Enabling Online Strategic Adaptation in Repeated Negotiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful decision-makers across a wide range of single-agent and stationary environments, fewer efforts have been devoted to settings where LLMs must engage in \emph{repeated} and \emph{strategic} interactions with unknown or dynamic opponents. In such settings, recipes built upon \emph{offline} pre-training or fine-tuning, though robust against worst-case adversaries, do not fully exploit the capability of LLMs to adapt \emph{online} based on interaction feedback. Instead, we explore the more natural perspective of scaling inference-time computation as a mechanism for adaptation, embedding the principles of a classical game-theoretical learning dynamic, \emph{smooth Fictitious Play (sFP)}, into LLM inference: (i) for belief formation, we employ an auxiliary opponent model that in-context learns to imitate the time-averaged behavior of the opponent; (ii) for best response, we advance best-of-$N$ (BoN) sampling by simulating against the opponent model. Empirical evaluations on two distinct forms of repeated negotiation games demonstrate that our method enables significant performance improvement over repeated online interaction compared to various baselines, offering a scalable and principled approach to repeated strategic decision-making without any parameter updates.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Formation Tracking Control of Wheeled Mobile Robots With Region Constraint: A Generalized Udwadia-Kalaba Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, the time-varying formation tracking control of wheeled mobile robots with region constraint is investigated from a generalized Udwadia-Kalaba framework. The communication network is modeled as a directed and weighted graph that has a spanning tree with the leader being the root. By reformulating the time-varying formation tracking control objective as an equality constrained equation and transforming the region constraint by a diffeomorphism, the time-varying formation tracking controller with the region constraint is designed under the generalized Udwadia-Kalaba framework. Compared with the existing works on time-varying formation tracking control, the region constraint is taken into account in this paper, which ensures the safety of the robots. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed control strategy is illustrated through some numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>LongCLI-Bench: A Preliminary Benchmark and Study for Long-horizon Agentic Programming in Command-Line Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in AI-assisted programming have empowered agents to execute complex workflows via command-line interfaces, however, existing benchmarks are limited by short task horizons, data contamination from GitHub scraping, and a lack of fine-grained evaluation metrics, fail to rigorously evaluate the long-horizon planning and execution capabilities essential for realistic software engineering. To address these gaps, we introduce LongCLI-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate agentic capabilities across long-horizon, realistic tasks. We curated 20 high-quality, long-horizon tasks from over 1,000 computer science assignments and real-world workflows, covering four engineering categories: from scratch, feature addition, bug fixing, and refactoring. We propose a dual-set testing protocol for LongCLI-Bench, which measures requirement fulfillment (fail-to-pass) and regression avoidance (pass-to-pass), and incorporates step-level scoring to pinpoint execution failures. Extensive experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art agents achieve pass rates below 20% in LongCLI-Bench. Step-level analysis further indicates that the majority of tasks stall at less than 30% completion, highlighting that critical failures often occur in the early stages. Although self-correction offers marginal gains, human-agent collaboration through plan injection and interactive guidance yields significantly higher improvements. These results highlight that future research must emphasize the development of synergistic human-agent workflows alongside advances in agents' planning and execution capabilities to overcome key challenges in long-horizon task performance.</description>

      <title>Under the Influence: Quantifying Persuasion and Vigilance in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With increasing integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into areas of high-stakes human decision-making, it is important to understand the risks they introduce as advisors. To be useful advisors, LLMs must sift through large amounts of content, written with both benevolent and malicious intent, and then use this information to convince a user to take a specific action. This involves two social capacities: vigilance (the ability to determine which information to use, and which to discard) and persuasion (synthesizing the available evidence to make a convincing argument). While existing work has investigated these capacities in isolation, there has been little prior investigation of how these capacities may be linked. Here, we use a simple multi-turn puzzle-solving game, Sokoban, to study LLMs' abilities to persuade and be rationally vigilant towards other LLM agents. We find that puzzle-solving performance, persuasive capability, and vigilance are dissociable capacities in LLMs. Performing well on the game does not automatically mean a model can detect when it is being misled, even if the possibility of deception is explicitly mentioned. However, LLMs do consistently modulate their token use, using fewer tokens to reason when advice is benevolent and more when it is malicious, even if they are still persuaded to take actions leading them to failure. To our knowledge, our work presents the first investigation of the relationship between persuasion, vigilance, and task performance in LLMs, and suggests that monitoring all three independently will be critical for future work in AI safety.</description>

Abstract: Multi-robot task planning requires decomposing natural-language instructions into executable actions for heterogeneous robot teams. Conventional Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) planners provide rigorous guarantees but struggle to handle ambiguous or long-horizon missions, while large language models (LLMs) can interpret instructions and propose plans but may hallucinate or produce infeasible actions. We present a hierarchical multi-agent LLM-based planner with prompt optimization: an upper layer decomposes tasks and assigns them to lower-layer agents, which generate PDDL problems solved by a classical planner. When plans fail, the system applies TextGrad-inspired textual-gradient updates to optimize each agent's prompt and thereby improve planning accuracy. In addition, meta-prompts are learned and shared across agents within the same layer, enabling efficient prompt optimization in multi-agent settings. On the MAT-THOR benchmark, our planner achieves success rates of 0.95 on compound tasks, 0.84 on complex tasks, and 0.60 on vague tasks, improving over the previous state-of-the-art LaMMA-P by 2, 7, and 15 percentage points respectively. An ablation study shows that the hierarchical structure, prompt optimization, and meta-prompt sharing contribute roughly +59, +37, and +4 percentage points to the overall success rate.</description>
