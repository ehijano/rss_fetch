      <title>Entropy plateaus can emerge from gas replacement at a characteristic halo mass in simulated groups and clusters of galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamic evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM) is driven by a complex interplay between gravitational collapse, radiative cooling, and baryonic feedback associated with galaxy formation. Using cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of a group of mass $8.83 \times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ and a cluster of mass $2.92 \times 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$ at $z=0$, we investigate the emergence of entropy plateaus at characteristic halo masses and their connection to feedback mechanisms. We use the SWIFT-EAGLE model with three resolution levels, down to an initial particle gas mass of $2.29 \times 10^5$ M$_\odot$ and dark matter particle mass of $1.23 \times 10^6$ M$_\odot$. Our analysis reveals that when halos reach $\sim 10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$, their entropy profiles flatten at the virial radius, marking a transition where AGN feedback begins to dominate over supernova-driven regulation. By tracking the Lagrangian history of gas particles, we demonstrate that this entropy buildup is driven primarily by AGN feedback, which efficiently removes low-entropy gas from progenitors of groups and clusters, redistributing it throughout the IGM before the gas can fall into the core region. Recent XMM-Newton observations of X-GAP local groups reveal large entropy excesses and flat cores, in line with our predicted plateaus and in contrast to the steeper, power-law-like profiles of previous observations. While these predicted plateaus may be observationally confirmed in unbiased samples, reproducing the full diversity of entropy profiles, from flat cores to cool-core power laws, remains an outstanding challenge for next-generation feedback models. We suggest that current AGN feedback models may be overly efficient in expelling low-entropy gas from the potential cool-core $10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$ progenitors, disrupting the balance between heating and cooling required to sustain long-lived cool cores.</description>

      <title>EMU: Cross-correlating EMU Pilot Survey 1 with Dark Energy Survey to constrain the radio galaxy redshift distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio continuum galaxy surveys can provide a relatively fast map of the projected distribution of structure in the Universe, at the cost of lacking information about the radial distribution. We can use these surveys to learn about the growth of structure and the fundamental physics of the Universe, but doing so requires extra information to be provided in the modelling of the redshift distribution, $dN/dz$. In this work, we show how the cross-correlation of the two dimensional radio continuum map with another galaxy map (in this case a photometric optical extragalactic survey), with a known redshift distribution, can be used to determine the redshift distribution through statistical inference. We use data from the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) Pilot Survey 1 and cross-correlate it with optical data from the Dark Energy Survey to fit the parameters of our $dN/dz$ model. We show that the recovered distribution fits the data much better than current simulated $dN/dz$ models available in the literature, and peaks at a much higher redshift. These results will have significance for future cosmological analyses with large-scale radio continuum surveys such as the full EMU, or with the SKAO.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Supermassive Dark Star candidates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark Stars, i.e. early stars composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium but powered by Dark Matter, could form in zero metallicity clouds located close to the center of high redshift Dark Matter halos. In 2023 three of us identified (in a PNAS work) the first three photometric Dark Star candidates: JADES-GS-z11-0, JADES-GS-z12-0, and JADES-GS-z13-0. We report here our results of a followup analysis based on available NIRSpec JWST data. We find that JADES-GS-z11-0 and JADES-GS-z-13-0 are spectroscopically consistent with a Dark Star interpretation. Moreover, we find two additional spectroscopic Dark Star candidates: JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z-14-1, with the former being the most distant luminous object ever observed. We furthermore identify a feature in its spectrum indicative of the smoking gun signature of Dark Stars: the He II$\lambda$1640 absorption line. In view ALMA's recent identification of a probable OIII nebular emission line in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z14-0, the simple interpretation of this object as an isolated Dark Star is unlikely. If both spectral features survive follow-up observations it would imply a Dark Star embedded in a metal rich environment, requiring theoretical refinements of the formation of evolution of Dark Stars, which in previous studies were assumed to form in isolation, without any companions.</description>

      <title>The THESAN-ZOOM project: Star formation efficiency from giant molecular clouds to galactic scale in high-redshift starbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star formation in galaxies is inherently complex, involving the interplay of physical processes over a hierarchy of spatial scales. In this work, we investigate the connection between global (galaxy-scale) and local (cloud-scale) star formation efficiencies (SFEs) at high redshifts ($z\gtrsim 3$), using the state-of-the-art cosmological zoom-in simulation suite THESAN-ZOOM. We find that the galaxy-scale average SFE, $\langle \epsilon^{\rm gal}_{\rm ff} \rangle$, scales with $M_{\rm halo}^{1/3}\,(1+z)^{1/2} \sim V_{\rm vir}$, consistent with expectations from feedback-regulated models. On cloud scales, we identify giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in a broad sample of high-redshift starbursts spanning a wide range of halo masses and redshifts. Star formation in these systems is predominantly hosted by filamentary GMCs embedded in a dense and highly turbulent interstellar medium (ISM). GMCs exhibit remarkably universal properties, including mass function, size, turbulence, and surface density, regardless of the environment in which they are identified. The global gas depletion time (and the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation) is determined by the GMC mass fraction in the ISM, while the cloud-scale SFE shows little variation. In particular, we find a nearly constant gas surface density of $\Sigma_{\rm GMC} \approx 70\,{\rm M}_{\odot}\,{\rm pc}^{-2}$ across different host galaxies. Nevertheless, we identify two regimes where phases with high SFE can arise. First, stars may form efficiently in the shock fronts generated by feedback from a preceding starburst. Second, the increasing background dark matter surface density with redshift may contribute to the gravitational potential of clouds at $z \gtrsim 8$ and confine them in high-SFE phases over extended periods.</description>

      <title>Super-Eddington accretion in high-redshift quasar hosts: black-hole driven outflows, galaxy quenching, and the nature of Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope has revolutionised our understanding of the high-redshift Universe, detecting bright, massive galaxies up to $z\gtrsim 10$, and identifying peculiar sources called "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). The origin of both classes of objects remains uncertain but is likely linked to the formation and early growth of the first massive black holes (MBHs), which may be more easily explained by invoking phases of super-Eddington accretion. In this study, we use a state-of-the-art zoom-in cosmological simulation of a quasar host to investigate whether these objects, during their assembly, can resemble any of the peculiar sources observed with JWST. We find that the impact of MBH feedback on star formation is typically moderate, with outflows preferentially escaping perpendicular to the galactic disc. However, for approximately ten percent of the galaxy's lifetime, the system enters a distinct quenched phase, after a rapid MBH growth driven by super-Eddington accretion. This phase culminates in a powerful feedback event, during which the MBH jet and disc-driven winds interact directly with the galactic disc, carving out a central cavity. We also find that, during the history of the quasar host progenitor, the spectral properties of the system can resemble both LRDs and quenched galaxies, depending on the specific evolutionary stage considered. These findings suggest that both conditions may represent transient phases in the life cycle of high-redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>Pieces of evidence for multiple progenitors of Swift long gamma-ray bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) are typically thought to result from the collapse of massive stars. Nonetheless, recent observations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) 211211A and 230307A, coupled with the low-redshift excess of LGRB event rates relative to star formation rates, present significant challenges to the prevailing model. We reexamine the selection criteria for higher redshift complete GRB samples and identify 280 Swift GRBs with peak flux over $2.6 ph cm^{-2} s^{-1}$. Assuming all LGRBs with $z \geq 2$ originate from collapsars, we construct the GRB luminosity functions(LFs) in three scenarios: no evolution, luminosity evolution, and density evolution. Our results indicate that a strong redshift evolution in luminosity $\delta = 1.87^{+0.27}_{-0.31}$ or in density $\delta = 1.10^{+0.21}_{-0.20}$ is necessary. The luminosity/density evolution model predicts 72.67/57.28 collapsar GRBs at $z &lt; 2$, which can account for 67.29%/ 53.04% of the observed LGRBs. This suggests that a substantial portion of LGRBs at $z&lt; 2$ may not be collapsar GRBs, which would challenge the universality of empirical GRB relations and affect their reliability in cosmological applications.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole-star binaries via dynamical friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a new channel for binary system formation involving stars and stellar-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) embedded in dark matter (DM) minihalos. In this scenario, binaries form when a star passes through the DM minihalo surrounding a PBH and loses sufficient energy due to dynamical friction. The continued energy loss induced by this friction is expected to drive the resulting systems to merge rapidly. We estimate their merger rate and explore the implications for two observables: rapidly decaying X-ray binaries in the Milky Way and gravitational waves sourced by compact object mergers. We find that this mechanism naturally produces a population of O(1) currently observable short-lived X-ray binaries. It also leads to a non-negligible gravitational wave event rate of O(0.3) Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, potentially involving high mass ratios and black holes in the lower or upper mass gap. This dynamical friction channel thus offers a plausible explanation for several unusual observations reported in recent years across both the X-ray and gravitational wave domains.</description>

      <title>The AGORA High-Resolution Galaxy Simulations Comparison Project VII: Satellite quenching in zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-mass halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Satellite galaxies experience multiple physical processes when interacting with their host halos, often leading to the quenching of star formation. In the Local Group (LG), satellite quenching has been shown to be highly efficient, affecting nearly all satellites except the most massive ones. While recent surveys are studying Milky Way (MW) analogs to assess how representative our LG is, the dominant physical mechanisms behind satellite quenching in MW-mass halos remain under debate. Aims: We analyze satellite quenching within the same MW-mass halo, simulated using various widely-used astrophysical codes, each using different hydrodynamic methods and implementing different supernovae feedback recipes. The goal is to determine whether quenched fractions, quenching timescales and the dominant quenching mechanisms are consistent across codes or if they show sensitivity to the specific hydrodynamic method and supernovae (SNe) feedback physics employed. Methods: We use a subset of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of a MW-mass halo from the multiple-code AGORA CosmoRun suite. Results: We find that the quenched fraction is consistent with the latest SAGA survey results within its 1$\sigma$ host-to-host scatter across all the models. Regarding quenching timescales, all the models reproduce the trend observed in the ELVES survey, LG observations, and previous simulations: the less massive the satellite, the shorter its quenching timescale. All our models converge on the dominant quenching mechanisms: strangulation halts cold gas accretion and ram pressure stripping is the predominant mechanism for gas removal, particularly effective in satellites with $M_* &lt; 10^8\, M_\odot$. Nevertheless, the efficiency of the stripping mechanisms differs among the codes, showing a strong sensitivity to the different SNe feedback implementations and/or hydrodynamic methods employed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations indicate a $4.9\sigma$ tension between the CMB and quasar dipoles. This tension challenges the cosmological principle. We propose that if we live in a gigaparsec scale void, the CMB and quasar dipolar tension can be reconciled. This is because we are unlikely to live at the center of the void. And a within 10\% offset from the center will impact the quasars and CMB differently in their dipolar anisotropies. As we consider a large and thick void, our setup can also ease the Hubble tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum diffusion describes the inflow of vacuum quantum fluctuations as they get amplified by gravitational instability, and stretched to large distances during inflation. In this picture, the dynamics of the universe's expansion becomes stochastic, and the statistics of the curvature perturbation is encoded in the distribution of the duration of inflation. This provides a non-perturbative framework to study cosmological fluctuations during inflation, which is well-suited to the case of primordial black holes since they originate from large fluctuations. We show that standard, perturbative expectations for the primordial black hole abundance can be significantly modified by quantum-diffusion effects, and we identify a few open challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upcoming cosmological surveys have the potential to reach groundbreaking discoveries on multiple fronts, including the neutrino mass, dark energy, and inflation. Most of the key science goals require the joint analysis of datasets from multiple surveys to break parameter degeneracies and calibrate systematics. To realize such analyses, a large set of mock simulations that realistically model correlated observables is required. In this paper we present the N-body component of the HalfDome cosmological simulations, designed for the joint analysis of Stage-IV cosmological surveys, such as Rubin LSST, Euclid, SPHEREx, Roman, DESI, PFS, Simons Observatory, CMB-S4, and LiteBIRD. Our 300TB initial data release includes full-sky lightcones and halo catalogs between $z$=0--4 for 11 fixed cosmology realizations, as well as an additional run with local primordial non-Gaussianity ($f_{\rm NL}$=20). The simulations evolve $6144^3$ particles in a 3.75$\,h^{-1} {\rm Gpc}$ box, reaching a minimum halo mass of $\sim 6 \times 10^{12}\,h^{-1} M_\odot$ and maximum scale of $k \sim 1\,h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Our data is publicly available: instructions to access the data and plans for future data releases can be found at https://halfdomesims.github.io.</description>

      <title>Planck-PR4 anisotropy spectra show (better) consistency with General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results from a series of analyses on two parametric tests of gravity that modify the growth of linear, sub-horizon matter perturbations in the $\Lambda$CDM model. The first test, known as the $(\mu,\Sigma)$ framework, modifies the Poisson and lensing equations from General Relativity (GR). The second test introduces the growth index $\gamma$, which directly affects the time evolution of matter density perturbations. Our study is motivated by results from the analysis of the Planck-PR3 2018 spectra, which indicate a preference for $\Sigma_0 \neq 0$ and $\gamma_0 &gt; 0.55$, both of which deviate from the $\Lambda$CDM predictions at a significance level of $\sim 2.5\sigma$. To clarify the nature of these anomalous results and understand how the lensing anomaly fits into the picture, we analyze the most recent Planck-PR4 spectra extracted from the updated \texttt{NPIPE} maps. Overall, the Planck-PR4 data show better consistency with GR. The updated likelihood \texttt{Camspec} provides constraints on $\Sigma_0$ and $\gamma_0$ that are consistent with GR within $1.5\sigma$ and $2\sigma$, respectively. The updated likelihoods \texttt{HiLLiPoP} and \texttt{LoLLiPoP} show even closer agreement, with all parameter values consistent with a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology within $1\sigma$. This enhanced consistency is closely correlated with the lensing anomaly. Across the different likelihoods, the tendency of $\Sigma_0$ and $\gamma_0$ to drift towards non-standard values matches the observed preference for $A_L &gt; 1$, both of which are significantly reduced or disappear within the Planck-PR4 data.</description>

      <title>Can Dark Stars account for the star formation efficiency excess at very high redshifts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07119v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently conducted observations of massive galaxies at high redshifts, revealing a notable anomaly in their star formation efficiency (SFE). Motivated by the recent identification of three $\sim 10^{6}M_\odot$ dark star candidates, we investigate whether dark stars can be the origin of the SFE excess. It turns out that the excess can be reproduced by a group of dark stars with $M \gtrsim 10^{3}\, \rm M_{\odot}$, because of their domination in generating primary UV radiation in high-redshift galaxies. The genesis of these dark stars is attributed to the capture of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) within a mass range of tens of GeV to a few TeV. However, if the top-heavy initial mass function of dark stars holds up to $\sim 10^{5}M_\odot$, the relic black holes stemming from their collapse would be too abundant to be consistent with the current observations of Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). We thus suggest that just a small fraction of SFE excess may be contributed by the very massive dark stars and the majority likely originated from other reasons such as the Population III stars in view of their rather similar UV radiation efficiencies.</description>

      <title>Constraining Axion Dark Matter with Galactic-Centre Resonant Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the influence of fuzzy dark-matter cores on the orbits of stars at the Galactic centre. This dark matter candidate condenses into dense, solitonic cores, and, if a super-massive black hole is present at the centre of such a core, its central part forms a `gravitational atom'. Here, we calculate the atom's contribution to the gravitational potential felt by a Galactic-centre star, for a general state of the atom. We study the angular-momentum dynamics this potential induces, and show that it is similar to vector resonant relaxation. Its influence is found to be sufficiently strong that such a dynamical component should be accounted for in Galactic-centre modelling. For the Milky Way, the atom is expected to have some spherical asymmetry, and we use this to derive a stability condition for the disc of young, massive stars at the Galactic centre - if the atom's mass is too large, then the disc would be destroyed. Thus, the existence of this disc constrains the mass of the axion particles comprising the solitonic core. We study an example model of the core, where all of the rotation of the core's inner region is assumed to come from an $l=1$ state, and its amplitude is determined by the halo's spin parameter; such a core is found to be in tension with the stability of the clockwise stellar disc for $4.4\times 10^{-20}\,\textrm{eV} \leq m_a \leq 5.3\times 10^{-20}\,\textrm{eV}$ at $2\sigma$. Other core models would vary the constrained values of $m_a$ somewhat. These constraints will tighten significantly with future, improved data.</description>

      <title>Probing gravity with non-linear clustering in redshift space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first computation of the gravity model testing parameter $E_G$ on realistic simulated modified gravity galaxy mocks. The analysis is conducted using two twin simulations presented in arXiv:1805.09824(1): one based on general relativity (GR) and the other on the $f(R)$ Hu $\&amp;$ Sawicki model with $f=10^{-5}$ (F5). This study aims to measure the $E_G$ estimator in GR and $f(R)$ models using high-fidelity simulated galaxy catalogs, with the goal of assessing how future galaxy surveys can detect deviations from standard gravity. Deriving this estimator requires precise, unbiased measurements of the growth rate of structure and the linear galaxy bias. We achieve this by implementing an end-to-end cosmological analysis pipeline in configuration space, using the multipoles of the 2-point correlation function. Our analysis demonstrates how to measure the scale-dependent growth rate predicted by non-standard gravity models. We split the estimation of the RSD $\beta$ parameter over distinct scale ranges, separating large (quasi-linear) and small (non-linear) scales. We show that this estimator can be accurately measured using mock galaxies in low redshift bins ($z &lt; 1$), where it offers strong discriminating power over competing gravity theories. We find that, for an all-sky galaxy survey and neglecting observational systematics, accurate and largely unbiased estimations of $E_G$ can be obtained across all redshifts. However, the error bars are too large to clearly distinguish between the theories. When measuring the scale-dependence of the $E_G$ estimator, we note that state-of-the-art theory modeling limitations and intrinsic "prior volume effects" prevent high-accuracy constraints. Alternatively, we propose a null test of gravity using RSD clustering, which, if small scales are modeled accurately in future surveys, could detect significant departures from GR.</description>

      <title>The irreversible relaxation of inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04803v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the results of a previous analysis of the Markovian master equation for the irreversible evolution of an open system embedded in de Sitter space, we include in the cosmological Friedmann equations a contribution from the presence of a physical bath at temperature $T_{\rm dS} = h / 2 \pi$, where $h$ is the Hubble parameter. We show that this provides a mechanism for the irreversible relaxation of the cosmological constant and a graceful exit to inflation, without need for subsequent reheating. Thermal particle production during inflation gives adiabatic, Gaussian, and approximately scale-invariant cosmological perturbations. We thus obtain the main features of inflation without any inflaton potential. To clarify the thermodynamic interpretation of these results, we consider the analogy of this irreversible relaxation to superfluorescence in quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Multi-Phase Thermal Structure &amp; The Origin of the Broad-Line Region, Torus, and Corona in Magnetically-Dominated Accretion Disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent simulations have demonstrated the formation of 'flux-frozen' and hyper-magnetized disks, qualitatively distinct from both classical $\alpha$ disks and magnetically-arrested disks, as a natural consequence of fueling gas to supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei. We previously showed that the dynamical structure of said disks can be approximated by simple analytic similarity models. Here we study the thermal properties of these models over a wide range of physical scales and accretion rates (from highly sub-critical to super-critical). We show there are several characteristic zones: a dusty torus-like region, a multi-phase neutral and then multi-phase ionized, broad line-emitting region interior to the sublimation radius, before finally a transition to a thermal accretion disk with a warm Comptonizing layer. The disks are strongly-flared with large scale heights, and reprocess and/or scatter an order-one fraction of the central disk emission. As a result, this simple accretion disk model predicts phenomena including the existence of a dusty torus and its covering factor, geometry, clumpiness, and dust temperatures; a broad-line-region (BLR) with its characteristic sizes and luminosities and ionization properties; extended scattering/reprocessing surfaces producing cooler disk continuum and apparently large observed disk sizes; and existence of warm Comptonizing layers and hard coronal gas. Remarkably, these properties emerge without our having to introduce new components or parameters: they are all part of the accretion flow if the disks are in the hyper-magnetized limit.</description>

      <title>The mass-metallicity relation as a ruler for galaxy evolution: insights from the James Webb Space Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxy evolution emerges from the balance between cosmic gas accretion, fueling star formation, and supernova (SN) feedback, regulating the metal enrichment. Hence, the stellar mass ($M_*$) - gas metallicity relation (MZR) is key to understanding the physics of galaxies. High-quality JWST data enable accurate measurements of the MZR up to redshift z=10. Our aims are to understand the observed MZR, its connection with the star formation rate (SFR), the role played by SFR stochasticity, and how it is regulated by SN feedback. We compare the MZR from the JADES, CEERS, and UNCOVER surveys, which comprise about 180 galaxies at $z=3-10$ with $10^6&lt;M_*/M_\odot&lt;10^{10}$, with 200 galaxies from the SERRA cosmological simulations. To interpret the MZR, we develop a minimal model for galaxy evolution that includes: cosmic accretion modulated with an amplitude $A_{100}$ on 100 Myr; a time delay $t_d$ between SFR and SN; SN-driven outflows with a varying mass loading factor $\epsilon_{SN}$. Using our minimal model, we find the observed mean MZR is reproduced by weak outflows ($\epsilon_{SN}=1/4$), in line with findings from JADES. Matching the observed MZR dispersion requires $t_d=20$ Myr and a $A_{100}=1/3$ modulation of the accretion rate. Successful models have low stochasticity ($\sigma_{SFR}=0.2$), yielding a MZR dispersion of $\sigma_{Z}=0.2$. Such values are close but lower than SERRA predictions ($\sigma_{SFR}=0.24$, $\sigma_{Z}=0.3$), clarifying why SERRA shows flatter trend and some tension with the observations. As the MZR is very sensitive to SFR stochasticity, models predicting high r.m.s. values ($\sigma_{SFR}=0.5$) result in a ``chemical chaos'' (i.e. $\sigma_{Z}=1.4$), virtually destroying the MZR. As a consequence, invoking a highly stochastic SFR ($\sigma_{SFR}=0.8$) to explain the overabundance of bright, super-early galaxies leads to inconsistencies with the observed MZR.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic leptogenesis with light-heavy sterile neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel leptogenesis scenario utilising the two-body decay of heavy right handed neutrino (RHN) via the electromagnetic dipole operator. While the requirement of the standard model (SM) gauge invariance requires such dipole operator only at dimension-6 forcing the generation of non-zero CP asymmetry from three-body decay with two-loop corrections, we write down dimension-5 dipole operators involving heavy RHN $N_R$ and its lighter counterpart $\nu_R$. This allows the generation of lepton asymmetry in $\nu_R$ from two-body decay of heavy RHN which later gets transferred to left handed leptons via sizeable Yukawa coupling with a neutrinophilic Higgs doublet. The asymmetry in left handed leptons is then converted to baryon asymmetry via electroweak sphalerons. The lepton number violation by heavy RHN also induces a one-loop Majorana mass of $\nu_R$ rendering the light neutrinos to be Majorana fermions. While smallness of the Majorana mass of $\nu_R$ prevents additional sources or washout of lepton asymmetry, it also constrains the scale of leptogenesis. For $\mathcal{O}(10)$ TeV scale leptogenesis, this leads to additional sterile neutrinos lighter than a few keV with interesting implications for a variety of observables including neutrino oscillation, warm dark matter as well as effective degrees of freedom within reach of future cosmic microwave background experiments. Additionally, heavy RHN can lead to observable monochromatic photon signatures at terrestrial experiments.</description>

      <title>The Merging Galaxy Cluster Environment Affects the Morphology of Radio-AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04198v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has previously been found that the galaxy cluster environment can affect the fueling and evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). This work examines the effect of the merging cluster environment on the properties of radio-AGN by comparing the radio morphology of cluster members in a sample of four merging and eight relaxed galaxy clusters at low redshift (z&lt;0.2). Using 144-MHz data from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) and Zooniverse, we classify the radio morphology of the radio-detected cluster members using the following morphology classes: compact, compact extended, extended, jetted, and disturbed. We find that the merging cluster environment has a statistically significant, higher population proportion of disturbed (bent and head tail) sources, indicating that the merging environment can affect the morphology of cluster radio-AGN. We also investigate the number of AGN that are detected in the radio data only, and the number that are detected in both the radio and optical data in mergers and non-mergers. We find that the merging cluster environment has a higher population proportion of AGN that are identified only as radio-AGN compared to AGN that are identified as both radio and optical AGN. Overall, we find that the merging environment affects certain radio-AGN (disturbed and only radio identified AGN), but not all.</description>

      <title>GHOST commissioning science results -- IV: Chemodynamical analyses of Milky Way satellites Sagittarius II and Aquarius II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Gemini/GHOST high-resolution spectra of five stars observed in two low surface brightness Milky Way satellites, Sagittarius II (Sgr2) and Aquarius II (Aqu2). For Aqu2, the velocities and metallicities of the two stars are consistent with membership in a dark matter-dominated ultra faint dwarf galaxy (UFD). The chemical abundance ratios suggest inefficient star formation from only one or a few supernovae (e.g., low Na, Sr, Ba), and enriched potassium (K) from super-AGB stars. For Sgr2, the velocity and metallicity dispersions of its members are not clearly resolved and our detailed chemical abundances show typical ratios for metal-poor stars, with low dispersions. There is only one exception - we report the discovery of an r-process enhanced star (Sgr2584, [Eu/Fe]= $+0.7 \pm 0.2 $; thus, an r-I star). As r-I stars are found in both UFDs (Tuc III, Tuc IV, Grus II) and globular clusters (M15 and M92), then this does not help to further classify the nature of Sgr2. Our exploration of Sgr2 demonstrates the difficulty in classifying some of the faintest (ambiguous) satellites. We advocate for additional diagnostics in analysing the ambiguous systems, such as exploring radial segregation (by mass and/or chemistry), N-body simulations, and the need for dark matter to survive Galactic tidal effects. The spectra analysed in this paper were taken as part of the GHOST commissioning observations, testing faint observation limits (G &lt; 18.8) and the single and double IFU observing modes.</description>

      <title>Describing the Non-Universal Galaxy Merger Timescales in IllustrisTNG: Effects of Host Halo Mass, Baryons, and Sample Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxy merger timescales are crucial for understanding and modeling galaxy formation in our hierarchically structured Universe. However, previous studies have reported widely varying dependencies of merger timescales on initial orbital parameters and mass ratio at the first crossing of $r_{\rm vir}$. Using IllustrisTNG simulations, we find that these dependencies vary with host halo mass, suggesting that discrepancies in prior studies may arise from differences in the systems analyzed. Specifically, in low-mass halos, merger timescales show a stronger dependence on initial orbital parameters, while in high-mass halos, this dependence weakens. To account for these variations, we present a fitting formula that incorporates host mass dependence, achieving a logarithmic scatter smaller than 0.15 dex. Comparing dark matter-only and baryonic simulations, we observe similar merger timescales for circular orbits but notable differences for radial orbits. In halos with $M_{\rm{host}} &lt; 10^{12.5} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$, mergers in dark matter-only runs take longer than in baryonic runs, whereas the trend reverses in more massive halos. We attribute these differences to the competing effects of tidal disruption by central galaxy disks and the resistance of baryonic satellites to tidal stripping. Finally, we extend our model to predict merger timescales from any starting radius within the halo. By fitting the extended model to the entire infall sample, we find that using only the merger sample can underestimate merger timescales, particularly for low mass ratios. Our model provides a valuable tool for improving semi-analytical and empirical models of galaxy formation.</description>
