      <title>Atomic-Scale Investigation of an Asymmetric SrTiO$_{3}$ Grain Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain boundaries (GBs) in oxide perovskites significantly influence their functional properties. This study examines the atomic-scale structure and composition of a faceted asymmetric grain boundary in strontium titanate (SrTiO$_3$) using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), atom probe tomography (APT), and density functional theory (DFT). STEM and APT reveal an atomically sharp boundary with asymmetric and symmetric facets, marked by strong Sr depletion over a width of less than 1 nm. STEM-EELS shows Ti concentration variations of up to 20% between facets, while APT constrains this variation to less than 10%. DFT$+U$ calculations of a symmetric ${\Sigma}$5 facet confirm that Sr depletion minimizes boundary energy while maintaining Ti content. The variation in Ti suggests cation mobility that enables local energy minimization. Differences in facet surface energies likely drive Ti redistribution, offering strategies for GB structure control. This combined experimental-theoretical approach provides key insights into the structure and energy landscape of GBs in SrTiO$_3$, aiding in the prediction of their impact on ionic and electronic transport.</description>

      <title>Physicochemical Characterization of a New 2D Semiconductor Carbon Allotrope, C16: An Investigation via Density Functional Theory and Machine Learning-based Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study comprehensively characterizes, with suggested applications, a novel two-dimensional carbon allotrope, C$_{16}$, using Density Functional Theory and machine learning-based molecular dynamics. This nanomaterial is derived from naphthalene and bicyclopropylidene molecules, forming a planar configuration with sp$^2$ hybridization and featuring 3-, 4-, 6-, 8-, and 10-membered rings. Cohesive energy of \SI{-7.1}{\electronvolt/atom}, absence of imaginary frequencies in the phonon spectrum, and the retention of the system's topology after ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirm the structural stability of C$_{16}$. The nanomaterial exhibits a semiconducting behavior with a direct band gap of \SI{0.59}{\electronvolt} and anisotropic optical absorption in the $y$ direction. Assuming a complete absorption of incident light, it registers a power conversion efficiency of \SI{13}{\percent}, demonstrating relatively good potential for applications in solar energy conversion. The thermoelectric figure of merit ($zT$) reaches 0.8 at elevated temperatures, indicating a reasonable ability to convert a temperature gradient into electrical power. Additionally, C$_{16}$ demonstrates high mechanical strength, with Young's modulus values of \SI{500}{\giga\pascal} and \SI{630}{\giga\pascal} in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively. Insights into the electronic, optical, thermoelectric, and mechanical properties of C$_{16}$ reveal its promising capability for energy conversion applications.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Interatomic Potential for Twisted Hexagonal Boron Nitride: Accurate Structural Relaxation and Emergent Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging ferroelectric properties of two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures are at the forefront of science and prospective technology. In moir\'e bilayers, twisting or heterostructuring causes local atomic reconstruction, which even at picometer scale, can lead to pronounced ferroelectric polarization. Accurately determining this reconstruction utilizing ab initio methods is unfeasible for the relevant system sizes, but modern machine-learning interatomic potentials offer a viable solution. Here, we present the Gaussian Approximation Potential for twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layers validated against ab initio datasets. This approach enables the precise analysis of their structural properties, which is particularly relevant at small twist angles. We couple the structural information to a tight-binding model based on accurate interatomic positioning, and determine the twist-dependent polarization, yielding results that closely align with previous experimental findings - even at room temperature. This methodology enables further studies that are unattainable otherwise and is transferable to other 2D materials of interest.</description>

      <title>Anthraphenylenes: Porous 2D Carbon Monolayers with Biphenyl-Anthracene Frameworks and Type-II Dirac line nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon's versatility allows it to form diverse structures with unique properties, driven by its moderate electronegativity, small ionic radius, and ability to adopt \textit{sp}, \textit{sp\textsuperscript{2}}, and \textit{sp\textsuperscript{3}} hybridizations, individually or in combination. In this work, we introduce three novel 2D carbon allotropes -- $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$-anthraphenylenes -- derived from biphenylene and Dewar-anthracene motifs, investigated through density functional theory calculations. Their thermodynamic and dynamic stability are confirmed by cohesive energy ($-7.02$ to $-7.26$ eV/atom), phonon dispersion, and \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations. The electronic structure analysis shows that all three anthraphenylenes display metallic behavior. All anthraphenylenes feature type-II Dirac Line Nodes (DLNs). Mechanical analysis highlights significant anisotropy, mainly in $\gamma$-anthraphenylene, which exhibits the highest rigidity. These monolayers feature a porous architecture with tunable mechanical properties, making them promising candidates for nanoelectronics and energy storage applications. By expanding the family of 2D carbon materials, anthraphenylenes provide new avenues for functional nanomaterial design.</description>

      <title>From 2D to 1D in beta-Naphthyne: A Porous Carbon Allotrope Merging Graphyne and Naphthylene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) carbon-based materials have attracted considerable interest due to their diverse structural and electronic properties, making them ideal for next-generation flat electronics. Among these materials, metallic-like porous structures offer advantages such as tunable charge transport and high surface area, which are essential for energy storage applications. In this study, we introduce beta-naphthyne, a novel 2D carbon allotrope composed of naphthyl units interconnected by octagonal rings. First-principles calculations confirm its dynamic and thermal stability, demonstrating its theoretical feasibility. Our results confirm its energetic, dynamic, and mechanical stability and its metallic nature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Young's modulus ranges from 46.60 N/m to 164.47 N/m, indicating an anisotropic mechanical response. Optical analysis reveals absorption activity in the infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) regions. The 1D structures were also analyzed, revealing a Dirac cone and a transition from metallic to semiconducting behavior. These findings establish beta-naphthyne as a promising material for energy storage and optoelectronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Evolution of surface morphology from Stranski Krastanov growth mode to step flow growth mode in InSbBi thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The incorporation of dilute concentrations of bismuth (Bi) into traditional III V alloys leads to significant reduction in bandgap energy, making InSbBi is a promising candidate for long wavelength infrared photodetection sensors due to its small bandgap (&lt;0.17 eV). Furthermore, InSbBi could serve as a valuable platform for spin dynamics and quantum phenomena due to its strong spin-orbit coupling. Despite its potential, the material quality of InSbBi alloys lags behind that of conventional III V semiconductors, primarily due to the substantial challenges associated with incorporating Bi into InSb and producing high-quality InSbBi with varying Bi compositions. In this study, we address these issues by developing a method for growing smooth InSbBi thin films with tunable Bi incorporation up to 1.81% by the dynamic adjustment of Sb flux and careful control of the interplay between growth temperature and Bi flux using molecular beam epitaxy. This work paves the path for high-quality InSbBi thin films for applications in photodetection, spintronics, and quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic signatures of biexcitons: A case study in Ruddlesden-Popper lead-halides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton-exciton interactions are fundamental to the light-emitting properties of semiconductors, influencing applications from lasers to quantum light sources. In this study, we investigate the spectroscopic signatures and binding energy of biexcitons in a metal halide two-dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper structure, which is known for hosting distinct excitonic resonances with unique lattice coupling. Using three spectroscopic techniques - photoluminescence (PL) and two variations of two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) - we map coherent one-quantum and two-quantum correlations to gain deeper insight into the biexciton characteristics. While PL spectroscopy is hindered by spectral broadening and reabsorption, 2DES provides a more accurate characterization, revealing multiple biexciton states and uncovering a mixed biexciton species arising from exciton cross-coupling. These findings highlight the importance of advanced spectroscopic approaches in accurately determining biexciton binding energies and offer new perspectives on many-body interactions in exciton-polarons within layered perovskites.</description>

      <title>Trilinear coupling and toroidicity in multiferroics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric responses are related in general to magnetic multipoles, and in particular the off-diagonal linear response is proportional to the toroidization order parameter. In multiferroics with three order parameters (polarization, magnetization, and toroidization), such response turns out to be also proportional to the trilinear coupling between the order parameters. Here we explore this scenario, discussing the effects of such trilinear coupling within a Landau theory framework, and using ab initio calculations to discuss a specific model system for this effect, namely the recently predicted three-order-parameter multiferroic metal Bi$_5$Mn$_5$O$_{17}$.</description>

      <title>Vacancy-induced Modification of Electronic Band Structure of LiBO$_{2}$ Material as Cathode Surface Coating of Lithium-ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiBO$_{2}$ is an electronic insulator and a promising surface coating for stabilizing high-voltage cathodes in lithium-ion batteries. Despite its potential, the functional mechanisms of this coating remain unclear, particularly the transport of lithium ions and electrons through LiBO$_{2}$ in the presence of lattice vacancies. This understanding is critical for the design and development of LiBO$_{2}$-based materials. In our previous work [Ziemke $\textit{et al.}$, J. Mater. Chem. A, 2025, $\textbf{13}$, 3146-3162], we used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the impact of lattice vacancies on Li-ion transport in both tetragonal (t-LBO) and monoclinic (m-LBO) polymorphs of LiBO$_{2}$, revealing that B vacancies in either polymorph enhanced lithium-ion transport. In this study, we expand on these findings by using DFT calculations to examine the effects of lattice vacancies on the electronic properties of both t-LBO and m-LBO polymorphs,focusing on the electronic band structure. Our analysis shows that B vacancies can enhance the electronic insulation of t-LBO while improving the ionic conduction of m-LBO. The combined results of our previous and current works indicate that B vacancy generation in LiBO$_{2}$ may enable t-LBO to function as a promising solid electrolyte and enhance the performance of m-LBO as a conformal cathode coating in lithium-ion batteries. Overall, generating B vacancies, such as through neutron irradiation, would offer a viable strategy to improve the functionality of LiBO$_{2}$ as a promising material for energy storage applications.</description>

      <title>Oxygen vacancy engineering in pulsed laser deposited BaSnO$_3$ thin films on SrTiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the tunability of oxygen content in pulsed laser deposition (PLD)-grown barium stannate (BaSn$O_3$, BSO) thin films by precisely controlling the background oxygen pressure over a broad range from 0.0004 mbar to 0.13 mbar. The introduction of oxygen vacancies significantly alters the structural properties of BSO films, inducing a monotonic expansion of the out-of-plane lattice parameter and cell volume as the vacancy concentration increases. The progressive formation of oxygen vacancies was spectroscopically tracked using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), providing direct insight into the vacancy evolution. Furthermore, we show that the oxygen stoichiometry in BSO plays a critical role in modulating the sheet resistance of BSO/LaScO$_3$ heterostructures, enabling interface metallic electron conduction. This oxygen content control offers a robust strategy to tailor the electronic properties at the interface, highlighting its potential for oxide electronics and functional interface engineering.</description>

      <title>Soft mode induced structural phase transition in Ba$_2$ZnTeO$_6$ at high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a thorough investigation of vibrational, structural, and electronic properties of perovskite-type rhombohedral Ba$_2$ZnTeO$_6$ (BZTO) under systematic application of pressure. To carry out the analysis, we have performed pressure-dependent Raman spectroscopic measurements, synchrotron XRD, and density functional theory-based calculations. At ambient conditions, BZTO stabilizes in $R\bar{3}m$ space group, which under pressure undergoes a structural transition to a monoclinic phase with space group $C2/m$ at around 18~GPa. In-depth Raman analysis reveals softening of a phonon mode E$_g$ ($\sim $ 28cm$^{-1}$) leads to the structural phase transition. First principle DFT calculations also indicate that the doubly degenerate soft mode associated with the in-phase TeO$_6$ octahedral rotation drives the structure to a lower symmetry phase $C2/m$.</description>

      <title>Optical excitation and detection of high-frequency Sezawa modes in Si/SiO2 system decorated with Ni80Fe20 nanodot arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface acoustic waves have emerged as one of the potential candidates for the development of next-generation wave-based information and computing technologies. For practical devices, it is essential to develop the excitation techniques for different types of surface acoustic waves, especially at higher microwave frequencies, and to tailor their frequency versus wave vector characteristics. We show that this can be done by using ultrashort laser pulses incident on the surface of a multilayer decorated with a periodic array of metallic nanodots. Specifically, we study surface acoustic waves in the dielectric substrate Si/SiO2 decorated with a square lattice of thin Ni80Fe20 (Py) dots. Using a femtosecond laser-based optical pump-probe measurement, we detect a number of high-frequency phononic modes. By performing finite element simulations, we identify them as Sezawa modes from the second and third Brillouin zone in addition to the modes confined within the Py dots. The frequency of the Sezawa modes strongly depends on the period of the Py dots and varies in the range between 5 to 15 GHz. Both types of waves cover the same frequency range for Py dots with period less than 400 nm, providing a promising system for magnetoelastic studies.</description>

      <title>Texture- and Stress-Dependent Electromechanical Response in Ferroelectric PZT: Insights from a Micromechanical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 (PZT)-based microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and other piezoelectric devices can be significantly enhanced by optimizing crystallographic texture, which directly influences polarization switching and electromechanical response. However, the combined effect of texture and residual stress on the nonlinear behavior of PZT remains poorly understood, particularly in morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) compositions, where both tetragonal and rhombohedral domain switching mechanisms coexist. While several computational models have been developed to predict the response of ferroelectric materials, most studies either focus exclusively on tetragonal ceramics, require computationally expensive self-consistent schemes, or fail to explicitly capture key experimental observables, such as butterfly loops and D3-E3 hysteresis loops. Furthermore, the lack of accessible numerical implementations limits the ability of experimentalists to engage with and refine these models. To address these challenges, this work presents an efficient micro-electromechanical model based on Hwang et al. (1998), implemented in an open-source MATLAB framework to predict the effects of preferred crystallographic orientation and residual stress on polarization switching in MPB PZT. Despite its simplicity, the model successfully captures key experimentally observed trends, making it an invaluable tool for understanding domain-switching processes in ferroelectrics. By making the code freely available, this study provides a practical and scalable computational approach that allows researchers, especially experimentalists, to simulate, analyze, and refine polarization switching behavior, bridging the gap between theoretical modeling and real-world ferroelectric device optimization.</description>

Abstract: Heusler alloys, renowned for their multifunctionality and capacity for vast elemental customization, are primarily classified into half-Heusler (XYZ) and full-Heusler (X2YZ) structural types. Typically, the 18-electron half-Heusler and the 24-electron full-Heusler alloys are recognized as semiconductors, following the Slater-Pauling rule. Semiconductors are desired for many applications, but they represent a minor portion compared to the predominantly metallic and half-metallic members of the Heusler family. To broaden the scope of Heusler semiconductors, advancements have been made in developing variants such as double-half Heuslers XX'Y2Z2 and quaternary full Heuslers XX'YZ, which incorporate four constituent elements. Recently, vacancy-filling off-stoichiometric Heuslers of ternary X1+bYZ (0 &lt;= b &lt;= 1) and quaternary XaX'bYZ (1 &lt;= a + b &lt;= 2) have emerged as a more versatile strategy. However, the flexibility associated with off-stoichiometry inevitably leads to complications, including issues with fractional filling ratios and complex site occupations. This work presents a comprehensive landscape of transition-metal-containing Heusler semiconductors, focusing on the off-stoichiometric Heuslers but seamlessly encompassing the integer-stoichiometric systems. The structural and electronic properties can be theoretically understood through a few simple rules. Many systems have been experimentally validated, showcasing their potential for applications such as thermoelectric converters.</description>

      <title>Eigenmode following for direct entropy calculation and characterization of magnetic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an eigenmode following method (EMF) that has been developed for the numerical scanning of the potential energy surface and the direct calculation of entropy and pre-exponential factors of Arrhenius-like transition rates in the framework of transition state theory. In contrast to other methods, we do not use EMF to move "uphill" or "downhill" in energy to find stationary points, but to obtain energy curves. By numerical integration of the Boltzmann factor along these curves, the partition functions of the followed eigenmodes can be calculated without making assumptions of the form of the energy curves. The EMF method is computationally more elaborate than traditional approaches as it requires iterative updates of the respective eigenpair spectrum. In order to mitigate this increase in computational cost, the EMF method can be combined with other approaches like the harmonic approximation for all eigenmodes but the softest which typically require the most accurate mod elling. In this work we first introduce the general theoretical background and algorithm of the EMF method before providing test calculations and relevant use-cases in the framework of atomistic spin simulations with a focus on magnetic skyrmions collapse.</description>

      <title>Photostriction Facilitates Relaxation of Lattice Distortion in Two-Dimensional Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photostriction effect, a light-induced mechanical deformation in materials, originates from the intricate interplay between lattice structure and electronic excitation. In photovoltaic semiconductors, this effect plays a crucial role in shaping non-equilibrium structural responses, yet its fundamental mechanism remains elusive. Here, we uncover lattice expansion and structural reconfiguration in two-dimensional (2D) perovskites driven by photoinduced excitation using first-principles calculations. Our findings reveal that the photoinduced carriers lead to a substantial lattice expansion by about 2%. The expanded lattice facilitates strain relaxation with the amplitude of 20% by increasing interatomic distances and reducing internal stresses, thereby enhancing structural stability. The lattice dynamics can be systematically engineered through photodoping density, unveiling a new pathway to modulate light-matter interactions in 2D perovskites. These insights not only advance the understanding of optically driven structural dynamics but also offer a guiding principle for optimizing next-generation high-efficiency photovoltaic devices and optoelectronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black silicon (b-Si) has been receiving a great deal of interest for its potential to be used in applications ranging from sensors to solar cells and electrodes in batteries due to its promising optical, electronic and structural properties. Several approaches have been used to demonstrate the possibility of producing application quality b-Si, which also exhibits light emission properties. The photoluminescence is a useful technique to identify recombination pathways and thus enable us to optimize device quality. In this work, we report the results of the radiative recombination dynamics in b-Si produced by a technique involving thermal oxidation, photoresist coating and chlorine plasma etching. An ultrafast blue luminescence component competing with non-radiative recombination at surface defects was identified as no-phonon radiative recombination. This component involves two decay processes with a peak energy at around 480 nm, which have the fast component of about 15 ps followed by a component of around 50 ps lifetime. The emission exhibits a slow process in red spectral region with time constant of 1500 ps. When the surface is smoothed, the lifetime of carriers increased up to 4500 ps and the emission peak blue shifted indicating downsizing in dimensions. The results are correlated with transmission electron microscopy, localized vibrational modes and spectroscopic ellipsometry and interpreted through the presence of quantum</description>

      <title>Investigation of physical and electrical properties of a suboxide layer at Si/Si-hexafluoride interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The silicon suboxide SiOx (x&lt;2.0) offers promising industrial application possibilities ranging from electrodes in lithium-ion batteries, which are used widely in electrical vehicles and portable devices to sensing applications. Therefore, a low cost, environmental friendly and high performance silicon oxide materials are required for an appropriate operation of any electronic gadget. In this work, we report on the physical and electrical properties of a suboxide layer of up to 1 {\mu}m, which was grown on silicon during the formation of a dielectric layer, namely the ammonium silicon hexafluoride. It is a stable oxide exhibiting light emission from 400 nm to 1700 nm offering scalable and cost-effective large area processing capability. The measurement results reveal interesting properties, which are required to be understood clearly before proceeding with any suitable application. The results have been analyzed using state-of-the-art physical and electrical characterization techniques such as ellipsometry, AFM, SEM, FTIR, photoluminescence lifetime and resistive switching measurements to determine structural, optical and electrical properties. At 300 K the carrier lifetime measurements reveal the lifetime values ranging from about few tens of picosecond up to 4500 picoseconds. Scanning probe analysis indicate a surface roughness of about 30 Angstr\"om. Resistive memory forming was observed also in these layers at relatively low power thresholds. We provide a comprehensive description of the physical and electrical properties in order to clarify the origin of the observed features. The wavelength dependent real {\epsilon}_1 ({\omega}) and the imaginary {\epsilon}_2 ({\omega}) dielectric functions provided useful insights on optical properties. A lookout is given for the possible applications of this special SiOx dielectric oxide layer.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectricity originating from polar moiety flipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide variety of applications has inspired great interest in designing new materials and investigating fundamental physics in the ferroelectric field. In the concept of ferroelectricity, the spontaneous polarization is traditionally considered a core property, but we find that the `spontaneous' seems unnecessary. Based on this understanding, we suggest a new type of ferroelectric materials, in which the polar atomic moiety is incorporated to realize the electric polarization and the polar atomic moiety flipping corresponds to the reversal of electric polarization. Lead hydroxyapatite Pb$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$(OH)$_2$ containing polar OH moieties is taken as an example to illustrate our idea, in which the OH moiety flipping result in the reversal of electric polarization. The mechanism of ferroelectricity reported herein distinctly differs from those of the displacive type, disorder-order type, and interlayer sliding type ferroelectric materials in the previous studies.</description>

      <title>Stability, electronic quantum states, and magnetic interactions of Er$^{3+}$ ions in Ga$_2$O$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical, structural, mechanical, and dynamical stabilities of the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ are confirmed from respective negative formation energies, negative cohesive energies, favorable elastic constants, and positive phonon frequencies. The phonon dispersions indicate that the Ga-O bonds are uniform in the $\alpha$-phase, while they vary in the $\beta$-phase due to the anisotropic polyhedral movement. The defect formation energy analysis confirms that both Er-doped phases prefer Er$^{3+}$ state. The underestimated band gaps of the pristine phases from $ab~initio$ calculations are corrected by employing the hybrid functional calculations. The site preference energy analysis indicates partial occupation of Er in the octahedral site of Ga. Anisotropic nature of hyperfine tensor coefficients of Er are similar in both phases. Calculated magnetic exchange interaction between two Er dopants is negative for $\alpha$ and positive for $\beta$, indicating antiferromagnetic ground state in the former and the ferromagnetic ground state in the latter. A large values of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMIs) are obtained along the $x$ direction in the $\alpha$ and along the $y$ direction in the $\beta$. The analysis of dielectric constants and refractive indices of both pristine and Er doped phases shows a good agreement with available experimental values. The calculated optical anisotropy is slightly higher in $\beta$ than those in $\alpha$, which is due to the involvement of lower symmetry in $\beta$. The crystal field coefficients (CFCs) calculated from DFT are used to analyze 4$f$ multiplets and 4$f$ - 4$f$ transitions. Thus calculated lowest energy level of the first excited state to the lowest energy level of the ground state is about 1.53~$\mu$m, which is in a good agreement with available experiment and it falls within the quantum telecommunication wavelength range.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic higher-order topological states in 2D honeycomb Z_2 quantum spin Hall insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of topological phases remains a cutting-edge research frontier, driven by their promising potential for next-generation electronic and quantum technologies. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations and tight-binding modeling to systematically investigate the topological properties of freestanding two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb Bi, HgTe, and Al2O3(0001)-supported HgTe. Remarkably, all three systems exhibit coexistence of first-order and higher-order topological insulator states, manifested by gapless edge states in one-dimensional (1D) nanoribbons and symmetry-related corner states in zero-dimensional (0D) nanoflakes. Furthermore, fractional electron charges may accumulate at the corners of armchair-edged nanoflakes. Among these materials, HgTe/Al2O3(0001) is particularly promising due to its experimentally feasible atomic configuration and low-energy corner states. Our findings highlight the importance of exploring higher-order topological phases in Z_2 quantum spin Hall insulators and pave the way for new possibilities in device applications.</description>

      <title>Non-van der Waals Heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond the study of individual materials, their interfaces and arising functionality are crucial enablers of fundamental science and technological applications. Recently, the arena of two-dimensional (2D) materials was extended to so-called non-van der Waals (non-vdW) compounds derived from strongly bonded non-layered bulk crystals. These nanosystems with their active surfaces complement now - through their chemically bonded heterostructure (HS) interfaces - the established space of weakly interacting vdW HSs. Here, we study a wide range of 55 candidate non-vdW HSs with autonomous density functional calculations and find that the resulting interfacial chemical hybridization and bonding is the key factor determining their electronic and magnetic properties. It gives rise to the formation of hybrid interface bands, strong magnetic coupling, and substantial electronic as well as magnetic moire surface property modulations upon twisting. Our work thus provides a significant step towards charting the new interface class of non-vdW HSs.</description>

      <title>Negative temperature coefficient of resistivity due to the itinerant spin fluctuations in metallic V$_{0.3}$Ti$_{0.7}$ alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few concentrated disordered binary metallic alloys show a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR), which is quite unusual. V$_{0.3}$Ti$_{0.7}$ is one such alloy that shows resistivity exceeding 100 $\mu\Omega$ cm and exhibits negative TCR. The addition of ferromagnetic rare-earth Gd, which is insoluble in the body-centered cubic V-Ti matrix, changes the negative TCR to positive (when Gd conc. $\geq$ 2 at.$\%$). Evidence of spin polarization of conduction electrons of the V-Ti matrix by Gd clusters is obtained from the magnetization experiments as well as from the anomalous component of the Hall effect. Our analysis suggests that the additional scattering due to the distribution in the electron-spin fluctuation interaction arising from the substitution of titanium in vanadium is the origin of the negative TCR. The Gd clusters polarize the conduction electrons, leading to the suppression of spin fluctuations, resulting in the positive TCR.</description>

      <title>Identification of Two Distinct Antiferromagnetic Phases in the Au-Al-Gd Quasicrystal Approximant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural and physical properties of two single-grain Au-Al-Gd 1/1 approximant crystals (ACs) with analyzed compositions Au73.67Al12.24Gd14.09 and Au74.67Al11.35Gd13.98 were thoroughly investigated. The two variants are iso-structural (cubic, space group: Im-3 undergoing sharp antiferromagnetic (AFM) transitions at TN = 9.6 K and TN = 8.3 K, respectively. Specific heat measurements in both samples evidenced sharp jump at TN, associated with the AFM transition, accompanied by broad Schottky-type anomalies at lower temperatures. Strikingly, the two 1/1 ACs exhibited markedly different responses to applied magnetic fields: one displayed a pronounced metamagnetic anomaly while the other did not. In this regard, variational calculations with adiabatic transformation of the magnetic field in realistic structural models identified the existence of two possible AFM phases: the cuboc phase with a metamagnetic anomaly and the cluster N\'eel phase without it, thereby clearly revealing the possible magnetic structures of the present AFM variants. These findings have led to the establishment of a comprehensive magnetic phase diagram for Heisenberg-type 1/1 ACs. This work not only advances our understanding of magnetic phase transitions in these complex systems but also suggests the existence of a broader spectrum of unexplored magnetic states in Tsai-type materials.</description>

      <title>Reduction of current for magnetization switching in a nanomagnet with perpendicular anisotropy by spin-splitter torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, spin-transfer torque (STT) based magnetization switching has been widely utilized in magnetic resistance-based memories, which have broad applications in microcontroller units and other devices. This study utilizes a macrospin model to simulate magnetization switching in nanoscale magnets with perpendicular anisotropy through spin-splitter torque (SST). The study primarily addresses minimizing the current for magnetization switching and identifying the conditions necessary for achieving high switching probabilities. Notably, the threshold current density for SST-induced magnetization switching is reduced by approximately 75-80% compared to conventional STT and spin-orbit torque mechanisms, provided the spin torque polar angle is optimized. For practical implementation in magnetic random-access memory (MRAM), a polar angle exceeding roughly 128 degrees must be maintained to ensure sufficient switching probability. Additionally, optimizing the shape of the applied current pulse significantly lowers the switching per rate by approximately 18 times. These findings underscore the effectiveness of SST in reducing magnetization switching currents and offer valuable insights into its potential application in SST-MRAM technology.</description>

      <title>Spin glass behavior in amorphous CrSiTe3 alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to the intrinsically high crystallization temperatures, layered phase-change materials, such as CrGeTe3 and InGeTe3, are attracting attention for embedded memory applications, In addition to the electrical contrast, a major change in magnetic properties is observed in CrGeTe3 upon switching from the crystalline to the amorphous state. In this work, we report a combined ab initio modeling and magnetic characterization study on the isostructural silicon parent compound of CrGeTe3, namely, CrSiTe3. Amorphous CrSiTe3 has similar structural properties to amorphous CrGeTe3; however, it shows a smaller energy difference between the ferromagnetic configuration and the random magnetic configuration, indicating a high probability of spin glass formation. Indeed, direct-current and alternating-current magnetic measurements show that the coercive force of amorphous CrSiTe3 is higher than that of amorphous CrGeTe3. Therefore, the pinning effect of spins is enhanced in amorphous CrSiTe3, leading to a more robust spin glass state with a higher freezing temperature. The large magnetic contrast between the amorphous and crystalline phase could make CrSiTe3 a potential candidate for phase-change magnetic switching applications.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic two-dimensional transition-metal nitride Co$_2$N$_2$ layer with high N$\rm \acute{\textbf e}$el temperature and Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal nitrides have a wide prospect of applications in the fields of physics, chemistry, materials, etc. However, 2D transition metal nitrides with strong magnetism, especially high N$\rm \acute{e}$el temperature, are very scarce. Based on the first-principles calculations within the framework of density functional theory, we design two 2D transition-metal nitrides \textit{M}$_2$N$_2$ (\textit{M} = Ti, Co), in which the transition metal atoms and the N atoms form a 2D layer with a wrinkled structure. The structural stability is demonstrated by the cohesive energy, formation energy, elastic constants, phonon spectra and molecular dynamics simulations. Elastic moduli calculations reveal that the mechanical properties of the two structures are anisotropic. Spin-polarized calculations show that Ti$_2$N$_2$ is a 2D ferromagnetic material while Co$_2$N$_2$ is a 2D antiferromagnetic semimetal with a Dirac point at Fermi level. Furthermore, by solveing the Heisenberg model by Monte Carlo method, we discover that the 2D Co$_2$N$_2$ layer is a high-temperature antiferromagnetic material and the N$\rm \acute{e}$el temperature is up to 474 K. Therefore, our findings provide a rare antiferromagnetic 2D material with both high critical temperature and Dirac Fermions.</description>

      <title>A Universal Raman Spectroscopic Framework for Defect Quantification in Mono-to-Multilayer Graphenic Materials: The Graphene Atlas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point defects, though atomically small, significantly influence the properties of 2D materials. A general method for characterizing point defect density ($n_{ D }$) in graphenic materials with arbitrary layer number ($n_{ L }$) is currently lacking. Here, we introduce the Graphene Atlas, a non-destructive Raman spectroscopy-based framework for defect quantification in diverse graphenic systems. We demonstrate that the relative fractions of the double-resonance D and 2D Raman bands, which arise from competing scattering processes, exhibit a universal relationship with $n_{ D }$, independent of $n_{ L }$. Plotting Raman data on a plane defined by defect-related and layer number-related parameters enables a direct and quantitative determination of $n_{ D }$ and $n_{ L }$. This Graphene Atlas provides a transformative tool for real-time defect quantification in scalable manufacturing of graphenic materials, bridging fundamental research and industrial applications. This framework establishes a new standard for defect characterization of graphenic systems, facilitating their optimization for advanced technological applications.</description>

      <title>Effect of surface orientation on blistering of copper under high fluence keV hydrogen ion irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Copper and hydrogen are among the most common elements that are widely used in industrial and fundamental research applications. Copper surfaces are often exposed to hydrogen in the form of charged ions. The hydrogen ions can accelerate towards the surface, resulting in an accumulation of hydrogen below the surface. Harmless in low concentrations, prolonged hydrogen exposure can lead to dramatic changes on copper surfaces. This effect is visible to the naked eye in the form of blisters densely covering the exposed surface. Blisters are structural modifications that can affect the physical properties of the surface including, for example, vacuum dielectric strength. Using scanning electron microscopy we found that the blistering of the irradiated polycrystalline copper surface does not grow uniformly with ion fluence. Initially, only some grains exhibit blisters, while others remain intact. Our experiments indicate that grains with the 100 orientation are the most prone to blistering, while the grains oriented in the 110 are the most resistant to it. Moreover, we noticed that blisters assume different shapes correlating with specific grain orientation. Good agreement of experiments with the atomistic simulations explains the difference in the shapes of the blisters by specific behavior of dislocations within the FCC crystal structure. Moreover, our simulations reveal the correlation of the delay in blister formation on surfaces with certain orientations compared to the others with the dependence of the hydrogen penetration depth and the depth and amount of vacancies in copper on the orientation of the irradiated surface.</description>

      <title>TBHubbard: tight-binding and extended Hubbard model database for metal-organic frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous materials composed of metal ions and organic linkers. Their diverse compositions and structures offer a wide range of applications, such as electrical conductivity and diffusion, which can be optimized by tuning the combination of different building blocks. The ease of modifying metal centers or organic linkers makes MOFs ideal for property prediction and inverse material design through computational modeling. Data science driven techniques can aid in the exploration of novel structures with optimize properties by employing machine learning models and using available simulation data in the literature. Here, we provide an extensive data collection with the simulation of MOFs, derived from the QMOF database, based on density-functional-theory, along with their corresponding tight-binding lattice Hamiltonian, offering insights into the electronic structure of each material. The topology information is augmented by the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptors which are used as fingerprints of the local environment. Besides, the Extended Hubbard model is also used to describe a sub-set of MOFs with transition metals, where the Hubbard parameters intra-site U and inter-site V are computed. Due to the highly computational cost associated with the Hubbard calculations and the comprehensive amount of data for the tight-binding Hamiltonian, the database provided here stands as a significant contribution not only for the training of ML models to predict new properties but also to perform inverse design of new MOFs with enhanced target properties.</description>

      <title>Density-Functional Theory and Triply-Periodic Minimal Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several authors have suggested that the surfaces of vanishing potential generated by the electrostatic fields from a distribution of point charges resemble triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) corresponding to the positions of the point charges. We provide a theoretical basis for this phenomenological comparison by starting with the Boltzmann equation to show that the surface corresponding to zero charge density is a minimal surface. We then use density-functional calculations for elemental materials that differ electronically and structurally, Na, Cu, and Al, to show that surfaces of vanishing charge density converge to the corresponding TPMS.</description>

      <title>Revealing Nanostructures in High-Entropy Alloys via Machine-Learning Accelerated Scalable Monte Carlo Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale simulations are a powerful tool for understanding material behavior and designing new materials. However, the computational limitations of atomistic-scale simulations stemming from constraints in computational power, algorithmic efficiency, and accuracy, prevent us from modeling large systems, even at ground state,(DFT)-level precision. Here, we introduce an efficient and Scalable Monte Carlo (SMC) method that overcomes the parallelization bottlenecks inherent in conventional MC simulation algorithms, reducing the computational complexity of an MC sweep from cubic to linear. Leveraging the large degree of parallelization inherent in our method, we present a GPU accelerated implementation, SMC_GPU, which enables the simulation of atomistic systems exceeding one billion atoms while maintaining the accuracy of density functional theory (DFT). Using this unprecedented capability, we perform large-scale thermodynamic simulations to investigate the microstructure evolution in the FeCoNiAlTi and MoNbTaW high entropy alloys (HEAs). Our results reveal a rich diversity of nanoscale phenomena, including short-range and long-range order, nanoparticles, and nanophases. The size, composition, and morphology of these nanostructures, which can comprise millions of atoms and thus present significant challenges for traditional methods, are analyzed with high-accuracy atomistic simulations for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. Our simulations produce thermodynamic properties and nanostructures that align well with available theoretical and experimental data. More intriguingly, our results reveal that the intricate nanoscale interplay of order and disorder in HEA stems from the combined effects of chemical complexity and temperature. This work underscores the promising potential of large-scale MC simulation for HEAs.let alone at finite temperatures, with density functional theory</description>

      <title>Velocity gauge formulation of nonlinear optical response in Floquet-driven systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the velocity gauge formalism, we develop a theoretical framework for computing the nonlinear optical responses of time-periodic quantum systems. This approach complements the length gauge formulation and offers distinct advantages in both numerical and analytical treatments, particularly for atomic and solid-state systems with well-defined momentum-space structures. By applying our framework to the Rabi model, we derive numerical solutions in the velocity gauge and compare them with the length gauge, demonstrating full agreement between the two formulations. Our findings reveal rich optical phenomena, including photon-assisted transitions, frequency mixing effects, and emergent Floquet-induced photocurrents that are absent in static systems. We demonstrate that nonlinear responses in Floquet-driven systems exhibit resonances at integer multiples of the driving frequency, providing insights into ultrafast spectroscopy and Floquet engineering of quantum materials. The present formulation establishes a bridge between theoretical models and experimental observations in driven quantum systems, with potential applications in quantum optics, photonics, and next-generation optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Coupling between small polarons and ferroelectricity in BaTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the formation of electron and hole small polarons in the prototypical ferroelectric material BaTiO3, with a focus on their interaction with ferroelectric distortive fields. To accurately describe the ferroelectric phase in electronically correlated BaTiO3, we employ the HSE06 hybrid functional, which addresses the limitations of conventional DFT and DFT+U models, providing a more precise depiction of both ferroelectric and polaronic behaviors. Our analysis spans three structural phases of BaTiO3: cubic, tetragonal, and orthorhombic. We uncover a unique phase-dependent trend in electron polaron stability, which progressively increases across the structural phases, peaking in the rhombohedral phase due to the constructive coupling between the polaron and ferroelectric phonon fields. In contrast, hole polarons exhibit a stability pattern largely unaffected by the phase transitions. Furthermore, we observe that polaron self-trapping significantly alters the local ferroelectric distortive pattern, which propagates to neighboring sites but has a minimal effect on the long-range macroscopic spontaneous polarization. Charge trapping is also associated with localized spin formation, opening new possibilities for enhanced functionalities in multiferroic materials.</description>

      <title>Indium selenides for next-generation low-power computing devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As silicon-based computing approaches fundamental physical limits in energy efficiency, speed, and density, the search for complementary materials to extend or replace CMOS technology has become increasingly urgent. While two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides have been extensively investigated, van der Waals indium selenides--particularly InSe and In2Se3--offer a compelling alternative with distinct advantages for next-generation electronics. Unlike conventional 2D semiconductors, indium selenides combine exceptional electron mobility (exceeding 1,000 cm^2V^-1s^-1), high thermal velocity (&gt;2x10^7 cm/s), thickness-tunable bandgaps (0.97-2.5 eV), and unique phase-dependent ferroelectric properties, enabling both high-performance logic and non-volatile memory functions within a single material system. This perspective critically evaluates the materials properties, fabrication challenges, and device applications of indium selenides, examining their potential to surpass silicon in ultra-scaled transistors through ballistic transport while simultaneously offering ferroelectric memory capabilities impossible in conventional semiconductors. We analyze recent breakthroughs in ballistic InSe transistors, tunnel field-effect transistors, and In2Se3-based ferroelectric devices for information storage, and identify key research priorities for addressing persistent challenges in scalable synthesis, phase control, and oxidation prevention. By bridging fundamental materials science with practical device engineering, we provide a roadmap for translating the exceptional properties of indium selenides into commercially viable, low-power computing technologies that can overcome the limitations of silicon while enabling novel computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Thermal-induced ion magnetic moment in H$_4$O superionic state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrogen ions in the superionic ice can move freely, playing the role of electrons in metals. Its electromagnetic behavior is the key to explaining the anomalous magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune. Based on the ab initio evolutionary algorithm, we searched for the stable H4O crystal structure under pressures of 500-5000 GPa and discovered a new layered chain $Pmn2_1$-H$_4$O structure with H$_3$ ion clusters. Interestingly, H3 ion clusters rotate above 900 K (with an instantaneous speed of 3000 m/s at 900 K), generating an instantaneous magnetic moment ($10^{-26}$ Am$^2 \approx 0.001 \mu_B$). Moreover, H ions diffuse in a direction perpendicular to the H-O atomic layer at 960-1000 K. This is because the hydrogen oxygen covalent bonds within the hydrogen oxygen plane hinder the diffusion behavior of H$_3$ ion clusters within the plane, resulting in the diffusion of H$_3$ ion clusters between the hydrogen oxygen planes and the formation of a one-dimensional conductive superionic state. One-dimensional diffusion of ions may generate magnetic fields. We refer to these two types of magnetic moments as "thermal-induced ion magnetic moments". When the temperature exceeds 1000 K, H ions diffuse in three directions. When the temperature exceeds 6900 K, oxygen atoms diffuse and the system becomes fluid. These findings provide important references for people to re-recognize the physical and chemical properties of hydrogen and oxygen under high pressure, as well as the sources of abnormal magnetic fields in Uranus and Neptune.</description>

      <title>Are There High-Density Deep States in AtomicLayer-Deposited IGZO Thin Film?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been well recognized that there exist high-density deep states in IGZO thin films. Many of the device characteristics of IGZO transistors, such as negative bias illumination stability (NBIS),were understood to be related to these deep states. However, in this work, it is found that deep state density (NtD) of atomic-layer-deposited (ALD) IGZO transistors can be an ultra-low value (2.3*10^12 /cm^3) by the proposed NBIS-free light assisted I-V measurements so that the deep states do not affect the I-V characteristics even in subthreshold region. This work also reveals that NBIS is not related to the photoexcitation of electrons in deep states. Our results suggest that the existence of deep states and the impact of deep states on ALD IGZO transistors may need to be revisited.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral multifold fermions in solids exhibit unique band structures and topological properties, making them ideal for exploring fundamental physical phenomena related to nontrivial topology, chirality, and symmetry breaking. However, the challenge of obtaining clean, flat surfaces through cleavage has hindered the investigation of their unique electronic states. In this study, we utilize high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to investigate the low-energy electronic structure of the cleavable single-crystal PdSbSe. Our combined experimental and theoretical analysis reveals the presence of multifold degenerate fermions within this chiral crystal. We also observe multiple chiral Fermi arc surface states and spin-splitting behavior in the associated bulk bands. These findings provide unique insights into chiral, multifold fermionic states in easily cleavable crystals and offer a robust platform for further research into their unique electronic properties and potential applications in novel electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Weyl Fermion Manipulation through Magnetic Transitions in the Ferromagnetic Non-Centrosymmetric Weyl semimetal PrAlSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PrAlSi, a non-centrosymmetric ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal candidate with a Curie temperature of 17.8K, offers a unique platform for exploring the interplay of symmetry breaking and topological electronic structures. Up to now, the Weyl fermion distribution as well as their evolution across the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase transition in PrAlSi has not been explored. Here, we uncover the presence of Weyl fermions in PrAlSi and demonstrate they could be manipulated through the magnetic phase transition. Our ab-initio calculations indicate a shift in the momentum and energy positions of Weyl fermions, alongside an increase in Weyl point numbers due to band splitting. The predicted band splitting and shifting of Weyl fermions are corroborated by our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments. Such manipulation of Weyl fermions leads to the appearance of a net chirality charge and a significant modulation in optical conductivity, as proposed by our calculations. Our research presents a novel method for adjusting the properties of Weyl semimetals by controlling Weyl fermions through magnetic phase transitions, positioning PrAlSi as a model system.</description>

      <title>Chiral magnon splitting in altermagnetic CrSb from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism has been proposed as a new type of magnetism, simultaneously exhibiting compensated spin moments in real space and spin-split electronic bands in reciprocal space. Alternating chiral magnon splitting is considered a unique feature of altermagnets. In this work, utilizing linear spin wave theory (LSWT), which is based on a localized spin picture and itinerant time-dependent density functional perturbation theory (TD-DFPT), we investigate the spin fluctuation spectra of altermagnetic CrSb. Along the L-$\Gamma$-L$^{\prime}$ path, the LSWT provides a chiral magnon splitting of up to 9 meV, located at high excitation energies around 140 meV, which is identified to be primarily driven by the splitting of two long-range exchange interactions, with exchange paths along the body diagonal lines of the unit cell. On the other hand, the more realistic TD-DFPT obtains more significant splitting of $\sim$ 30 meV at maximum. However, the splitting is severely smeared out due to strong Landau damping from the Stoner continuum, which may make it difficult to observe experimentally, e.g. through inelastic neutron scattering. We further provide a brief discussion on the connection between the Stoner excitations and the chiral magnon splitting.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetism in LaFeO3/LaNiO3 Superlattices with High Curie Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacing complex oxides in atomically engineered layered structures can give rise to a wealth of exceptional electronic and magnetic properties that surpass those of the individual building blocks. Herein, we demonstrate a ferromagnetic spin order with a high Curie temperature of 608 K in superlattices consisting of otherwise paramagnetic perovskite LaNiO3 (LNO) and antiferromagnetic LaFeO3 (LFO). The extraordinary ferromagnetism likely results from the covalent exchange due to interfacial charge transfer from Fe to Ni cations. By deliberately controlling the thickness of the LNO sublayers thus the amount of charge transfer, a robust ferromagnetism of 4 uB is realized for a stacking periodicity consisting of one single unit cell of both LNO and LFO, an emergent double perovskite phase of La2FeNiO6 with B-site layered ordering configurations. The ferromagnetic LFO/LNO superlattices offer great potential for the search of emergent magnetodielectric and/or multiferroic properties as well as applications in spintronics and electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Extraction of Coupling Strength for Polaron Hopping from $ab~initio$ Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately determining the coupling strength between polaron states is essential to describe charge-hopping transport in materials. In this work, we revisit methodologies to extract coupling strengths using ab initio approaches. Our findings underscore the critical role of incorporating anharmonic effects in the model Hamiltonian when analyzing total energy variations along reaction coordinates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coupling strength extraction based on total energy calculated from ab initio approaches is fundamentally limited due to the stabilization of diabatic states, which do not involve coupling strength. We demonstrate that such limitation exists in both DFT+U and HSE hybrid functionals, which are widely used in the study of polaron transport. Instead, we suggest extracting coupling strength directly from the electronic structure of a system in neutral conditions. The neutral condition avoids overestimating coupling strength due to additional energy splitting between bonding and anti-bonding states from the charging energy. This study highlights the limitations of existing methods and introduces a robust framework for accurately extracting coupling parameters, paving the way for improved modeling of charge transport in complex materials.</description>

      <title>Microscopic mechanisms of flexoelectricity in oxide membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern electromechanical actuators and sensors rely on the piezoelectric effect that linearly couples strain and electric polarization. However, this effect is restricted to materials that lack inversion symmetry. In contrast, the flexoelectric effect couples strain gradients to electric polarization, and is a universal property in insulating materials of arbitrary symmetry. Flexoelectricity becomes prominent at the nanoscale from the inverse scaling of strain gradients with material dimensions. Here, we measure the strain-gradient-induced structural distortions in strontium titanate using multislice electron ptychography. This technique enables reliable picometer-scale measurements of the dominant oxygen-titanium distortions, correcting for artifacts that limited conventional imaging methods. This enables us to directly measure the sign of the net ionic contribution to the flexoelectric polarization. Guided by the experimental measurements, first-principles calculations show how the sign and magnitude of the bulk contribution to the flexoelectric coefficient in strontium titanate can be switched by tuning the strain state. Hybridization between the optical soft phonon and acoustic phonon modes drives this transition, yielding a large response and a polarity switch across the resonance. This strain-dependence might explain the sign discrepancy and orders of magnitude variation in the values of previously reported flexoelectric coefficients for strontium titanate. As the strain state of curved membranes can be tuned, our approach also suggests an approach to engineer nanoscale flexoelectric polarization using strain as a control parameter.</description>

      <title>Role of Dimensionality on Excitonic Properties of BiSeI using Many-body Perturbative Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical exfoliation of two-dimensional materials has sparked significant interest in the study of low-dimensional structures. In this work, we investigate the bulk and low-dimensional derivatives of BiSeI, a quasi-one-dimensional anisotropic crystal known for its remarkable stability and novel electronic properties. Using the density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory, we examine the influence of dimensionality on their electronic, optical, and excitonic properties. Quasi-particle $\mathit{G_0W_0}$ calculations reveal a significant increase in the band gap with a decrease in dimensionality, driven by quantum confinement effects and reduced dielectric screening. By solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we identify a transition from weakly bound Wannier-Mott excitons in bulk BiSeI to strongly bound excitons its low-dimensional forms. These structures feature band gaps spanning the infrared to the visible spectrum and exhibit large exciton binding energies, making them promising for next-generation optoelectronics and excitonic applications. Our findings provide a theoretical foundation for future experimental studies on BiSeI and its low-dimensional counterparts.</description>

      <title>Giant energy density nitride dielectrics enabled by a paraelectric-metaparaelectric phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrostatic dielectric capacitors are foundational to advance the electronics and electric power devices due to their ultrafast charging/discharging capability and high-power density. However, the low energy density limits the potential for next generation devices in terms of miniaturization and integration. We propose a strategy that relies on inducing a field-driven phase transition that we denote paraelectric-metaparaelectric, which yields an ultrahigh energy density in III-nitrides. III-nitride compounds (Al, Sc, B)N with certain cation concentrations possess a nonpolar hexagonal ground phase which could transform into a polar wurtzite phase under a very large electric field, which is denoted as metaparaelectric with nearly null hysteresis P-E loop. This paraelectric-metaparaelectric transition leads to a polarization saturation at large electric field. The corresponding P-E loop displays a giant energy density of 308 J/cm$^3$ with high efficiency nearly 100%. The proposed paraelectric-metaparaelectric phase transition strategy in nitrides opens an avenue to design of next generation high performance dielectrics.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Network-Based Voltage Prediction for Alkali-Metal-Ion Battery Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting the voltage of battery materials is essential for advancing energy storage technologies and designing more efficient, high-performance batteries. In this study, we developed a deep neural network (DNN) model to predict the average voltage of materials used in Li-ion, Na-ion, and other alkali-metal-ion batteries. A comprehensive dataset was compiled from the Materials Project, incorporating a diverse set of features, including structural, physical, chemical, electronic, and thermodynamic properties, along with battery-specific descriptors. These features were utilized to construct a robust DNN model aimed at facilitating the discovery of novel battery materials. The model performance evaluated through 10-fold cross validation achieving an R$^2$ value of 0.99 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.069 V on the validation dataset. This high level of accuracy underscores the model's capability to capture the complex relationship between material properties and electrochemical performance. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that machine learning approaches, particularly DNN models, can provide rapid and reliable voltage predictions without relying on computationally expensive first-principles calculations. This research shows how systematic data analysis can accelerate the identification and improvement of next-generation battery materials. By focusing on key material properties and using computational methods, our study lays the groundwork for faster development of new energy storage solutions.</description>

      <title>Pathways to crystal chirality An algorithm to identify new displacive chiral phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algorithm that integrates pseudosymmetry search with first-principles calculations to systematically identify achiral parent structures and establish potential chiral displacive transitions linking them to their corresponding chiral phases within the 22 enantiomorphic space groups. This approach enables a robust exploration of structural relationships, offering new insights into symmetry-driven properties. Our workflow streamlines the discovery of displacive chiral phase transitions driven by soft phonon modes, providing insights into the mechanisms of structural chirality in inorganic materials. We apply this methodology on the chiral phases of TeO$_2$, Na$_2$SeO$_9$, Sr$_2$As$_2$O$_7$, As$_2$O$_5$, Rb$_2$Be$_2$O$_3$, and CaTe$_2$O$_3$. Demonstrating that some do not have a minimal supergroup that allows for an achiral phase; some can have a minimal supergroup, still, no unstable phonon mode exists in the achiral phase; and somewhere the minimal supergroup exists with a soft phonon mode connecting the identified achiral phase and the chiral phase through small continuous displacements.</description>

      <title>Drivers of chemical diffusion of hydrogen in the thin transition metallic glass V80Zr20</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the feasibility of using optical transmission to determine concentration-dependent hydrogen diffusion coefficients and activation energies of thin metallic glass films over a wide range of temperatures and concentrations. The hydrogen concentration's temporal and spatial profiles are simultaneously extracted without requiring a metal-insulator transition or hydride formation. The concentration-dependent activation energy is extracted and is found to exhibit similar concentration dependence as hydrogen in the disordered bulk alpha-phase of vanadium. The activation energy is in stark contrast, however, to the activation energy found in epitaxial vanadium films of similar thickness. The chemical diffusion increases with hydrogen concentration in the glass, whereas it decreases in the crystalline case owing to the differences in the thermodynamic factors. This technique provides detailed insight into the concentration dependence of hydrogen diffusion and constrains theories treating correlated motion of hydrogen and short-range hydrogen-hydrogen interaction. The method can be applied to other materials that show an optical response to hydrogen uptake.</description>

      <title>Giant spin shift current in two-dimensional altermagnetic multiferroics VOX$\mathrm{_2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets represent a novel class of magnetic materials that integrate the advantages of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, providing a rich platform for exploring the physical properties of multiferroic materials. Here, we demonstrate that $\mathrm{VOX_2}$ monolayers ($\mathrm{X = Cl, Br, I}$) are two-dimensional ferroelectric altermagnets, as confirmed by symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations. $\mathrm{VOI_2}$ monolayer exhibits a strong magnetoelectric coupling coefficient ($\alpha_S \approx 1.208 \times 10^{-6}~\mathrm{s/m}$), with spin splitting in the electronic band structure tunable by both electric and magnetic fields. Additionally, the absence of inversion symmetry in noncentrosymmetric crystals enables significant nonlinear optical effects, such as shift current (SC). The x-direction component of SC component is observed to have an ferroicity-driven switch. Moreover, the $\sigma^{yyy}$ component exhibits an exceptionally large spin SC of $330.072~\mathrm{\mu A/V^2}$. These findings highlight the intricate interplay between magnetism and ferroelectricity, offering versatile tunability of electronic and optical properties. $\mathrm{VOX_2}$ monolayers provide a promising platform for advancing two-dimensional multiferroics, paving the way for energy-efficient memory devices, nonlinear optical applications and opto-spintronics.</description>

      <title>Low-Temperature Remote Plasma Synthesis of Highly Porous TiO$_2$ as Electron Transport Layers in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) offer high efficiency and low costs, making them key for future photovoltaics. Optimizing charge transport layers is crucial, with porous TiO$_2$ widely used as electron transport layers (ETL) due to its energy alignment, transparency, and abundance. However, its efficiency relies on crystallinity requiring high-temperature processing (&gt;450$^\circ$C), increasing costs and limiting flexible substrates. Low-temperature wet-chemical methods face scalability issues due to material waste and hazardous solvents. In this context, plasma-based technologies are emerging as a more efficient and sustainable alternative to oxide-based ETLs. This study presents the synthesis of TiO$_2$ layers using an advanced plasma method combining remote plasma-assisted vacuum deposition (RPAVD) and soft plasma etching (SPE) at mild temperatures (&lt;200$^\circ$C), allowing control of microstructure and porosity. The resulting nanocolumnar film, decorated with a highly porous aerogel-like layer, enhances optical and electronic properties. These plasma-synthesized TiO$_2$ layers are antireflective and improve the efficiency in porous n-i-p PSCs, matching the performance of high-temperature reference cells. These PSCs achieve a champion PCE of 14.6%, a high value compared to reference devices synthesized at 450{\deg}C. Impedance spectroscopy confirms high recombination resistance and stable capacitance, linked to improved perovskite crystallinity. Our results highlight the potential of the RPAVD+SPE approach for producing low-temperature efficient ETLs, providing a feasible, industrially scalable, and eco-friendly alternative for manufacturing flexible, high-performance photovoltaic devices.</description>

      <title>Unprecedented superionicity of ultra-low barrier in A0.5CoO2 (A=Li, Zn)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ion conductivity of a solid-state ion conductor generally increases exponentially upon reduction in ion migration barrier. For prevalent cathode material LiCoO2, the room-temperature ion conductivity and migration barrier are respectively around 10-4 S/cm and 0.3 eV. In this paper, through first-principles calculations we predict the existence of 1D superionicity as the Li ions in O2 LiCoO2 are transformed to Zn0.5CoO2 or Li0.5CoO2 via cation-exchange reaction or deintercalation. The ion migration barriers (0.01-0.02 eV) even lower than room-temperature ~kBT are reduced by more than an order of magnitude compared with LiCoO2, which are facilitated by facile transition of mobile ions between two coordination configurations. The room-temperature ion conductivity is estimated to be over 50 S/cm, enhanced by 2-3 orders of magnitude compared with current highest reported value. Such unprecedented superionicity may also exist in other similar layered ion conductors, which may render technical advances and exotic effects such as ultrafast ion batteries and quantized ferroelectricity.</description>

      <title>Current Advances in Magnetoelectric Composites with Various Interphase Connectivity Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric composites integrate the coupling between magnetic and piezoelectric materials to create new functionalities for potential technological applications. This coupling is typically achieved through the exchange of magnetic, electric, or elastic energy across the interfaces between the different constituent materials. Tailoring the strength of the magnetoelectric effect is primarily accomplished by selecting suitable materials for each constituent and by optimizing geometrical and microstructural designs. Various composite architectures, such as (0-3), (2-2), (1-3) and core-shell connectivities, have been studied to enhance magnetoelectric coupling and other required physical properties in composites. This review examines the latest advancements in magnetoelectric materials, focusing on the impact of different interphase connectivity types on their properties and performance. Before exploring magnetic-electric coupling, a brief overview of the historical background of multiferroic magnetoelectric composites is provided. Fundamental concepts underlying the magnetoelectric effect, piezoelectricity, and the magnetostrictive effect are explained, including their origins and examples of these materials' properties. So far, three types of magnetoelectric composite connectivities have been investigated experimentally: particulate composites (0-3), laminated and thin films (2-2), sticks embedded in matrix, core-shell particles, and coaxial fibers. An outlook on the prospects and scientific challenges in the field of multiferroic magnetoelectric composites is given at the end of this review.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric control of antiferromagnetism via coordination swapping in A2Mo3O8 (A= Mn, Fe, Co)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal molybdenum oxides A2Mo3O8 (A= Mn, Fe, Co) are known to be polar magnets where A ions are located in either octahedrally or tetrahedrally coordinated sites. In this paper we predict that their polarizations can be reversed via swapping of two coordinations for A ions, giving rise to robust vertical ferroelectricity. Such unique ferroelectricity via coordination swapping can be used to control the Neel vector in altermagnetic Fe2Mo3O8, while the large non-relativistic spin-splittings can be also altered by ferroelectric switching in Luttinger compensated magnetic Mn2Mo3O8, both in the absence of net magnetization. However, their ultra-thin layers may possess net magnetizations that can be reversed upon ferroelectric switching. Our findings provide a new type of multiferroicity as well as a new avenue in control of antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Emergent B2 chemical orderings in the AlTiVNb and AlTiCrMo refractory high-entropy superalloys studied via first-principles theory and atomistic modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics and phase stability of the AlTiVNb and AlTiCrMo refractory high-entropy superalloys using a combination of \textit{ab initio} electronic structure theory -- namely a concentration wave analysis -- and atomistic Monte Carlo simulations. Our multiscale approach is suitable both for examining atomic short-range order in the solid solution, as well as for studying the emergence of long-range crystallographic order with decreasing temperature. In both alloys considered in this work, in alignment with experimental observations, we predict a B2 (CsCl) chemical ordering emerging at high temperatures, which is driven primarily by Al and Ti, with other elements expressing weaker site preferences. The predicted B2 ordering temperature for AlTiVNb is higher than that for AlTiCrMo. These chemical orderings are discussed in terms of the alloys' electronic structure, with hybridisation between the $sp$ states of Al and the $d$ states of the transition metals understood to play an important role. Within our modelling, the chemically ordered B2 phases for both alloys have an increased predicted residual resistivity compared to the A2 (disordered bcc) phases. These increased resistivity values are understood to originate in a reduction in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, in conjunction with qualitative changes to the alloys' smeared-out Fermi surfaces. These results highlight the close connections between composition, structure, and physical properties in this technologically relevant class of materials.</description>

      <title>Wettability and sp2/sp3 ratio effects on supercapacitor performance of N-doped hydrogenated amorphous Carbon Nanofoam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsed laser-deposited amorphous carbon nanofoams could be a potential candidate for electrochemical energy storage applications due to their properties such as ultralightweight, huge volumetric void fractions, and co-existence of sp, sp2 and sp3 carbon hybridization. It is known that the charge-storage of carbon nanostructures containing disordered sp2-domains is determined by the wettability, surface area, and porosity of carbon nanostructures. However, their charge-storage performance is limited to the areal capacitance of the order of a few mF/cm2. We enhanced the supercapacitor performance of nitrogen-doped amorphous carbon nanofoam by engineering its wettability and sp2-C/sp3-C ratio by vacuum annealing. The specific capacitance was enhanced around fifty times and the widened voltage of the device increased from 0.8 to 1.1 V compared to as-grown nanofoam. In addition, we examined for the first time the initial increase in specific capacitance of the aqueous symmetric supercapacitor with respect to the scan rate, employing in-situ measurements coupling Raman spectroscopy and electrochemistry. We attribute this effect, although observed in previous literatures but unexplained, to the electrochemical activation induced by structural changes during the charge storage performance. This optimization of pulsed laser-deposited carbon nanofoam may open an avenue for fabricating lightweight and porous nanostructures for advanced macro-to-micro-supercapacitor devices.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e $M$-valley bilayers: quasi-one-dimensional physics, unconventional spin textures and twisted van Hove singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of quasi-two-dimensional kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$, we consider the theory of twisted bilayers in which the Fermi surface is near the $M$-point. Surprisingly, unlike twisted bilayers of graphene or transition metal dichalcogenides, the moir\'e potential is quasi-one-dimensional: at each $M$-valley, the potential flattens the dispersion strongly along one direction, and weakly along the perpendicular direction. The combination of spin-orbit coupling and twist-induced broken inversion symmetry results in a similarly anisotropic `$\textit{moir\'e-Rashba}$' potential, which spin-splits the dispersion into coexisting two-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional bands. We discuss novel aspects of the interplay between mixed dimensionality and spin textures in this platform. First, an applied electric field produces spin polarisation which can be tuned by doping, suggesting potential spintronics applications. Secondly, an in-plane magnetic field momentum- and spin-polarises the Fermi surfaces, producing unconventional spin density waves. Thirdly, in the small-twist-angle limit, the large density of states due to a twisted van Hove singularity near $M$ results in a dense energy spectrum. Our results demonstrate a new variation of moir\'e bandstructure engineering, instigating the study of spin-textured one-dimensional physics in moir\'e materials.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Sheds Light on Integer and Fractional Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic topological phases of matter, characterized by robust boundary states derived from topologically nontrivial bulk states, are pivotal for next-generation electronic devices. However, understanding their complex quantum phases, especially at larger scales and fractional fillings with strong electron correlations, has long posed a formidable computational challenge. Here, we employ a deep learning framework to express the many-body wavefunction of topological states in twisted ${\rm MoTe_2}$ systems, where diverse topological states are observed. Leveraging neural networks, we demonstrate the ability to identify and characterize topological phases, including the integer and fractional Chern insulators as well as the $Z_2$ topological insulators. Our deep learning approach significantly outperforms traditional methods, not only in computational efficiency but also in accuracy, enabling us to study larger systems and differentiate between competing phases such as fractional Chern insulators and charge density waves. Our predictions align closely with experimental observations, highlighting the potential of deep learning techniques to explore the rich landscape of topological and strongly correlated phenomena.</description>

      <title>Mechanical resonant sensing of spin texture dynamics in a two-dimensional antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupling between the spin degrees of freedom and macroscopic mechanical motions, including striction, shearing, and rotation, has attracted wide interest with applications in actuation, transduction, and information processing. Experiments so far have established the mechanical responses to the long-range ordered or isolated single spin states. However, it remains elusive whether mechanical motions can couple to a different type of magnetic structure, the non-collinear spin textures, which exhibit nanoscale spatial variations of spin (domain walls, skyrmions, etc.) and are promising candidates to realize high-speed computing devices. Here, we report the detection of collective spin texture dynamics with nanoelectromechanical resonators made of two-dimensional antiferromagnetic (AFM) MnPS3 with $10^{-9}$ strain sensitivity. By examining radio frequency mechanical oscillations under magnetic fields, new magnetic transitions were identified with sharp dips in resonant frequency. They are attributed to the collective AFM domain wall motions as supported by the analytical modeling of magnetostriction and large-scale spin-dynamics simulations. Additionally, an abnormally large modulation in the mechanical nonlinearity at the transition field infers a fluid-like response due to the ultrafast domain motion. Our work establishes a strong coupling between spin texture and mechanical dynamics, laying the foundation for electromechanical manipulation of spin texture and developing quantum hybrid devices.</description>

      <title>Harnessing natural and mechanical airflows for surface-based atmospheric pollutant removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Removal strategies for atmospheric pollutants are increasingly being considered to mitigate global warming and improve public health. However, surface-based removal techniques, such as sorption, catalysis and filtration, are often limited by pollutant transport and removal rate constraints. We evaluate the atmospheric pollutant transport to surfaces and assess the potential of surface-based removal technologies for applications in airflow through cities, HVAC systems and over vehicles. If these removal technologies are applied to their surfaces, cities, solar farms, HVAC systems and filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal rates that exceed 1 GtCO$_2$e annually (20-year GWP). Cities have the highest atmospheric pollutant removal potential, with estimates averaging 30 GtCO$_2$, 0.06 GtCH$_4$, 0.0001 GtPM$_{2.5}$, 0.007 GtNO$_\text{x}$ annually. HVAC filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal costs as low as \$300 per tCO$_2$e removed when sorption or catalyst technologies are incorporated into their fibre sheets, outperforming the \$2000 per tCO$_2$e removal cost when these technologies are applied to city surfaces. This estimate is based on the literature values for these technologies' costs per square meter. However, our calculations indicate that optimising catalyst properties and surface coverage could lower the cost estimates to below \$100 per tCO$_2$e across these applications. These findings demonstrate that integrating surface-based pollutant removal technologies into infrastructure may offer a scalable pathway to advance climate and health objectives.</description>

      <title>Twin-Polaritons: Classical versus Quantum Features in Polaritonic Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding whether a polaritonic phenomenon is inherently quantum or classical is essential for developing accurate models and optimizing experimental designs. We investigate this question in the context of polaritonic rotational-vibrational spectra and report a new feature, the twin-polariton, an additional splitting beyond the usual primary resonant polariton splitting that arises from light-matter entanglement. Through ab-initio calculations of HCl molecules and a corresponding model system coupled to a cavity, we demonstrate that the twin-polariton persists in the many-molecule case and follows the same linear dependence on coupling strength as the primary resonant polariton splitting. This finding reveals a novel mechanism to tune a quantum feature using a classical one, offering new insights into the fundamental nature of polaritonic systems.</description>

      <title>Impact of structural distortions on the correlated electronic structure of orbital-selective Mott insulating Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ under strains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is a promising candidate to realize the Kitaev spin liquid phase since the large Kitaev spin exchange interaction is tunable via the change in electronic structure, such as the trigonal crystal field splitting ($\Delta_{TCF}$). Here, we show that the uncorrelated electronic structure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is rather insensitive to the strain effect due to the low crystal symmetry accompanied by oxygen displacements and the presence of Sb $s$ orbitals. This suggests that the Kitaev spin-exchange interaction obtained from perturbation theory also does not depend much on the strain effect. Using density functional theory plus dynamical mean field theory, we find that the correlated electronic structure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is an orbital selective Mott insulating state where the trigonal $a_{1g}$ orbital is insulating due to correlation-assisted hybridization, while other $d$ orbitals behave as typical Mott insulators, resulting in tunability of $\Delta_{TCF}$ under the strain effect effectively. Our results show that the local Co-site symmetry and dynamical correlation effects will play an important role in engineering the novel magnetic phase in this and related materials.</description>

      <title>Low-energy insulating reconstructions of Si(111)-7x7 surface with and without stacking fault discovered by graph theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 7x7 reconstruction of Si(111) surface is one of the most fascinating configuration in nature, whose STM image has been well-understood by the famous dimer-adatom-stacking-fault model (DAS). However, the electronic property of the DAS model is always confirmed to be metallic by first-principles calculations, while some experiments detected insulating features. It is still challenge to predict DAS-like reconstructions through traditional method to solve such a puzzle. Here, we show that 7x7 reconstructions can be quickly discovered by graph theory as implemented in the graph-space based RG2 code for crystal structure prediction. Two groups of reconstructions with (DAS-d8-T12, DAS-d8-T9H3-A, DAS-d8-T9H3-B and DAS-d8-T6H6) and without (AB-d10-T12, AB-d10-T9H3, AA-d10-T12 and AA-d10-T9H3) stacking-fault are discovered. They possess energetic stabilities comparable to the well-known DAS (DAS-d8-T12) and show similar STM patterns, providing a plausible explanation for the experimentally observed 7x7 reconstruction on the Si(111) surface. The first-principles calculations show that DAS-d8-T12, DAS-d8-T6H6, AB-d10-T12, and AA-d10-T12 are metallic, while DAS-d8-T9H3-A, DAS-d8-T9H3-B, AB-d10-T9H3 and AA-d10-T9H3 are insulating phases with gaps of 0.043 eV, 0.182 eV, 0.043 eV and 0.059 eV, respectively. Our work demonstrates the predictability of the Si(111)-7x7 reconstruction and provides the structural candidates for understanding the experimentally observed metal-to-insulator transition.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Vision Capabilities of Multimodal LLMs for Automated Data Extraction from Plots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated data extraction from research texts has been steadily improving, with the emergence of large language models (LLMs) accelerating progress even further. Extracting data from plots in research papers, however, has been such a complex task that it has predominantly been confined to manual data extraction. We show that current multimodal large language models, with proper instructions and engineered workflows, are capable of accurately extracting data from plots. This capability is inherent to the pretrained models and can be achieved with a chain-of-thought sequence of zero-shot engineered prompts we call PlotExtract, without the need to fine-tune. We demonstrate PlotExtract here and assess its performance on synthetic and published plots. We consider only plots with two axes in this analysis. For plots identified as extractable, PlotExtract finds points with over 90% precision (and around 90% recall) and errors in x and y position of around 5% or lower. These results prove that multimodal LLMs are a viable path for high-throughput data extraction for plots and in many circumstances can replace the current manual methods of data extraction.</description>

      <title>Diverse Magnetic Phase Diagram and Anomalous Hall Effect in Antiferromagetic LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interactions between conduction electrons and magnetism can significantly enhance the Hall signal, a phenomenon known as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). While the AHE is generally not expected in antiferromagnets with vanishing magnetization, a large AHE is observed in certain antiferromagnets with noncollinear spin textures and nonvanishing Berry curvature. In this work, we present a rich temperature and magnetic phase diagram with eight distinct magnetic phases for the antiferromagnetic kagome compound LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$. In the coplanar canted antiferromagnetic phase, we observe an AHE, which likely originates from the intrinsic effects. Upon entering the ferromagnetic phase, the AHE significantly increases and exceeds the conventional limits of AHE of intrinsic origin. Additionally, we observe a topological Hall effect (THE) that emerges in the conical magnetic phase. Notably, the THE in LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$ persists over an extended magnetic field range of up to 25~T. Our detailed transport measurements highlight the need for theoretical modeling to explain the observations of AHE and THE in $R$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$ ($R$= Rare earth) family of compounds.</description>

      <title>On-demand manipulation of superbunching emission from colloidal quantum dots and its application in noise-resistance correlated biphoton imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superbunching effect with second-order correlations larger than 2, $g^{(2)}(0)&gt;2$, indicating the N-photon bundles emission and strong correlation among photons, has a broad range of fascinating applications in quantum illumination, communication, and computation. However, the on-demand manipulation of the superbunching effect in colloidal quantum dots (QDs) under pulsed excitation, which is beneficial to integrated photonics and lab-on-a-chip quantum devices, is still challenging. Here, we disclosed the evolution of $g^{(2)}(0)$ with the parameters of colloidal QDs by Mento Carlo simulations and performed second-order correlation measurements on CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs under both continuous wave (CW) and pulsed lasers. The photon statistics of a single colloidal QD have been substantially tailored from sub-Poissonian distribution $g^{(2)}(0) &lt;1$) to superbunching emission, with the maximum $g^{(2)}(0)$ reaching 69 and 20 under CW and pulsed excitation, respectively. We have achieved correlated biphoton imaging (CPI), employing the coincidence of the biexciton and bright exciton in one laser pulse, with the stray light and background noise up to 53 times stronger than PL emission of single colloidal QDs. By modulating the PL intensity, the Fourier-domain CPI with reasonably good contrast has been determined, with the stray light noise up to 107 times stronger than PL emission and 75600 times stronger than the counts of biphotons. Our noise-resistance CPI may enable laboratory-based quantum imaging to be applied to real-world applications with the highly desired suppression of strong background noise and stray light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The frustrated honeycomb spin model can stabilize a subextensively degenerate spiral spin liquid with nontrivial topological excitations and defects, but its material realization remains rare. Here, we report the experimental realization of this model in the structurally disorder-free compound GdZnPO. Using a single-crystal sample, we find that spin-7/2 rare-earth Gd$^{3+}$ ions form a honeycomb lattice with dominant second-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic and first-nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic couplings, along with easy-plane single-site anisotropy. This frustrated model stabilizes a unique spiral spin liquid with a degenerate contour around the $\mathrm{K}$$\{$1/3,1/3$\}$ point in reciprocal space, consistent with our experiments down to 30 mK, including the observation of a giant residual specific heat. Our results establish GdZnPO as an ideal platform for exploring the stability of spiral spin liquids and their novel properties, such as the emergence of low-energy topological defects on the sublattices.</description>

      <title>Distribution of ${}^{7}$Li Implants in Nb Films for a Sterile Neutrino Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The BeEST experiment is measuring the ${}^{7}$Li recoil spectrum from the decay of ${}^{7}$Be implanted into Ta-based sensors to provide the most stringent limits on the existence of sterile neutrinos in the sub-MeV mass range. Its sensitivity is limited by spectral broadening due to interactions between the atomic shell of the ${}^{7}$Be/${}^{7}$Li and the Ta sensor film. This study is investigating the suitability of Nb as an alternative sensor material by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and atom probe tomography (APT) of ${}^{7}$Li-implanted Nb films. STEM does not detect any change in the microstructure of polycrystalline Nb due to ${}^{7}$Li implantation. APT reveals some segregation of ${}^{7}$Li at grain boundaries in Nb. While this may slightly alter the ${}^{7}$Li binding energies, the effect on the recoil spectrum is not expected to be strong enough to preclude using Nb-based detectors in future phases of the BeEST experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum friction describes the transfer of energy and momentum from electronically excited states in a material to a surrounding solvent. Here, we show that near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) exhibit quantum friction in water. The diffusion constants of functionalized SWCNTs in aqueous solution decrease linearly by around 50 % with increasing excitation power. In contrast, SWCNTs with quantum defects that localize excitons show no power-dependent diffusion. Chemical manipulation of exciton concentration by molecules that increase or decrease SWCNT fluorescence also modulate the diffusion constant by a factor of up to 2. Additionally, excitons increase the macroscopic viscosity of SWCNT solutions. Optical pump Terahertz (THz) probe spectroscopy reveals transient absorption features of water (37 /cm and above 80 /cm), indicating energy dissipation into translational modes of its hydrogen bond network. Molecular dynamics simulations further support a mechanism in which exciton-induced dipoles enhance frictional forces. These findings establish that excitons in SWCNTs induce quantum friction in water.</description>

      <title>Reversing Hydrogen-Related Loss in $\alpha$-Ta Thin Films for Quantum Device Fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\alpha$-Tantalum ($\alpha$-Ta) is an emerging material for superconducting qubit fabrication due to the low microwave loss of its stable native oxide. However, hydrogen absorption during fabrication, particularly when removing the native oxide, can degrade performance by increasing microwave loss. In this work, we demonstrate that hydrogen can enter $\alpha$-Ta thin films when exposed to 10 vol% hydrofluoric acid for 3 minutes or longer, leading to an increase in power-independent ohmic loss in high-Q resonators at millikelvin temperatures. Reduced resonator performance is likely caused by the formation of non-superconducting tantalum hydride (TaH$_x$) precipitates. We further show that annealing at 500{\deg}C in ultra-high vacuum (10$^{-8}$ Torr) for one hour fully removes hydrogen and restores the resonators' intrinsic quality factors to ~4 million at the single-photon level. These findings identify a previously unreported loss mechanism in $\alpha$-Ta and offer a pathway to reverse hydrogen-induced degradation in quantum devices based on Ta and, by extension also Nb, enabling more robust fabrication processes for superconducting qubits.</description>

Abstract: We report on the synthesis of single crystals of a new kagome compound, UV$_6$Sn$_6$, and present the results of magnetization, electrical resistivity, heat capacity, X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments to characterize the structure and magnetic properties. UV$_6$Sn$_6$ crystallizes in a large supercell of the HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$ parent structure with an hexagonal symmetry in which some of the U atoms are shifted by $c/2$ in an ordered fashion. Below $T_{N1}=30$ K, an incommensurate magnetic structure with a temperature-dependent wavevector $(0,0,k_z)$ is observed. Below $T_{N2}=23.5$ K, the wavevector locks in to $(0,0,0.5)$ forming an antiferromagnetic ground state. The U moments align along the \(c\) axis retaining a large magnetic anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Stability of Geopolymer Activator Solutions for Optimised Synthesis through Thermodynamic Modelling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geopolymers are an emerging class of binding materials used in sustainable cements, concretes, and composites. However, despite growing research, the lack of standardised processes and stability analyses for formulating activator solutions - a crucial component of geopolymer systems - remains a barrier to quality control and research advancement. This study presents an experimentally validated energy balance with thermodynamic phenomenon mathematically modelled for synthesising consistent geopolymer activator solutions. The model's general applicability enables dynamic assessments of user-specified systems, offering stability metrics for quality control in laboratory and industrial settings. Fundamentally, the mathematical model can be used towards batching optimisation under user-defined conditions where dissolution of geopolymer precursors can be maximised via solution preparation and batching optimisation. The model results quantify experimentally validated temperature dynamics, thermodynamic stability, and process design/batching optimisation, challenging traditional practices in the literature that rely on undefined equilibration periods. Key findings demonstrate that stable, ready-to-use activator solutions can be achieved in as little as 1 minute, compared to the typically used 24-hour batching periods. This research paves the way towards standardised activator solution preparation and supports the development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for geopolymer synthesis, promoting consistency and scalability in geopolymer technology.</description>

      <title>Switching on and off the spin polarization of the conduction band in antiferromagnetic bilayer transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic conductors with suitably broken spatial symmetries host spin-polarized bands, which lead to transport phenomena commonly observed in metallic ferromagnets. In bulk materials, it is the given crystalline structure that determines whether symmetries are broken and spin-polarized bands are present. Here we demonstrate experimentally that double-gate transistors realized on bilayers of van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrPS4 allow the relevant symmetry to be controlled by a perpendicular electric displacement field. Such a level of control enables the spin-polarization of the conduction band to be switched on and off. Because conduction band states with opposite spin-polarizations are hosted in the different layers and are spatially separated, these devices also give control over the magnetization of the electrons that are accumulated electrostatically. Our experiments show that double-gated CrPS4 transistors provide a viable platform to create gate-induced conductors with near unity spin polarization at the Fermi level, as well as devices with a full electrostatic control of the total magnetization of the system.</description>

      <title>UV$_6$Sn$_6$: a new kagome material with unusual $5f$ magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials in the family $R$V$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ ($R=$ rare earth) provide a unique platform to investigate the interplay between local moments from $R$ layers and nonmagnetic vanadium kagome layers. Yet, the investigation of actinide members remains scarce. Here we report the synthesis of UV$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ single crystals through the self-flux technique. Magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, electrical resistivity, and thermal expansion measurements reveal two uranium-driven antiferromagnetic transitions at $T_{N1}=29$~K and $T_{N2}=24$~K, a complex field-temperature phase diagram, and unusual negative domain wall magnetoresistance. Specific heat measurements unveil a modest Sommerfeld coefficient of $\gamma = 40$~mJ/mol.K$^{2}$, consistent with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements that show a moderate $f$-electron enhancement at the Fermi level ($E_{F}$). Our experiments support a modest contribution from \textit{5f} flat bands to the density of states at $E_{F}$, whereas our band structure calculations place the vanadium flat bands 0.25~eV above $E_{F}$. Our findings point to a materials opportunity to expand the uranium 166 family with the goal of enhancing correlations by tuning $5f$ and $3d$ flat bands to $E_{F}$.</description>

Abstract: Analytical relations for the glass transition temperature, $T_g$, and the crystal melting temperature, $T_m$, are developed on the basis of nonaffine lattice dynamics. The proposed relations explain: (i) the seemingly universal factor of $\approx 2/3$ difference between glass transition temperature and melting temperature of the corresponding crystal, and (ii) the recent empirical discovery that both $T_g$ and $T_m$ are proportional to the liquid fragility $m$ divided by the thermal expansion coefficient $\alpha$ of the solid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic impurities are known to degrade superconductivity. For this reason, physical vapor deposition chambers that have previously been used for magnetic materials have generally been avoided for making high-quality superconducting resonator devices. In this article, we show by example that such chambers can be used: with Nb films sputtered in a chamber that continues to be used for magnetic materials, we demonstrate compact (3 {\mu}m gap) coplanar waveguide resonators with low-power internal quality factors near one million. We achieve this using a resist strip bath with no post-fabrication acid treatment, which results in performance comparable to previous strip baths with acid treatments. We also find evidence that this improved resist strip bath provides a better surface chemical template for post-fabrication hydrogen fluoride processing. These results are consistent across three Si substrate preparation methods, including a \SI{700}{\celsius} anneal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Film formation from solvent evaporation in polymer ternary solutions is relevant for several technological applications, such as the fabrication of organic solar cells. The performance of the final device will strongly depend on the internal morphology of the obtained film, which, in turn, is affected by the processing conditions. We are interested in modeling morphology formation in 3D for ternary mixtures using both a lattice model and its continuous counterpart in the absence of evaporation. In our previous works, we found that, in 2D, both models predict the existence of two distinct regimes: (i) a low-solvent regime, characterized by two interpenetrated domains of the two polymers, and (ii) a high-solvent regime, where isolated polymer domains are dispersed in the solvent background. In the significantly more intriguing 3D case, we observe a comparable scenario both for the discrete and the continuous model. The lattice model reveals its ability to describe morphology formation even in the high solvent content 3D case, in which the three-dimensional nature of space could have prevented cluster formation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced anomalous Hall effect in the topological Kagome metal Cs(V$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$)$_3$Sb$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a fundamental physical phenomenon, achieving and controlling a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is crucial for advancing the understanding of topological physics and for developing applied technologies in spintronics. The recently discovered topological Kagome metal $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A =$ K, Rb, Cs)exhibits a significant AHE along with charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity, providing an ideal platform to study the interactions between nontrivial band topology, CDW, and superconductivity. In this study, we systematically investigated the evolution of CDW, superconductivity, and AHE in electron (Mn)-doped Cs(V$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$)$_3$Sb$_5$ single crystals. The experimental results show that electron doping rapidly suppresses superconductivity, while the CDW order remains relatively robust. Meanwhile, a significantly enhanced AHE, with a maximum anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of ~25331 \Ohm ^{-1}\cm^{-1} and an anomalous Hall angle of 6.66% occurs at a relatively low doping level of $x = 0.03$. Based on the Tian-Ye-Jin (TYJ) scaling model, such a significant enhancement AHC is mainly dominated by the skew scattering. We speculated enhanced skew scattering between electrons and Mn originating from the strengthened spin-orbital coupling. Our finding provides important guidance for the design and development of transverse transport properties in topological Kagome materials.</description>

Abstract: In the field of condensed matter physics, time-reversal symmetry provides the foundation for a number of interesting quantum phenomena, in particular the topological materials and the quantum spin Hall physics that have been extensively studied in recent years. Here, based on the first-principles electronic-structure calculations, symmetry analysis, and model simulations, we demonstrate that time-reversal symmetry is not fundamentally necessary for the quantum spin Hall effect. In altermagnetic materials, as an alternative, it can also be protected by crystal symmetry, which can be referred to as the quantum crystal spin Hall effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to achieve breathing kagome moir\'e superlattices using three twisted layers of transition metal dichalcogenides. In this scheme, the top and bottom layers are twisted relative to the middle layer by small angles $\theta$ and 2$\theta$ respectively, generating a kagome-like moir\'e potential for the middle layer with suitable parameters. The moir\'e band structures of these systems are calculated within the continuum model and show good resemblance to the breathing kagome band structure, including the flat band, Dirac points with tunable gap, and van Hove singularities. This system serves as a new venue to explore strongly correlated physics on kagome lattices which offers more flexibility and tunability in band structure, charge density, and interaction strength.</description>

      <title>Learning Physics-Consistent Material Behavior from Dynamic Displacements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately modeling the mechanical behavior of materials is crucial for numerous engineering applications. The quality of these models depends directly on the accuracy of the constitutive law that defines the stress-strain relation. However, discovering these constitutive material laws remains a significant challenge, in particular when only material deformation data is available. To address this challenge, unsupervised machine learning methods have been proposed to learn the constitutive law from deformation data. Nonetheless, existing approaches have several limitations: they either fail to ensure that the learned constitutive relations are consistent with physical principles, or they rely on boundary force data for training which are unavailable in many in-situ scenarios. Here, we introduce a machine learning approach to learn physics-consistent constitutive relations solely from material deformation without boundary force information. This is achieved by considering a dynamic formulation rather than static equilibrium data and applying an input convex neural network (ICNN). We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a diverse range of hyperelastic material laws. We demonstrate that it is robust to a significant level of noise and that it converges to the ground truth with increasing data resolution. We also show that the model can be effectively trained using a displacement field from a subdomain of the test specimen and that the learned constitutive relation from one material sample is transferable to other samples with different geometries. The developed methodology provides an effective tool for discovering constitutive relations. It is, due to its design based on dynamics, particularly suited for applications to strain-rate-dependent materials and situations where constitutive laws need to be inferred from in-situ measurements without access to global force data.</description>

      <title>Antiferroelectric Altermagnets: Antiferroelectricity Alters Magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06071v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric coupling is crucial for uncovering fundamental phenomena and advancing technologies in high-density data storage and energy-efficient devices. The emergence of altermagnets, which unify the advantages of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, offers unprecedented opportunities for magnetoelectric coupling. However, electrically tuning altermagnets remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we demonstrate how this challenge can be overcome by using antiferroelectricity and ferroelectricity to modulate the spin splitting in altermagnets, employing a universal, symmetry-based design principle supported by an effective model. We introduce an unexplored class of multiferroics: antiferroelectric altermagnets (AFEAM), where antiferroelectricity and altermagnetism coexist in a single material. From first-principles calculations, we validate the feasibility of AFEAM in well-established van der Waals metal thio(seleno)phosphates and perovskite oxides. We reveal the design of AFEAM ranging from two-dimensional monolayers to three-dimensional bulk structures. Remarkably, even a weak electric field can effectively toggle spin polarization in the AFEAM by switching between antiferroelectric and ferroelectric states. Our findings not only enrich the understanding of magnetoelectric coupling but also pave the way for electrically controlled spintronic and multiferroic devices.</description>

      <title>On the Hidden Transient Interphase in Metal Anodes: Dynamic Precipitation Controls Electrochemical Interfaces in Batteries</title>

Abstract: The Solid-Electrolyte Interphase, SEI, formed on a battery electrode has been a central area of research for decades. This thin, complex layer profoundly impacts the electrochemical deposition morphology and stability of the metal in battery anodes. Departing from conventional approaches, we investigate metal dissolution, the reverse reaction of deposition, in battery environments using a state-of-the-art electroanalytical system combining a rotating-disk electrode and in-operando visualization. Our key finding is the presence of a Transient Solid-Electrolyte Interphase, T-SEI, that forms during fast discharging at high dissolution rates. We attribute T-SEI formation to transient local supersaturation and resultant electrolyte salt deposition. The T-SEI fundamentally alters the dissolution kinetics at the electrochemical interface, leading to a self-limiting morphological evolution and eventually yielding a flat, clean surface. Unlike a classical SEI formed due to electrolyte decomposition, the T-SEI is fully relaxable upon removal of the enforced dissolution current. The formation of T-SEI, surprisingly, plays a critical role in the subsequent electrodeposition. When the metal is redeposited on a fully relaxed T-SEI surface, the morphology is remarkably different from that deposited on pristine or low-rate discharged metal electrodes. Electron backscatter diffraction analysis suggests a homoepitaxial relationship with the original grains in the electrode. This is in stark contrast to the isolated, particulate nuclei seen on standard metal electrodes without T-SEI formation. Our findings provide important insights into the electrochemical kinetics at the metal-electrolyte interface, particularly in concentrated or water-in-salt electrolytes that are close to the salt saturation limit. The results suggest a new dimension for electrochemical engineering in batteries.</description>

      <title>Machine learning interatomic potential for the low-modulus Ti-Nb-Zr alloys in the vicinity of dynamical instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditionally, alloying and thermal treatment are considered as the main tools for design of new materials. Application of first-principles simulations can significantly accelerate the process of materials design, however, to account for both, multicomponent chemical disorder and finite temperature effects in theoretical simulations is a challenging task. In this work we have trained machine learning interatomic potential to effectively simulate finite temperature elastic properties of multicomponent \beta-Ti94-xNbxZr6 alloys. Our simulations predict the presence of the elinvar effect for the wide range of temperatures. Importantly, we predict that in a vicinity of dynamical and mechanical instability, the \beta-Ti94-xNbxZr6 alloys demonstrate strongly non-linear concentration-dependence of elastic moduli, which leads to low values of moduli comparable to that of human bone. Moreover, these alloys demonstrate a strong anisotropy of directional Young's modulus which can be helpful for microstructure tailoring and design of materials with desired elastic properties.</description>

      <title>Revisiting ab-initio excited state forces from many-body Green's function formalism: approximations and benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ab initio techniques for studying the optical and vibrational properties of materials are well-established, but only a few recent studies have focused on the interaction between excitons and atomic vibrations. In this paper, we revisit the excited state forces method, which integrates results from GW/BSE and DFPT calculations to determine the gradient of the excited state energy. We explore its technical aspects, including convergence and the quality of approximations used. We successfully apply this method to investigate self-trapped excitons in LiF. The excited state forces method provides valuable insights into ionic dynamics in the excited state and the microscopic mechanism of exciton self-trapping.</description>

      <title>Direct Summation of the Madelung Constant using Axial Multipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A direct summation method for the Madelung constant calculation is presented where a crystal lattice is constructed from linear arrays of charges or axial multipoles. An array is designed to have vanishing low order electric moments such that its potential at the origin from a distance $r$ decays at least as fast as $r^{-5}$, but preferably as fast as $r^{-13}$. High potential decay rates render the summation absolutely convergent in up to 6 dimensions. Convergence speed increases with higher decay rates. It is also shown that the limit approached by the summation is independent of the growth geometry. Madelung constants for NaCl bulk, surface, and edge lattice points are calculated, as well as on off-lattice points such as interstitial positions and external neighborhoods of surfaces. In addition, bulk CsCl Madelung constant was calculated. In 1D, 2D, and 3D, accuracy of 13 decimal places are attained within 40 nearest neighbor distance from the reference ion.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio theory of Electron-phonon-coupling-induced Giant Magnetic Moments of Chiral Phonons in Magnetic Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral phonons, characterized by nonzero angular momenta and magnetic moments, have attracted extensive attention. However, a long-standing critical issue in this field is the lack of ab initio methods to accurately calculate phonon magnetic moments resulting from electron-phonon coupling (EPC). Here, we resolve this challenge by developing an ab initio theory for calculating EPC-induced phonon magnetic properties, applicable to both insulating and metallic materials. Based on this theory, we demonstrate EPC-induced giant phonon magnetic moments and resulting phonon Zeeman splittings in magnetic metals, which are orders of magnitude larger than classical predictions from point-charge models. Interestingly, these splittings could open observable topological gaps in phonon spectra of magnets, generating intrinsic phonon Chern states. Through first-principles calculations, we first propose candidate materials with such intrinsic phonon Chern states hosting robust edge phonon currents which may be applied to detecting neutral particles such as dark matter particles. Our work not only establishes a theoretical foundation for EPC-induced phonon magnetic properties, but also enables the ab initio calculation of long-sought TRS-breaking phonon spectra throughout the Brillouin zone in realistic materials.</description>

      <title>Scaling in Kinetics of Supercooled Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present study introduces a renormalization based approach to investigate the relaxation dynamics within supercooled liquids. By applying a numerical scale transformation to potential energies along the temporal axis, we have established a novel framework that elucidates the underlying kinetics of supercooled liquids. Our findings indicate that the skewness of the potential energy distribution attains its maximum at a characteristic time scale, D, which exhibits a Curie like scaling relationship with temperature. This scaling relationship is characterized by an exponent, g, that experiences a discontinuous transition at a critical cooling rate, signifying a kinetic like phase transition.We further demonstrate that g maintains an approximate scaling relationship with the cooling rate, where the product of g and the logarithm of the cooling rate is approximately constant.This constant, however, varies depending on whether the cooling rate is above or below the critical value, effectively classifying supercooled liquids into two distinct categories: the glass transition as the destiny of supercooled liquid, GDL, and the crystallization as the destiny of supercooled liquid, CDL. Furthermore, we identify that Ts corresponds to the glass transition temperature for GDL and the crystallization temperature for CDL, respectively. We have successfully developed a theoretical model,which not only derives the Curie like power law but also provides profound insights into the physical implications of D, g and Ts. This research delineates the differences between GDL and CDL, and offers a fresh perspective for exploring the nature of glasses. The findings contribute to the broader understanding of the dynamics of supercooled liquids and the mechanisms of glass formation.</description>

      <title>Electrical Injection and Transport of Coherent Magnons in Non-Collinear Antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-collinear antiferromagnets (nAFMs) with a small net magnetic moment offer new opportunities for ultrafast spintronic devices, owing to unique physical properties. While in ferromagnets and collinear AFMs the spin current polarization is locked to the magnetization $\hat{\mathbf{m}}$ and N\'eel vector $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ directions, we predict that magnon spin currents injected by metal contacts into nAFMs can be polarized with both $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{m}}$ components when carried by a coherent superposition of magnon eigenstates. The spin injection efficiency is governed by an interface spin conductance tensor that depends on the non-collinear magnetic texture. While the $\hat{\mathbf{m}}$-component diffuses freely into the nAFM, the $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$-component oscillates as a function of distance from the injector and applied magnetic field, analogous to the Hanle effect of electron spins in metals. Our findings reveal the potential of nAFMs as platforms for the study of tensorial coherent spin transport.</description>

      <title>Effects of Strain Compensation on Electron Mobilities in InAs Quantum Wells Grown on InP(001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: InAs quantum wells (QWs) grown on InP substrates are interesting for their applications in devices with high spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and their potential role in creating topologically nontrivial hybrid heterostructures. These QWs rely on InGaAs cladding layers and InAlAs barrier layers to confine electrons within a thin InAs well. The highest mobility QWs are limited by interfacial roughness scattering and alloy disorder scattering in the cladding and buffer layers. Increasing QW thickness has been shown to reduce the effect of both of these scattering mechanisms. However, for current state-of-the-art devices with As-based cladding and barrier layers, the critical thickness is limited to $\leq7$ nm. In this report, we demonstrate the use of strain compensation techniques in the In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As cladding layers, grown on In$_{0.81}$Al$_{0.19}$As barrier layers, to extend the critical thickness well beyond this limit. We induce tensile strain in the InGaAs cladding layers by reducing the In concentration from In$_{0.81}$Ga$_{0.19}$As to In$_{0.70}$Ga$_{0.30}$As and we observe changes in both the critical thickness of the well and the maximum achievable mobility. The peak electron mobility at 2 K is $1.16\times10^6$ cm$^2/$Vs, with a carrier density of $4.2\times10^{11}$ /cm$^2$. Additionally, we study the quantum lifetime and Rashba spin splitting in the highest mobility device as these parameters are critical to determine if these structures can be used in topologically nontrivial devices.</description>

      <title>Low-density functionalized amorphous carbon nanofoam as binder-free Supercapacitor electrode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanoporous carbon materials containing small domains of sp2-carbon with highly disordered structures are promising for supercapacitor applications. Herein, we synthesize amorphous carbon nanofoam with 98% volumetric void fraction and low mass density of around 30 mg/cm3 by pulsed laser deposition at room temperature. With the unavoidable oxygen functional groups on the nanoporous surface, carbon nanofoam and nitrogen-functionalized carbon nanofoams are directly grown on the desired substrate under different background gases (Ar, N2, N2-H2), and employed as supercapacitor electrodes. Among the background gases used in synthesis, the use of nitrogen yields nanofoam with higher thickness and more N-content with higher graphitic-N. From the test of amorphous carbon nanofoam supercapacitor device, nitrogenated amorphous carbon electrode shows a higher areal capacitance of 4.1 mF/cm2 at 20 mV/s in aqueous electrolyte, a better capacitance retention at higher current, and excellent cycle stability (98%) over 10000 charge-discharge cycles are achieved compared to not-functionalized counterpart prepared under Ar background gas (2.7 mF/cm2 and cycle stability of 88%).</description>

      <title>Cubic Dirac Semimetals: General Theory and Application to Rare-Earth Magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetry exhibit unique topological properties. However, the origin of these behaviors remains presently unclear. Here, we develop minimal models for Dirac semimetals (DSMs) with accidental band crossings and higher-order topology in cubic systems, incorporating candidate magnetic order to analyze bulk, surface, and hinge state characteristics. In certain cubic-symmetric DSMs, we identify an effective Z2 chiral symmetry which significantly impacts surface and hinge-localized states. Our results highlight distinct features in surface state dispersions, Fermi arcs, polarization dependence, and band splitting that correlate with photoemission data in rare-earth monopnictides. We also suggest candidate materials and experimental tests for further validation. These findings advance our understanding of surface states in rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetries and illuminate the role of DSM physics in these systems.</description>

      <title>MoMa: A Modular Deep Learning Framework for Material Property Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods for material property prediction have been widely explored to advance materials discovery. However, the prevailing pre-train then fine-tune paradigm often fails to address the inherent diversity and disparity of material tasks. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MoMa, a Modular framework for Materials that first trains specialized modules across a wide range of tasks and then adaptively composes synergistic modules tailored to each downstream scenario. Evaluation across 17 datasets demonstrates the superiority of MoMa, with a substantial 14% average improvement over the strongest baseline. Few-shot and continual learning experiments further highlight MoMa's potential for real-world applications. Pioneering a new paradigm of modular material learning, MoMa will be open-sourced to foster broader community collaboration.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Permeability Time-varying Metamaterials at Microwave Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate magnetic permeability time-varying metamaterials at GHz frequencies using ferromagnetic permalloy (Ni80Fe20; Py). We observe frequency up and down conversion of 4 GHz microwaves through the metamaterials, which is caused by the temporal modulation of permeability in the Py layer. Moreover, the efficiency of the up-conversion to a higher frequency is much larger than that of the down conversion to a lower frequency. These experimental results are reproduced well via numerical calculation, verifying that the significant up-conversion efficiency is traced back to nonlinear magnetization dynamics in the metamaterials. The present study opens a door to microwave sources toward the 6th-generation mobile communication system, four-dimensional metamaterials with spatio-temporal modulation, and nonlinear spintronics.</description>
