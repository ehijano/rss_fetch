      <title>On Classical Prime Near-ring Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2005, M. Behboodi introduced the notion of a classical prime ring module, which he showed is, in general, nonequivalent to a (Dauns) prime ring module. In this paper, we extended the idea of classical primeness to near-ring module. However, unlike in the ring case, we were able to define and distinguish between various types of classical prime modules. We investigate four of them here. We also prove some properties about the annihilator. Finally we characterize the classical $m$-systems of $R$-ideals of near-ring modules.</description>

      <title>Free algebras, universal models and Bass modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the question of when free structures of infinite rank (in a variety) possess model-theoretic properties like categoricity in higher power, saturation, or universality. Concentrating on left $R$-modules we show, among other things, that the free module of infinite rank $R^{(\kappa)}$ embeds every $\kappa$-generated flat left $R$-module iff $R$ is left perfect. Using a Bass module corresponding to a descending chain of principal right ideals, we construct a model of the theory $T$ of $R^{(\kappa)}$ whose projectivity is equivalent to left perfectness, which allows to add a "stronger" equivalent condition: $R^{(\kappa)}$ embeds every $\kappa$-generated flat left $R$-module which is a model of $T$.
  In addition, we extend the model-theoretic construction of this Bass module to arbitrary descending chains of pp formulas, resulting in a `Bass theory' of pure-projective modules. We put this new theory to use by reproving an old result of Daniel Simson about pure-semisimple rings and Mittag-Leffler modules.</description>

      <title>On the existence of relative injective envelopes on ring extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f:S\rightarrow R$ be a ring extension. Then every $R$-module has an $(R,S)$-injective envelope, positively answering an open question provided by Guo [9].</description>

      <title>Menichetti's nonassociative $G$-crossed product algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct unital central nonassociative algebras over a field $F$ which have either an abelian Galois extensions $K/F$ or a central simple algebra over a separable extension of $F$ in their nucleus. We give conditions when these algebras are division algebras. Our constructions generalize algebras studied by Menichetti over finite fields. The algebras are examples of non-trivial semiassociative algebras and thus relevant for the semiassociative Brauer monoid recently defined by Blachar, Haile, Matzri, Rein, and Vishne. When ${\rm Gal}(K/F)=G$ the algebras of the first type can be viewed as nonassociative $G$-crossed product algebras.</description>

      <title>Near-integral fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We abstract the study of irreducible characters of finite groups vanishing on all but two conjugacy classes, initiated by S. Gagola, to irreducible characters of fusion rings whose kernel has maximal rank. These near-integral fusion rings include the near-groups which are currently one of the most abundant sources of novel examples of fusion categories to date. We generalize many of the known results on near-group fusion categories from the literature to near-integral fusion categories and characterize when such categories are braided. In particular, braided near-integral fusion categories describe all braided fusion categories which are almost symmetrically braided. This novel result allows a digestible characterization of the over $300$ braided equivalence classes of premodular fusion categories of rank $6$ or less.</description>

      <title>Partially wrapped Fukaya categories of orbifold surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a complete description of partially wrapped Fukaya categories of graded orbifold surfaces with stops. We show that a construction via global sections of a natural cosheaf of A$_\infty$ categories on a Lagrangian core of the surface is equivalent to a global construction via the (equivariant) orbit category of a smooth cover. We therefore establish the local-to-global properties of partially wrapped Fukaya categories of orbifold surfaces closely paralleling a proposal by Kontsevich for Fukaya categories of smooth Weinstein manifolds.
  From the viewpoint of Weinstein sectorial descent in the sense of Ganatra, Pardon and Shende, our results show that orbifold surfaces also have Weinstein sectors of type $\mathrm D$ besides the type $\mathrm A$ or type $\widetilde{\mathrm A}$ sectors on smooth surfaces.
  We describe the global sections of the cosheaf explicitly for any generator given by an admissible dissection of the orbifold surface and we give a full classification of the formal generators which arise in this way. This shows in particular that the partially wrapped Fukaya category of an orbifold surface can always be described as the perfect derived category of a graded associative algebra. We conjecture that associative algebras obtained from dissections of orbifold surfaces form a new class of associative algebras closed under derived equivalence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1812.04896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This expository paper focuses on free Lie $K$-algebras and the basic PBW theorem. We argue in various ways that the basic PBW theorem is a quite close consequence of the Magnus-Witt theorems concerning free Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Tropical adic spaces I: The continuous spectrum of a topological semiring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.15116v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Towards building tropical analogues of adic spaces, we study certain spaces of prime congruences as a topological semiring replacement for the space of continuous valuations on a topological ring. This requires building the theory of topological idempotent semirings, and we consider semirings of convergent power series as a primary example. We consider the semiring of convergent power series as a topological space by defining a metric on it. We check that, in tropical toric cases, the proposed objects carry meaningful geometric information. In particular, we show that the dimension behaves as expected. We give an explicit characterization of the points in terms of classical polyhedral geometry in a follow up paper.</description>
