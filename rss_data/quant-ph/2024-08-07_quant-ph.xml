      <title>Quantum Transfer Learning for MNIST Classification Using a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, we explore the integration of quantum computing with classical machine learning for image classification tasks, specifically focusing on the MNIST dataset. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical approach that leverages the strengths of both paradigms. The process begins with preprocessing the MNIST dataset, normalizing the pixel values, and reshaping the images into vectors. An autoencoder compresses these 784-dimensional vectors into a 64-dimensional latent space, effectively reducing the data's dimensionality while preserving essential features. These compressed features are then processed using a quantum circuit implemented on a 5-qubit system. The quantum circuit applies rotation gates based on the feature values, followed by Hadamard and CNOT gates to entangle the qubits, and measurements are taken to generate quantum outcomes. These outcomes serve as input for a classical neural network designed to classify the MNIST digits. The classical neural network comprises multiple dense layers with batch normalization and dropout to enhance generalization and performance. We evaluate the performance of this hybrid model and compare it with a purely classical approach. The experimental results indicate that while the hybrid model demonstrates the feasibility of integrating quantum computing with classical techniques, the accuracy of the final model, trained on quantum outcomes, is currently lower than the classical model trained on compressed features. This research highlights the potential of quantum computing in machine learning, though further optimization and advanced quantum algorithms are necessary to achieve superior performance.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-enhanced learning of quantum processes at scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning unknown processes affecting a quantum system reveals underlying physical mechanisms and enables suppression, mitigation, and correction of unwanted effects. Describing a general quantum process requires an exponentially large number of parameters. Measuring these parameters, when they are encoded in incompatible observables, is constrained by the uncertainty principle and requires exponentially many measurements. However, for Pauli channels, having access to an ideal quantum memory and entangling operations allows encoding parameters in commuting observables, thereby exponentially reducing measurement complexity. In practice, though, quantum memory and entangling operations are always noisy and introduce errors, making the advantage of using noisy quantum memory unclear. To address these challenges we introduce error-mitigated entanglement-enhanced learning and show, both theoretically and experimentally, that even with noise, there is a separation in efficiency between learning Pauli channels with and without entanglement with noisy quantum memory. We demonstrate our protocol's efficacy in examples including hypothesis testing with up to 64 qubits and learning inherent noise processes in a layer of parallel gates using up to 16 qubits on a superconducting quantum processor. Our protocol provides accurate and practical information about the process, with an overhead factor of $1.33 \pm 0.05$ per qubit, much smaller than the fundamental lower bound of 2 without entanglement with quantum memory. Our study demonstrates that entanglement with auxiliary noisy quantum memory combined with error mitigation considerably enhances the learning of quantum processes.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating anyonic non-Abelian statistics with a minimal $d = 6$ qudit lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum double models provide a natural framework for realising anyons by manipulating a lattice of qudits, which can be directly encoded in quantum simulators. In this work, we consider a lattice of $d=6$ qudits that give rise to $\mathbf{D}(\mathbf{S}_3)$ non-Abelian anyons. We present a method that demonstrates the non-commutativity of the braiding and fusion evolutions solely by utilising the operators that create and measure anyons. Furthermore, we provide a dense coding scheme where only two qudits are sufficient to determine the anyonic braiding and fusion matrices. The minimal resource requirement of our approach offers a viable blueprint for demonstrating the non-Abelian nature of anyons in various quantum platforms, including optical, atomic, and solid-state systems, where higher-spin states can be effectively encoded. This work represents a foundational step towards the realisation of non-Abelian quantum error-correcting codes.</description>

      <title>Effects of retardation on many-body superradiance in chiral waveguide QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the superradiant decay of a chain of atoms coupled to a chiral waveguide, focusing on the regime of non-negligible photon propagation time. Using an exact master equation description which accounts for delay effects, we obtain evidence to suggest that competition between collective decay and retardation leads to the emergence of an effective maximum number of atoms able to contribute to the superradiant dynamics, resulting in a plateau of the peak emission rate. To develop this analysis further, we investigate the inter-atomic correlations to find features consistent with the formation of individual superradiant domains. Moreover, we find that retardation can also result in persistent oscillatory atomic dynamics accompanied by a periodic sequence of emission bursts.</description>

      <title>Variable-strength non-local measurements reveal quantum violations of classical counting principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement a variant of the quantum pigeonhole paradox thought experiment to study whether classical counting principles survive in the quantum domain. We observe strong measurements significantly violate the pigeonhole principle (that among three pigeons in two holes, at least one pair must be in the same hole) and the sum rule (that the number of pigeon pairs in the same hole is the sum of the number of pairs across each of the holes) in an ensemble that is pre and postselected into particular separable states. To investigate whether measurement disturbance is a viable explanation for these counter-intuitive phenomena, we employ the first ever variable-strength measurement of a non-local observable. As we decrease the measurement strength, we find the violation of the sum rule decreases, yet the pigeonhole principle remains violated. In the weak limit, the sum rule is restored due to the cancellation between two weak values with equal and opposite imaginary parts. We observe the same kind of cancellation at higher measurement strengths, thus raising the question: do strong measurements have imaginary parts?</description>

      <title>Detecting Quantum and Classical Phase Transitions via Unsupervised Machine Learning of the Fisher Information Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of quantum and classical phase transitions in the absence of an order parameter is possible using the Fisher information metric (FIM), also known as fidelity susceptibility. Here, we propose and investigate an unsupervised machine learning (ML) task: estimating the FIM given limited samples from a multivariate probability distribution of measurements made throughout the phase diagram. We utilize an unsupervised ML method called ClassiFIM (developed in a companion paper) to solve this task and demonstrate its empirical effectiveness in detecting both quantum and classical phase transitions using a variety of spin and fermionic models, for which we generate several publicly available datasets with accompanying ground-truth FIM. We find that ClassiFIM reliably detects both topological (e.g., XXZ chain) and dynamical (e.g., metal-insulator transition in Hubbard model) quantum phase transitions. We perform a detailed quantitative comparison with prior unsupervised ML methods for detecting quantum phase transitions. We demonstrate that ClassiFIM is competitive with these prior methods in terms of appropriate accuracy metrics while requiring significantly less resource-intensive training data compared to the original formulation of the prior methods. In particular, ClassiFIM only requires classical (single-basis) measurements. As part of our methodology development, we prove several theorems connecting the classical and quantum fidelity susceptibilities through equalities or bounds. We also significantly expand the existence conditions of the fidelity susceptibility, e.g., by relaxing standard differentiability conditions. These results may be of independent interest to the mathematical physics community.</description>

      <title>A Study on Quantum Graph Neural Networks Applied to Molecular Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel architecture for Quantum Graph Neural Networks, which is significantly different from previous approaches found in the literature. The proposed approach produces similar outcomes with respect to previous models but with fewer parameters, resulting in an extremely interpretable architecture rooted in the underlying physics of the problem. The architectural novelties arise from three pivotal aspects. Firstly, we employ an embedding updating method that is analogous to classical Graph Neural Networks, therefore bridging the classical-quantum gap. Secondly, each layer is devoted to capturing interactions of distinct orders, aligning with the physical properties of the system. Lastly, we harness SWAP gates to emulate the problem's inherent symmetry, a novel strategy not found currently in the literature. The obtained results in the considered experiments are encouraging to lay the foundation for continued research in this field.</description>

      <title>MarQSim: Reconciling Determinism and Randomness in Compiler Optimization for Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulation, fundamental in quantum algorithm design, extends far beyond its foundational roots, powering diverse quantum computing applications. However, optimizing the compilation of quantum Hamiltonian simulation poses significant challenges. Existing approaches fall short in reconciling deterministic and randomized compilation, lack appropriate intermediate representations, and struggle to guarantee correctness. Addressing these challenges, we present MarQSim, a novel compilation framework. MarQSim leverages a Markov chain-based approach, encapsulated in the Hamiltonian Term Transition Graph, adeptly reconciling deterministic and randomized compilation benefits. We rigorously prove its algorithmic efficiency and correctness criteria. Furthermore, we formulate a Min-Cost Flow model that can tune transition matrices to enforce correctness while accommodating various optimization objectives. Experimental results demonstrate MarQSim's superiority in generating more efficient quantum circuits for simulating various quantum Hamiltonians while maintaining precision.</description>

      <title>Classical-quantum correspondence in the noise-based dissipative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the correspondence between classical noise and quantum environments. Although it has been known that the classical noise can be mapped to the quantum environments only for pure dephasing and infinite-temperature dissipation processes, we describe that this limitation can be circumvented by introducing auxiliary systems and conservation. Taking a two-level system as an example, we construct the so-called central spin model with its couplings fluctuating as the classical noise, and then acquire its statistical-average dynamics which captures the dissipations beyond the infinite temperature. By adjusting the number of the auxiliary systems and their initial states, the noise-based model reproduces both Markovian and non-Markovian evolutions. It is also found that different quantities of the two-level system are governed by different model parameters, indicating that the constructed model is an efficient simulator for specific observables, rather than an equivalent form of a realistic open system. In addition, the model is also applicable to investigate topical mechanisms of the open systems, e.g. negative temperatures and asymmetric equidistant quenches.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Quantum Control Gates for Functional MRI Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has emerged as a powerful tool for solving complex problems intractable for classical computers, particularly in popular fields such as cryptography, optimization, and neurocomputing. In this paper, we present a new quantum-based approach named the Hierarchical Quantum Control Gates (HQCG) method for efficient understanding of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. This approach includes two novel modules: the Local Quantum Control Gate (LQCG) and the Global Quantum Control Gate (GQCG), which are designed to extract local and global features of fMRI signals, respectively. Our method operates end-to-end on a quantum machine, leveraging quantum mechanics to learn patterns within extremely high-dimensional fMRI signals, such as 30,000 samples which is a challenge for classical computers. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms classical methods. Additionally, we found that the proposed quantum model is more stable and less prone to overfitting than the classical methods.</description>

      <title>A Predictive Approach for Selecting the Best Quantum Solver for an Optimization Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging quantum computers for optimization problems holds promise across various application domains. Nevertheless, utilizing respective quantum computing solvers requires describing the optimization problem according to the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formalism and selecting a proper solver for the application of interest with a reasonable setting. Both demand significant proficiency in quantum computing, QUBO formulation, and quantum solvers, a background that usually cannot be assumed by end users who are domain experts rather than quantum computing specialists. While tools aid in QUBO formulations, support for selecting the best-solving approach remains absent. This becomes even more challenging because selecting the best solver for a problem heavily depends on the problem itself. In this work, we are accepting this challenge and propose a predictive selection approach, which aids end users in this task. To this end, the solver selection task is first formulated as a classification task that is suitable to be solved by supervised machine learning. Based on that, we then propose strategies for adjusting solver parameters based on problem size and characteristics. Experimental evaluations, considering more than 500 different QUBO problems, confirm the benefits of the proposed solution. In fact, we show that in more than 70% of the cases, the best solver is selected, and in about 90% of the problems, a solver in the top two, i.e., the best or its closest suboptimum, is selected. This exploration proves the potential of machine learning in quantum solver selection and lays the foundations for its automation, broadening access to quantum optimization for a wider range of users.</description>

      <title>Maximum Quantum Non-Locality is not always Sufficient for Device-Independent Randomness Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The outcomes of local measurements on entangled quantum systems can be certified to be genuinely random through the violation of a Bell Inequality. The randomness of the outcomes with respect to an adversary is quantified by the guessing probability, conditioned upon the observation of a specific amount of Bell violation or upon the observation of the entire input-output behavior. It has been an open question whether standard device-independent randomness generation protocols against classical or quantum adversaries can be constructed on the basis of any arbitrary Bell inequality, i.e., does there exist a Bell inequality for which the guessing probability is one for any chosen input even upon observing the maximal violation of the inequality? A strengthened version of the question asks whether there exists a quantum behavior that exhibits maximum non-locality but zero certifiable randomness for any arbitrary input. In this paper, we present an affirmative answer to both questions by constructing families of $n$-player non-local games for $n \geq 2$ and families of non-local behaviors on the quantum boundary that do not allow to certify any randomness against a classical adversary. Our results show the existence of a form of bound randomness against classical adversaries, highlighting that device-independent randomness and quantum non-locality can be maximally inequivalent resources.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel, \textit{fully} quantum hash (FQH) function within the quantum walk on a cycle framework. We incorporate deterministic quantum computation with a single qubit to replace classical post-processing, thus increasing the inherent security. Further, our proposed hash function exhibits zero collision rate and high reliability. We further show that it provides $ &gt; 50\%$ avalanche on average, and is highly sensitive to the initial conditions. We show comparisons of several performance metrics for the proposed FQH with different settings as well as with existing protocols to prove its efficacy. FQH requires minimal quantum resources to produce a large hash value, providing security against the birthday attack. This innovative approach thus serves as an efficient hash function and lays the foundation for potential advancements in quantum cryptography by integrating the fully quantum hash generation protocol.</description>

      <title>NetQIR: An Extension of QIR for Distributed Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advance of quantum computing has highlighted the need for scalable and efficient software infrastructures to fully exploit its potential. While current quantum processors have significant scalability problems due to the limited number of qubits on each chip, distributed quantum computing offers a promising solution by networking multiple Quantum Processing Units (QPUs). To support this paradigm, robust Intermediate Representations (IRs) are crucial for translating high-level quantum algorithms into executable instructions across distributed systems. This paper introduces NetQIR, an extension of Microsoft's Quantum Intermediate Representation (QIR), specifically designed for distributed quantum computing. NetQIR is designed to meet the specific needs of distributed quantum systems by incorporating functions to manage quantum and classical communications between QPUs. The main objective is to facilitate the development of new distributed compilers by improving the integration and execution of quantum programmes in a distributed infrastructure, taking advantage of modular architectures to improve scalability. By extending QIR to support distributed quantum computing, NetQIR aims to complement and add capabilities to an already supported quantum IR and, at the same time, take advantage of the tools previously created for QIR. Throughout this paper the specification of the intermediate representation is introduced, including the basic instructions necessary to enable distributed quantum computing in an abstract form independent of the target machine.</description>

      <title>Microwave-optics entanglement via coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave-optics entanglement plays a crucial role in building hybrid quantum networks with quantum nodes working in the microwave and optical frequency bands. However, there are limited efficient ways to produce such entanglement due to the large frequency mismatch between the two regimes. Here, we present a new mechanism to prepare microwave-optics entanglement based on a hybrid system of two coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres, i.e., a YIG sphere and a silica sphere. The YIG sphere holds a magnon mode and a vibration mode induced by magnetostriction, while the silica sphere supports an optical whispering-gallery mode and a mechanical mode coupled via an optomechanical interaction. The two mechanical modes are close in frequency and directly coupled via physical contact of the two microspheres. We show that by simultaneously activating the magnomechanical (optomechanical) Stokes (anti-Stokes) scattering, stationary entanglement can be established between the magnon and optical modes via mechanics-mechanics coupling. This leads to stationary microwave-optics entanglement by further coupling the YIG sphere to a microwave cavity and utilizing the magnon-microwave state swapping. Our protocol is within reach of current technology and may become a promising new approach for preparing microwave-optics entanglement, which finds unique applications in hybrid quantum networks and quantum information processing with hybrid quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of quantum battery capacity under Markovian channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the quantum battery capacity for the Bell-diagonal states under Markovian channels on the first subsystem. We show that the capacity increases for special Bell-diagonal states under amplitude damping channel. The sudden death of the capacity occurs under depolarizing channel. We also investigate the capacity evolution of Bell-diagonal states under Markovian channels on the first subsystem $n$ times. It is shown that the capacity under depolarizing channel decreases initially, then increases for small $n$ and tend to zero for large $n$. We find that under bit flip channel and amplitude damping channel, the quantum battery capacity of special Bell-diagonal states tends to a constant for large $n$, namely, the frozen capacity occurs. The dynamics of the capacity of the Bell-diagonal states under two independent same type local Markovian channels is also studied.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian learning for 300 trapped ion qubits with long-range couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulators with hundreds of qubits and engineerable Hamiltonians have the potential to explore quantum many-body models that are intractable for classical computers. However, learning the simulated Hamiltonian, a prerequisite for any applications of a quantum simulator, remains an outstanding challenge due to the fast increasing time cost with the qubit number and the lack of high-fidelity universal gate operations in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. Here we demonstrate the Hamiltonian learning of a two-dimensional ion trap quantum simulator with 300 qubits. We employ global manipulations and single-qubit-resolved state detection to efficiently learn the all-to-all-coupled Ising model Hamiltonian, with the required quantum resources scaling at most linearly with the qubit number. Our work paves the way for wide applications of large-scale ion trap quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Mutual information fluctuations and non-stabilizerness in random circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of quantum technologies has brought much attention to the characterization of quantum resources as well as the classical simulatability of quantum processes. Quantum resources, as quantified by non-stabilizerness, have in one theoretical approach been linked to a family of entropic, monotonic functions. In this work, we demonstrate both analytically and numerically a simple relationship between non-stabilizerness and information scrambling using the fluctuations of an entropy-based quantifier. Specifically, we find that the non-stabilizerness generated by a random quantum circuit is proportional to fluctuations of mutual information. Furthermore, we explore the role of non-stabilizerness in measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions. We find that the fluctuations of mutual information decrease with increasing non-stabilizerness yielding potentially easier identification of the transition point. Our work establishes a key connection between quantum resource theory, information scrambling and measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Bottom-up Fabrication of 2D Rydberg Exciton Arrays in Cuprous Oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state platforms provide exceptional opportunities for advancing on-chip quantum technologies by enhancing interaction strengths through coupling, scalability, and robustness. Cuprous oxide ($\text{Cu}_{2}\text{O}$) has recently emerged as a promising medium for scalable quantum technology due to its high-lying Rydberg excitonic states, akin to those in hydrogen atoms. To harness these nonlinearities for quantum applications, the confinement dimensions must match the Rydberg blockade size, which can reach several microns in $\text{Cu}_{2}\text{O}$. Using a CMOS-compatible growth technique, this study demonstrates the bottom-up fabrication of site-selective arrays of $\text{Cu}_{2}\text{O}$ microparticles. We observed Rydberg excitons up to the principal quantum number $n$=5 within these $\text{Cu}_{2}\text{O}$ arrays on a quartz substrate and analyzed the spatial variation of their spectrum across the array, showing robustness and reproducibility on a large chip. These results lay the groundwork for the deterministic growth of $\text{Cu}_{2}\text{O}$ around photonic structures, enabling substantial light-matter interaction on integrated photonic platforms and paving the way for scalable, on-chip quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Principal Trotter Observation Error with Truncated Commutators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation is one of the most promising applications of quantum computers, and the product formula is one of the most important methods for this purpose. Previous related work has mainly focused on the worst$-$case or average$-$case scenarios. In this work, we consider the simulation error under a fixed observable. Under a fixed observable, errors that commute with this observable become less important. To illustrate this point, we define the observation error as the expectation under the observable and provide a commutativity$-$based upper bound using the Baker$-$Campbell$-$Hausdorff formula. For highly commuting observables, the simulation error indicated by this upper bound can be significantly compressed. In the experiment with the Heisenberg model, the observation bound compresses the Trotter number by nearly half compared to recent commutator bounds. Additionally, we found that the evolution sequence significantly affects the observation error. By utilizing a simulated annealing algorithm, we designed a sequence optimization algorithm, achieving further compression of the Trotter number. The experiment on the hydrogen molecule Hamiltonian demonstrates that optimizing the sequence can lead to nearly half the reduction in the Trotter number.</description>

      <title>Role of time-frequency correlations in two-photon-two-atom resonance energy transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitation energy transfer is a photophysical process upon which many chemical and biological phenomena are built. From natural small systems to synthetic multichromophoric macromolecules, energy transfer deals with the process of migration of electronic excitation energy from an excited donor to an acceptor. Although this phenomenon has been extensively studied in the past, the rapid evolution of quantum-enabled technologies has motivated the question on whether nonclassical sources of light, such as entangled photon pairs, may provide us with a better control (or enhancement) of energy transfer at the nanoscale. In this work, we provide a comprehensive study of the joint excitation of two non-interacting two-level atoms by time-frequency correlated photon pairs -- whose central frequencies are not resonant with the individual particles -- generated by means of spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC). We demonstrate that while strong frequency anti-correlation between photons guarantees a large two-photon excitation (TPE) probability, photons bearing a sine cardinal spectral shape exhibit a $\sim$3.8 times larger TPE signal than photons with a Gaussian spectrum. More importantly, we find that suppression of time-ordered excitation pathways does not substantially modify the TPE probability for two-photon states with a Gaussian spectral shape; whereas photons with a sine cardinal spectrum exhibit the strongest TPE signals when two-photon excitation pathways are not suppressed. Our results not only help elucidating the role of time-frequency correlations in resonance energy transfer with SPDC photons, but also provide valuable information regarding the optimal source to be used in its experimental implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We take advantage of the gravitational redshift experienced by a photon propagating in curved spacetime in order to construct a quantum Otto refrigeration cycle. Deriving a lower bound for the relative temperature between the cold and hot reservoirs at which the engine operates, we provide examples of refrigeration cycles in the presence of a uniform gravitational field as well as in the case of a gravitational field produced by a non-rotating spherically symmetric charged body, and the one obtained from the vacuum solution of Einstein's field equations in an expanding universe, as a function of the parameters which describe each spacetime.</description>

      <title>Correlation versus Dissipation in a Non-Hermitian Anderson Impurity Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the competition between strong correlations and dissipation in quantum impurity systems from the Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime by developing a slave-boson theory for a non-Hermitian Anderson impurity model with one-body loss. Notably, in the non-Hermitian Kondo regime, strong correlations qualitatively change the nature of dissipation through renormalization effects, where the effective one-body loss is suppressed and emergent many-body dissipation characterized by the complex-valued hybridization is generated. We unveil the mechanism of a dissipative quantum phase transition of the Kondo state on the basis of this renormalization effect, which counterintuitively enhances the lifetime of the impurity against loss. We also find a crossover from the non-Hermitian Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime dominated by one-body dissipation. Our results can be tested in a wide variety of setups such as quantum dots coupled to electronic leads and quantum point contacts in ultracold Fermi gases.</description>

      <title>A Gallery of Soft Modes: Theory and Experiment at a Ferromagnetic Quantum Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the low-energy excitations in the vicinity of the quantum critical point in LiHoF$_4$, a physical realization of the Transverse Field Ising Model, focusing on the long-range fluctuations which soften to zero energy at the ferromagnetic quantum phase transition. Microwave spectroscopy in tunable loop-gap resonator structures identifies and characterizes the soft mode and higher-energy electronuclear states. We study these modes as a function of frequency and magnetic fields applied transverse and parallel to the Ising axis. These are understood in the context of a theoretical model of a soft electronuclear mode that interacts with soft photons as well as soft phonons. We identify competing infrared divergences at the quantum critical point, coming from the photons and the electronuclear soft mode. It is an incomplete cancellation of these divergences that leads to the muted but distinct signatures observed in the experiments. The application of a longitudinal magnetic field gaps the soft mode. Measurements well away from the quantum critical point reveal a set of ``Walker'' modes associated with ferromagnetic domain dynamics.</description>

      <title>Large positive magnetoconductance in carbon nanoscrolls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate that carbon nanoscrolls -- spirally wrapped graphene layers with open endpoints -- can be characterized by a large positive magnetoconductance. We show that when a carbon nanoscroll is subject to an axial magnetic field of ~ 10T, the ballistic conductance at low carrier densities of the nanoscroll has an increase of about 200%. Importantly, we find that this positive magnetoconductance is not only preserved but can be even enhanced in the presence of on-site disorder. We prove that the positive magnetoconductance comes about the emergence of magnetic field-induced zero energy modes, specific of rolled-up geometries. Our results establish curved graphene systems as a new material platform displaying sizable magnetoresistive phenomena.</description>

      <title>Periodically poled thin-film lithium niobate ring Mach Zehnder coupling interferometer as an efficient quantum source of light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single photons and squeezed light are the two primary workhorses for quantum computation and quantum communication. Generating high-efficiency single photons with high purity and heralding efficiency is the prerequisite for photonic quantum computers. At the same time, generating high-efficiency scalable squeezed light is the prerequisite for continuous variable quantum computing along with sensing applications. Here, we propose a symmetric ring-Mach-Zehnder interferometer (RMZI), which includes a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide as an efficient source of squeezed light and a single-photon source. We numerically show that our proposed design can generate tunable squeezed light with a squeezing level higher than -12dB with sub-milli-watt (mW) pump power. The proposed device can also generate single photons with purity as high as 99(95)% with heralding efficiency 94(99)% using only 20ps long pulses. Our proposed design is fully compatible with current fabrication technology.</description>

      <title>Atom-Field-Medium Interactions I: Graded Influence Actions for $N$ Harmonic Atoms in a Dielectric-Altered Quantum Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This series of papers has two broader aims: 1) Construct a theory for multi-partite open quantum systems comprising several layers of structure with self-consistent back-actions. Develop the graded influence action formalism \cite{BehHu10,BH11} to account for the influences of successive sub-layers on the dynamics of the variables of interest. 2) Apply these methods to the study of atom-field-medium interactions and highlight their merits over conventional methods. We consider a system of $N$ harmonic oscillators, modeling the internal degrees of freedom (idf) of $N$ neutral atoms (A), interacting with a quantum field (F), scalar here, for simplicity, altered by the presence of a dielectric medium (M). In this paper we use the coarse-grained and stochastic effective actions in the influence functional formalism to derive the stochastic equations for the reduced density matrices of the dynamical variables in the successive layers of structure. The word `graded' refers to the specific ordering of the coarse-graining procedures. Three layers of coarse-graining are performed, firstly, integrating over the common bath of the dielectric oscillators results not only in the appearance of necessary dissipative properties of the dielectric but also essential nuanced features such as nonMarkovian spatial correlations in the dielectric. Secondly, integrating over the medium variables as a whole results in a dielectric-modified quantum field, the influence of the medium on the quantum field manifesting through a frequency-dependent permittivity function. Finally, integrating over this dielectric-altered quantum field which interacts with the idfs of the atoms yields an influence action. From it we obtain the stochastic equation of motion which describes the nonequilibrium stochastic dynamics of the idf of the atoms interacting with a dielectric medium-modified quantum field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel scheme for modelling quantum plasmas in the warm dense matter (WDM) regime via a hybrid smoothed particle hydrodynamic - molecular dynamic treatment, here referred to as 'Bohm SPH'. This treatment is founded upon Bohm's interpretation of quantum mechanics for partially degenerate fluids, does not apply the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, and is computationally tractable, capable of modelling dynamics over ionic timescales at electronic time resolution. Bohm SPH is also capable of modelling non-Gaussian electron wavefunctions. We present an overview of our methodology, validation tests of the single particle case including the hydrogen 1s wavefunction, and comparisons to simulations of a warm dense hydrogen system performed with wave packet molecular dynamics.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Transition due to particle losses in a monitored fermionic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been interest in the dynamics of monitored quantum systems using linear jump operators related to the creation or annihilation of particles. Here we study the dynamics of the entanglement entropy under quantum jumps that induce local particle losses in a model of free fermions with hopping and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ pairing. We explore the different steady-state entanglement regimes by interpolating between monitored free fermions with U(1) symmetry and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fermions. In the absence of pairing, the U(1) symmetric model approaches the vacuum at long times, with the entanglement entropy showing non-monotonic behavior over time that we capture with a phenomenological quasiparticle ansatz. In this regime, quantum jumps play a key role, and we highlight this by exactly computing their waiting-time distribution. On the other hand, the interplay between losses and pairing in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ case gives rise to quantum trajectories with entangled steady-states. We show that by tuning the several system parameters, a measurement-induced entanglement transition occurs where the entanglement entropy scaling changes from logarithmic to area-law. We compare this transition with the one derived in the no-click limit and observe qualitative agreement in most of the phase diagram. Furthermore, the statistics of entanglement gain and loss are analyzed to better understand the impact of the linear jump operators.</description>

      <title>Energy change and Landauer's principle in the interaction between qubit and quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a general description of the system evolution under the interaction between qubit and quantum field theory up to the second order perturbation, which is also referred to as the simplified model of light-matter interaction. The results are classified into rotating and counter-rotating wave terms, the former corresponding to stimulated absorption and emission, and the latter to Unruh and inverse Unruh effects. We obtain not only the reduced density matrix of the qubit, but also the backreaction obtained by quantum field theory as the environment. The result shows that the energy variation of the quantum field theory is related to trajectory and the initial state of the qubit, the expectation values of the linear and quadratic field operators, and the temporal order product operator. When the qubit is in accelerated motion, the conventional Unruh effect causes the vacuum state to possess a "temperature", which raises some doubts about the validity of Landauer's principle. We prove that Landauer's principle still holds for any state of motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots with confined electron or hole spins show promise for quantum information processing as they allow for efficient electric field-driven qubit manipulation. However, their susceptibility to electric noise poses a challenge that may hinder the effectiveness of these qubits. Here, we explore the impact of electric noise on a planar double quantum dot (DQD) spin qubit under the influence of AC gates applied to the dot levels, focusing on the flopping-mode spin qubit with spin-orbit interaction. We employ a rotating wave approximation within a time-dependent effective Hamiltonian to derive analytic expressions for the Rabi frequency of spin qubit oscillations with a single electron or hole in a DQD. We find that driving the qubit off-resonantly effectively mitigates the influence of charge noise, leading to a manifestation of a dynamic sweet spot. The proposed mode of operation notably improves the fidelity of quantum gates, particularly within specific ranges of drive parameters and detuning during qubit manipulation. Furthermore, our study unveils the potential of inducing a second-order dynamic sweet spot, a phenomenon tunable by drive and DQD parameters. Understanding the importance of driving qubits off-resonantly is essential for developing high-coherence planar DQD spin qubits, both for electrons in silicon and holes in germanium.</description>

      <title>Dissipation Driven Coherent Dynamics Observed in Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>

Abstract: We report the first experimental observation of dissipation-driven coherent quantum many-body oscillation, and this oscillation is manifested as the coherent exchange of atoms between the thermal and the condensate components in a three-dimensional partially condensed Bose gas. Firstly, we observe that the dissipation leads to two different atom loss rates between the thermal and the condensate components, such that the thermal fraction increases as dissipation time increases. Therefore, this dissipation process serves as a tool to uniformly ramp up the system's temperature without introducing extra density excitation. Subsequently, a coherent pair exchange of atoms between the thermal and the condensate components occurs, resulting in coherent oscillation of atom numbers in both components. This oscillation, permanently embedded in the atom loss process, is revealed clearly when we inset a duration of dissipation-free evolution into the entire dynamics, manifested as an oscillation of total atom number at the end. Finally, we also present a theoretical calculation to support this physical mechanism, which simultaneously includes dissipation, interaction, finite temperature, and harmonic trap effects. Our work introduces a highly controllable dissipation as a new tool to control quantum many-body dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We derive exact, universal, closed-form quantum Monte Carlo estimators for finite temperature energy susceptibility and fidelity susceptibility for essentially arbitrary Hamiltonians. We demonstrate how our method can be used to study quantum phase transitions without knowledge of an order parameter and without the need to design system-specific ergodic quantum Monte Carlo update rules by applying it to a class of random models.</description>

Abstract: A random access code (RAC), corresponding to a communication primitive with various applications in quantum information theory, is an instance of a preparation-and-measurement scenario. In this work, we consider (n,d)-RACs constituting an "n"-length string, constructed from a "d" size set of letters, and send an encoding of the string in a single d-level physical system and present their quantum advantages. We first characterize optimal classical RACs, proving that the well-known classical strategy known as majority-encoding-identity-decoding is indeed optimal. We then construct a quantum protocol by exploiting only two incompatible measurements, the minimal requirement, and show the advantages beyond the classical one. We also discuss the generality of our results and whether quantum advantages are valid for all types of (n, d)-&gt;1 RACs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.13644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A model with two entangled spin-3/2 particles based on geometry of dodecahedron was suggested by Roger Penrose for formulation of analogue of Bell theorem "without probabilities." The model was later reformulated using so-called Witting configuration with 40 rays in 4D Hilbert space. However, such reformulation needs for some subtleties related with entanglement of two such configurations essential for consideration of non-locality and some other questions. Two entangled systems with quantum states described by Witting configurations are discussed in presented work. Duplication of points with respect to vertices of dodecahedron produces rather significant increase with number of symmetries in 25920/60=432 times. Quantum circuits model is a natural language for description of operations with different states and measurements of such systems.</description>

Abstract: Classical-quantum hybrid algorithms have recently garnered significant attention, which are characterized by combining quantum and classical computing protocols to obtain readout from quantum circuits of interest. Recent progress due to Lubasch et al in a 2019 paper provides readout for solutions to the Schrodinger and Inviscid Burgers equations, by making use of a new variational quantum algorithm (VQA) which determines the ground state of a cost function expressed with a superposition of expectation values and variational parameters. In the following, we analyze additional computational prospects in which the VQA can reliably produce solutions to other PDEs that are comparable to solutions that have been previously realized classically, which are characterized with noiseless quantum simulations. To determine the range of nonlinearities that the algorithm can process for other IVPs, we study several PDEs, first beginning with the Navier-Stokes equations and progressing to other equations underlying physical phenomena ranging from electromagnetism, gravitation, and wave propagation, from simulations of the Einstein, Boussniesq-type, Lin-Tsien, Camassa-Holm, Drinfeld-Sokolov-Wilson (DSW), and Hunter-Saxton equations. To formulate optimization routines that the VQA undergoes for numerical approximations of solutions that are obtained as readout from quantum circuits, cost functions corresponding to each PDE are provided in the supplementary section after which simulations results from hundreds of ZGR-QFT ansatzae are generated.</description>

      <title>Parallel compression algorithm for fast preparation of defect-free atom arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Defect-free atom arrays have emerged as a powerful and versatile platform for quantum sciences and technologies, offering high programmability and promising scalability. The arrays can be prepared by rearranging atoms from a partially loaded initial array to the designated target sites. However, achieving large defect-free arrays presents challenges due to atom loss during rearrangement and the vacuum-limited lifetime which is inversely proportional to the array size. Efficient rearrangement algorithms which minimize time cost and atom loss are crucial for successful atom rearrangement. Here we propose a novel parallel compression algorithm which leverages multiple mobile tweezers to transfer atoms simultaneously. The total time cost could be reduced to scale linearly with the number of target sites. This algorithm can be readily implemented in current experimental setups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17268v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we introduce the concept of classical input - quantum output (C-Q) non-signalling boxes, a generalisation of the classical input - classical output (C-C) non-signalling boxes. We argue that studying such objects leads to a better understanding of the relation between quantum nonlocality and non-locality beyond quantum mechanics. The main issue discussed in the paper is whether there exist 'genuine' C-Q boxes or all C-Q boxes can be built from objects already known, namely C-C boxes acting on pre-shared entangled quantum particles. We show that large classes of C-Q boxes are non-genuine. In particular, we show that all bi-partite C-Q boxes with outputs that are pure states are non-genuine. We also present various strategies for addressing the general problem, i.e. for multi-partite C-Q boxes which output mixed states, whose answer is still open. Finally, we show that even some very simple non-genuine C-Q boxes require large amounts of C-C nonlocal correlations in order to simulate them.</description>

      <title>First Passage Times for Continuous Quantum Measurement Currents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07810v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The First Passage Time (FPT) is the time taken for a stochastic process to reach a desired threshold. In this letter we address the FPT of the stochastic measurement current in the case of continuously measured quantum systems. Our approach is based on a charge-resolved master equation, which is related to the Full-Counting statistics of charge detection. In the quantum jump unravelling this takes the form of a coupled system of master equations, while for quantum diffusion it becomes a type of quantum Fokker-Planck equation. In both cases, we show that the FPT can be obtained by introducing absorbing boundary conditions, making their computation extremely efficient {and analytically tractable}. The versatility of our framework is demonstrated with two relevant examples. First, we show how our method can be used to study the tightness of recently proposed kinetic uncertainty relations (KURs) for quantum jumps, which place bounds on the signal-to-noise ratio of the FPT. Second, we study the usage of qubits as threshold detectors for Rabi pulses, and show how our method can be employed to maximize the detection probability while, at the same time, minimize the occurrence of false positives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06763v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the applicability of hybrid quantum-classical heuristics for practical railway rescheduling management problems. We build an integer linear model for the given problem and solve it with D-Wave's quantum-classical hybrid solver as well as with CPLEX for comparison. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a real-life heterogeneous urban network in Poland, including both single- and multi-track segments and covers all the requirements posed by the operator of the network. The computational results demonstrate the readiness for application and benefits of quantum-classical hybrid solvers in the realistic railway scenario: they yield acceptable solutions on time, which is a critical requirement in a rescheduling situation. At the same time, the solutions that were obtained were feasible. Moreover, though they are probabilistic (heuristics) they offer a valid alternative by returning a range of possible solutions the dispatcher can choose from. And, most importantly, they outperform classical solvers in some cases.</description>

      <title>Circuit-to-Hamiltonian from tensor networks and fault tolerance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a map from an arbitrary quantum circuit to a local Hamiltonian whose ground state encodes the quantum computation. All previous maps relied on the Feynman-Kitaev construction, which introduces an ancillary `clock register' to track the computational steps. Our construction, on the other hand, relies on injective tensor networks with associated parent Hamiltonians, avoiding the introduction of a clock register. This comes at the cost of the ground state containing only a noisy version of the quantum computation, with independent stochastic noise. We can remedy this - making our construction robust - by using quantum fault tolerance. In addition to the stochastic noise, we show that any state with energy density exponentially small in the circuit depth encodes a noisy version of the quantum computation with adversarial noise. We also show that any `combinatorial state' with energy density polynomially small in depth encodes the quantum computation with adversarial noise. This serves as evidence that any state with energy density polynomially small in depth has a similar property. As applications, we give a new proof of the QMA-completeness of the local Hamiltonian problem (with logarithmic locality) and show that contracting injective tensor networks to additive error is BQP-hard. We also discuss the implication of our construction to the quantum PCP conjecture, combining with an observation that QMA verification can be done in logarithmic depth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze optimal, and approximately optimal, quantum strategies for a variety of non-local XOR games. Building upon previous arguments due to Ostrev in 2016, which characterized approximately optimal, and optimal, strategies that players Alice and Bob can adopt for maximizing a linear functional to win non-local games after a Referee party examines each answer to a question drawn from some probability distribution, we identify additional applications of the framework for analyzing the performance of a broader class of quantum strategies in which it is possible for Alice and Bob to realize quantum advantage if the two players adopt strategies relying upon quantum entanglement, two-dimensional resource systems, and reversible transformations. For the Fortnow-Feige-Lovasz (FFL) game, the 2016 framework is directly applicable, which consists of five steps, including: (1) constructing a suitable, nonzero, linear transformation for the intertwining operations, (2) demonstrating that the operator has unit Frobenius norm, (3) constructing error bounds, and corresponding approximate operations, for $\big( A_k \otimes \textbf{I} \big) \ket{\psi}$, and $\big( \textbf{I} \otimes \big( \frac{\pm B_{kl} + B_{lk}}{\sqrt{2}} \big) \big) \ket{\psi}$, (4) constructing additional bounds for permuting the order in which $A^{j_i}_i$ operators are applied, (5) obtaining Frobenius norm upper bounds for Alice and Bob's strategies. We draw the attention of the reader to applications of this framework in other games with less regular structure.</description>

Abstract: Our study demonstrates successful error mitigation of indistinguishability-related noise in a quantum photonic processor through the application of the zero-noise extrapolation technique. By measuring observable values at different error levels, we were able to extrapolate towards a noise-free regime. We examined the impact of partial distinguishability of photons in a two-qubit processor implementing the variational quantum eigensolver for a Schwinger Hamiltonian. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of the extrapolation technique in mitigating indistinguishability-related noise and improving the accuracy of Hamiltonian eigenvalue estimation.</description>

Abstract: We implement a five-qubit protocol in IBM quantum processors to study entanglement dynamics in a two qubit system in the presence of a simulated environment. Specifically, two qubits represent the main system, while another two qubits serve as the environment. Additionally, we employ an auxiliary qubit to estimate the quantum entanglement. Specifically, we observe the sudden death and sudden birth of entanglement for different inital conditions that were simultaneously implemented on the IBM 127-qubit quantum processor \textit{ibm$\_$brisbane}. We obtain the quantum entanglement evolution of the main system qubits and the environment qubits averaging over $N=10$ independent experiments in the same quantum device. Our experimental data shows the entanglement and disentanglement signatures in system and enviroment qubits, where the noisy nature of current quantum processors produce a shift on times signaling sudden death or sudden birth of entanglement. This work takes relevance showing the usefulness of current noisy quantum devices to test fundamental concepts in quantum information.</description>

Abstract: Quantum many-body systems undergoing phase transitions have been proposed as probes enabling beyond-classical enhancement of sensing precision. However, this enhancement is usually limited to a very narrow region around the critical point. Here, we systematically develop a modular approach for introducing multiple phase transitions in a many-body system. This naturally allows us to enlarge the region of quantum-enhanced precision by encompassing the newly created phase boundaries. Our approach is general and can be applied to both symmetry-breaking and topological quantum sensors. In symmetry-breaking sensors, we show that the newly created critical points inherit the original universality class and a simple total magnetization measurement already suffices to locate them. In topological sensors, our modular construction creates multiple bands which leads to a rich phase diagram. In both cases, Heisenberg scaling for Hamiltonian parameter estimation is achieved at all the phase boundaries. This can be exploited to create a global sensor which significantly outperforms a uniform probe.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing is a growing field with significant potential applications. Learning how to code quantum programs means understanding how qubits work and learning to use quantum gates. This is analogous to creating classical algorithms using logic gates and bits. Even after learning all concepts, it is difficult to create new algorithms, which hinders the acceptance of quantum programming by most developers. This article outlines the need for higher-level abstractions and proposes some of them in a developer-friendly programming language called Rhyme. The new quantum types are extensions of classical types, including bits, integers, floats, characters, arrays, and strings. We show how to use such types with code snippets.</description>

Abstract: We present a quantum circuit model which emulates the interface growth of the classical raise-and-peel model. Our model consists of Clifford unitary gates interspersed with projective measurements, applied according to prescribed feedback rules. We numerically find via large-scale simulations that, depending on the feedback rules, the system may undergo several measurement-induced entanglement transitions, including continuous transitions within a universality class not previously observed in hybrid random Clifford systems as well as a first-order transition.</description>

Abstract: Light-harvesting via the transport and trapping of optically-induced electronic excitations is of fundamental interest to the design of new energy efficient quantum technologies. Using a paradigmatic quantum optical model, we study the influence of coherence, entanglement, and cooperative dissipation on the transport and capture of excitation energy. In particular, we demonstrate that the rate of energy extraction is optimized under conditions that minimize the quantum coherence and entanglement of the system. We show that this finding is not limited to disordered or high temperature systems but is instead a fundamental consequence of spontaneous parity time-reversal symmetry breaking associated with the quantum-to-classical transition. We then examine the effects of vibrational fluctuations, revealing a strong dephasing assisted transport enhancement for delocalized excitations in the presence of cooperative interactions. Our results highlight the rich, emergent behavior associated with decoherence and may be relevant to the study of biological photosynthetic antenna complexes or to the design of room-temperature quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the open challenges in quantum computing is to find meaningful and practical methods to leverage quantum computation to accelerate classical machine learning workflows. A ubiquitous problem in machine learning workflows is sampling from probability distributions that we only have access to via their log probability. To this end, we extend the well-known Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to leverage quantum computation in a hybrid manner as a proposal function. Our new algorithm, Quantum Dynamical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (QD-HMC), replaces the classical symplectic integration proposal step with simulations of quantum-coherent continuous-space dynamics on digital or analogue quantum computers. We show that QD-HMC maintains key characteristics of HMC, such as maintaining the detailed balanced condition with momentum inversion, while also having the potential for polynomial speedups over its classical counterpart in certain scenarios. As sampling is a core subroutine in many forms of probabilistic inference, and MCMC in continuously-parameterized spaces covers a large-class of potential applications, this work widens the areas of applicability of quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Evaluating radiation impact on transmon qubits in above and underground facilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits can be sensitive to abrupt energy deposits caused by cosmic rays and ambient radioactivity. Previous studies have focused on understanding possible correlated effects over time and distance due to cosmic rays. In this study, for the first time, we directly compare the response of a transmon qubit measured initially at the Fermilab SQMS above-ground facilities and then at the deep underground Gran Sasso Laboratory (INFN-LNGS, Italy). We observe same average qubit lifetime T$_1$ of roughly 80 microseconds at above and underground facilities. We then apply a fast decay detection protocol and investigate the time structure, sensitivity and relative rates of triggered events due to radiation versus intrinsic noise, comparing above and underground performance of several high-coherence qubits. Using gamma sources of variable activity we calibrate the response of the qubit to different levels of radiation in an environment with minimal background radiation. Results indicate that qubits respond to a strong gamma source and it is possible to detect particle impacts. However, when comparing above and underground results, we do not observe a difference in radiation induced-like events for these sapphire and niobium-based transmon qubits. We conclude that the majority of these events are not radiation related and to be attributed to other noise sources which by far dominate single qubit errors in modern transmon qubits.</description>

Abstract: In this brief report, we discuss the characteristics of B$^{\alpha}$ gates. We provide the conditions for the two-qubit gates generated by two applications of a B$^{\alpha}$ gate. We propose an experimental scheme to implement B$^{\alpha}$ gates in ion-trap system. In this scheme, we assume that only a single vibrational mode contributes to spin-spin coupling. This scheme is an extension of a recently proposed scheme to realize XY-type interaction in ion-trap system. With the successful implementation of this scheme, B$^{\alpha}$ gates can be used for doing quantum computation in ion-trap quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the realm weak force sensing, an important issue is to suppress fundamental noise (quantum noise and thermal noise), as they limit the accuracy of force measurement. In this paper, we investigate a weak force sensing scheme that combines a degenerate optical parametric amplifier (OPA) and an auxiliary mechanical oscillator into a cavity optomechanical system to reduce quantum noise. We demonstrate that the noise reduction of two coupled oscillators depends on their norm mode splitting. and provide a classic analogy and quantum perspective for further clarification. Besides, the noise reduction mechanism of OPA is to reduce the fluctuation of photon number and enhance the squeezing of the cavity field. We propose a specific design aimed at enhancing the joint effect of both, beyond what can be achieved using OPA alone or two series coupled oscillators. This scheme provides a new perspective for deeper understanding of cavity field squeezing and auxiliary oscillator in force sensing.</description>

Abstract: Quantum noise and thermal noise are the two primary sources of noise that limit the sensitivity of weak magnetic field sensing. Although quantum noise has been widely addressed, effectively reducing thermal noise remains challenging in detecting weak magnetic fields. We employ an anisotropic elliptical YIG sphere as a magnetic field probe to establish a parametric amplification interaction of magnons and induce magnon squeezing effects. These effects can effectively suppress thermal noise in the magnon mode and amplify weak magnetic field signals from external sources. Specifically, complete suppression of thermal noise can be achieved by placing the YIG sphere in a squeezed vacuum reservoir. Our scheme has the potential to inspire advancements in thermal noise suppression for quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Local ergotropy and its fluctuations across a dissipative quantum phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a two-qubit open Rabi model, focusing on local ergotropy - the maximum extractable work by acting solely on the two qubits - within a parameter regime where a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless dissipative phase transition occurs. First, we aim to define a protocol for charging, storing, and discharging the two-qubit system, interpreted as the working principle of an open quantum battery. Second, we examine the impact of the phase transition on ergotropy and identify potential markers. To achieve these goals, we construct an ad-hoc charging unitary operator, leveraging our knowledge of the ground state near the transition to bring it into a decoherence-free state during storage. Using advanced numerical techniques based on matrix product state representation, we reveal that high couplings to an external bath approximately double the local ergotropy immediately post-charging. Over time we observe oscillatory behaviors in ergotropy and its fluctuations, which undergo significant changes near the transition, signaling its occurrence. Furthermore, we optimize local ergotropy over time using a physically inspired ansatz, enabling continuous work extraction (local ergotropy never reaches zero). Our work proposes a tunable, experimentally realizable protocol for work extraction, leveraging decoherence-free states and phase transitions. Additionally, it sheds light on the complex interaction between ergotropy and quantum phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: Local quantum annealing (LQA), an iterative algorithm, is designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems. It draws inspiration from QA, which utilizes adiabatic time evolution to determine the global minimum of a given objective function. In the original LQA, the classical Hamiltonian is minimized via gradient descent. The performance of LQA depends on the choice of the parameters. Owing to the non-convex nature of the original cost function, LQA often becomes trapped in local minima, limiting its effectiveness. To address this challenge, we combine LQA with a deep unfolding scheme, which enables us to tune the parameters from the training data via back-propagation. Our findings demonstrate that deep unfolded LQA outperforms the original LQA, exhibiting remarkable convergence speed and performance improvement. As the trained parameters can be generalized to unknown instances and different system sizes, our results have significant practical implications and provide valuable insights for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced topological quantum phase transitions in multi-gap Euler semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of disorder in systems having a non-trivial Euler class. As these recently proposed multi-gap topological phases come about by braiding non-Abelian charged band nodes residing between different bands to induce stable pairs within isolated band subspaces, novel properties may be expected. Namely, a~modified stability and critical phases under the unbraiding to metals can arise, when the disorder preserves the underlying $C_2\cal{T}$ or $\cal{P}\cal{T}$ symmetry on average. Employing elaborate numerical computations, we verify the robustness of associated topology by evaluating the changes in the average densities of states and conductivities for different types of disorders. Upon performing a scaling analysis around the corresponding quantum critical points we retrieve a universality for the localization length exponent of $\nu = 1.4 \pm 0.1$ for Euler-protected phases, relating to two-dimensional percolation models. We generically find that quenched disorder drives Euler semimetals into critical metallic phases. Finally, we show that magnetic disorder can also induce topological transitions to quantum anomalous Hall plaquettes with local Chern numbers determined by the initial value of the Euler invariant.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, a quantum variant of chess is introduced, which can be played on a traditional board without the need of using computers or other electronic devices. The rules of the game arise naturally by combining the rules of conventional chess with key quantum-physical effects such as superposition and entanglement. Niel's Chess is recommended for ages 10 and above, to everyone who wishes to play a creative game with historical roots and at the same time gain intuition about the foundational quantum effects that power cutting-edge technologies like quantum computing and quantum communication, which are poised to revolutionise our society in the coming decades.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15404v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding thermodynamical measurement noise is of central importance for electrical and optical precision measurements from mass-fabricated semiconductor sensors, where the Brownian motion of charge carriers poses limits, to optical reference cavities for atomic clocks or gravitational wave detection, which are limited by thermorefractive and thermoelastic noise due to the transduction of temperature fluctuations to the refractive index and length fluctuations. Here, we discover that unexpectedly charge carrier density fluctuations give rise to a novel noise process in recently emerged electro-optic photonic integrated circuits. We show that Lithium Niobate and Lithium Tantalate photonic integrated microresonators exhibit an unexpected Flicker type (i.e. $1/f^{1.2}$) scaling in their noise properties, significantly deviating from the well-established thermorefractive noise theory. We show that this noise is consistent with thermodynamical charge noise, which leads to electrical field fluctuations that are transduced via the strong Pockels effects of electro-optic materials. Our results establish electrical Johnson-Nyquist noise as the fundamental limitation for Pockels integrated photonics, crucial for determining performance limits for both classical and quantum devices, ranging from ultra-fast tunable and low-noise lasers, Pockels soliton microcombs, to quantum transduction, squeezed light or entangled photon-pair generation. Equally, this observation offers optical methods to probe mesoscopic charge fluctuations with exceptional precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10037v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a stabilizer code model with a qutrit at every edge on a square lattice and with non-invertible plaquette operators. The degeneracy of the ground state is topological as in the toric code, and it also has the usual deconfined excitations consisting of pairs of electric and magnetic charges. However, there are novel types of confined fractonic excitations composed of a cluster of adjacent faces with vanishing flux. They manifest confinement, and even larger configurations of these fractons are fully immobile although they acquire emergent internal degrees of freedom. Deconfined excitations change their nature in presence of these fractonic defects. As for instance, fractonic defects can absorb magnetic charges making magnetic monopoles exist while electric charges acquire restricted mobility. Furthermore, some generalized symmetries can annihilate any ground state and also the full sector of fully mobile excitations. All these properties can be captured via a novel type of \textit{non-commutative} and \textit{non-Abelian} fusion category in which the product is associative but does not commute, and can be expressed as a sum of (operator) equivalence classes. Generalized non-invertible symmetries give rise to the feature that the fusion products form a non-unital category without a proper identity. We show that a variant of this model features a deconfined fracton liquid phase and a phase where the dual (magnetic) strings have condensed.</description>

      <title>Generalized Black Hole Entropy is von Neumann Entropy</title>

Abstract: It was recently shown that the von Neumann algebras of observables dressed to the mass of a Schwarzschild-AdS black hole or an observer in de Sitter are Type II, and thus admit well-defined traces. The von Neumann entropies of "semi-classical" states were found to be generalized entropies. However, these arguments relied on the existence of an equilibrium (KMS) state and thus do not apply to, e.g., black holes formed from gravitational collapse, Kerr black holes, or black holes in asymptotically de Sitter space. In this paper, we present a general framework for obtaining the algebra of dressed observables for linear fields on any spacetime with a Killing horizon. We prove, assuming the existence of a stationary (but not necessarily KMS) state and suitable decay of solutions, a structure theorem that the algebra of dressed observables always contains a Type II factor "localized" on the horizon. These assumptions have been rigorously proven in most cases of interest. Applied to the algebra in the exterior of an asymptotically flat Kerr black hole, where the fields are dressed to the black hole mass and angular momentum, we find a product of a Type II$_{\infty}$ algebra on the horizon and a Type I$_{\infty}$ algebra at past null infinity. In Schwarzschild-de Sitter, despite the fact that we introduce an observer, the quantum field observables are dressed to the perturbed areas of the black hole and cosmological horizons and is the product of Type II$_{\infty}$ algebras on each horizon. In all cases, the von Neumann entropy for semiclassical states is given by the generalized entropy. Our results suggest that in all cases where there exists another "boundary structure" (e.g., an asymptotic boundary or another Killing horizon) the algebra of observables is Type II$_{\infty}$ and in the absence of such structures (e.g., de Sitter) the algebra is Type II$_{1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12107v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show, via explicit computation on a constrained bosonic model, that the presence of subsystem symmetries can lead to a quantum phase transition (QPT) where the critical point exhibits an emergent enhanced symmetry. Such a transition separates a unique gapped ground state from a gapless one; the latter phase exhibits a broken $Z_2$ symmetry which we tie to the presence of the subsystem symmetries in the model. The intermediate critical point separating these phases exhibits an additional emergent $Z_2$ symmetry which we identify; this emergence leads to a critical theory in the Ashkin-Teller, instead of the expected Ising, universality class. We show that the transitions of the model reproduces the Askhin-Teller critical line with variable correlation length exponent $\nu$ but constant central charge $c$. We verify this scenario via explicit exact-diagonalization computations, provide an effective Landau-Ginzburg theory for such a transition, and discuss the connection of our model to the PXP model describing Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

Abstract: We outline a general formalism for treating vacuum polarization phenomena within an effective field expansion. The coupling between source charges and virtual fields is examined from the perspectives of electrostatic potentials, induced charge densities and form factors in momentum space. A strategy for the efficient calculation of vacuum polarization potentials is outlined, implemented, and applied towards the construction of fitting potentials that are suitable for molecular electronic structure calculations, which enclose no overall charge by construction. The order $\alpha(Z \alpha)$, $\alpha (Z \alpha)^{3}$ and $\alpha^{2}(Z\alpha)$ effects of a Gaussian nuclear charge on the electron-positron field are applied variationally towards the E119F molecule, as well as the order $\alpha(Z \alpha)$ effects arising from the virtual muon and charged pion fields.</description>

      <title>Vacuum polarization in molecules I: Uehling interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiative corrections to electronic structure are characterized by perturbative expansions in $\alpha$ and $Z\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant and $Z$ is the nuclear charge. A formulation of the leading-order $\alpha(Z\alpha)$ Uehling contribution to the renormalized vacuum polarization is reported in a form that is convenient for implementation in computational studies of the relativistic electronic structures of molecules. Benchmark calculations based on these methods are reported that include the leading-order vacuum polarization effects within relativistic mean-field methods for the E119$^+$ ion and the closed-shell diatomic species E119F.</description>

      <title>A Novel Generalisation of Supersymmetry: Quantum $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-Oscillators and their `superisation'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a very simple toy model of a $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-supersymmetric quantum system and show, via Klein's construction, how to understand the system as being an $N=2$ supersymmetric system with an extra $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-grading. That is, the commutation/anticommutation rules are defined via the standard boson/fermion rules, but the system still has an underlying $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-grading that needs to be taken into account.</description>

      <title>Commensurate supersolids and re-entrant transitions in an extended Bose-Hubbard ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ground state phases of an extended Bose-Hubbard ladder of unit filling via the density-matrix-renormalization-group method and, in particular, the effect of rung-hoppings. In contrast to a single-chain, a commensurate supersolid emerges, and based on the Luttinger parameter, we classify them into two types. The latter leads to a reentrant gapless behavior as the onsite interaction is increased while keeping all other parameters intact. A reentrant gapped transition is also found as a function of nearest-neighbor interactions. Further, we show that the string order characterizing the Haldane phase vanishes for a finite inter-chain hopping amplitude, however small it is. Finally, we propose two experimental platforms to observe our findings, using either dipolar atoms or polar molecules and Rydberg admixed atoms.</description>

      <title>Low energy excitations in bosonic quantum quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21230v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first principles construction of the low-energy effective action for bosonic self-organized quantum quasicrystals. Our generalized elasticity approach retains the appropriate number of phase- and corresponding conjugate density- degrees-of-freedom required for a proper description of the Goldstone modes. For the dodecagonal and decagonal quasicrystal structures we obtain collective longitudinal and transversal excitations with an isotropic speed of sound. Meanwhile, for the octagonal structure, the coupling between phononic and phasonic degrees of freedom leads in turn to hybridization of the latter with the condensate sound mode, producing collective excitations with a longitudinal and transversal component, and an anisotropic speed of sound. Finally, we discuss the fate of each excitation mode at the low and high density phase transitions limiting the quantum quasicrystal phase.</description>
