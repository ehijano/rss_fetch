      <title>Social Laser Theory as a Natural Extension of Quantum-Like Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive review of the Social Laser Theory (SLT) as a natural extension of the broader framework of Quantum-Like Modeling (QLM). While QLM applies the mathematical formalism of quantum theory . such as Hilbert space representations, interference, and non-commutative observables - to model context-dependent and non-classical phenomena in cognition, decision-making, and social behavior, SLT advances this approach by integrating concepts from quantum field theory. The theory conceptualizes social systems as ensembles of social atoms capable of absorbing and emitting quantized units of social energy. Under conditions analogous to population inversion in physical lasers, external informational stimuli (e.g., media signals or mobilizing rhetoric) can trigger coherence across the population, resulting in large-scale, synchronized collective actions such as protests or ideological shifts. SLT thus provides a formal framework for understanding the amplification and coherence of social energy leading to abrupt phase-like transitions in collective behavior. Beyond its metaphorical appeal, the theory proposes measurable quantities and predictive parameters that may support empirical diagnostics of sociopolitical dynamics. By bridging micro-level psychological processes with macro-level sociological phenomena, SLT extends QLM into the domain of complex social systems, offering a mathematically grounded paradigm for interpreting rapid transformations in contemporary societies.</description>

      <title>The Probability of Vacuum Metastability and Artificial Vacuum Decay: Expert Survey Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vacuum decay posits that the universe's apparent vacuum is metastable and could transition to a lower-energy state. According to current physics models, if such a transition occurred in any location, a region of "true vacuum" would propagate outward at near light speed, destroying the accessible universe as we know it by deeply altering the effective physical laws. Understanding whether advanced technology could potentially trigger such a transition has implications for existential risk assessment and the long-term trajectory of technological civilizations. We present results from what we believe to be the first structured survey of physics experts (n = 20) regarding both the theoretical possibility of vacuum decay and its potential technological inducibility. The average responded probability that our vacuum is metastable was 45.6%, with an average estimated 18.8% probability that arbitrarily advanced technology could induce vacuum decay if our vacuum is metastable. However, the survey revealed substantial disagreement among respondents on both whether the vacuum is metastable, and, if it is, whether vacuum decay could be artificially induced with arbitrarily advanced technology. According to participants, resolving these questions primarily depends on developing theories that go beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Among respondents who considered vacuum decay theoretically possible, it was generally expected that artificial induction would pose significant technological challenges even for a civilization with galactic resources.</description>

      <title>The Neuroticism Paradox: How Emotional Instability Fuels Collective Feelings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective emotions shape organizations, communities, and societies, yet the traits that determine who drives them remain unknown. Conventional wisdom holds that stable, extraverted individuals act as emotional leaders, calming and coordinating the feelings of others. Here we challenge this view by analyzing a 30.5-month longitudinal dataset of daily emotions from 38 co-located professionals (733,534 records). Using Granger-causality network reconstruction, we find that emotionally unstable individuals -- those high in neuroticism (r = 0.478, p = 0.002) and low in conscientiousness (r = -0.512, p = 0.001) -- are the true "emotional super-spreaders," while extraversion shows no effect (r = 0.238, p = 0.150). This "Neuroticism Paradox" reveals that emotional volatility, not stability, drives contagion. Emotions propagate with a reproduction rate (R_0 = 15.58) comparable to measles, yet the system avoids collapse through high clustering (C = 0.705) that creates "emotional quarantine zones." Emotional variance increased 22.9% over time, contradicting homeostasis theories and revealing entropy-driven dynamics. We propose an Affective Epidemiology framework showing that collective emotions are governed by network position and volatility rather than personality stability -- transforming how we understand emotional leadership in human systems.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium phase transition and cultural drift in the continuous-trait Axelrod model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard Axelrod model of cultural dissemination, based on discrete cultural traits, exhibits a non-equilibrium phase transition but is inherently limited by its inability to continuously probe the critical behavior. We address this limitation by introducing a generalized Axelrod model utilizing continuous cultural traits confined to the interval $[0,1]$, and a similarity threshold, $d$, that serves as a continuous control parameter representing cultural tolerance. This framework allows for a robust analysis of the model's critical properties and its dynamics under cultural drift (copying noise). For the perfect copying scenario, we precisely locate the critical threshold $d_c$, which separates the disordered (fragmented) and ordered (polarized) phases. Through Finite-Size Scaling, we find that the mean domain density vanishes continuously at $d_c$ with the exponent $\beta = 1/3$. Simultaneously, the largest domain fraction displays a surprising discontinuous jump at $d_c$. We find that the finite size effects in the critical region are governed by the exponent $\nu=2$ for both the continuous and discontinuous transitions. Under imperfect copying, persistent noise introduces a powerful selective pressure on the trait space, leading to the emergence of two symmetry-related attractors at the trait values $d$ and $1-d$. However, these noise-induced attractors prove fragile in the thermodynamic limit, becoming unstable at large lattice sizes, which directly accounts for the observed failure of the dynamics to freeze under sustained cultural drift. This suggests that in large, continuously evolving societies, true cultural convergence is highly unlikely, leading instead to sustained fragmentation and nonstationary dynamics where cultural domains never fully stabilize.</description>

      <title>Predictability of Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of complex systems has attracted widespread attention from researchers in the fields of natural sciences, social sciences, and engineering. Prediction is one of the central issues in this field. Although most related studies have focused on prediction methods, research on the predictability of complex systems has received increasing attention across disciplines--aiming to provide theories and tools to address a key question: What are the limits of prediction accuracy? Predictability itself can serve as an important feature for characterizing complex systems, and accurate estimation of predictability can provide a benchmark for the study of prediction algorithms. This allows researchers to clearly identify the gap between current prediction accuracy and theoretical limits, thereby helping them determine whether there is still significant room to improve existing algorithms. More importantly, investigating predictability often requires the development of new theories and methods, which can further inspire the design of more effective algorithms. Over the past few decades, this field has undergone significant evolution. In particular, the rapid development of data science has introduced a wealth of data-driven approaches for understanding and quantifying predictability. This review summarizes representative achievements, integrating both data-driven and mechanistic perspectives. After a brief introduction to the significance of the topic in focus, we will explore three core aspects: the predictability of time series, the predictability of network structures, and the predictability of dynamical processes. Finally, we will provide extensive application examples across various fields and outline open challenges for future research.</description>

      <title>Mastering Uncertainty: From Understanding to Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty defines our age: it shapes climate, finance, technology, and society, yet remains profoundly misunderstood. We oscillate between the illusion of control and the paralysis of fatalism. This paper reframes uncertainty not as randomness but as ignorance: a product of poor models, institutional blindness, and cognitive bias. Drawing on insights from physics, complex systems, and decades of empirical research, I show that much of what appears unpredictable reveals structure near transitions, where feedbacks, critical thresholds, and early-warning signals emerge. Across domains from financial crises to industrial disasters, uncertainty is amplified less by nature than by human behavior and organizational failure. To master it, prediction must shift from prophecy to diagnosis, identifying precursors of instability rather than forecasting exact outcomes. I propose a framework of dynamic foresight grounded in adaptive leadership, transparent communication, and systemic learning. Mastering uncertainty thus means transforming fear into foresight and building institutions that navigate, rather than deny, the complexity of change.</description>

      <title>FlexBSS: A flexible multi-objective framework for bike-sharing station optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bike-sharing systems (BSS) are key components of urban mobility, promoting active travel and complementing public transport. This paper presents a flexible, data-driven framework for optimizing BSS station placement. Existing methods usually focus on a single planning objective, such as maximizing demand, or on a fixed set of two or three objectives, such as combining demand and social equity. This restricts their adaptability to evolving priorities and diverse contexts. Moreover, they often aggregate candidate sites into coarse spatial units and neglect features such as topography or directed cycling networks. The framework addresses these limitations through four components: (i) a multi-criteria decision-making model that evaluates candidate sites using configurable spatial factors and adjustable weights, thereby enabling planners to represent any combination of planning objectives rather than being limited to a fixed set; (ii) network-level metrics that explicitly balance station proximity and system-wide accessibility on directed bicycle networks; (iii) slope-adjusted distances that account for uphill effort and downhill facilitation; and (iv) a genetic algorithm that generates feasible station sets while respecting minimum-distance constraints. A case study in Barcelona demonstrates its application using open data for scenarios focused on demand, multimodal integration, and social equity. Results show that network-level metrics reshape the spatial arrangement of stations while keeping the same planning objectives, slope-adjusted distances improve station availability in hilly districts, and an expansion scenario in lEixample district produces coherent layouts complementing existing stations. By integrating spatial factors and network representation, the framework provides a versatile decision-support tool for BSS planning in complex urban environments.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Condorcet's Jury Theorem to Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize Condorcet's jury theorem (CJT) to socially connected populations in which agents revise discrete choices on a network in the presence of zealots. Free agents receive privately informative signals about the correct alternative and, at each update, either retain their state or imitate a uniformly chosen neighbor (free or zealot). For finite networks, we derive closed-form stationary laws for vote counts, and we characterize the corresponding vote-share limits as the number of free voters tends to infinity. For majority rule -- both in binary and multi-alternative settings -- we obtain an exact accuracy limit in closed form via the regularized incomplete beta function. For plurality rule, we establish sharp closed-form lower bounds on accuracy, expressed in terms of regularized incomplete beta functions. Under an absolute-majority condition for the correct alternative, both majority and plurality accuracies strictly exceed the accuracy of any single voter, showing that informative signals, coupled through social interaction, are amplified at the group level. These results extend CJT beyond independence and provide closed-form accuracy benchmarks for networked decision systems in social, biological, and engineered settings.</description>

      <title>Defining the urban "local" with low dimensional manifolds of human mobility networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban science has largely relied on universal models, rendering the heterogeneous and locally specific nature of cities effectively invisible. Here we introduce a topological framework that defines and detects localities in human mobility networks. We empirically demonstrate that these human mobility network localities are rigorous geometric entities that map directly to geographic localities, revealing that human mobility networks lie on manifolds of dimension &lt;=5. This representation provides a compact theoretical foundation for spatial embedding and enables efficient applications to facility location and propagation modeling. Our approach reconciles local heterogeneity with universal representation, offering a new pathway toward a more comprehensive urban science.</description>

      <title>Exploring the impact of multi-agent wealth exchange model on inequality reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary kinetic exchange models, where money is shuffled between two agents at a time, reproduce the Boltzmann Gibbs exponential wealth distribution but cannot address the multi party trades common in real markets. We generalize the exchange rule to simultaneous interactions among more than two agents in a closed economical system. We observe, as number of agents grow, the stationary wealth distribution evolves smoothly from an exponential to an almost uniform distribution. Inequality metrics (Gini and k index) has been found to fall monotonically with the increase in agents number. Compared with binary models that rely on saving propensities, which is also known to reduce inequality, we find the multi agent interaction show a completely different behavior of inequality reduction.</description>

      <title>Are penalty shootouts better than a coin toss? Evidence from European football</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Penalty shootouts play an important role in the knockout stage of major football tournaments, especially since the 2021/22 season, when the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) scrapped the away goals rule in its club competitions. Inspired by this rule change, our paper examines whether the outcome of a penalty shootout can be predicted in UEFA club competitions. Based on all shootouts between 2000 and 2025, we find no evidence for the effect of the kicking order, the field of the match, and psychological momentum. In contrast to previous results, stronger teams, defined first by Elo ratings, do not perform better than their weaker opponents. Consequently, penalty shootouts are equivalent to a perfect lottery in top European football.</description>

      <title>The Marked Edge Walk: A Novel MCMC Algorithm for Sampling of Graph Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have enabled the generation of large ensembles of redistricting plans through graph partitioning. However, existing algorithms such as Reversible Recombination (RevReCom) and Metropolized Forest Recombination (MFR) are constrained to sampling from distributions related to spanning trees. We introduce the marked edge walk (MEW), a novel MCMC algorithm for sampling from the space of graph partitions under a tunable distribution. The walk operates on the space of spanning trees with marked edges, allowing for calculable transition probabilities for use in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Empirical results on real-world dual graphs show convergence under target distributions unrelated to spanning trees. For this reason, MEW represents an advancement in flexible ensemble generation.</description>

      <title>Eigenvector Localization and Universal Regime Transitions in Multiplex Networks: A Perturbative Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the transition between layer-localized and delocalized regimes in a general contact-based contagion model on multiplex networks. Using the inverse participation ratio, we characterize how activity shifts from being confined to a single layer to spreading across the entire system. Through a first-order perturbative analysis of the leading eigenvector of the supra-contact probability matrix, we derive an analytical expression for the fictive coupling $p^*$ that marks the crossover between the two regimes. This result reproduces and explains previously observed numerical scalings and extends them to a broad class of contact-based processes beyond the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible model. We also obtain an analytical expression for the IPR of the non-dominant layer in the localized regime, confirming its power-law dependence on the coupling with exponent $\alpha=4$. Finally, we study the transition between non-dominant and dominant layers as a function of the intra-layer activity parameter $\gamma$. Our analytical findings are supported by dynamical simulations that highlight distinct susceptibility patterns across regimes. Altogether, this work provides a unified spectral framework for understanding localization and dominance transitions in multiplex contagion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Connected components in networks with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of defining connected components in hypergraphs, which are models for systems with higher-order interactions. For graphs with dyadic interactions, connected components are defined in terms of paths connecting nodes along the graph. However, defining connected components in hypergraphs is a more involved problem, as one needs to consider the higher-order nature of the interactions associated with the hyperedge. Higher-order interactions can be taken into consideration through a logic associated with the hyperedges, two examples being OR-logic and AND-logic; these logical operations can be considered two limiting cases corresponding to non-cooperative and fully cooperative interactions, respectively. In this paper we show how connected components can be defined in hypergraphs with OR or AND logic. While OR-logic and AND-logic provide the same connected components for nondirected hypergraphs, for directed hypergraphs the strongly connected component of AND-logic is a subset of the OR-logic strongly connected component. Interestingly, higher-order interactions change the general topological properties of connected components in directed hypergraphs. Notably, while for directed graphs the strongly connected component is the intersection of its in- and out-component, in hypergraphs with AND-logic the intersection of in- and out-component does not equal the strongly connected component. We develop a theory for the fraction of nodes that are part of the largest connected component and through comparison with real-world data we show that degree-cardinality correlations play a significant role.</description>

      <title>Mapping the interaction between science and misinformation in COVID-19 tweets</title>

Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, scientific knowledge evolved rapidly, accompanied by a surge of misinformation, labelled an infodemic by the WHO. In this context, we study the interaction between science and misinformation on Twitter (now X) using a database of ~407M COVID-19-related tweets. We classify URL reliability with Media Bias/Fact Check and used Altmetric data to identify scientific publications. We find that among ~1.2M users who shared science, 45% also shared unreliable content. Scientific papers circulated by these users were more often preprints, slightly more likely to be retracted, less cited, and published in lower-impact journals. Our findings indicate misinformation is not driven by a lack of exposure to science but instead raise critical questions about open science practices, particularly the role of preprints in amplifying misleading narratives. Our results underscore the importance of proactive scientific engagement on social media in countering misinformation and reinforcing trust in science during global crises.</description>

      <title>From Spatial to Spectral: Network Renormalization via Dynamical Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08893v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network renormalization has traditionally relied on spatial adjacency-grouping nearby nodes together, but this approach fails to capture the dynamical correlations that govern system-wide behavior in scale-free networks. We present a spectral-space renormalization framework that enables coarse-graining based on dynamical coherence rather than geometric proximity. Within this framework, diffusion processes naturally constitute renormalization transformations in spectral space, yielding scaling relations that connect network dimensions with critical exponents. Building on this foundation, we develop a meta-graph reconstruction algorithm that systematically maps spectral information back into explicit topology while preserving dynamical correlations. The resulting renormalized networks uncover organizational structures that remain invisible to adjacency-based methods, including long-range correlations between structurally distant nodes that reflect coherent dynamical responses. Applications to Internet topologies, yeast regulatory networks, and European power grids demonstrate the broad applicability of this framework. The algorithm consistently extracts fractal, spectral, and random-walk dimensions with theoretical consistency across diverse systems. In power grids, it further reveals hidden failure pathways, exposing transcontinental correlations that match documented cascade patterns. In Internet networks, it reveals multiscaling behavior as the topology evolves over time. By shifting network renormalization from spatial geometry to dynamical flow, this work provides a unified foundation for understanding how information, energy, and failures propagate through complex systems, with direct implications for infrastructure resilience and network vulnerability assessment.</description>

      <title>Economic thermodynamics and inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a computational and theoretical framework inspired by thermodynamic principles to analyze the dynamics of economic inflation within adiabatic and non-adiabatic systems. In a framework referred to as developmental symmetry, inflation is formulated as a scalar field evolving through continuity equations, drawing an analogy with the Raychaudhuri equation in gravitational dynamics. The results show that adiabatic systems fail to reach equilibrium, while non-adiabatic systems can evolve toward stable states over time. The model successfully reproduces observed inflationary regimes-from hyperinflation to stable low-inflation phases-with characteristic transition periods of about a decade. These results indicate that production continuity and controlled monetary flow are crucial for achieving stability in complex economic systems, linking thermodynamic balance to macroeconomic equilibrium.</description>

      <title>(Anti)Gravitron: A Statistical Physics Perspective on Multidimensional Metrics of Polarizing Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for measuring multidimensional inequality based on a statistical physics reinterpretation of centrifugal and centripetal forces in rotating systems. Inspired by the mechanics of the Gravitron and extended via the conceptual AntiGravitron, this study proposes a new class of inequality metrics grounded in multivariate mixtures of Beta distributions. These composite metrics capture three key structural dimensions of polarizing inequality: the number and balance of population clusters (modal entropy), the internal uniformity of each cluster (concentration), and the separation between clusters in attribute space (geometric divergence). Monte Carlo simulations of the AntiGravitron show how bifurcation, stratification, and polarization jointly influence inequality measurements due to multidimensional attraction-repulsion forces. An empirical application of the AntiGravitron to US household income data reveals polarized inequality driven by intersecting centripetal and centrifugal socio-economic forces affecting Black and African American populations in the Philadelphia County. By bridging physical systems theory and social stratification analysis, this paper offers a rigorous, flexible, and interpretable metric that enhances the understanding of polarizing inequality in high-dimensional, structurally heterogeneous contexts. The AntiGravitron framework holds promise for small-area estimation of polarization-driven inequality in socio-economics and biomedicine domains such as epidemiology, where inequality arises from multi-axial exclusion and attractor dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Emergent Behaviors in Agent-Based Models using Mean Information Gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emergent behaviors are a defining feature of complex systems, yet their quantitative characterization remains an open challenge, as traditional classifications rely mainly on visual inspection of spatio-temporal patterns. In this Letter, we propose using the Mean Information Gain (MIG) as a metric to quantify emergence in Agent-Based Models. The MIG is a conditional entropy-based metric that quantifies the lack of information about other elements in a structure given certain known properties. We apply it to a multi-agent biased random walk that reproduces Wolfram's four behavioral classes and show that MIG differentiates these behaviors. This metric reconnects the analysis of emergent behaviors with the classical notions of order, disorder, and entropy, thereby enabling the quantitative classification of regimes as convergent, periodic, complex, and chaotic. This approach overcomes the ambiguity of qualitative inspection near regime boundaries, particularly in large systems, and provides a compact, extensible framework for identifying and comparing emergent behaviors in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Network analysis reveals news press landscape and asymmetric user polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlike traditional media, online news platforms allow users to consume content that suits their tastes and to facilitate interactions with other people. However, as more personalized consumption of information and interaction with like-minded users increase, ideological bias can inadvertently increase and contribute to the formation of echo chambers, reinforcing the polarization of opinions. Although the structural characteristics of polarization among different ideological groups in online spaces have been extensively studied, research into how these groups emotionally interact with each other has not been as thoroughly explored. From this perspective, we investigate both structural and affective polarization between news media user groups on Naver News, South Korea's largest online news portal, during the period of 2022 Korean presidential election. By utilizing the dataset comprising 333,014 articles and over 36 million user comments, we uncover two distinct groups of users characterized by opposing political leanings and reveal significant bias and polarization among them. Additionally, we reveal the existence of echo chambers within co-commenting networks and investigate the asymmetric affective interaction patterns between the two polarized groups. Classification task of news media articles based on the distinct comment response patterns support the notion that different political groups may employ distinct communication strategies. Our approach based on network analysis on large-scale comment dataset offers novel insights into characteristics of user polarization in the online news platforms and the nuanced interaction nature between user groups.</description>

      <title>Participatory design: A systematic review and insights for future practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Participatory Design -- an iterative, flexible design process that uses the close involvement of stakeholders, most often end users -- is growing in use across design disciplines. As an increasing number of practitioners turn to Participatory Design (PD), it has become less rigidly defined, with stakeholders engaged to varying degrees through the use of disjointed techniques. This ambiguous understanding can be counterproductive when discussing PD processes. Our findings synthesize key decisions and approaches from design peers that can support others in engaging in PD practice. We investigated how scholars report the use of Participatory Design in the field through a systematic literature review. We found that a majority of PD literature examined specific case studies of PD (53 of 88 articles), with the design of intangible systems representing the most common design context (61 of 88 articles). Stakeholders most often participated throughout multiple stages of a design process (65 of 88 articles), recruited in a variety of ways and engaged in several of the 14 specific participatory techniques identified. This systematic review provides today's practitioners synthesized learnings from past Participatory Design processes to inform and improve future use of PD, attempting to remedy inequitable design by engaging directly with stakeholders and users.</description>

      <title>Evolving interdisciplinary contributions to global societal challenges: A 50-year overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Addressing global societal challenges necessitates insights and expertise that transcend the boundaries of individual disciplines. In recent decades, interdisciplinary collaboration has been recognised as a vital driver of innovation and effective problem-solving, with the potential to profoundly influence policy and practice worldwide. However, quantitative evidence remains limited regarding how cross-disciplinary efforts contribute to societal challenges, as well as the evolving roles and relevance of specific disciplines in addressing these issues. To fill this gap, this study examines the long-term evolution of interdisciplinary contributions to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), drawing on extensive bibliometric data from OpenAlex. By analysing publication and citation trends across 19 research fields from 1970 to 2022, we reveal how the relative presence of different disciplines in addressing particular SDGs has shifted over time. Our results also provide unique evidence of the increasing interconnection between fields since the 2000s, coinciding with the United Nations' initiative to tackle global societal challenges through interdisciplinary efforts. These insights will benefit policymakers and practitioners as they reflect on past progress and plan for future action, particularly with the SDG target deadline approaching in the next five years.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Dimensionality of Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou High-Dimensional Trajectories Through Manifold Learning: A Linear Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02058v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A data-driven approach based on unsupervised machine learning is proposed to infer the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ of the high-dimensional trajectories of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) model. Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. By estimating the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ using multiple methods (participation ratio, Kaiser rule, and the Kneedle algorithm), it is found that $m^{\ast}$ increases with the model nonlinearity. Interestingly, in the weakly nonlinear regime, for trajectories initialized by exciting the first mode, the participation ratio estimates $m^{\ast} = 2, 3$, strongly suggesting that quasi-periodic motion on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold underlies the characteristic energy recurrences observed in the FPUT model.</description>
