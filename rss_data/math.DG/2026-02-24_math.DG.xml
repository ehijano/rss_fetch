      <title>Parametrizations of minimal timelike surfaces in the four-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean space of index two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct representation formulas for local null curves in the four-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean space of index two and derive corresponding parametrizations for local minimal timelike surfaces without integration. As a special case of the representation formula, we construct a representation formula for local null curves in the three-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean space of index one that involves integration. Our results provide examples of minimal timelike surfaces.</description>

      <title>Smooth relative connections on quiver bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of smooth relative connections over the real path algebra $\mathbb{R}Q$ on smooth twisted quiver bundles. We give obstructions to the existence of a smooth relative connection on twisted quiver bundles. For tree-type quiver bundles, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a smooth relative connection. Additionally, we provide a framework for the representation theory of flat quiver bundles, relating the existence of flat relative connections to the underlying quiver representations.</description>

      <title>High codimension mean curvature flow of spacelike-convex submanifolds with one spacelike codimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the pseudo-Euclidean space $\R^{n+1,k}$, we consider the mean curvature flow %$F: \S^n \times [0, T) \to \R^{n+1,k}$ of $n$-dimensional spacelike submanifolds with spacelike codimension one and arbitrary timelike codimension $k$. We show that if the initial submanifold is compact and \emph{spacelike-convex} (the acceleration along every geodesic is strictly spacelike), then natural quantities measuring curvature pinching and noncollapsing are preserved under the flow. Moreover, we prove an analogue of the Huisken and Gage-Hamilton theorems in this setting, which states that the mean curvature flow deforms any such submanifold to a point in finite time, and that the solution is asymptotic to a shrinking sphere in a maximally spacelike affine subspace $\R^{n+1,0}\subset \R^{n+1,k}$.</description>

      <title>Classification of quadratically pinched self-shrinkers in higher codimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify properly immersed self-shrinkers of the mean curvature flow in arbitrary codimension under a quadratic pinching condition of Andrews-Baker type on the second fundamental form that is preserved along the flow. Under this assumption, such self-shrinkers reduce effectively to codimension one and are therefore generalized self-shrinking cylinders. In contrast to previous works, our approach is purely elliptic: it relies on parabolicity in a weighted setting and is tailored specifically to self-shrinkers, rather than to general ancient solutions of the flow. This allows us to avoid assuming any uniform pinching condition, to treat in any dimension the sharp Andrews-Baker pinching constant $\frac{4}{3n}$ and hence to sharpen, in the self-shrinker setting, the pinching constants appearing in recent classification results for ancient solutions.</description>

      <title>Projective Maps from the Perspective of Elliptic Differential Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops an analytical approach to the study of the geometry of projective maps using the theory of elliptic differential operators. We construct two elliptic operators of second and fourth order, whose kernels characterize projective diffeomorphisms between Riemannian manifolds and one-parameter groups of projective diffeomorphisms (transformations) of a Riemannian manifold onto itself, respectively. This approach establishes a natural correspondence between analytical and geometric properties, enabling the study of projective diffeomorphisms via operator-theoretic methods. The proposed framework provides a new understanding of projective structures on Riemannian manifolds and extends classical results in differential geometry.</description>

      <title>The character of ideal circle patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S$ be an oriented closed surface with a cellular decomposition $\mathcal{D}$ and a weight $\Phi\in(0, \pi)$. It is crucial to determine when $S$ supports an ideal $\mathcal{D}$-type circle pattern $\mathcal{P}$ with the exterior intersection angles given by $\Phi$. Rivin, Bobenko-Springborn and Ge-Hua-Zhou provided perfect solutions and gave wonderful criteria for the existence and uniqueness of ideal circle patterns. However, all criteria established by Rivin, Bobenko-Springborn and Ge-Hua-Zhou are extremely difficult to verify for the given cellular decomposition $\mathcal{D}$ and the weight $\Phi$. In this paper, we introduce the character $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{D},\Phi)$ depends only on the data of the weighted cellular decomposition $(\mathcal D, \Phi)$ on $S$, and give some quite simple criteria for the existence of ideal circle patterns realizing $(\mathcal{D},\Phi)$. It seems that our character-type criteria are the first conditions totally different from criteria of Rivin, Bobenko-Springborn and Ge-Hua-Zhou, and provide more easily verifiable criteria. Our new character-type theorems may be of some independent interest. As an application, we give a new descriptions of the curvature image set $\mathbf{K}(\mathbb{R}^N_{&gt;0})$. To approach our results, we shall use the combinatorial Ricci flows with ideal circle patterns introduced by Ge-Hua-Zhou as a fundamental tool. The main difficulty in the proof of our results is to establish the compactness of the solution to the flows. To circumvent the difficulty, we borrow the techniques developed by Ge and his collaborators.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Estimates on the Topology and Singular Set of Prescribed Mean Curvature Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish quantitative topological and singularity properties for (certain) prescribed mean curvature (PMC) hypersurfaces $V^n$ in Riemannian manifolds $(N^{n+1},h)$. Indeed, if $V$ has area at most $A&gt;0$ with PMC given by a $C^{1,\alpha}$ function $g:N\to \mathbb{R}$ with the bound $|g|_{C^{1,\alpha}}\leq \Gamma$, we show that there exists a constant $C$ depending only on $n,h,A,\Gamma$ and geometric quantities such that: \[\sum^n_{i=0}b^i(V) \leq C(1+\text{index}(V)) \quad \text{if }3\leq n+1\leq 7;\] \[M^{*n-7}(\text{sing}(V)) \leq C(1+\text{index}(V)) \quad \text{if }n+1\geq 8.\] Here, $b^i$ denote the Betti numbers over any field, $M^{*n-7}$ denotes the upper $(n-7)$-dimensional Minkowski content, and $\text{sing}(V)$ is the singular set of $V$. The first inequality extends the work of Song from the minimal hypersurface setting to the PMC hypersurface setting, whilst the second extends work of the authors. Our results apply to the PMC hypersurfaces constructed recently through min-max techniques by Bellettini--Wickramasekera.</description>

      <title>On $U(1)^{n-2}$-Invariant Special Lagrangian $n$-Folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a construction of families of $ U(1)^{n-2} $-invariant special Lagrangian $ n $-folds in $ \mathbb{C}^{n} $, extending the analytic framework introduced by Joyce ($ n = 3 $) to arbitrary dimension. By reducing the special Lagrangian condition to a quasilinear elliptic system of two-dimensional non-linear Cauchy-Riemann equations, we analyse both the resulting geometry and its degenerations at singular points. We show that the structure and multiplicity of singularities are governed by an associated polynomial arising from the symmetry reduction. Explicit examples are constructed, including affine and perturbative solutions, and are compared with the classical Harvey-Lawson $ U(1)^{n-1} $-invariant submanifolds. We further show that the key elements of Joyce's analysis in the non-singular case, in particular the potential formulation and Dirichlet problem, extend to this higher-dimensional setting, with the proofs unchanged.</description>

      <title>Algebraic integrability and minimality of Lie equations for transitive, finite dimensional, non-commutative pseudogroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an algebraic characterization of transitive, finite-dimensional algebraic Lie pseudogroups (or $\mathcal{D}$-groupoids) that are algebraic integrable, that is, isogenous to the action groupoid of an algebraic group action. Our approach is based on the differential Galois theory of rational connections. Under suitable hypotheses on the Lie algebra of the $\mathcal D$-groupoid, its algebraic integrability is equivalent to the triviality of the differential Galois group of its $\mathcal D$-Lie algebra. Furthermore, we investigate the structure of highly non-integrable $\mathcal{D}$-groupoids, demonstrating that if the differential Galois group of the linear differential equation of their $\mathcal D$-Lie algebra is large enough, then they are minimal in the sense that they admit no non-trivial sub-$\mathcal{D}$-groupoids of positive dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of recovery of parametrizations from Legendre data is a very important inverse problem. In this paper, we provide a systematic and widely-applicable method to recover parametrizations $f: U_n \to \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ from Legendre data where $U_n$ is an open subset of $\mathbb R^n$. Namely, for a dense subset of the space of real-analytic parametrizations from $U_n$ into $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, we show how to recover the parametrization from the Gauss mapping and the height function. Moreover, in order to assist readers to apply results of this paper, many concrete examples are given.</description>

      <title>New minimal surfaces in the sphere from capillary minimal cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every $p,q\geq 1$, we construct minimal embeddings of $\mathbb{S}^p \times \mathbb{S}^q \times \mathbb{S}^1$ in $\mathbb{S}^{p + q + 2}$ by doubling the links of free-boundary minimal cones in $\mathbb{R}^{p+q+3}$ with bi-orthogonal symmetry. This solves problems posed by Hsiang-Lawson and Hsiang-Hsiang. The equivariance reduces the minimal surface equation to an ODE, and we prove the existence of capillary minimal cones for every contact angle. We obtain free-boundary solutions as limits of capillary surfaces via a singular shooting problem with infinite initial slope. As the contact angle degenerates to $0$, rescalings of the capillary cones converge to a homogeneous solution of the one-phase Bernoulli problem, further illustrating the connection between one-phase free boundaries and minimal surfaces through the capillary functional.</description>

      <title>Convex Analysis of Relaxation Dynamics in Chemical Reaction Networks and Generalized Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain bounds on the Kullback--Leibler divergence to equilibrium for mass-action chemical reaction networks (CRNs) with equilibrium. The associated decay rates are characterized in terms of the singular values of the stoichiometric matrix, convexity parameters, and time-integrated activities via deformed-exponential-type functions. We further extend these bounds within a generalized gradient flow framework. We highlight the biological relevance of this framework: the resulting bounds apply to quasi-steady-state regimes, where long transients and plateau-like behavior are common and functionally important. We illustrate the framework using a catalytic CRN exhibiting plateaus, where the bounds capture slow relaxation induced by local convexity and provide a bound-based approach to quantifying relaxation in CRNs.</description>

      <title>A compensated compactness theorem for pseudodifferential operators on vector bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a compensated compactness theorem in the microlocal and geometric analytic framework. For a weakly $L^2_{\rm loc}$-convergent sequence of sections of a vector bundle over a semi-Riemannian manifold whose image under a pseudo-differential operator $\mathscr{A}$ of order $s&gt;0$ is precompact in $H^{-s}_{\rm loc}$, we show that a quadratic form $Q$ acting on this sequence converges in the distributional sense, provided that $Q$ vanishes on the operator cone of $\mathscr{A}$. This extends the classical Murat--Tartar theory of compensated compactness from constant-coefficient first-order differential constraints on Euclidean spaces to variable-coefficient pseudo-differential constraints of arbitrary order on semi-Riemannian manifolds.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we construct, for given any small positive number $\epsilon$ and given natural number $n$, and given any closed hyperbolic surface $M$, a closed hyperbolic covering surface $\widetilde{M}$, such that its $n$-th eigenvalue is less than $\epsilon$. An application of this result will also be discussed. The main result follows from the techniques used in B.Randol's paper in 1974 [Ran]. Here I give a new and geometric proof of the main result.</description>

      <title>Isospectrality for infinite-type hyperbolic surfaces with discrete length spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that every family of isospectral surfaces with discrete length spectrum arising from Sunada's method is finite. Furthermore, by introducing the topological notion of surfaces with self-duplicating ends, we show that every finite group can be realized as the full isometry group of a hyperbolic structure with discrete spectrum on such a surface, if the genus is infinite. Under the same topological assumptions, we also demonstrate that the above-mentioned isospectral families can have unbounded cardinality within a fixed moduli space.</description>

      <title>An new polar factor retraction on the Stiefel manifold with closed-form inverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retractions are the workhorse in Riemannian computing applications, where computational efficiency is of the essence. This work introduces a new retraction on the compact Stiefel manifold of orthogonal frames. The retraction is second-order accurate under the Euclidean metric and features a closed-form inverse that can be efficiently computed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Stiefel retraction with both these properties. A variety of retractions is known on the Stiefel manifold, including the Riemannian exponential map, the polar factor retraction, the QR-retraction and the Cayley retraction, but none of them features a closed-form inverse. The only Stiefel retraction with closed-form inverse that we are aware of is based on quasi-geodesics, but this one is of first order.</description>

      <title>The Spacetime Positive Mass Theorem with Multiple Time Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the spacetime positive mass theorem to include multiple time dimensions. In particular, we show that the mass remains nonnegative in the sense that the energy $E$ is bounded from below by the trace norm of the linear momenta $J^1,...,J^m$. Equality in this energy inequality implies a foliation by flat submanifolds of a generalized initial data set. Moreover, under an additional umbilicity assumption, we find that the initial data set isometrically embeds into a generalized pp-wave.</description>

      <title>Counting surface subgroups in cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M =\mathbb{H}^3/\Gamma$ be a finite-volume, noncompact hyperbolic 3-manifold. We show that the number of quasi-Fuchsian surface subgroups of $\Gamma$ (up to conjugacy and commensurability) of genus at most $g$ is bounded both above and below by functions of the form $(cg)^{2g}$. As a corollary, for all $h\geq 4$, the number of purely pseudo-Anosov closed surface subgroups of genus at most $g$ of the mapping class group $\mathrm{Mod}(S_{h,0})$ is bounded below by $(Cg)^{2g}$ for a universal constant $C$. In contrast, for some $g \geq 2$, we construct infinitely many conjugacy classes of genus-$g$ surface subgroups of $\Gamma$ with accidental parabolics.</description>

      <title>Spherically symmetric solutions to the Einstein-scalar field conformal constraint equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works by the second author and Dilts et al. have shown that the Einstein-scalar field conformal constraint equations are highly complex and generally intractable, even in the vacuum case. In this article, to gain a clearer understanding and offer a new perspective, we study these equations under special assumptions: the manifold $(M,g)$ is harmonic and data is radial.
  In this setting, the system reduces to a single nonlinear equation and is completely resolved in the standard cases. In particular, on the sphere, our results reveal phenomena that contrast with the well-known achievements on compact manifolds without conformal Killing vector fields, including nonexistence of solutions in the near-CMC regime and instability when the mean curvature is non-constant. By contrast, on Euclidean or hyperbolic manifolds, the equations are always solvable, with all expected properties of solutions satisfied. These findings support the view that, although the conformal method appears to present some drawbacks on compact manifolds, it remains a promising tool for parametrizing solutions to the constraint equations on asymptotically flat and hyperbolic manifolds in arbitrary mean curvature regimes.
  In this article, we also investigate the sign of mass, showing that the ADM and asymptotically hyperbolic mass can take arbitrary sign when the decay rate of symmetric $(0,2)$-tensor $k$ at infinity is critical. Finally, most solution classes in our framework are explicit, providing a variety of models in general relativity and offering insights into the structure and behavior of initial data, particularly in numerical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collapsed ancient solutions to the homogeneous Ricci flow on compact manifolds occur only on the total space of principal torus bundles. Under an algebraic assumption that guarantees flowing through diagonal metrics and a tameness assumption on the collapsing directions, we prove that such solutions have additional symmetries, i.e., they are invariant under the right action of their collapsing torus. As a byproduct of these additional torus symmetries, we prove that these solutions converge, backward in time, in the Gromov-Hausdorff topology to an Einstein metric on the base of a torus bundle.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the Skoda-Zeriahi type integrability theorem with respect to some measure with $L^1$-density. In addition, we introduce the log-log threshold in order to detect singularities of K\"{a}hler potentials. We prove the positivity of the integrability threshold for such a measure and K\"{a}hler potentials with uniform log-log threshold. As an application, we prove the entropy compactness theorem for a family of potential functions of Poincar\'{e} type K\"{a}hler metrics with uniform log-log threshold. The Ohsawa-Takegoshi $L^2$-extension theorem and Skoda-Zeriahi's integrability theorem play a very important role in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12797v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish solvability and uniqueness conditions for the linearized Ricci curvature equations on compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary, obtained without imposing restrictions on the interior geometry. The proof recasts the problem in cohomological terms by means of a generalized Hodge theory, based on the Boutet de Monvel calculus. The first cohomology, obstructing uniqueness, is always finite dimensional, whereas the second cohomology, obstructing solvability, is finite dimensional if the boundary is empty or the dimension is three. Through the Bochner technique, we prove vanishing theorems for these cohomologies; for the second cohomology, the argument also uses stress potentials and the sharp Poincar\'e inequality on spheres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Line congruences are the genesis of important examples of transformations of projective surfaces, such as the Laplace transform. We survey and review results related to this historical subject, then derive original formulae for the Laplace transform of the entire rank-4 linear system associated to such an immersed projective surface. We apply our results to study the geometry of surfaces defined by Appell's hypergeometric functions of rank-4: namely, $F_2$ and $F_4$. We show that the sequence of Laplace invariants for each is determined respectively by the Euler-Poisson-Darboux equation for $F_2$, and Darboux's Harmonic equation for $F_4$. Further, we show the natural line congruences generated by the Laplace transforms of each constitute a $W$-congruence, an important example of line congruence in which a surface and its Laplace transform are simultaneously locally conformally equivalent.</description>

      <title>Heat Flow under Semi-Flat Collapse with Conic Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the SYZ picture for the collapsing of elliptic K3 surfaces, we study heat kernels under semi-flat collapse of Ricci-flat K\"ahler manifolds (X_t, g(t)) fibered by flat 2-tori over a surface B with a finite discriminant set D. On the regular locus B_reg = B \ D we assume an exponentially accurate semi-flat product approximation together with a uniform vertical spectral gap at the collapse scale. Using normalized lift and fiber-average maps, we show that for each fixed time tau &gt; 0 the fiber-compressed heat operators converge strongly on L^2 to the heat semigroup of the base Laplacian. Equivalently, bilinear pairings of the total-space heat kernel against fiber-constant lifts of test functions converge on any precompact subset of B_reg.
  The main additional issue occurs at the discriminant: although X_t is smooth, the limiting base geometry becomes conic near D, so test functions meeting D cannot be treated by purely interior arguments. In wedge charts around D we introduce a canonical conic-renormalized bilinear functional obtained by patching the base heat-kernel pairing away from D with the model heat kernel of the corresponding flat cone. A conic parametrix shows that this functional is well-defined and independent of auxiliary cutoffs, and that the total-space bilinear pairings converge to it for arbitrary smooth compactly supported test functions and every fixed tau &gt; 0. When the supports avoid D, the renormalization is trivial and the limit reduces to the usual base heat-kernel pairing. Under exponentially small geometric errors we obtain an explicit exponential convergence rate, uniform for tau in compact subintervals of (0, infinity). The results extend to Neumann and nonnegatively weighted Robin boundary conditions and globalize by exhaustion of the regular locus.</description>

We provide an explicit construction of them in terms of parallel families of hypersurfaces of the factors. We show that hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature in class $\mathcal{A}$ are given in terms of parallel families of isoparametric hypersurfaces in each factor and a solution of a second order ODE. Finally, we classify hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature in class $\mathcal{A}$ that have constant product angle function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17220v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend unbounded Kasparov theory to encompass conformal group and quantum group equivariance. This new framework allows us to treat conformal actions on both manifolds and noncommutative spaces. As examples, we present unbounded representatives of Kasparov's $\gamma$-element for the real and complex Lorentz groups and display the conformal $SL_q(2)$-equivariance of the standard spectral triple of the Podle\'s sphere. In pursuing descent for conformally equivariant cycles, we are led to a new framework for representing Kasparov classes. Our new representatives are unbounded, possess a dynamical quality, and also include known twisted spectral triples. We define an equivalence relation on these new representatives whose classes form an abelian group surjecting onto KK. The technical innovation which underpins these results is a novel multiplicative perturbation theory. By these means, we obtain Kasparov classes from the bounded transform with minimal side conditions.</description>

Abstract: Hydrodynamics describes the evolution of macroscopic states in non--equilibrium thermodynamics. Following Onsager reciprocal relations, one can formulate a large class of hydrodynamic equations as gradient flows of free energies. In recent years, such Onsager gradient flows have been extensively investigated on optimal transport type metric spaces with nonlinear mobilities, known as hydrodynamical density manifolds. A typical example is the gradient--drift Fokker--Planck equation, which can be characterized as the gradient flow of the free energy in the Wasserstein-2 metric space. This paper studies geometric calculations on general hydrodynamical density manifolds. We first formulate the associated Levi--Civita connections, gradients, Hessians, and parallel transports, and then derive the corresponding Riemannian and sectional curvatures. Finally, we obtain closed-form formulas for sectional curvatures in one dimensional density manifolds, where the signs of the curvatures are determined by the convexity of the mobility functions. As illustrations, we present density manifolds and their sectional curvatures for several zero range models, including independent particle systems, simple exclusion processes, and Kipnis--Marchioro--Presutti models.</description>

      <title>On face angles of tetrahedra with a given base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22374</link>

Abstract: Let us consider the set $\Omega (\triangle ABC)$ of all tetrahedra $ABCD$ with a given non-degenerate base $ABC$ in $\mathbb{E}^3$ and $D$ lying outside the plane $ABC$. Let us denote by $\Sigma(\triangle ABC)$ the set $\left\{\Bigl(\cos \overline{\alpha},\cos \overline{\beta},\cos \overline{\gamma} \Bigr)\in \mathbb{R}^3\,|\, ABCD \in \Omega (\triangle ABC)\right\}$, where $\overline{\alpha}=\angle BDC$, $\overline{\beta}=\angle ADC$, and $\overline{\gamma}=\angle ADB$. The paper is devoted to the problem of determining of the closure of $\Sigma(\triangle ABC)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and its boundary.</description>

      <title>Invariant Reduction for Partial Differential Equations. III: Poisson Brackets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08213v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, under suitable conditions, finite-dimensional systems describing invariant solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) inherit local Hamiltonian operators through the mechanism of invariant reduction, which applies uniformly to point, contact, and higher symmetries. The inherited operators endow the reduced systems with Poisson bivectors that relate constants of motion to symmetries. Applying the same mechanism to invariant conservation laws, we further show that the induced Poisson brackets agree with those of the original systems, up to sign. The results are illustrated by two examples in which the inherited Poisson brackets and inherited constants of motion yield integrability of the reduced systems. Crucially, the construction is independent of the choice of an $\ell$-normal inclusion of a PDE system into jet spaces.</description>

      <title>Lie groups in tangent join restriction categories</title>

Abstract: Principal bundles have at least three different definitions, depending on the category of geometric objects studied.
  In Differential Geometry, they are defined as locally trivial projection map of smooth manifolds with an atlas whose transition maps are given by group multiplication. In Topology they are $G$-equivariantly trivial $G$-spaces. In Algebraic Geometry, they are \'Etale locally isotrivial geometric quotients of $G$-varieties.
  The goal of this work is to have a categorical notion that recovers all of them. While they are different structures, they are all locally isomorphic to the Cartesian product of a base space with a group.
  There are a variety of other results on group objects and their tangent bundle. In particular we show that the tangent bundle is the product of the tangent space and the group object and that the tangent space has an external Lie algebra structure, generalizing the correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras.
  In order to give a purely categorical definition of a principal bundle, we formulate this notion in the language of join restriction categories. Restriction categories were developed by Cockett and Lack to generalize partial maps (maps defined only on a subset of the domain) and have since then found applications in mathematics and computer science. Join restriction categories, as described by Guo are restriction categories where local restrictions can be joined to obtain a global map. Together with a manifold construction due to Grandis, that allows us to glue together objects, we can describe principal bundles entirely in the language of join-restriction categories.</description>

      <title>Contact Wasserstein Geodesics for Non-Conservative Schr\"odinger Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger Bridge provides a principled framework for modeling stochastic processes between distributions; however, existing methods are limited by energy-conservation assumptions, which constrains the bridge's shape preventing it from model varying-energy phenomena. To overcome this, we introduce the non-conservative generalized Schr\"odinger bridge (NCGSB), a novel, energy-varying reformulation based on contact Hamiltonian mechanics. By allowing energy to change over time, the NCGSB provides a broader class of real-world stochastic processes, capturing richer and more faithful intermediate dynamics. By parameterizing the Wasserstein manifold, we lift the bridge problem to a tractable geodesic computation in a finite-dimensional space. Unlike computationally expensive iterative solutions, our contact Wasserstein geodesic (CWG) is naturally implemented via a ResNet architecture and relies on a non-iterative solver with near-linear complexity. Furthermore, CWG supports guided generation by modulating a task-specific distance metric. We validate our framework on tasks including manifold navigation, molecular dynamics predictions, and image generation, demonstrating its practical benefits and versatility.</description>
