      <title>A Hierarchical Adaptive Diffusion Model for Flexible Protein-Protein Docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural prediction of protein-protein interactions is important to understand the molecular basis of cellular interactions, but it still faces major challenges when significant conformational changes are present. We propose a generative framework of hierarchical adaptive diffusion to improve accuracy and efficiency in such cases. It is hierarchical in separating global inter-protein rigid-body motions and local intra-protein flexibility in diffusion processes, and the distinct local and global noise schedules are designed to mimic the induced-fit effect. It is adaptive in conditioning the local flexibility schedule on predicted levels of conformational change, allowing faster flexing for larger anticipated conformational changes. Furthermore, it couples the local and global diffusion processes through a common score and confidence network with sequence, evolution, structure, and dynamics features as inputs, and maintains rotational or translational invariance or equivariance in outputs. It builds on our newly curated DIPS-AF dataset of nearly 39,000 examples for pre-training. Experiments on the independent docking benchmark dataset DB5.5 show that our model outperforms an AlphaFold2-like iterative transformer (GeoDock) and a diffusion model (DiffDock-PP) in both rigid and flexible cases, with larger improvements in more flexible cases. Ablation studies prove the importance of adaptive schedules, dynamics features, and pre-training. Additional analyses and case studies reveal remaining gaps in sampling, scoring, and conformational resolution.</description>

      <title>Flexible MOF Generation with Torsion-Aware Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with novel chemistries is a longstanding challenge due to their large combinatorial space and complex 3D arrangements of the building blocks. While recent deep generative models have enabled scalable MOF generation, they assume (1) a fixed set of building blocks and (2) known local 3D coordinates of building blocks. However, this limits their ability to (1) design novel MOFs and (2) generate the structure using novel building blocks. We propose a two-stage MOF generation framework that overcomes these limitations by modeling both chemical and geometric degrees of freedom. First, we train an SMILES-based autoregressive model to generate metal and organic building blocks, paired with a cheminformatics toolkit for 3D structure initialization. Second, we introduce a flow matching model that predicts translations, rotations, and torsional angles to assemble the blocks into valid 3D frameworks. Our experiments demonstrate improved reconstruction accuracy, the generation of valid, novel, and unique MOFs, and the ability to create novel building blocks. Our code is available at https://github.com/nayoung10/MOFFlow-2.</description>

      <title>Beyond Ensembles: Simulating All-Atom Protein Dynamics in a Learned Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02196v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating the long-timescale dynamics of biomolecules is a central challenge in computational science. While enhanced sampling methods can accelerate these simulations, they rely on pre-defined collective variables that are often difficult to identify. A recent generative model, LD-FPG, demonstrated that this problem could be bypassed by learning to sample the static equilibrium ensemble as all-atom deformations from a reference structure, establishing a powerful method for all-atom ensemble generation. However, while this approach successfully captures a system's probable conformations, it does not model the temporal evolution between them. We introduce the Graph Latent Dynamics Propagator (GLDP), a modular component for simulating dynamics within the learned latent space of LD-FPG. We then compare three classes of propagators: (i) score-guided Langevin dynamics, (ii) Koopman-based linear operators, and (iii) autoregressive neural networks. Within a unified encoder-propagator-decoder framework, we evaluate long-horizon stability, backbone and side-chain ensemble fidelity, and functional free-energy landscapes. Autoregressive neural networks deliver the most robust long rollouts; score-guided Langevin best recovers side-chain thermodynamics when the score is well learned; and Koopman provides an interpretable, lightweight baseline that tends to damp fluctuations. These results clarify the trade-offs among propagators and offer practical guidance for latent-space simulators of all-atom protein dynamics.</description>
