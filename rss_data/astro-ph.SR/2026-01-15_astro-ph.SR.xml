      <title>IK Pegasi and the Double Merger Path to Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Gaia astrometry has revealed thousands of main-sequence + white-dwarf binaries (MS+WD) at separations of ~0.1-10 au, including a subset hosting unusually massive (&gt;~0.8 Msun) WDs. We argue that s-process enrichment in the non-degenerate companion provides a powerful diagnostic for identifying WDs that formed via mergers in hierarchical triple systems. For a massive WD, standard single-star evolution requires a massive (&gt;~4 Msun) progenitor, yet such progenitors produce negligible s-process yields. We define IK Peg-type systems as those exhibiting this mass-yield tension: barium-enhanced companions orbiting WDs too massive to have descended from efficient s-process producers. The well-known system IK Peg exemplifies this class. Applying this framework to published spectroscopic data reveals several additional candidates, and we estimate that a few dozen such systems should exist in the current Gaia sample. If these systems trace inner-binary mergers in primordial triples, they represent observable intermediate stages towards eventual Type Ia supernovae via the double-merger pathway, as predicted by recent population-synthesis models.</description>

      <title>Numerical Insights into Disk Accretion, Eccentricity, and Kinematics in the Class 0 phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation and early evolution of protoplanetary disks are governed by a wide variety of physical processes during a gravitational collapse. Observations have begun probing disks in their earliest stages, and have favored the magnetically-regulated disk formation scenario. Disks are also expected to exhibit ellipsoidal morphologies in the early phases, an aspect that has been widely overlooked. We aim to describe the birth and evolution of the disk while accounting for the eccentric motions of fluid parcels. Using 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with ambipolar diffusion, we self-consistently model the collapse of isolated $1~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and $3~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ cores to form a central protostar surrounded by a disk. We account for dust dynamics, and employ gas tracer particles to follow the thermodynamical history of fluid parcels. We find that magnetic fields and turbulence drive highly anisotropic accretion onto the disk via dense streamers. This streamer-fed accretion, occurring from the vertical and radial directions, drives vigorous internal turbulence that facilitates efficient angular momentum transport and rapid radial spreading. Crucially, the anisotropic inflow delivers material with an angular momentum deficit that continuously generates and sustains significant disk eccentricity ($e\sim 0.1$). Our results reveal ubiquitous eccentric kinematics in Class 0 disks, with direct implications for disk evolution, planetesimal formation, and the interpretation of cosmochemical signatures in Solar System meteorites.</description>

      <title>HOPS-288: A Laboratory for Complex Organics in Proto-multiple Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex organic molecules (COMs) in young stellar objects (YSOs) have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their potential connection to pre-biotic chemistry and their utility as tracers of warm or shocked gas components. Proto-binary and multiple systems with close separations are particularly valuable targets for investigating chemical inheritance and reaction, as their members are expected to form from similar material in their parental cloud. We present ALMA observations of the hierarchical proto-triple system HOPS-288, focusing on the physical structure, kinematics, and COM compositions. The system is treated as a proto-binary system consisting of HOPS-288-A and HOPS-288-B due to the limited spatial resolutions, with a separation of 200~au. Three COM-rich features are revealed: two hot corinos associated with the two members, rich in a variety of COMs, and an intervening component between the two members traced by CH$_3$OH and tentatively by CH$_3$CHO. The hot corino in HOPS-288-A exhibits rotational features and might trace a disk. The hot corino in HOPS-288-B is also possibly exhibiting rotational motion. The intervening component could possibly trace a shocked region in the circumbinary disk or a bridge between the two members. The column densities of COMs, including $^{13}$CH$_3$OH, CH$_2$DOH, CH$_3$CHO, HCOOCH$_3$, C$_2$H$_5$OH, $^{13}$CH$_3$CN, and NH$_2$CHO, are broadly similar between the two sources, possibly suggesting the complex organic similarities among proto-binary/multiple systems. Given the complexity of the studied physical structures, further detailed investigations will be essential to confirm this result.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Method Age Determination for the Ursa Major Moving Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ursa Major Moving Group (UMa) is one of the closest stellar associations, yet its age has remained controversial, with published estimates ranging from 200 Myr to 1 Gyr. We present a comprehensive age analysis using the largest sample of candidate UMa members to date. Using Gaia DR3, we identify 1172 stars within 100 pc of the Sun with 3D kinematic motions consistent with group membership. We determine the age of UMa's dominant population using three independent methods: lithium equivalent widths $(393.6^{+85.1}_{-80.9}\,\mathrm{Myr})$, gyrochronology $(428 \pm 93\,\mathrm{Myr})$, and photometric variability indicators $(449^{+114}_{-79}\,\mathrm{Myr})$. The three methods converge on a consistent age of $418^{+32}_{-34}\,\mathrm{Myr}$. While our kinematic selection includes field stars that share UMa's space motion but are not coeval members, the convergent age determinations clearly identify a dominant population that formed together approximately 400 Myr ago. These stars are important benchmarks for studies of stellar rotation, magnetic activity evolution, and lithium depletion. The presence of systems such as HD~63433, a young multiplanet host within the group, further illustrates the value of UMa as a laboratory for early planetary system evolution. Our expanded catalog of kinematic candidates lays the groundwork for spectroscopic membership confirmation, refined mapping of the group's structure and chemistry, and future investigations of both stellar and planetary evolution at this key epoch.</description>

      <title>The IRIS$^{2+}$ inversion tool: recovering the radiative losses and the thermodynamics in the lower solar atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an improved and fast inversion tool that is able to provide the thermodynamics of the solar atmosphere from the photosphere to the top of the chromosphere, as well as the integrated radiative losses in the chromosphere for data observed by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). This NASA mission has been observing the Sun and providing, among other kinds of data, multi-line spectral observations sensitive to changes in the lower solar atmosphere since 2013. In this paper, we explain the new inversion tool IRIS$^{2+}$ based on the IRIS$^{2+}$ database, which is based on 135,472 synthetic representative profiles (RP), each of them consisting of 6 chromospheric lines and 6 photospheric lines, their corresponding representative model atmospheres (RMA), and the integrated radiative losses (IRL) associated with these atmospheres. A nearest neighbor (k-nn) model algorithm is trained with the synthetic representative profiles to predict the closest RP in the database to the one observed, at which point IRIS$^{2+}$ assigns the RMA and the IRL to the location of that observed profile. We have compared the results obtained by IRIS$^{2+}$ with results obtained from the state-of-the-art inversion code STiC, which is also used to build the IRIS$^{2+}$ database. We find that the thermodynamics and the IRL obtained with both methods are comparable in most cases. Therefore, IRIS$^{2+}$ is a fast and reliable inversion tool that provides approximate values of the thermodynamic state and the radiative losses in the lower solar atmosphere for a large variety of solar scenes observed with IRIS.</description>

      <title>The Progenitor of the Type II-Plateau SN 2025pht in NGC 1637: The Dustiest, Most Luminous Red Supergiant So Far?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a characterization of the red supergiant (RSG) progenitor candidate for the nearby Type II-plateau supernova (SN) 2025pht in NGC 1637. The star was first detectable in 2001 by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and then again in a dozen bands by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in 2024. This "quasi-snapshot" of the star's nature almost immediately prior to explosion is unprecedented. The RSG varied in brightness, and we posit that it could have been a pulsating variable, possibly with a long period of ~660 days. The largest uncertainty is the host-galaxy distance, which we establish to be 10.73+/-1.76 Mpc. The star was also heavily extinguished by interstellar dust internal to the host, with visual extinction A_V(host)~1.7 mag (total A_V(tot)~1.8 mag). Dust radiative-transfer modeling reveals the star's circumstellar medium to be quite dusty and silicate-rich, yielding a bolometric luminosity log(L_bol/L_Sun)=5.08+/-0.16 and a cool effective temperature T_eff=2100--2500 K. The available HST optical data had no bearing on the shape of the candidate's observed spectral energy distribution -- for the first time, without the archival JWST observations we would not have been able to detect and characterize the candidate at all. The SN 2025pht progenitor candidate, although quite similar to that of SN 2023ixf, may be the most luminous candidate identified to date.</description>

      <title>Quiet Sun impulsive events observed with NuSTAR during solar minimum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of small-scale energy release in the Sun's atmosphere is important in understanding how the corona is heated. Previous work has been able to study small EUV and SXR brightenings outside of active regions (i.e. the quiet Sun), but with HXRs this has mostly focused on active region transients/microflares due to the sensitivity of available telescopes. In this paper we present observations of the quiet Sun with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR), an X-ray imaging spectrometer with much greater sensitivity than previous instruments, allowing the observation of faint events. During the recent solar minimum, NuSTAR captured seven quiet Sun flares/impulsive brightenings, three on 21 February 2020, and four on 12-13 September 2020. From fitting their NuSTAR HXR spectra we find temperatures of 3.1-4.0 MK and emission measures between (0.75-17.0) $\times 10^{43}$ cm$^{-3}$, which gives thermal energies between (2.5-8.9) $\times 10^{26}$ erg. Only one event, a mini-filament eruption, showed evidence of slightly higher temperatures emission, confirmed through Differential Emission Measure analysis. None of the events showed evidence of non-thermal emission in their NuSTAR spectra, and we placed upper limits to the accelerated electron population. The thermal parameters for these quiet Sun events seem to scale differently to previously studied active region flares, suggesting a different energy release process might be dominating. However, this conclusion is affected by the different sensitivity and biases introduced by the various instruments and analysis approaches used.</description>

      <title>The Structure and Kinematics of Three Class 0 Protostellar Jets from JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observations of jets within 2000 au of three deeply embedded protostars using 2.9-27 micron observations with JWST. These observations show the morphologies and kinematics of the collimated jets from three protostars, the low-mass Class 0 protostars B335 and HOPS 153, and the intermediate-mass protostar HOPS 370. These jets are traced by shock-ionized fine-structure line emission observed with the JWST NIRSpec and MIRI IFUs. We find that [Fe II] emission traces the full extent of the inner 1000 to 2000 au of the jets, depending on distance to the protostar, while other ions mostly trace isolated shocked knots. The jets show evidence of wiggling motion in the plane of the sky as well as asymmetries between blue and red-shifted lobes. The widths of the jets increase non-monotonically with distance from the central protostar, with opening angles ranging from 2.1 degrees to &lt; 10.1 degrees for the three protostars in the sample. The jets have total velocities ranging from 147 to 184 km/s after correcting for disk inclination. For B335, an 8-month gap between NIRSpec and MIRI MRS observations enabled measurement of the tangential velocity of a shocked knot; in combination with the radial velocity, this shows that the jet has a different inclination than the outflow cavity. We find multiple knots before and during a recent outburst in B335, although the knots were more frequent during the burst. The asymmetries between blue- and red-shifted lobes strongly suggest complex interactions between the circumstellar disks and magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Solar Energetic Proton Events Observed by the High Energy Telescopes on the STEREO Spacecraft or at the Earth During the First Solar Orbit of STEREO A (2006 to 2023)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The twin STEREO A and B spacecraft were launched in October 2006 into heliocentric orbits at around 1 AU, advancing ahead of or lagging behind Earth, respectively, at around 22 deg./year. The spacecraft provide in-situ observations of the solar wind and energetic particle populations, as well as remote sensing observations of solar activity and the corona. In particular, the High Energy Telescopes (HETs) on the STEREO spacecraft observe 0.7-4 MeV electrons and 13-100 MeV protons. This paper summarizes observations of solar energetic particle (SEP) events made by the STEREO HETs from the beginning of the mission through Solar Cycle 24 to December 2023, approaching the maximum of Solar Cycle 25 and encompassing STEREO A's first full orbit of the Sun relative to Earth, completed in August 2023; contact with STEREO B was lost in October 2014. Specifically, the catalog of SEP events including approximately 25 MeV protons observed by the STEREO HETs and/or instruments on spacecraft near Earth in Richardson et al. (2014) is updated to include around 450 SEP events and a total of around 1000 separate observations of these events from the various spacecraft locations. These extensive observations can provide unique insight into the propagation of energetic protons in the inner heliosphere and how the properties of the particle events are related to those of the associated solar eruptions.</description>

      <title>Parallaxes, Proper Motions, and Near-Infrared Photometry for 173 L and T Dwarfs From The US Naval Observatory Infrared Astrometry Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present near-infrared parallax and proper motion astrometry for 74 L-dwarfs and 99 T-dwarfs, as single objects or in binary systems, obtained with the ASTROCAM astrometric imager on the USNO, Flagstaff Station 1.55-m telescope over two observing periods. For all 173 objects the median number of observational epochs was 62 with a median time frame of 5.25 years, resulting in median uncertainties of $\sigma$($\pi_{abs}$) = 1.51 mas, $\sigma$($\mu_{abs}$) = 1.02 mas yr$^{-1}$, and $\sigma$($V_{\rm tan}$) = 1.01 km s$^{-1}$. Our observations provide the first parallax/proper motion results for 16 objects and the highest precision parallaxes/proper motions for an additional 116 objects. A serendipitous overlap of 40 objects with Gaia DR3 astrometry allows direct comparison and confirmation of our results, along with an investigation on the effects of resolved binarity on astrometric results. We also provide a uniform set of $J$-, $H$-, $K_{S}$-band photometry in the UKIRT/MKO system, most of it being from new observations. We use these results to examine objects included in this study of special-interest populations, consisting of binaries, wide companions, young objects, subdwarfs, and brown dwarf spectral standards.</description>

      <title>Planet-Host Stars Across the Galaxy in the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By the 2040s, the exoplanet field will have moved from the discovery of a few thousand planets to hundreds of thousands, thanks to Gaia DR5, TESS, PLATO, Roman, and their successors. At that stage, the key bottleneck will no longer be planet detection, but our ability to understand how planetary systems form, evolve, and diversify across different stellar and Galactic environments.
  To address this, we need a large-scale, high-resolution spectroscopic survey of planet-host stars, spanning a broad range of Galactic environments (thin and thick disks, bulge, halo, clusters, associations), and including a well-defined control sample of non-hosts. Such a survey must deliver homogeneous stellar parameters, detailed abundance determinations, ages, and kinematics for tens of thousands of hosts, extending to the faint magnitudes probed by future missions but are beyond the reach of existing and currently planned spectroscopic facilities.</description>

      <title>Expanding the High-z Supernova Frontier: "Wide-Area" JWST Discoveries from the First Two Years of COSMOS-Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transient astronomy in the early Universe (z &gt; 2) remains largely unexplored, lying beyond the rest-frame optical spectroscopic reach of most current observatories. Yet this regime promises transformative insights, with high-redshift transients providing direct access to the early Universe and enabling studies of how stellar populations and cosmology evolve over cosmic time. JWST is uniquely equipped to probe these redshifts efficiently in the rest-frame optical and near-IR. We present results from an initial pathfinder search, covering an area of ~133 arcmin^2 (~0.037 deg^2) independently imaged by the PRIMER and COSMOS-Web (hereafter COSMOS) extragalactic surveys. Although neither program was designed for time-domain astronomy, combining their data results in difference images separated by roughly one year, leading to the discovery of 68 supernovae (SNe) with host photometric redshifts reaching z &lt; 5. For most SNe, only a single epoch is available, but the combination of host redshift, classification, color, and magnitude enables us to prioritize candidates for detailed photometric and spectroscopic follow-up. Among the most notable sources are a relatively bright, blue CCSN at z &gt; 3 (SN 2023aeab) and a young, normal SN Ia at z &gt; 2 (SN 2023aeax). The sample distribution highlights the increasing likelihood that a wide-area JWST program can uncover younger, bluer, and potentially more extreme explosions. While this pathfinder effort is limited in cadence and number of filters, it demonstrates the strong potential of a dedicated, well-planned time-domain survey with JWST to obtain the sample sizes and rate measurements needed to chart SN populations deep into the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Can photoevaporation open gaps in protoplanetary discs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether photoevaporation alone can open and sustain gaps in protoplanetary discs by coupling the evolving disc structure with the photoevaporative flow in two dimensional radiation hydrodynamical simulations. Our results show that once a density depression forms, the local mass-loss rate decreases sharply, suppressing further gap deepening. Viscous inflow and radial mass transport along the disc surface act to partially refill the depleted region, preventing complete clearing. The resulting configuration is a persistent, partially depleted zone whose evolution is largely insensitive to the initial disc morphology. This behaviour challenges the standard paradigm that photoevaporation efficiently carves clean inner cavities and directly produces transition discs. However, the pressure maximum at the outer edge of the depression may still trap dust grains, giving rise to transition disc like observational signatures. We also present a first-order prescription to approximate this behaviour in one dimensional disc evolution models, suitable for use in planet formation and population synthesis studies. Although the prescription improves upon static mass-loss treatments, it remains approximate, underscoring the need for further multidimensional simulations and parameter-space exploration to derive robust recipes for global disc and planet population models.</description>

      <title>Pre-Supernova Eruptions Triggered by Sudden Energy Deposition in Low-Mass Core-Collapse Supernova Progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In low-mass core-collapse supernova (CCSN) progenitors, nuclear burning beyond oxygen can become explosive under degenerate conditions, triggering eruptive mass loss before the final explosion. We investigate such pre-SN eruptions using \texttt{SNEC} hydrodynamic simulations and realistic stellar models, parameterizing the nuclear energy deposition as a fraction of the binding energy of the combined He layer and H-rich envelope. For the lowest-mass model (9 $M_\odot$), the ejecta mass ($M_{\rm ej}$) scales with the energy gained by the H-rich envelope via a power law (index$\sim$3.5). Across 9-10 $M_\odot$, this relation shows limited scatter within a factor of $\sim$2.6, enabling an estimation of the gained energy from $M_{\rm ej}$. The shock passage also flattens the bound envelope, which can affect the SN light curve morphology and provide another diagnostic for the eruption. Then, we compute the associated precursor light curves for the 9 $M_\odot$ model with the multi-group radiative-transfer code \texttt{STELLA}. These signals are typically faint, with bolometric luminosities of $\sim10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ lasting hundreds of days. Their cool black-body spectra make them brighter in the infrared, yet several magnitudes fainter than observed pre-SN precursors at the threshold for full envelope ejection. To aid future studies, we make our post-eruption stellar profiles and precursor light curves publicly available.</description>

      <title>True Masses using RV data with Hipparcos and Gaia Astrometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-period companions are detected and characterized thanks to long-baseline radial velocity surveys. Combining Doppler time-series with astrometry, and in particular with proper motion anomalies technique, it is possible to put strong constraints on their orbital inclination and true mass. This work aims to present a model that combines Hipparcos and Gaia astrometric data with radial velocity measurements to constrain the orbital inclinations and true masses of long-period companions. Additionally, we re-analyse a small sample of targets that have not yet been studied using this combined approach. This research leverages the simultaneous modelling of proper motion anomalies and radial velocities, in conjunction with an analysis of the sensitivity curve. This approach serves not only as a verification of the parameters but also as a means to acquire valuable insights into planetary systems. The new analyses reveal that some of the targets classified as brown dwarfs or small-mass stars have a planetary nature. HD 5388 b and HD 6718 b are likely planets. HD 141937 b is likely a planet, but the current dataset does not allow us to firmly constrain its true mass. HD 16760 b belongs to the brown dwarf regime and it has a probable second companion. 30 Ari B b falls within the stellar regime, but the presence of an additional stellar companion could compromise the reliability of the final results. For HD 148427 b, HD 96127 b and HIP 65891 b we determined a range for the orbital inclinations.</description>

      <title>Mass estimates of the young TOI-451 transiting planets: Multidimensional Gaussian Process on stellar spectroscopic and photometric signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The young TOI-451 planetary system, aged 125 Myr, provides a unique opportunity to test theories of planetary internal structures and atmospheric mass loss through examination of its three transiting planets. We present an exhaustive photometric and spectroscopic follow-up to determine the orbital and physical properties of the system. We perform multidimensional Gaussian Process regression with the code pyaneti on spectroscopic time-series and NGTS/LCO light curves to disentangle the stellar and planetary signal in ESPRESSO radial velocities. We show how contemporaneous photometry serves as an activity indicator to inform RV modelling within a multidimensional Gaussian Processes framework. We argue that this can be exploited when spectroscopic observations are adversely affected by low signal-to-noise and/or poor sampling. We estimate the Doppler semi-amplitudes of Kb = 2.6(+1.1,-1.2) m/s, Kc = 1.2(+1.0,-0.8) m/s and Kd = 2.7 +/- 1.2 m/s. This translates into 2-sigma mass estimates for TOI-451 b and d of Mb = 4.7(+2.1,-2.2) Earth masses and Md = 10.2(+4.6,-4.5) Earth masses, as well as a mass upper limit for TOI-451 c of Mc &lt; 11.5 Earth masses. The derived planetary properties suggest that planets c and d contain significant hydrogen-rich envelopes. The inferred parameters of TOI-451 b are consistent with either a rocky world that still retains a small hydrogen envelope or a water world. These insights make the TOI-451 system an ideal laboratory for future follow-up studies aimed at measuring atmospheric compositions, detecting atmospheric mass-loss signatures, and further exploring planetary formation and evolution processes.</description>

      <title>Constraining the size, shape, and albedo of the large Trans-Neptunian Object (28978) Ixion with multi-chord stellar occultations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) are among the most primitive remnants of the early Solar System, and constraining their sizes, shapes, albedos, and surface properties is essential for understanding their origin and evolution. Stellar occultations provide highly accurate size and shape measurements for TNOs, while photometry constrains their albedo and surface colours. (28978) Ixion is one of the largest TNOs and a prominent Plutino, making it a key target for comparative studies. We aim to constrain Ixion's projected size, shape, absolute magnitude, geometric albedo, and surface colours, and to search for evidence of an atmosphere or circum-object material. We analysed stellar occultation campaigns by Ixion conducted between 2020 and 2023 within the Lucky Star collaboration, comprising 51 observations from eight events, including 30 positive detections. Five multi-chord events enabled a global limb fit and an accurate reconstruction of Ixion's projected shape. The occultations reveal a slightly elongated limb well represented by a single projected ellipse, yielding an area-equivalent diameter of $D_{\mathrm{equiv}} = 696.78^{+10.75}_{-8.87}$ km and an apparent oblateness $\epsilon' = 0.081^{+0.004}_{-0.010}$. Typical radial residuals of order $\sim$10 km indicate a largely stable shape across epochs, with modest epoch-dependent variations. Calibrated photometric data yield an absolute magnitude of $H_V = 3.845 \pm 0.006$, a phase-curve slope of $\beta = 0.1301 \pm 0.0078$ mag deg$^{-1}$, and a visible geometric albedo of $p_V = 0.106^{+0.003}_{-0.003}$, with colours consistent with moderately red TNO surfaces. No atmosphere or circum-object material is detected down to our sensitivity limits. The best-sampled event also allows a precise measurement of the angular diameter of the occulted star Gaia DR3 4056440205544338944, $\theta_\star = 0.670 \pm 0.010$ mas.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a new open cluster as a companion to Czernik 38 cluster and its associated complex tide, using Gaia DR3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We utilize Gaia DR3 data to report the discovery of a new star cluster, Nasser 1, located 32 arcmin from Czernik 38 at coordinates $\alpha= 282.11 \pm 0.05$ and $\delta= 4.56 \pm 0.05$. Using a variable membership probability threshold technique with pyUPMASK, we confirm Nasser 1 as a genuine open cluster. It exhibits a distinct King profile and a well-defined CMD with an age of $125.0 \pm 12.30$ Myr, a distance modulus of $12.87 \pm 0.21$ mag, and a color excess of $2.42 \pm 0.09$. Nasser 1 shares consistent physical parameters (age, distance, kinematics, and reddening) with Czernik 38, suggesting they constitute a young primordial binary system in the Carina-Sagittarius spiral arm. Both clusters display elongations indicative of differential rotation tides; Nasser 1 is additionally perturbed by the spiral arm's gravitational field. Gaussian mass function analysis suggests the two were formerly a single cluster, violently torn apart by differential rotation.</description>

      <title>A self-consistent numerical model of internal wave-induced mean flow oscillations in polar geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Earth's Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) is a natural example of wave-mean flow interaction and corresponds to the alternating directions of winds in the equatorial stratosphere. It is due to internal gravity waves (IGW) generated in the underlying convective troposphere. In stars, a similar situation is predicted to occur, with the interaction of a stably-stratified radiative zone and a convective zone. In this context, we investigate the dynamics of this reversing mean flow by modelling a stably-stratified envelope and a convectively unstable core in polar geometry. Here, the coupling between the two zones is achieved self-consistently, and IGW generated through convection lead to the formation of a reversing azimuthal mean flow in the upper layer. We characterise the mean-flow oscillations by their periods, velocity amplitudes, and regularity. Despite a continuous broad spectrum of IGW, our work show good qualitative agreement with the monochromatic model of Plumb and McEwan (1978). If the latter was originally developed in the context of the Earth's QBO, our study could prove relevant for its stellar counterpart in massive stars, which host convective cores and radiative envelopes.</description>

      <title>Possible Dynamical Pathways to the Misalignment of the VHS 1256-1257 System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Circumbinary planets (CBPs) provide a unique window into planet formation and dynamical evolution in complex gravitational environments. Their orbits are shaped not only by the protoplanetary disk but also by the perturbations from two stellar hosts, making them sensitive probes of both early- and late-stage dynamical processes. In this work, we investigate the unusual architecture of the VHS J125601.92-125723.9 system, where a retrograde, nearly polar tertiary orbits an extremely low-mass substellar binary in a hierarchical triple configuration. We find that triple body dynamics can naturally reproduce the observed high eccentricity of the inner binary and the tertiary's near-polar obliquity. However, this configuration alone cannot account for the observed mutual inclination, which is both near-polar and retrograde. This tension suggests two possible formation pathways: either the planet formed in an aligned, protoplanetary disk-like configuration and was later tilted by an additional, undetected fourth companion (below current Gaia limits), or the system formed close to its current state. Stellar flybys, in contrast, are unlikely due to their long timescales. Our results highlight both the explanatory power and the limitations of triple dynamics, and the potential role of hidden companions in shaping extreme planetary architectures.</description>

Abstract: Many Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars have optically thick winds that cloak the hydrostatic layers of the underlying star. In these cases, traditional spectral analysis methods are plagued by degeneracies that make it difficult to constrain parameters such as the stellar radius and the deeper density and velocity structure of the atmosphere. Focussing on the regime of nitrogen-rich WN4-stars with strong emission lines, we employ hydrodynamically-consistent modelling using the PoWR-HD code branch to perform a next generation spectral analysis. The inherent coupling of the stellar and wind parameters enables us to break parameter degeneracies, constrain the wind structure, and get a mass estimate. With this information, we can draw evolutionary implications and test current mass-loss descriptions for WR stars. We selected a sample of six Galactic WN4b stars. Applying updated parallaxes from Gaia DR3 and calculating PoWR-HD models that sufficiently resemble most of their spectral appearance, we obtain new values for the stellar and wind parameters of the WN4b sample. We compare our results to previous studies employing grid models with a beta = 1 velocity structure and cross-check our derived parameters with stellar structure predictions from GENEC and FRANEC evolution tracks. For all six targets, we obtain a narrow range of stellar temperatures T~140 kK, in contrast to previous grid-model analyses. We confirm the existence of WRs with luminosities as low as log L/Lsol = 5.0 and M~5 Msol. All derived velocity fields include a plateau feature at ~85% of the terminal velocity. Both the distance updates and the switch to dynamically-consistent atmospheres lead to substantial parameter adjustments compared to earlier grid-based studies. A comparison of the derived mass-loss rates favours a different description for the WN4b sample than for WN2 stars analysed with the same methodology.</description>

      <title>Bridging the gap: consistent modeling of protoplanetary disk heating and gap formation by planet-induced spiral shocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A giant planet embedded in a protoplanetary disk excites spiral density waves, which steepen into shocks as they propagate away from the planet. These shocks lead to secular disk heating and gap opening, both of which can have important implications for the evolution of solids near the planet. To date, these two effects have largely been modeled independently. In this study, we present a self-consistent model that unifies these processes by linking shock heating and angular momentum deposition through the entropy jumps across the spiral shocks. We show that this model accurately reproduces the temperature and surface density profiles around the planet's orbit, as obtained from two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with standard $\alpha$ viscosity and $\beta$ thermal relaxation prescriptions. Furthermore, by incorporating an empirically derived scaling law for the radial distribution of the entropy jump, we construct a fully analytic model that self-consistently predicts the temperature and surface density structures of disks hosting a giant planet. This work represents a first step toward understanding how a giant planet forming in the inner disk region influences the distribution and composition of second-generation planets and planetesimals in its vicinity.</description>

Abstract: The transition regime between giant planets (GPs) and brown dwarfs (BDs) is still an open subject of study in exoplanetary science. A complete understanding of the population of long-period GPs and BDs would be pivotal in understanding this topic, but the number of such objects with precisely measured orbital and physical parameters is still small. Moreover, their dynamical influence on smaller companions in inner orbits is still unclear. Within the GAPS programme, we aim to confirm and characterize sub-stellar companion candidates from Gaia DR3, and to study the potential presence of additional lower-mass planets in their systems. We present the results of an intensive high-precision RV monitoring of HD 128717, which hosts the astrometric candidate Gaia-ASOI-009. We used the HARPS-N spectrograph at TNG to collect a high-cadence RV time series of the target. We used MCMC analyses to refine the Gaia DR3 orbital solution of the companion and, finally, performed a combined model of RV and proper motion anomaly (PMa) to derive the complete 3-D orbit of the companion. We also ran a suite of numerical simulations to confirm our results. We confirm the sub-stellar nature of Gaia-ASOI-009, i.e. Gaia-6 B: from the combined RV+PMa fit, we confirm that it is a high-eccentricity low-mass brown dwarf with $P_\text{B} = 9.37^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ yr, $M_\text{B} = 19.8 \pm 0.5$ $M_\text{J}$, $e_\text{B}=0.85$, $i_\text{B} = 130^{\circ}$. The derived orbital solution differs significantly from the one published in Gaia DR3. Through a series of dedicated simulations, we demonstrate that this discrepancy arises from a degeneracy in the Gaia DR3 astrometric solution. Specifically, the combination of Gaia-6 B long orbital period and high eccentricity, both poorly constrained by the limited timespan of DR3, led to an incorrect solution characterized by a shorter period and lower eccentricity.</description>

      <title>The Topological Origin of Bohm Resistivity in Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08054</link>

Abstract: The physical origin of 'anomalous' resistivity in magnetic reconnection remains one of the longest-standing problems in space plasma physics. While the empirical Bohm diffusion scaling ($\eta~\propto~T/B$) is widely invoked to explain fast reconnection rates, it lacks a rigorous derivation from first principles. Here, we derive this scaling by modeling the magnetized electron fluid as an overdamped spintronic condensate governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We demonstrate that the breakdown of the "frozen-in" condition is rigorously identified as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation in the model: a topological phase transition where electron gyro-axes lose synchronization with the magnetic field. By rigorously mapping the breakdown of adiabatic invariance to electron gyro axis slippage on the unit sphere, we show that the resulting resistivity naturally saturates at the Bohm limit. Numerical simulations of the $XY$ universality class confirm that the onset of this resistive state is explosive, following a logistic trigger consistent with the impulsive phase of solar flares. Furthermore, the topological defects in the condensate decay via a $t^{-0.75}$ power law, consistent with magnetic island coalescence as the mechanism of anomalous transport. These results suggest that Bohm resistivity is a universal topological property of magnetized matter at the critical point of reconnection.</description>
