      <title>Revealing an unexpectedly low electron injection threshold via reinforced shock acceleration</title>

Abstract: Collisionless shock waves, found in supernova remnants, interstellar, stellar, and planetary environments, and laboratories, are one of nature's most powerful particle accelerators. This study combines in situ satellite measurements with recent theoretical developments to establish a reinforced shock acceleration model for relativistic electrons. Our model incorporates transient structures, wave-particle interactions, and variable stellar wind conditions, operating collectively in a multiscale set of processes. We show that the electron injection threshold is on the order of suprathermal range, obtainable through multiple different phenomena abundant in various plasma environments. Our analysis demonstrates that a typical shock can consistently accelerate electrons into very high (relativistic) energy ranges, refining our comprehension of shock acceleration while providing insight on the origin of electron cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Regimes of spray formation in gas-centered swirl coaxial atomizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spray formation in ambient atmosphere from gas-centered swirl coaxial atomizers is described by carrying out experiments in a spray test facility. The atomizer discharges a circular air jet and an axisymmetric swirling water sheet from its coaxially arranged inner and outer orifices. A high-speed digital imaging system along with a backlight illumination arrangement is employed to record the details of liquid sheet breakup and spray development. Spray regimes exhibiting different sheet breakup mechanisms are identified and their characteristic features presented. The identified spray regimes are wave-assisted sheet breakup, perforated sheet breakup, segmented sheet breakup, and pulsation spray regime. In the regime of wave-assisted sheet breakup, the sheet breakup shows features similar to the breakup of two-dimensional planar air-blasted liquid sheets. At high air-to-liquid momentum ratios, the interaction process between the axisymmetric swirling liquid sheet and the circular air jet develops spray processes which are more specific to the atomizer studied here. The spray exhibits a periodic ejection of liquid masses whose features are dominantly controlled by the central air jet.</description>

      <title>Detection asymmetry in solar energetic particle events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08211v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are detected in interplanetary space in association with solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The magnetic connection between the observing spacecraft and the solar active region (AR) source of the event is a key parameter in determining whether SEPs are observed and the particle event's properties. Aims. We investigate whether an east-west asymmetry in the detection of SEP events is present in observations and discuss its possible link to corotation of magnetic flux tubes with the Sun. Methods. We used a published dataset of 239 CMEs recorded between 2006 and 2017 and having source regions both on the Sun's front and far sides as seen from Earth. We produced distributions of occurrence of in-situ SEP intensity enhancements associated with the CME events, versus \Delta\phi, the longitudinal separation between source active region and spacecraft magnetic footpoint based on the nominal Parker spiral. We focused on protons of energy &gt;10 MeV measured by STEREO A, STEREO B and GOES at 1 au. We also considered occurrences of 71-112 keV electron events detected by MESSENGER between 0.31 and 0.47 au. Results. We find an east-west asymmetry with respect to the best magnetic connection (\Delta\phi=0) in the detection of &gt;10 MeV proton events and of 71-112 keV electron events. For protons, observers for which the source AR is on the east side of the spacecraft footpoint and not well connected (-180&lt;\Delta\phi&lt;-40) are 93% more likely to detect an SEP event compared to observers with +40&lt;\Delta\phi&lt;+180. The asymmetry may be a signature of corotation of magnetic flux tubes with the Sun, since for events with \Delta\phi&lt;0 corotation sweeps particle-filled flux tubes towards the observing spacecraft, while for \Delta\phi&gt;0 it takes them away from it. Alternatively it may be related to asymmetric acceleration or propagation effects.</description>
