      <title>The Discovery of Neptune Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of the differences detected between the observed and the predicted positions of Uranus taking only the ancient planets into account led to the discovery of planet Neptune in 1846. This event remains one of the best accomplishments ever achieved in the history of Astronomy and Classical Mechanics. In this paper, we study the perturbations in the orbit of Uranus due to Neptune and its effects from a modern numerical point of view of the $N$-body problem. The effects induced by Pluto in the orbit of Neptune, as the historical search for a ninth planet in the Solar System (recently boostered again with the hypothesis of the so-called Planet Nine) back in the days was propelled by some supposed small inconsistencies in the orbit of the ice giants, are also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Does quantum mechanics require "conspiracy"?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13275v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum states containing records of incompatible outcomes of quantum measurements are valid states in the tensor-product Hilbert space. Since they contain false records, they conflict with the Born rule and with our observations. I show that excluding them requires a fine-tuning to an extremely restricted subspace of the Hilbert space that seems "conspiratorial", in the sense that (1) it seems to depend on future events that involve records (including measurement settings) and on the dynamical law (normally thought to be independent of the initial conditions), and (2) it violates Statistical Independence, even when it is valid in the context of Bell's theorem. To solve the puzzle, I build a model in which, by changing the dynamical law, the same initial conditions can lead to different histories in which the validity of records is relative to the new dynamical law. This relative validity of the records may restore causality, but the initial conditions still must depend, at least partially, on the dynamical law. While violations of Statistical Independence are often seen as non-scientific, they turn out to be needed to ensure the validity of records and our own memories and, by this, of science itself. A Past Hypothesis is needed to ensure the existence of records and turns out to require violations of Statistical Independence. It is not excluded that its explanation, still unknown, ensures such violations in the way needed by local interpretations of quantum mechanics. I suggest that an as-yet unknown law or superselection rule may restrict the full tensor-product Hilbert space to the very special subspace required by the validity of records and the Past Hypothesis.</description>
