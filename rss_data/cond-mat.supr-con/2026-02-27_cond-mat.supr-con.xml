      <title>Inhomogeneous superconductivity in (001), (110) and (111) KTaO$_3$ two-dimensional electronic gas: $T_c$ driven from electronic confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate superconductivity in KTaO$_3$ (KTO)-based two-dimensional electron gases for the (001), (110), and (111) crystallographic orientations within a unified microscopic framework. Using a self-consistent tight-binding slab model, we determine the confinement potential, electronic structure, and orbital composition for each orientation, explicitly including inversion-symmetry-induced orbital Rashba couplings. Using a local spin-singlet s-wave pairing interaction, we find that the pronounced orientation dependence of the superconducting critical temperature primarily originates from differences in the spatial extent of the two-dimensional electron gas and the associated redistribution of the density of states at the Fermi level, rather than from changes in the pairing interaction. Our results provide a microscopic explanation for the experimentally observed orientation dependence of superconductivity at KTO-based interfaces.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of superconductivity by disorder in Remeika-type quasiskutterudites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic-scale disorder is conventionally regarded as detrimental to superconductivity; however, under specific conditions, it can enhance superconducting properties. Here, we investigate the role of substitutional disorder in Remeika-type quasiskutterudites $R_3M_4$Sn$_{13}$ and $R_5M_6$Sn$_{18}$ ($R=$ Y, La, Lu; $M=$ Co, Rh, Ru) by combining measurements of magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, and heat capacity with microscopic modeling. We demonstrate that increasing disorder leads to the emergence of locally superconducting regions characterized by an enhanced critical temperature $T_c^{\ast}$, exceeding the bulk transition temperature $T_c$.
  Both $T_c^\ast$ and $T_c$ exhibit a nonmonotonic dependence on dopant concentration and show a strong correlation with entropy isotherms measured as a function of disorder. The pronounced entropy maxima coincide with the largest separation between $T_c^{\ast}$ and $T_c$, establishing disorder as a thermodynamically controlled parameter governing superconductivity in these materials. Measurements of the upper critical field reveal distinct $H_{c2}(T)$ branches associated with the bulk and locally superconducting phases, providing direct experimental evidence for a percolative superconducting state.
  To interpret these observations, we propose a microscopic model that captures the interplay between the impurity-induced enhancement of local pairing and the disorder-driven suppression of global superconducting coherence. The model reproduces the experimentally observed nonmonotonic evolution of $T_c^{\ast}$ with disorder and supports a percolation-based interpretation of the superconducting transition. Our results demonstrate that controlled atomic disorder can serve as an effective materials-design parameter for tuning superconductivity in complex correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Moire Engineering of Cooper-Pair Density Modulation States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooper-pair density modulation (CPDM) states are superconducting phases in which the order parameter varies periodically in real space without breaking translational symmetry. Recently, moire superlattices in layered materials have emerged as powerful platforms for engineering charge density with tunable lattice symmetry, offering a new route to creating and controlling CPDM states. In this work, we demonstrate moire-induced CPDM states in a bilayer heterostructure formed by epitaxially stacking one quintuple layer (1 QL) of topological insulator Sb2Te3 on a six-unit-cell (6 UC) antiferromagnetic FeTe layer. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S) measurements reveal a moir\'e superlattice formed between the hexagonal Te lattice of Sb2Te3 and the square Te lattice of FeTe, which spatially modulates the two superconducting gaps of the 1 QL Sb2Te3/6 UC FeTe bilayer. Our Josephson STM/S measurements provide direct real-space imaging of the CPDM states with a wavelength corresponding to the periodicity of the moire superlattice. By substituting Sb2Te3 with Bi2Te3, we achieve control over both the periodicity and magnitude of the CPDM states. Our work demonstrates an epitaxial strategy for synthesizing moire superlattices from materials with different crystal symmetries and reveals a new mechanism for engineering CPDM states in designer bilayer heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Emergence of chiral $p$-wave and $d$-wave states in $g$-wave altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets emerge as a novel platform for realizing unconventional superconductivity through their exotic momentum-dependent spin-splitting of electronic band structures. Recent experiments have uncovered a novel form of altermagnetism with distinctive $g$-wave symmetry in CrSb. However, the potential for unconventional superconductivity arising from $g$-wave altermagnetism in such systems remains largely unexplored. In this study, we discover the emergence of chiral superconducting states in three-dimensional $g$-wave altermagnetic metals. Through systematic self-consistent mean-field analysis on the extended attractive Hubbard model combined with $g$-wave altermagnetic exchange fields in a three-dimensional hexagonal lattice, as observed in CrSb, we find that the altermagnetic spin splitting of Fermi surfaces favors chiral $p$-wave states as the dominant pairing channel under strong altermagnetic fields and high electron densities, while chiral $d$-wave states become predominant under weak altermagnetic fields and intermediate electron densities. Conversely, at weak altermagnetic fields and typical electron densities, non-chiral $s$-, extended $s$-, or $f$-wave states become stabilized. We also showcase the possible experimental detection using the quasiparticle energy dispersions and the density of states to distinguish different pairing symmetries. These findings underscore the potential of $g$-wave altermagnets to host sought-after chiral and gapless superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Interaction and disorder effects on Cooper instability in two-dimensional fractional Dirac semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing a renormalization group analysis that allows for an unbiased treatment of competing physical ingredients, we systematically trace how the interplay between Cooper pairing and disorder scatterings governs the emergence or suppression of Cooper instability in the low-energy regime of fractional Dirac semimetals.In the clean limit, we find that the emergence of Cooper instability requires surpassing a finite interaction threshold $|\lambda_c|$, and depends sensitively on both the fractional exponent $\alpha$ and the transfer momentum $\mathbf{Q}=(Q,\phi)$. Specifically, bigger values of $\alpha$ enhance the tendency toward BCS instability. For $\alpha\in(0.001,0.61)$, the $(Q,\phi)$ parameter space separates into two distinct regions: Zone-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1}, where Cooper instability is suppressed, and Zone-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}, where it is allowed. In the presence of disorders, we demonstrate that they can either promote or suppress Cooper instability. Disorder of type $\Delta_1$ or $\Delta_2$ enhances superconductivity by reducing the critical interaction threshold $|\lambda_c|$ and expanding the superconducting phase space (Zone-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}). In sharp contrast, either $\Delta_0$ or $\Delta_3$ suppresses Cooper pairing by increasing $|\lambda_c|$ and shrinking the available phase space (Zone-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1}). Although Cooper instability can be enhanced when promotive disorders ($\Delta_1$, $\Delta_2$) coexist with a single suppressive disorder ($\Delta_0$ or $\Delta_3$), the suppressive influence of $\Delta_{0,3}$ generally dominates the promotive effects of $\Delta_{1,2}$ in the presence of all sorts of disorders. These results would be helpful for further studies of fractional Dirac semimetals and alike materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetoresistance Oscillations in Few-Layer NbSe2 in Superconducting Fluctuation Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum interference phenomena in superconductors, such as Josephson interference and Little-Parks oscillations, serve as powerful probes of phase coherence, symmetry breaking and vortex dynamics. However, they are typically observed in well-defined mesoscopic structures, and their behavior in the two-dimensional limit remains largely unexplored. Here, we report periodic magnetoresistance oscillations, superconducting interference patterns, and interfering diode effect in unpatterned few-layer NbSe2. These phenomena emerge exclusively within the superconducting fluctuation regime of thin samples, consistent with the enhanced anomalous metallic behavior of atomically thin NbSe2. The non-monotonic temperature dependence of both the oscillation amplitude and the diode efficiency can be captured by a model in which thermally activated vortices traverse intrinsic supercurrent loops. Our results reveal that the observed interference phenomena originate from the lost of global phase coherence, providing a new route to accessing interference effects in unpatterned superconductors.</description>

      <title>Hourglass Dirac chains enable intrinsic topological superconductivity in nonsymmorphic silicides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonsymmorphic crystalline symmetries provide a robust route to symmetry-protected electronic topology, yet their role in stabilizing intrinsic topological superconductivity remains largely unexplored. Here, we report \ch{TaPtSi} as a new member of the superconducting nonsymmorphic silicide family, characterized via AC transport, magnetization, heat capacity, and muon spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements. Zero field $\mu$SR reveals spontaneous internal magnetic fields below $T_{\rm c}$, establishing time reversal symmetry breaking in \ch{TaPtSi}. First principles calculations on \ch{TaPtSi} and its isostructural nonsymmorphic superconducting analogues reveal the presence of symmetry-protected hourglass dispersions. The "necks" of these dispersions form Dirac nodal rings and chains that reside near or intersect the Fermi level. Guided by Ginzburg Landau symmetry analysis, we identify an internally antisymmetric non unitary triplet pairing state as the unique ground state consistent with the experimental phenomenology. Based on Bogoliubov de Gennes calculations, we further demonstrate that this state supports Majorana surface modes, establishing its intrinsically topological nature. These results reveal a systematic route by which nonsymmorphic symmetry drives the interplay between hourglass Dirac chain topology and unconventional triplet pairing, positioning equiatomic silicides as a unified materials platform for intrinsic topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Surface-localized topological superconductivity in nodal-loop materials: BdG analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study surface superconductivity in a nodal-line semimetal by combining a minimal tight-binding model with a layer-resolved Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach. In the normal state, the model realizes a bulk nodal loop and an associated drumhead surface band in a slab geometry with open boundaries in the $z$ direction: the central layers reproduce the bulk-like density of states, whereas the surface layer exhibits a sharp zero-energy peak originating from the drumhead states. On top of this band structure we introduce chiral $p$-wave and $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconducting channels and determine the layer-dependent gap amplitudes self-consistently. The chiral $p$-wave order parameter is strongly enhanced at the outermost layers and decays within only a few layers towards the interior, while the $d$-wave order parameter is more than an order of magnitude smaller on all layers. The quasiparticle dispersion and surface local density of states in the chiral $p$-wave state show that the drumhead band is efficiently gapped out and that the zero-energy peak in the normal surface spectrum is split into two coherence peaks, directly reflecting the induced superconducting gap. These results demonstrate that superconductivity driven by drumhead surface states is naturally biased toward a surface-localized chiral $p$-wave pairing symmetry and may offer qualitative guidance for interpreting surface-sensitive experiments on Pd-doped CaAgP.</description>

      <title>Pressure-induced reentrant superconductivity in a misfit layered compound $\mathrm{(SnS)_{1.15}(TaS_2)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Misfit layered compounds are natural van der Waals heterostructures in which electronically active transition-metal dichalcogenide layers are decoupled by incommensurate blocking layers, enabling bulk realization of quasi-two-dimensional quantum states. Here we investigate the superconducting, transport,and structural properties of the misfit compound $\mathrm{(SnS)_{1.15}(TaS_2)}$ under pressures up to 150 GPa. The low-pressure superconducting phase is gradually suppressed and disappears near 14.7 GPa,accompanied by increasing residual resistance. Remarkably, a distinct superconducting phase reemerges above 80 GPa and persists to the highest pressures achieved. This reentrant superconductivity follows a pressure-induced sign reversal of the Hall coefficient near 60 GPa and a nonmonotonic evolution of the normal-state resistance, indicating an electronic reconstruction. No structural phase transition is detected over the entire pressure range. Our results demonstrate a pressure-driven electronic reconstruction leading to reentrant superconductivity in a misfit layered compound, establishing pressure as an effective route to engineer superconductivity and electronic states in natural van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Threefold error in the reported zero-field cooled magnetic moment of single crystal $La_2SmNi_2O_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a relatively long time, the observation of the DC diamagnetic state in highly compressed nickelate superconductors [1],[2] has been a challenging experimental problem. And recently Li et al.[3] reported on the measurements of the DC diamagnetism in zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) pressurized single crystal $La_2SmNi_2O_7$. From the analysis of experimental data, Li et al.[3] reported that the superconducting phase fraction in their $La_2SmNi_2O_7$ sample measured in the ZFC mode is 62.1%, and the superconducting phase fraction in the FC mode is 14.4%. It should be clarified that we regard the measurements of the DC diamagnetic state [3] in $La_2SmNi_2O_7$ (and more recently in $Pr_4Ni_3O_{10}$ [4]) as outstanding experimental results confirming bulk superconductivity in pressurized nickelates. However, we should note that Li et al.[3] made a threefold error in their calculations of the superconducting phase fraction in $La_2SmNi_2O_7$. We believe that correcting this and other errors in Ref.[3] will benefit the physics community.</description>

      <title>Memory-Dominated Quantum Criticality as a Universal Route to High-Temperature Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamical origin of high--temperature superconductivity remains a central challenge of strongly correlated quantum matter. Conventional approaches to quantum criticality assume overdamped Markovian dissipation governed by Ohmic Landau damping. Here we show that infrared collective dynamics is instead generically controlled by the time--scale density of states (TDOS) of relaxation modes. Within the Martin--Siggia--Rose--Janssen--De Dominicis formalism, we derive an exact spectral representation of the collective susceptibility in terms of the TDOS. A finite infrared TDOS defines a new universality class of memory--dominated critical dynamics characterized by long--time kernels $K(t)\sim1/t$ and nonanalytic dynamical response. This spectral reorganization produces a strong infrared amplification of the particle--particle channel, converting the marginal instabilities of BCS and Eliashberg theories into algebraic superconducting transitions. As a result, the transition temperature scales linearly with the infrared spectral weight of slow collective modes, naturally yielding superconducting domes and Uemura scaling without invoking bosonic glue or fine tuning. The same slow--mode reservoir governs anomalous normal--state dynamics, including long--time correlations and strange--metal behavior, providing a unified description of thermodynamic and dynamical phenomena in correlated superconductors. Our results establish dynamical spectral organization as a fundamental principle of quantum critical matter and identify memory--dominated criticality as a generic route to high--temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Single Photon Counting with Kinetic Inductance Detectors from 3.8 to 25 $\mu$m</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the primary objectives of modern astronomy is the atmospheric characterization of Earth-like exoplanets at visible and infrared wavelengths. Achieving this goal requires extremely sensitive detectors capable of measuring faint signal of the exoplanet at the single-photon level while maintaining near-zero dark count rates. In the infrared, however, conventional semiconducting detector technologies struggle to meet these stringent requirements. In this work we demonstrate single-photon counting with superconducting Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors at the wavelengths 3.8, 8.5, 18.5, and 25 $\mu$m and measure resolving powers ($E/\delta E$) of 9.9, 5.9, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively, with corresponding dark count rates of 4, 8, 34, and 48 mHz. Our membrane-based devices reach phonon-loss limited performance at 3.8 $\mu$m, more than doubling the performance attainable with comparable solid-substrate devices. These results showcase the detector technology in the mid-infrared and the intricate measurement setup required for these sensitive detectors. We discuss how the detector design and measurement setup can be further optimized to increase the detector performance in the mid-infrared.</description>

      <title>Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum transition in 2 dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition is the prototype of a phase transition driven by the formation and interaction of topological defects in two-dimensional (2D) systems. In typical models these are vortices: above a transition temperature $T_{\rm BKT}$ vortices are free, below this transition temperature they get confined. In this work we extend the concept of BKT transition to quantum systems in two dimensions. In particular, we demonstrate that a zero-temperature quantum BKT phase transition, driven by a coupling constant can occur in 2D models governed by an effective gauge field theory with a diverging dielectric constant. One particular example is that of a compact U(1) gauge theory with a diverging dielectric constant, where the quantum BKT transition is induced by non-relativistic, purely 2D magnetic monopoles, which can be viewed also as electric vortices. These quantum BKT transitions have the same diverging exponent $z$ as the quantum Griffiths transition but have nothing to do with disorder.</description>

      <title>Microwave surface resistance of Tl-1223 films in a dc magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present first preliminary surface impedance measurements on Tl-1223 films in dc magnetic fields, in view of potential applications for the next generation Future Circular Collider (FCC-hh) at CERN. The Tl-1223 samples were produced through laser ablation, with nominal thickness of 1 {\mu}m and grown on a thick LaAl2O3 substrate. The presence of Tl-1212 phase identified by XRD and BSE microscopy, could be avoided by changing the oxygen partial pressure during heat treatment. The high-frequency transport properties of the samples were characterized using microwave resonant devices, at fixed frequencies of 14.9 GHz, 24.2 GHz and 26.7 GHz, in the temperature range 40 K to 140 K. An external applied static magnetic field up to 12 T was applied. Samples from subsequent batches exhibited huge improvements in the microwave properties, confirming the progress in the deposition technique.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and magnetism in bilayer nickelates: itinerant perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study superconductivity and magnetism in bilayer nickelates from an itinerant perspective. Starting from a tight binding fit to recent ARPES measurements on compressively strained thin films, we incorporate the standard set of onsite repulsive interactions among partially filled $e_g$ orbitals: intra-orbital $U$, inter-orbital $U'$, Hund's coupling $J_H$ and a pair hopping $J_P$. We obtain the effective pairing interaction by dressing these bare interactions with particle-hole fluctuations via the RPA. In the strong Hund's coupling regime, we find that $s$-wave superconductivity and $(\pi/2, \pi/2)$ SDW order are the favored ground states. With weaker Hund's coupling, we find that $d$-wave pairing and $(\pi, \pi)$ SDW are the leading ground states. Our results are qualitatively consistent with earlier DMRG studies, and point to the key role played by Hund's coupling in determining the nature of superconductivity and magnetism in this system.</description>

      <title>Giant and robust Josephson diode effect in multiband topological nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05772v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically predict the giant and robust Josephson diode effect in quasi-one-dimensional topological Majorana nanowires in the regime with multiple subbands, which is expected to be relevant for the real experiment. In the multiband regime, the Majorana bound states and conventional Andreev bound states can naturally coexist, and respectively contribute to the fractional and conventional parts in the Josephson effect, with the former/latter having 4$\pi$/2$\pi$-periodicity. We show that the interplay between the two types of bound modes can produce a robust and giant diode effect in the deep topological phase regime. Notably, we unveil a novel spin parity exchange mechanism, occurring only in the multiband regime, which leads to a robust high efficiency plateau of the giant diode effect. This effect is a nontrivial consequence of the balanced Fermi moment shifts of the multiple subbands in tuning the external magnetic field. Our finding highlights the subband engineering as a powerful tool to optimize the Josephson diode effect realistically and provides a new feasible signature to identify topological phase regime in superconducting nanowires.</description>

      <title>Quantum critical behavior of cuprate superconductors observed by inelastic X-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Progress toward a complete understanding of cuprate superconductors has been hindered by their intricate phase diagram, potentially linked to a quantum critical point (QCP). However, conclusive evidence for the QCP is lacking, as the presumed QCP is buried under the superconducting dome, disguising its presence. Here, we use high-resolution resonant inelastic X-ray scattering to examine the dynamical charge-charge correlation in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ and uncover the quantum critical scaling, a key feature required for a QCP. Specifically, \djh{we observed that the inverse correlation lengths for various dopings and temperatures collapsed onto a universal scaling curve, yielding a critical exponent $\nu$ of $0.74 \pm 0.08$. The non-negativity of this exponent confirms the presence of a QCP. Remarkably, the value of $\nu$ suggests that while the QCP is manifested through the charge-density wave, other orders also participate, such that the QCP appears to belong to the universality class characterized by the O(4) symmetry, reminiscent of the microscopic SO(4) symmetry in the Hubbard model at half-filling. Further analysis indicates that the QCP is highly dissipative with a short quasi-particle lifetime, reflecting the intertwined quantum fluctuations due to its being buried inside the superconducting state.</description>
