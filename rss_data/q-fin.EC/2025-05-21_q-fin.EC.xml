      <title>Designing a Multi-Period Model for Economic and Low-Carbon Hydrogen Transportation in Texas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to hydrogen powered transportation requires regionally tailored yet scalable infrastructure planning. This study presents the first Texas specific, multi-period mixed integer optimization model for hydrogen transportation from 2025 to 2050, addressing challenges in infrastructure phasing, asset coordination, and multimodal logistics. The framework introduces three innovations: (1) phased deployment with delayed investment constraints, (2) dynamic modeling of fleet aging and replacement, and (3) a clustering-based hub structure enabling adaptive two-stage hydrogen delivery. Simulations show pipeline deployment supports up to 94.8% of hydrogen flow by 2050 under high demand, reducing transport costs by 23% compared to vehicle-based systems. However, one-year construction delays reduce pipeline coverage by over 60%, shifting reliance to costlier road transport. While the study focuses on Texas, its modular design and adaptable inputs apply to other regions. It provides a tool for policy makers and stakeholders to manage hydrogen transitions under logistical and economic constraints.</description>

      <title>Conglomerates, Liquidity Shocks, and Innovation-Led Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I develop a dynamic model of how internal capital markets in conglomerates respond to liquidity shocks when affiliated firms vary in innovation potential. A two-stage framework defines cutoff rules for when the conglomerate should liquidate low-productivity firms, coerce intermediate types into short-termist strategies, or preserve high-potential firms for long-horizon R&amp;D. Embedding these margins into an endogenous growth model, I show how the optimal policy evolves: early in development, coercion preserves liquidity while sustaining broad innovation; as the economy nears the frontier and short-term returns decline, the optimal strategy shifts toward binary reallocation between liquidation and long-termism. I characterize two policy failures: a "coercion trap," where short-termism persists too long, and a "liquidation fallacy," where viable firms are discarded prematurely. The framework provides microfoundations for dynamic reallocation in conglomerate systems and offers policy insights for crisis-era restructuring.</description>

      <title>Effects of system-blind prosumers in energy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prosumer households that generate and store electricity from rooftop PV installations play an increasing role in electricity markets around the world. As retail tariffs usually do not convey time-varying wholesale price signals to households and the rollout of smart meters is low in many countries, prosumers do not necessarily self-consume and feed-in solar electricity in a system-friendly way. The effects of such system-blind behaviours are typically neglected in energy system models, which rarely account for prosumers. In this paper, we embed a calibrated self-generation constraint into a linear capacity expansion model to approximate the incentives of prosumers to minimise their electricity bills. We apply our method to a German case study for 2030 featuring sector coupling with battery electric vehicles. We show that parametrising the self-generation constraint such that the prosumer electricity bill is as low as possible approximates prosumer decisions well for a broad range of tariff schemes. Based on this, we quantify distortions that might arise in energy models that do not account for prosumers. For our case study, we find that the optimal battery storage capacity increases by up to 200% if prosumer constraints are included. The main driver is the imperfect substitutability between home and utility-scale batteries. We conclude that energy system models could benefit from implementing this straightforward method.</description>

      <title>Keeping in Place After the Storm-Emergency Assistance and Evictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We offer evidence that federal emergency assistance (FEMA) in the days following natural disasters mitigate evictions in comparison to similar emergency scenarios where FEMA aid is not provided. We find a 16% increase in overall evictions after hurricane natural disaster events that can be decomposed to a 36% increase for those that do not receive FEMA rental assitance and only a 11% for hurricane events that do receive FEMA aid. Furthermore, we also show that FEMA aid acts as a liquidity buffer to other forms of emergency credit, specifically we find that both transactions volumes remain stable and result in a decrease in defaults by 19% in payday loans during hurricane events in locations that do receive FEMA aid. This effect largely reverses in areas that do not receive FEMA aid, where transaction volumes drop by 12\% and default rates remain similar relative to the baseline. Overall, this suggests that the availability of emergency liquidity during natural disaster events is indeed a binding constraint with real household financial consequences, in particular through our documented channel of evictions and in usage of high-cost credit.</description>

      <title>Generative AI at the Crossroads: Light Bulb, Dynamo, or Microscope?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of generative AI (genAI), the potential scope of artificial intelligence has increased dramatically, but the future effect of genAI on productivity remains uncertain with the effect of the technology on the innovation process a crucial open question. Some labor-saving innovations, such as the light bulb, temporarily raise productivity growth as adoption spreads, but the effect fades when the market is saturated; that is, the level of output per hour is permanently higher but the growth rate is not. In contrast, two types of technologies stand out as having longer-lived effects on productivity growth. First, there are technologies known as general-purpose technologies (GPTs). GPTs are (1) widely adopted, (2) spur abundant knock-on innovations (new goods and services, process efficiencies, and business reorganization), and (3) improve continuously, refreshing this innovation cycle; the electric dynamo is an example. Second, there are inventions of methods of invention (IMIs). IMIs increase the efficiency of the research and development process, generating new ideas more quickly and cheaply; the compound microscope is an example. We show that GenAI has the characteristics of both a GPT and an IMI -- an encouraging sign. Even so, for genAI to boost productivity growth, its contribution will have to exceed the fading growth effects of past IT innovations baked into the trend, including predecessor AI technologies.</description>

      <title>CATS: Clustering-Aggregated and Time Series for Business Customer Purchase Intention Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting customers' purchase intentions is critical to the success of a business strategy. Current researches mainly focus on analyzing the specific types of products that customers are likely to purchase in the future, little attention has been paid to the critical factor of whether customers will engage in repurchase behavior. Predicting whether a customer will make the next purchase is a classic time series forecasting task. However, in real-world purchasing behavior, customer groups typically exhibit imbalance - i.e., there are a large number of occasional buyers and a small number of loyal customers. This head-to-tail distribution makes traditional time series forecasting methods face certain limitations when dealing with such problems. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a unified Clustering and Attention mechanism GRU model (CAGRU) that leverages multi-modal data for customer purchase intention prediction. The framework first performs customer profiling with respect to the customer characteristics and clusters the customers to delineate the different customer clusters that contain similar features. Then, the time series features of different customer clusters are extracted by GRU neural network and an attention mechanism is introduced to capture the significance of sequence locations. Furthermore, to mitigate the head-to-tail distribution of customer segments, we train the model separately for each customer segment, to adapt and capture more accurately the differences in behavioral characteristics between different customer segments, as well as the similar characteristics of the customers within the same customer segment. We constructed four datasets and conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CAGRU approach.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Hiring and Diversity: Reducing Human-Algorithm Similarity for Better Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic tools are increasingly used in hiring to improve fairness and diversity, often by enforcing constraints such as gender-balanced candidate shortlists. However, we show theoretically and empirically that enforcing equal representation at the shortlist stage does not necessarily translate into more diverse final hires, even when there is no gender bias in the hiring stage. We identify a crucial factor influencing this outcome: the correlation between the algorithm's screening criteria and the human hiring manager's evaluation criteria -- higher correlation leads to lower diversity in final hires. Using a large-scale empirical analysis of nearly 800,000 job applications across multiple technology firms, we find that enforcing equal shortlists yields limited improvements in hire diversity when the algorithmic screening closely mirrors the hiring manager's preferences. We propose a complementary algorithmic approach designed explicitly to diversify shortlists by selecting candidates likely to be overlooked by managers, yet still competitive according to their evaluation criteria. Empirical simulations show that this approach significantly enhances gender diversity in final hires without substantially compromising hire quality. These findings highlight the importance of algorithmic design choices in achieving organizational diversity goals and provide actionable guidance for practitioners implementing fairness-oriented hiring algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Perfect Storm: First-Nature Geography and Economic Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1825 a storm cut a new channel through Denmark's Limfjord, providing an exogenous shock to first-nature geography. Difference-in-differences estimates show the channel increased trade immediately and, within a generation, lifted population by 26.7 percent - an elasticity of 1.6 relative to the improved market access. Higher fertility and economic growth of new industries, not migration, drove the expansion. A mirror experiment - the waterway's closure circa 1086-1208 - caused symmetric declines in medieval coin and building finds, bolstering external validity. These results offer the first robust causal evidence that first-nature geomorphology shapes the location of economic activity.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms for belief elicitation without ground truth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07277v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review article examines the challenge of eliciting truthful information from multiple individuals when such information cannot be verified, a problem known as information elicitation without verification (IEWV). This article reviews over 25 mechanisms designed to incentivize truth-telling in such scenarios and their effectiveness in empirical studies. Although many mechanisms theoretically ensure truthfulness as a Bayesian Nash Equilibrium, empirical evidence regarding the effects of mechanisms on truth-telling is limited and generally weak. Consequently, more empirical research is needed to validate mechanisms. However, empirical validaton is difficult because most mechanisms are very complex and cannot be easily conveyed to research subjects. This review suggests that simple and intuitive mechanisms may be easier to empirically test and apply.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence, Scientific Discovery, and Product Innovation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the impact of artificial intelligence on innovation, exploiting the randomized introduction of a new materials discovery technology to 1,018 scientists in the R&amp;D lab of a large U.S. firm. AI-assisted researchers discover 44% more materials, resulting in a 39% increase in patent filings and a 17% rise in downstream product innovation. These compounds possess more novel chemical structures and lead to more radical inventions. However, the technology has strikingly disparate effects across the productivity distribution: while the bottom third of scientists see little benefit, the output of top researchers nearly doubles. Investigating the mechanisms behind these results, I show that AI automates 57% of "idea-generation" tasks, reallocating researchers to the new task of evaluating model-produced candidate materials. Top scientists leverage their domain knowledge to prioritize promising AI suggestions, while others waste significant resources testing false positives. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of AI-augmented research and highlight the complementarity between algorithms and expertise in the innovative process. Survey evidence reveals that these gains come at a cost, however, as 82% of scientists report reduced satisfaction with their work due to decreased creativity and skill underutilization.</description>
