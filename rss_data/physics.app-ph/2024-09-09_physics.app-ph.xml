      <title>Experimental realization of an active time-modulated acoustic circulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reciprocity is one of the fundamental characteristics of wave propagation in linear time-invariant media with preserved time-reversal symmetry. Breaking reciprocity opens the way to numerous applications in the fields of phononics and photonics, as it allows the unidirectional transport of information and energy carried by waves. In acoustics, achieving non-reciprocal behavior remains a challenge, for which time-varying media are one of the solutions. Here, we design and experimentally demonstrate a three-port non-reciprocal acoustic scatterer that behaves as a circulator for audible sound, by actively modulating the effective mass of the acoustic membranes over time. We discuss the conception and experimental validation of such an acoustic circulator, implemented with actively controlled loudspeakers, in the realm of audible and airborne acoustics, and demonstrate its good performance in different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Controlling Raman enhancement in particle-aperture hybrid nanostructures by interlayer spacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we show how surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) features can be fine-tuned in optically active substrates made of layered materials. To demonstrate this, we used DNA-assisted lithography (DALI) to create substrates with silver bowtie nanoparticle-aperture pairs and then coated the samples with rhodamine 6G (R6G) molecules. By varying the spacing between the aperture and particle layer, we were able to control the strength of the interlayer coupling between the plasmon resonances of the apertures and those of the underlying bowtie particles. The changes in the resulting field enhancements were confirmed by recording the Raman spectra of R6G from the substrates, and the experimental findings were supported with finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations including reflection/extinction and near-field profiles.</description>

      <title>Measuring Non-linearity in AH 2700A Capacitance Bridges with sub-ppm level uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability and non-linearity of a commercial AH 2700A capacitance bridge were studied beyond its specified capabilities using the Thompson-Lampard Calculable Capacitor (TLCC) at LNE. The TLCC allows for continuous variation of measured capacitance between 0.4 pF and 1.2 pF with a resolution of 2 parts in $10^{7}$ and stability better than 1 part in $10^{9}$ over 2 days. The study aimed to determine root cause of the saw-tooth non-linearity pattern observed in the AH 2700A capacitance bridge. This pattern becomes apparent when the internal calibration is no longer valid, indicating deviations in the bridge circuit. Additionally, the dependence of capacitance non-linearity on various factors such as frequency and capacitance value are described. This work enables automatic calibration of the commercial bridge with an uncertainty of sub-ppm level and allows for quick evaluation of TLCC's non-linearity and monitoring of any changes over time through in-situ measurements.</description>

      <title>Water-induced high-performance quantum-dot light-emitting diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solution-processed light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are appealing for their potential in the low-cost fabrication of large-area devices. However, the limited performance of solution-processed blue LEDs, particularly their short operation lifetime, is hindering their practical use in display technologies. Here, we demonstrate that trace water in device, previously considered detrimental to most solution-processed LEDs, dramatically enhances the performance of quantum-dot LEDs (QLEDs). This breakthrough stems from our comprehensive mechanism investigations into the positive ageing phenomenon, a long-standing puzzle in the QLED field. Our findings reveal that water passivation on the surface of electron-transport layers, which are composed of zinc-oxide-based nanoparticles, improves charge transport and enhances exciton radiative recombination during device operation. Combined with the advanced top-emitting architecture, our blue QLEDs achieve a high current efficiency of 35.5 cd A-1, a blue index (colour coordinate corrected current efficiency) of over 470 cd A-1 CIEy-1, and unprecedented stability, with an extrapolated T95 lifetime (at an initial brightness of 1,000 cd m-2) of 287 hours. Our work may inspire further exploration into surface passivation of nanocrystalline functional layers, critical for the advancement of emerging solution-processed optoelectronic and electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Selective Passive Tuning of Cavity Resonance by Mode Index Engineering of the Partial Length of a Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavities in large-scale photonic integrated circuits often suffer from a wider distribution of resonance frequencies due to fabrication errors. It is crucial to adjust the resonances of cavities using post-processing methods to minimize the frequency distribution. We have developed a concept of passive tuning by manipulating the mode index of a portion of a microring cavity. Through analytical studies and numerical experiments, we have found that depositing a thin film of dielectric material on top of the cavity or etching the material enables us to fine-tune the resonances and minimize the frequency distribution. This versatile method allows for the selective tuning of each cavity's resonance in a large set of cavities in a single fabrication step, providing robust passive tuning in large-scale photonic integrated circuits. Furthermore, this method can be applied and explored in various cavities and different material configurations.</description>

      <title>Electronvolt energy resolution with broadband ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ptychography is a scanning coherent diffraction imaging technique successfully applied in the electron, visible and x-ray regimes. One of the distinct features of ptychography with respect to other coherent diffraction techniques is its capability of dealing with partial spatial and temporal coherence via the reconstruction algorithm. Here we focus on the temporal and clarify the constraints which affect the energy resolution limits of the ptychographic algorithms. Based on this, we design and perform simulations for a broadband ptychography in the hard x-ray regime, which enables an energy resolution down to 1 eV. We benchmark the simulations against experimental ptychographic data of an NMC battery cathode material, attaining an energy resolution of 5 eV. We review the results, discuss the limitations, and provide guidelines for future broadband ptychography experiments, its prospective application for single acquisition x-ray absorption near edge structure imaging, magnetic dichroism imaging, and potential impact on achieving diffraction limited resolutions.</description>

      <title>Piezoresistive PtSe$_2$ pressure sensors with reliable high sensitivity and their integration into CMOS ASIC substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Membrane-based sensors are an important market for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Two-dimensional (2D) materials, with their low mass, are excellent candidates for suspended membranes to provide high sensitivity, small footprint sensors. The present work demonstrates pressure sensors employing large-scale-synthesized 2D platinum diselenide (PtSe${_2}$) films as piezoresistive membranes supported only by a thin polymer layer. We investigate three different synthesis methods with contrasting growth parameters and establish a reliable high yield fabrication process for suspended PtSe${_2}$/PMMA membranes across sealed cavities. The pressure sensors reproducibly display sensitivities above 6 x 10${^4}$ kPa${^{-1}}$. We show that the sensitivity clearly depends on the membrane diameter and the piezoresistive gauge factor of the PtSe${_2}$ film. Reducing the total device size by decreasing the number of membranes within a device leads to a significant increase in the area-normalized sensitivity. This allows the manufacturing of pressure sensors with high sensitivity but a much smaller device footprint than the current state-of-the-art MEMS technology. We further integrate PtSe${_2}$ pressure sensors with CMOS technology, improving the technological readiness of PtSe${_2}$-based MEMS and NEMS devices.</description>
