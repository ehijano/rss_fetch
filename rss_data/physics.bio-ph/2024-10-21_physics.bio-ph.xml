      <title>Pattern Formation in E. coli Through Negative Chemotaxis: Instability, Condensation, and Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motile bacteria can migrate along chemical gradients in a process known as chemotaxis. When exposed to uniform environmental stress, Escherichia coli cells coordinate their chemotactic responses to form millimeter-sized condensates containing hundreds of thousands of motile cells. In this study, we combined experiments with mathematical modeling based on a modified version of the Keller-Segel equations to investigate the dynamics of this collective behavior across three distinct time scales: the shortest time scale, at which spatial instability emerges; an intermediate time scale, in which a quasi-stationary bacterial condensate is formed; and finally, a longer time scale, during which neighboring bacterial accumulations coalesce. In particular, we found that the force between neighboring bacterial accumulations decays exponentially with distance due to screening effects. We suggest that the model presented here could describe more broadly the dynamics of stress-induced condensation mediated by bacterial chemotaxis.</description>

      <title>Two-component model of a microtubule in a semi-discrete approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we study the nonlinear dynamics of a microtubule, an important part of the cytoskeleton. We use a two-component model of the relevant system. A crucial nonlinear differential equation is solved with semi-discrete approximation, yielding some localised modulated solitary waves called the breathers. A detailed estimation of the existing parameters is provided. The numerical investigation shows that the solutions are robust only if the carrier velocity of the breather wave is higher than its envelope velocity. That disproves the previously accepted solutions based on the equality of these velocities.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic cell-to-cell variance from experimental single-cell motility data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When analyzing the individual positional dynamics of an ensemble of moving objects, the extracted parameters that characterize the motion of individual objects, such as the mean-squared instantaneous velocity or the diffusivity, exhibit a spread that is due to the convolution of three different effects: i) Motion stochasticity, caused by the fluctuating environment and enhanced by limited observation time, ii) measurement errors that depend on details of the detection technique, and iii) the intrinsic parameter variance that characterizes differences between individual objects, the quantity of ultimate interest. We develop the theoretical framework to separate these effects using the generalized Langevin equation (GLE), which constitutes the most general description of active and passive dynamics, as it derives from the general underlying many-body Hamiltonian for the studied system without approximations. We apply our methodology to determine intrinsic cell-to-cell differences of living human breast-cancer cells, algae cells and, as a benchmark, size differences of passively moving polystyrene beads in water. We find algae and human breast-cancer cells to exhibit significant individual differences, reflected by the spreading of the intrinsic mean-squared instantaneous velocity over two orders of magnitude, which is remarkable in light of the genetic homogeneity of the investigated breast-cancer cells and highlights their phenotypical diversity. Quantification of the intrinsic variance of single-cell properties is relevant for infection biology, ecology and medicine and opens up new possibilities to estimate population heterogeneity on the single-organism level in a non-destructive manner. Our framework is not limited to motility properties but can be readily applied to general experimental time-series data.</description>

      <title>JAMUN: Transferable Molecular Conformational Ensemble Generation with Walk-Jump Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformational ensembles of protein structures are immensely important both to understanding protein function, and for drug discovery in novel modalities such as cryptic pockets. Current techniques for sampling ensembles are computationally inefficient, or do not transfer to systems outside their training data. We present walk-Jump Accelerated Molecular ensembles with Universal Noise (JAMUN), a step towards the goal of efficiently sampling the Boltzmann distribution of arbitrary proteins. By extending Walk-Jump Sampling to point clouds, JAMUN enables ensemble generation at orders of magnitude faster rates than traditional molecular dynamics or state-of-the-art ML methods. Further, JAMUN is able to predict the stable basins of small peptides that were not seen during training.</description>

      <title>Change-point detection in anomalous-diffusion trajectories utilising machine-learning-based uncertainty estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When recording the movement of individual animals, cells or molecules one will often observe changes in their diffusive behaviour at certain points in time along their trajectory. In order to capture the different diffusive modes assembled in such heterogeneous trajectories it becomes necessary to segment them by determining these change-points. Such a change-point detection can be challenging for conventional statistical methods, especially when the changes are subtle. We here apply Bayesian Deep Learning to obtain point-wise estimates of not only the anomalous diffusion exponent but also the uncertainties in these predictions from a single anomalous diffusion trajectory generated according to four theoretical models of anomalous diffusion. We show that we are able to achieve an accuracy similar to single-mode (without change-points) predictions as well as a well calibrated uncertainty predictions of this accuracy. Additionally, we find that the predicted uncertainties feature interesting behaviour at the change-points leading us to examine the capabilities of these predictions for change-point detection. While the series of predicted uncertainties on their own are not sufficient to improve change-point detection, they do lead to a performance boost when applied in combination with the predicted anomalous diffusion exponents.</description>

      <title>Comparison of hydroxyapatite and honeycomb micro-structure in bone tissue engineering using electrospun beads-on-string fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thick honeycomb-like electrospun scaffold with nanoparticles of hydroxyapatite (nHA) recently demonstrated its potential to promote proliferation and differentiation of a murine embryonic cell line (C3H10T1/2) to osteoblasts. In order to distinguish the respective effects of the structure and the composition on cell differentiation, beads-on-string fibers were used to manufacture thick honeycomb-like scaffolds without nHA. Mechanical and biological impacts of those beads-on string fibers were evaluated. Uniaxial tensile test showed that beads-on-string fibers decreased the Young Modulus and maximal stress but kept them appropriate for tissue engineering. C3H10T1/2 were seeded and cultured for 6 days on the scaffolds without any growth factors. Viability assays revealed the biocompatibility of the beads-on-string scaffolds, with adequate cells-materials interactions observed by confocal microscopy. Alkaline phosphatase staining was performed at day 6 in order to compare the early differentiation of cells to bone fate. The measure of stained area and intensity confirmed the beneficial effect of both honeycomb structure and nHA, independently. Finally, we showed that honeycomb-like electrospun scaffolds could be relevant candidates for promoting bone fate to cells in the absence of nHA. It offers an easier and faster manufacture process, in particular in bone-interface tissue engineering, permitting to avoid the dispersion of nHA and their interaction with the other cells.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced transitions from contractile to extensile active stress in isotropic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tissues of living cells are a prime example of active fluids. There is experimental evidence that tissues generate extensile active stress even though their constituting cells are contractile. Fluctuating forces that could result from cell-substrate interactions have been proposed to be able to induce a transition from contractile to extensile active stress. Through analytic calculations and numerical computations, we show that in isotropic active fluids, nonlinearities and a coupling between fluctuating forces and fluid density are necessary for such a transition to occur. Here, both transitions from extensile to contractile and vice versa are possible.</description>

      <title>Growth and shrinkage of tissue sheets on substrates: buds, buckles, and pores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many tissues take the form of thin sheets, being only a single cell thick, but millions of cells wide. These tissue sheets can bend and buckle in the third dimension. In this work, we investigated the growth and shrinkage of suspended and supported tissue sheets using particle-based simulations. We construct a minimum model, combining particle-based tissue growth and meshless membrane models, to simulate the growth of tissue sheets with mechanical feedback. Free suspended growing tissues exhibit wrinkling when growth is sufficiently fast. Conversely, tissues on a substrate form buds when the adhesion to the substrate is weak and/or when the friction with the substrate is strong. These buds undergo a membrane-mediated attraction and subsequently fuse. The complete detachment of tissues from the substrate and straight buckled bump formation are also obtained at very weak adhesion and/or fast growth rates. In the tissue shrinkage, tissue pores grow via Ostwald ripening and coalescence. The reported dynamics can also be applied in research on the detachment dynamics of different tissues with weakened adhesion.</description>

      <title>Influence of cell density and in-vivo aging on erythrocyte aggregability: Dissociation dynamics in extensional flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blood rheology and microcirculation are strongly influenced by red blood cell (RBC) aggregation. The aggregability of RBCs can vary significantly due to factors such as their mechanical and membrane surface properties, which are affected by cell aging in vivo. In this study, we investigate RBC aggregability as a function of their density, a marker of cell age and mechanical properties, by separating RBCs from healthy donors into different density fractions using Percoll density gradient centrifugation. We examine the dissociation rates of aggregates in a controlled medium supplemented with Dextran, employing an extensional flow technique based on hyperbolic microfluidic constrictions and image analysis, assisted by a convolutional neural network (CNN). In contrast to other techniques, our microfluidic experimental approach highlights the behavior of RBC aggregates in dynamic flow conditions relevant to microcirculation. Our results demonstrate that aggregate dissociation is strongly correlated with cell density and that aggregates formed from the denser fractions of RBCs are significantly more robust than those from the average cell population. This study provides insight into the effect of RBC aging in vivo on their mechanical properties and aggregability, underscoring the importance of further exploration of RBC aggregation in the context of cellular senescence and its potential implications for hemodynamics. Additionally, it suggests that this technique can complement existing methods for improved evaluation of RBC aggregability in health and disease.</description>

      <title>Error Thresholds in Presence of Epistatic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models for viral populations with high replication error rates (such as RNA viruses) rely on the quasispecies concept, in which mutational pressure beyond the so-called "Error Threshold" leads to a loss of essential genetic information and population collapse, an effect known as the "Error Catastrophe". We explain how crossing this threshold, as a result of increasing mutation rates, can be understood as a second order phase transition, even in the presence of lethal mutations. In particular, we show that, in fitness landscapes with a single peak, this collapse is equivalent to a ferro-paramagnetic transition, where the back-mutation rate plays the role of the external magnetic field. We then generalize this framework to rugged fitness landscapes, like the ones that arise from epistatic interactions, and provide numerical evidence that there is a transition from a high average fitness regime to a low average fitness one, similarly to single-peaked landscapes. The onset of the transition is heralded by a sudden change in the susceptibility to variations in the mutation rate. We use insight from Replica Symmetry Breaking mechanisms in spin glasses, in particular by considering the fluctuations of the genotype similarity distribution as the order parameter.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Amp\`ere current-current interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of modern measurement techniques, the energy resolution of $1 \, meV$ can now be easily obtained. Generally, the driving mechanisms of the physical, chemical or biological processes of the matters or the living organisms on Earth at about $1 \, meV$ energy scale are assumed to stem from the fundamental microscopic Coulomb interaction, its various reduced ones and the relativistic corrections. In this article, by using a path integral approach on a non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics theory, we show that there is another fundamental microscopic electromagnetic interaction at this energy scale, the microscopic Amp\`ere current-current interaction. It has time-dependent dynamical feature and can be the driving interaction of the physical, chemical or biological processes at about $1\, meV$ energy scale. A new Amp\`ere-type exchange spin interaction is also found with a magnitude about $10^{-4}$ of the well-known Heisenberg exchange spin interaction.</description>
