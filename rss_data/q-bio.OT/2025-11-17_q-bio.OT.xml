      <title>Multiomic Enriched Blood-Derived Digital Signatures Reveal Mechanistic and Confounding Disease Clusters for Differential Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding disease relationships through blood biomarkers offers a pathway toward data driven taxonomy and precision medicine. We constructed a digital blood twin from 103 disease signatures comprising longitudinal hematological and biochemical analytes. Profiles were standardized into a unified disease analyte matrix, and pairwise Pearson correlations were computed to assess similarity. Hierarchical clustering revealed robust grouping of hematopoietic disorders, while metabolic, endocrine, and respiratory diseases were more heterogeneous, reflecting weaker cohesion.
  To evaluate structure, the tree was cut at a stringent threshold, yielding 16 groups. Enrichment of the largest heterogeneous cluster (Cluster 9) showed convergence on cytokine-signaling pathways, indicating shared immunological and inflammatory mechanisms across clinical boundaries. Dimensionality reduction with PCA and UMAP corroborated these results, consistently separating hematological diseases. Random Forest feature selection identified neutrophils, mean corpuscular volume, red blood cell count, and platelets as the most discriminative analytes, reinforcing hematopoietic markers as key drivers.
  Collectively, these findings show that blood-derived digital signatures can recover clinically meaningful clusters while revealing mechanistic overlaps across categories. The coherence of hematological diseases contrasts with the dispersion of systemic and metabolic disorders, underscoring both the promise and limits of blood-based classification. This framework highlights the potential of integrating routine laboratory data with computational methods to refine disease ontology, map comorbidities, and advance precision diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Similarity Analysis of Complete Blood Count (CBC) Reference Interval Distributions Across Ethnic and Geographic Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blood reference intervals (RIs) are central to diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring, yet most were derived from Western populations and assumed universal. This risks misclassification in regions with diverse demographic, physiological, or genetic profiles. We examined one of the most used panels, the Complete Blood Count (CBC), by compiling RI data from 28 countries and applying a multi-stage analytical framework. Structural similarity was assessed using multiple clustering strategies combining different linkage rules with Euclidean, correlation, and information-theoretic distances. To benchmark sensitivity, we introduced a Two-Level Cohesion Score quantifying continent-level grouping. UMAP embeddings with feature importance scores identified analytes potentially driving geography-related separation. Using BMI as a cross-country positive control, CBC reference intervals showed no reproducible clustering by geography or population genetics; weak, unstable signals were limited to MCV and HGB, unlike BMI. These findings indicate that CBC physiology is not geographically coordinated but instead reflects laboratory equipment, calibration, or logistical practices. Our results support moving from one-size-fits-all global RIs toward adaptive and personalized reference frameworks that link precision and predictive medicine with diagnostic equity in patient care.</description>
