      <title>WebAssembly Based Portable and Secure Sensor Interface for Internet of Things</title>

Abstract: As the expansion of IoT connectivity continues to provide quality-of-life improvements around the world, they simultaneously introduce increasing privacy and security concerns. The lack of a clear definition in managing shared and protected access to IoT sensors offer channels by which devices can be compromised and sensitive data can be leaked. In recent years, WebAssembly has received considerable attention for its efficient application sandboxing suitable for embedded systems, making it a prime candidate for exploring a secure and portable sensor interface. This paper introduces the first WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) extension offering a secure, portable, and low-footprint sandbox enabling multi-tenant access to sensor data across heterogeneous embedded devices. The runtime extensions provide application memory isolation, ensure appropriate resource privileges by intercepting sensor access, and offer an MQTT-SN interface enabling in-network access control. When targeting the WebAssembly byte-code with the associated runtime extensions implemented atop the Zephyr RTOS, our evaluation of sensor access indicates a latency overhead of 6% with an additional memory footprint of 5% when compared to native execution. As MQTT-SN requests are dominated by network delays, the WASI-SN implementation of MQTT-SN introduces less than 1% additional latency with similar memory footprint.</description>

      <title>DeLog: An Efficient Log Compression Framework with Pattern Signature Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parser-based log compression, which separates static tem- plates from dynamic variables, is a promising approach to exploit the unique structure of log data. However, its perfor- mance on complex production logs is often unsatisfactory. This performance gap coincides with a known degradation in the accuracy of its core log parsing component on such data, motivating our investigation into a foundational yet unverified question: does higher parsing accuracy necessarily lead to better compression ratio?
  To answer this, we conduct the first empirical study quanti- fying this relationship and find that a higher parsing accuracy does not guarantee a better compression ratio. Instead, our findings reveal that compression ratio is dictated by achiev- ing effective pattern-based grouping and encoding, i.e., the partitioning of tokens into low entropy, highly compressible groups.
  Guided by this insight, we design DeLog, a novel log com- pressor that implements a Pattern Signature Synthesis mecha- nism to achieve efficient pattern-based grouping. On 16 public and 10 production datasets, DeLog achieves state-of-the-art compression ratio and speed.</description>
