      <title>The Influence of Establishing Belt and Road Node Cities on the Development of Digital Inclusive Finance Across Chinese Provinces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domestic and foreign scholars have conducted many studies on the influencing factors of digital inclusive finance, but few studies on the impact of the "Belt and Road" and the establishment of node cities on digital inclusive finance. Therefore, it is necessary to study the impact of the establishment of node cities in the "Belt and Road" on the development of digital inclusive finance. This paper mainly uses descriptive analysis and literature analysis to summarize and analyze the development status of China's digital inclusive finance and relevant theoretical research on the development of the "Belt and Road" Initiative, and analyzes and collates the background knowledge needed for the demonstration from the aspects of the development status of China's digital inclusive finance and the impact of digital inclusive finance on the economy. In this process, referring to the relevant economic theories, the theoretical model of this paper is proposed and the influence machine analysis is carried out.
  Empirically, this paper selects the development level of digital inclusive finance in 31 provinces in China from 2011 to 2020 as the explained variable, takes the establishment of "Belt and Road" node cities as a quasi-natural experiment, and verifies the promoting effect of the establishment of "Belt and Road" node cities on the development of digital inclusive finance in provinces through the differential differential method. And verify whether the level of Internet development is a mediating variable. The empirical results show that the establishment of node cities in the "Belt and Road" does promote the development of digital inclusive finance in provinces with the level of Internet development as an intermediary variable.</description>

      <title>FinTextSim: Enhancing Financial Text Analysis with BERTopic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in information availability and computational capabilities have transformed the analysis of annual reports, integrating traditional financial metrics with insights from textual data. To extract valuable insights from this wealth of textual data, automated review processes, such as topic modeling, are crucial. This study examines the effectiveness of BERTopic, a state-of-the-art topic model relying on contextual embeddings, for analyzing Item 7 and Item 7A of 10-K filings from S&amp;P 500 companies (2016-2022). Moreover, we introduce FinTextSim, a finetuned sentence-transformer model optimized for clustering and semantic search in financial contexts. Compared to all-MiniLM-L6-v2, the most widely used sentence-transformer, FinTextSim increases intratopic similarity by 81% and reduces intertopic similarity by 100%, significantly enhancing organizational clarity. We assess BERTopic's performance using embeddings from both FinTextSim and all-MiniLM-L6-v2. Our findings reveal that BERTopic only forms clear and distinct economic topic clusters when paired with FinTextSim's embeddings. Without FinTextSim, BERTopic struggles with misclassification and overlapping topics. Thus, FinTextSim is pivotal for advancing financial text analysis. FinTextSim's enhanced contextual embeddings, tailored for the financial domain, elevate the quality of future research and financial information. This improved quality of financial information will enable stakeholders to gain a competitive advantage, streamlining resource allocation and decision-making processes. Moreover, the improved insights have the potential to leverage business valuation and stock price prediction models.</description>
