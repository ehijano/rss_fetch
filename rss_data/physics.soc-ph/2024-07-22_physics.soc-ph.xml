      <title>Asymmetric interaction preference induces cooperation in human-agent hybrid game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of artificial intelligence, human beings are increasingly interested in human-agent collaboration, which generates a series of problems about the relationship between agents and humans, such as trust and cooperation. This inevitably induces the inherent human characteristic that there are subjective interaction preferences for different groups, especially in human-agent hybrid systems where human-human interaction, agent-agent interaction, and human-agent interaction coexist. However, understanding how individual interaction preferences affect the cooperation of the system remains a major challenge. Therefore, this paper proposes a human-agent hybrid prisoner's dilemma game system under the framework of evolutionary game. In spatial networks, the most significant difference between agents and humans is the flexibility of decision, where humans have higher adaptive capabilities, follow link dynamics, and adopt free decision rules, which enable them to choose different strategies for different neighbors. However, agents follow node dynamics and adopt consistent decision rules, applying the same strategy to different neighbors. We give the subjective preferences of any individual to different groups, involving the interaction preferences between homogeneous groups and heterogeneous groups respectively. The simulation results show that both human and agent have asymmetric interaction preferences for groups with different identities, which can significantly improve the cooperative behavior of the system. In the hybrid system, human groups show more stable prosocial behavior. Agent groups can form highly cooperative clusters under the condition of strong interaction preference for human groups. In addition, giving agents the ability to identify opponents can effectively alleviate the interaction dilemma of agents.</description>

      <title>Human-in-the-loop MGA to generate energy system design options matching stakeholder needs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using cost-optimisation to support energy system design decisions hides from view many more feasible designs that, while economically comparable to the least-cost option, may have other practical advantages that stakeholders prefer. Increasingly, modellers look at Modelling to generate alternatives (MGA) as a way to go beyond few, optimal designs and provide stakeholders with broad portfolios of design options to appraise based on their preferences and knowledge of the problem. In practice, however, generating and exploring all the feasible system design options is not computationally possible. Modellers need to choose what design feature to generate diversity around, and yet, they cannot know what features may matter the most to heterogeneous real-world stakeholders. Stakeholders' knowledge is thus needed to guide the MGA search towards the most important trade-offs, but how to incorporate such knowledge in the MGA workflow is unclear. To address this gap, we propose a first-of-its-kind human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach that seamlessly and automatically integrates stakeholder preferences into an MGA workflow. In a nutshell, we elicit stakeholders' system design preferences via a first interaction between them and a tentative MGA design space. Hence, we decode those preferences so that it becomes possible to feed them back to the MGA algorithm to perform a guided search. This search produces an updated, human-trained design space with a higher share of designs that align with the elicited preferences. In a controlled experiment for the case study of the Portuguese energy system, we demonstrate that our HITL-MGA approach may facilitate the identification of a consensus solution that balances many conflicting stakeholder preferences. The approach shows promise for generalisation and real-world application to accelerate technically and socially feasible energy transition decisions.</description>

Abstract: Despite the growing importance of the digital sector, research on economic complexity and its implications continues to rely mostly on administrative records, e.g. data on exports, patents, and employment, that fail to capture the nuances of the digital economy. In this paper we use data on the geography of programming languages used in open-source software projects to extend economic complexity ideas to the digital economy. We estimate a country's software economic complexity and show that it complements the ability of measures of complexity based on trade, patents, and research papers to account for international differences in GDP per capita, income inequality, and emissions. We also show that open-source software follows the principle of relatedness, meaning that a country's software entries and exits are explained by specialization in related programming languages. We conclude by exploring the diversification and development of countries in open-source software in the context of large language models. Together, these findings help extend economic complexity methods and their policy considerations to the digital sector.</description>

      <title>Preparing Fermilab to Carry Out the P5 Plan</title>

Abstract: In the past several years, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) has suffered a number of troublesome setbacks. In some cases, failures to respond effectively have only made things worse, resulting in the current crisis atmosphere at the laboratory. This is reflected in part in the poorly rated performance appraisals (or PEMP) that the DOE provides to the lab every year. Three entities are currently responsible for supporting, managing, operating, and leading the lab: the Department of Energy (DOE), Fermi Research Alliance (FRA), and the Laboratory Director Office. Two recent events provide opportunities for interested parties to reverse the recent decline: the release in December 2023 of the P5 Report and the DOE decision to rebid the Management &amp; Operating (M&amp;O) contract. The P5 Report a decadal update of recommendations for US particle physics, includes an ambitious and positive roadmap for projects and activities at Fermilab. Carrying out the P5 plan successfully, however, will also require addressing many of the other problems currently besetting the lab. The selection of a new M&amp;O contractor is under the responsibility of the Deputy Director for Operations of the DOE Office of Science Dr. Juston Fontaine. A new M&amp;O Contractor would replace FRA and name a new Director effective January 1, 2025. A new management team, one hopes, would be motivated to solve problems and would enjoy a honeymoon period, enabling them to make positive changes more easily. Stimulated by these recent developments, the authors of this document, all present or past employees, convened confidentially in order to collect testimonials on a series of events symptomatic of the lab problems, to provide constructive criticism and offer possible solutions. This document summarizes this work.</description>

      <title>Bottlenecks in Occupational Transitions: A Data-driven Taxonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an era of rapid technological advancements and macroeconomic shifts, worker reallocation is necessary, yet responses to labor market shocks remain sluggish, making it crucial to identify bottlenecks in occupational transitions to understand labor market dynamics and improve mobility. In this study, we analyze French occupational data to uncover patterns of worker mobility and pinpoint specific occupations that act as bottlenecks which impede rapid reallocation. We introduce two metrics, transferability and accessibility, to quantify the diversity of occupational transitions and find that bottlenecks can be explained by a condensation effect of occupations with high accessibility but low transferability. Transferability measures the variety of transitions from an occupation to others, while accessibility assesses the variety of transitions into an occupation. We provide a comprehensive framework for analyzing occupational complexity and mobility patterns, offering insights into potential barriers and pathways for efficient retraining programs. We argue that our approach can inform policymakers and stakeholders aiming to enhance labor market efficiency and support workforce adaptability.</description>

      <title>Higher-order triadic percolation on random hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a comprehensive theoretical framework combining percolation theory with nonlinear dynamics in order to study hypergraphs with a time-varying giant component. We consider in particular hypergraphs with higher-order triadic interactions that can upregulate or downregulate the hyperedges. Triadic interactions are a general type of signed regulatory interaction that occurs when a third node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. For example, in brain networks, the glia can facilitate or inhibit synaptic interactions between neurons. However, the regulatory interactions may not only occur between regulator nodes and pairwise interactions but also between regulator nodes and higher-order interactions (hyperedges), leading to higher-order triadic interactions. For instance, in biochemical reaction networks, the enzymes regulate the reactions involving multiple reactants. Here we propose and investigate higher-order triadic percolation on hypergraphs showing that the giant component can have a non-trivial dynamics. Specifically, we demonstrate that, under suitable conditions, the order parameter of this percolation problem, i.e., the fraction of nodes in the giant component, undergoes a route to chaos in the universality class of the logistic map. In hierarchical higher-order triadic percolation, we extend this paradigm in order to treat hierarchically nested triadic interactions demonstrating the non-trivial effect of their increased combinatorial complexity on the critical phenomena and the dynamical properties of the process. Finally, we consider other generalizations of the model studying the effect of considering interdependencies and node regulation instead of hyperedge regulation.</description>

      <title>What makes Individual I's a Collective We; Coordination mechanisms &amp; costs</title>

Abstract: The collective effort exceeds the sum of its parts when individuals coordinate and regulate their activities and behaviors. This holds true even in self-organizing systems with open, voluntary participation where coordination occurs implicitly. Here, we analyze the non-functional actions of contributors, administrators, and bots on Wikipedia, categorizing them by their asymmetric authority: one-way oversight and two-way. This categorization helps us reveal comparable patterns. First, we find remarkably consistent scaling factors for each category relative to system size. Two-way coordination scales superlinearly (with an exponent of $1.3$), while oversight coordination grows sublinearly (with an exponent of $0.9$), suggesting an underlying mechanism for coordination across communities. Second, we identify the hierarchical modular structure of interactions as a key factor for the economy of scale in coordination, and we propose a mathematical model to explain these results. Finally, our temporal analysis shows a shift from two-way interactions to one-way oversight as system size increases. This suggests the emergence of a nascent hierarchical structure even in self-organizing systems, echoing Weber's theory of organizational evolution.</description>

      <title>Individual and team performance in cricket</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancements in technology have recently allowed us to collect and analyse large-scale fine-grained data about human performance, drastically changing the way we approach sports. Here, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of individual and team performance in One-Day International cricket, one of the most popular sports in the world. We investigate temporal patterns of individual success by quantifying the location of the best performance of a player and find that they can happen at any time in their career, surrounded by a burst of comparable top performances. Our analysis shows that long-term performance can be predicted from early observations and that temporary exclusions of players from teams are often due to declining performances but are also associated with strong comebacks. By computing the duration of streaks of winning performances compared to random expectations, we demonstrate that teams win and lose matches consecutively. We define the contributions of specialists such as openers, all-rounders and wicket-keepers and show that a balanced performance from multiple individuals is required to ensure team success. Finally, we measure how transitioning to captaincy in the team improves the performance of batsmen, but not that of bowlers. Our work emphasizes how individual endeavours and team dynamics interconnect and influence collective outcomes in sports.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of networks with weak geometric coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Renormalization Group is crucial for understanding systems across scales, including complex networks. Renormalizing networks via network geometry, a framework in which their topology is based on the location of nodes in a hidden metric space, is one of the foundational approaches. However, the current methods assume that the geometric coupling is strong, neglecting weak coupling in many real networks. This paper extends renormalization to weak geometric coupling, showing that geometric information is essential to preserve self-similarity. Our results underline the importance of geometric effects on network topology even when the coupling to the underlying space is weak.</description>

      <title>Safety-Oriented Calibration and Evaluation of the Intelligent Driver Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many car-following models like the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) incorporate important aspects of safety in their definitions, such as collision-free driving and keeping safe distances, implying that drivers are safety conscious when driving. Despite their safety-oriented nature, when calibrating and evaluating these models, the main objective of most studies is to find model parameters that minimize the error in observed measurements like spacing and speed while studies specifically focused on calibrating and evaluating unobserved safe behavior captured by the parameters of the model are scarce. Most studies on calibration and evaluation of the IDM do not check if the observed driving behavior (i.e. spacing) are within the model estimated unobserved safety thresholds (i.e. desired safety spacing) or what parameters are important for safety. This limits their application for safety driven traffic simulations. To fill this gap, this paper first proposes a simple metric to evaluate driver compliance with the safety thresholds of the IDM model. Specifically, we evaluate driver compliance to their desired safety spacing, speed and safe time gap. Next, a method to enforce compliance to the safety threshold during model calibration is proposed. The proposed compliance metric and the calibration approach is tested using Dutch highway trajectory data obtained from a driving simulator experiment and two drones. The results show that compliance to the IDM safety threshold greatly depends on braking capability with a median compliance between 38% and 90% of driving time, indicating that drivers can only partially follow the IDM safety threshold in reality.</description>

      <title>The Impact of School and Family Networks on COVID-19 Infections Among Dutch Students: A Study Using Population-Level Registry Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of different social interactions is key to improving epidemic models. Here, we use extensive registry data -- including PCR test results and population-level networks -- to investigate the impact of school, family, and other social contacts on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the Netherlands (June 2020--October 2021). We isolate and compare different contexts of potential SARS-CoV-2 transmission by matching pairs of students based on their attendance at the same or different primary school (in 2020) and secondary school (in 2021) and their geographic proximity. We then calculated the probability of temporally associated infections -- i.e. the probability of both students testing positive within a 14-day period.
  Our results highlight the relative importance of household and family transmission in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 compared to school settings. The probability of temporally associated infections for siblings and parent-child pairs living in the same household was 22.6--23.2\%, and 4.7--7.9\% for family members living in different household. In contrast, the probability of temporally associated infections was 0.52\% for pairs of students living nearby but not attending the same primary or secondary school, 0.66\% for pairs attending different secondary schools but having attended the same primary school, and 1.65\% for pairs attending the same secondary school. Finally, we used multilevel regression analyses to examine how individual, school, and geographic factors contribute to transmission risk. We found that the largest differences in transmission probabilities were due to unobserved individual (60\%) and school-level (34\%) factors. Only a small proportion (3\%) could be attributed to geographic proximity of students or to school size, denomination, or the median income of the school area.</description>

      <title>Flock2: A model for orientation-based social flocking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aerial flocking of birds, or murmurations, has fascinated observers while presenting many challenges to behavioral study and simulation. We examine how the periphery of murmurations remain well bounded and cohesive. We also investigate agitation waves, which occur when a flock is disturbed, developing a plausible model for how they might emerge spontaneously. To understand these behaviors a new model is presented for orientation-based social flocking. Previous methods model inter-bird dynamics by considering the neighborhood around each bird, and introducing forces for avoidance, alignment, and cohesion as three dimensional vectors that alter acceleration. Our method introduces orientation-based social flocking that treats social influences from neighbors more realistically as a desire to turn, indirectly controlling the heading in an aerodynamic model. While our model can be applied to any flocking social bird we simulate flocks of starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, and demonstrate the possibility of orientation waves in the absence of predators. Our model exhibits spherical and ovoidal flock shapes matching observation. Comparisons of our model to Reynolds' on energy consumption and frequency analysis demonstrates more realistic motions, significantly less energy use in turning, and a plausible mechanism for emergent orientation waves.</description>
