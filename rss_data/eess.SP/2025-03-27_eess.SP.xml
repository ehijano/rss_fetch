      <title>Deep-Learning-Based Classification of Digitally Modulated Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This dissertation presents several novel deep-learning (DL)-based approaches for classifying digitally modulated signals, one method of which involves the use of capsule networks (CAPs) together with cyclic cumulant (CC) features of the signals. These were blindly estimated using cyclostationary signal processing (CSP) and were then input into the CAP for training and classification. The results showed that the classification of digitally modulated signals using CAPs and CCs proposed in this dissertation outperformed alternative approaches for classifying digitally modulated signals that included conventional classifiers that employed CSP-based techniques, as well as alternative DL-based classifiers that used various conventional neural networks (NNs) with in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) data used for training and classification.
  Another method of digital modulation classification presented in this dissertation showcases two novel DL-based classifiers that each use a CAP with custom-designed feature extraction layers. The classifiers take I/Q data as input, and the feature extraction layers are inspired by CSP techniques, which extract the CC features employed by conventional CSP-based approaches to blind modulation classification and signal identification. Specifically, the feature extraction layers implement a proxy of the mathematical functions used in the calculation of the CC features and include a squaring layer, a raise-to-the-power-of-three layer, and a fast-Fourier-transform (FFT) layer, along with additional normalization and warping layers to ensure that the relative signal powers are retained and to prevent the trainable NN layers from diverging in the training process.</description>

      <title>Hybrid FSO and RF Lunar Wireless Power Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on the feasibility analyses of the hybrid FSO and RF-based WPT system used in the realistic Cislunar environment, which is established by using STK HPOP software in which many external forces are incorporated. In our proposed multi-hop scheme, a solar-powered satellite (SPS) beams the laser power to the low lunar orbit (LLO) satellite in the first hop, then the harvested power is used as a relay power for RF-based WPT to two critical lunar regions, which are lunar south pole (LSP) (0{\deg}E,90{\deg}S) and Malapert Mountain (0{\deg}E,86{\deg}S), owing to the multi-point coverage feature of RF systems. The end-to-end system is analyzed for two cases, i) the perfect alignment, and ii) the misalignment fading due to the random mechanical vibrations in the optical inter-satellite link. It is found that the harvested power is maximized when the distance between the SPS and LLO satellite is minimized and it is calculated as 331.94 kW, however, when the random misalignment fading is considered, the mean of the harvested power reduces to 309.49 kW for the same distance. In the next hop, the power harvested by the solar array on the LLO satellite is consumed entirely as the relay power. Identical parabolic antennas are considered during the RF-based WPT system between the LLO satellite and the LSP, which utilizes a full-tracking module, and between the LLO satellite and the Malapert Mountain region, which uses a half-tracking module that executes the tracking on the receiver dish only. In the perfectly aligned hybrid WPT system, 19.80 W and 573.7 mW of maximum harvested powers are yielded at the LSP and Mountain Malapert, respectively. On the other hand, when the misalignment fading in the end-to-end system is considered, the mean of the maximum harvested powers degrades to 18.41 W and 534.4 mW for the former and latter hybrid WPT links.</description>

      <title>Near-Field THz Bending Beamforming: A Convex Optimization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication systems suffer severe
  blockage issues, which may significantly degrade the communica tion coverage and quality. Bending beams, capable of adjusting
  their propagation direction to bypass obstacles, have recently
  emerged as a promising solution to resolve this issue by engineer ing the propagation trajectory of the beam. However, traditional
  bending beam generation methods rely heavily on the specific
  geometric properties of the propagation trajectory and can only
  achieve sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a new
  and general bending beamforming method by adopting the convex
  optimization techniques. In particular, we formulate the bending
  beamforming design as a max-min optimization problem, aiming
  to optimize the analog or digital transmit beamforming vector to
  maximize the minimum received signal power among all positions
  along the bending beam trajectory. However, the resulting problem
  is non-convex and difficult to be solved optimally. To tackle this
  difficulty, we apply the successive convex approximation (SCA)
  technique to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. Numerical
  results show that our proposed bending beamforming method
  outperforms the traditional method and shows robustness to the
  obstacle in the environment.</description>

      <title>Impact of the Pilot Design for OFDM Based Bi-static Integrated Sensing and Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bistatic milimeter-wave (mmWave) ISAC system utilizing OFDM signaling is considered. For a single-target scnenario, closed-form expressions for the Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) of range and velocity estimation are derived for a given pilot pattern. The analysis shows that when the target's range and velocity remain within the maximum unambiguous limits, allocating pilot symbols more frequently in time improves position estimation, while increasing their density in frequency enhances velocity estimation. Numerical results further validate that the least squares (LS) channel estimation approach closely follows CRB predictions, particularly in the high-SNR regime.</description>

      <title>Optimal One- and Two-Sided Multi-Level ASK for Noncoherent SIMO Systems Over Correlated Rician Fading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the performance of a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) wireless communication system employing one- and two-sided amplitude shift keying (ASK) modulation schemes for data transmission and operating under correlated Rician fading channels. The receiver deploys an optimal noncoherent maximum likelihood detector, which exploits statistical knowledge of the channel state information for signal decoding. An optimal receiver structure is derived, from which series-form and closed-form expressions for the union bound on the symbol error probability (SEP) are obtained for general and massive SIMO systems, respectively. Furthermore, an optimization framework to derive the optimal one- and two-sided ASK modulation schemes is proposed, which focuses on minimizing SEP performance under an average transmit energy constraint. The conducted numerical investigations for various system parameters demonstrate that the proposed noncoherent SIMO system with the designed optimal ASK modulation schemes achieves superior error performance compared to traditional equispaced ASK modulation. It is also shown that, when the proposed system employs traditional two-sided ASK modulation, superior error performance from the case of using one-sided ASK is obtained.</description>

      <title>Derivation and analysis of power offset in fiber-longitudinal power profile estimation using pre-FEC hard-decision data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing the precise reference waveform regenerated by post-forward error correction (FEC) data, the fiber-longitudinal power profile estimation based on the minimum-mean-square-error method (MMSE-PPE) has been validated as an effective tool for absolute power monitoring. However, when post-FEC data is unavailable, it becomes necessary to rely on pre-FEC hard-decision data, which inevitably introduces hard-decision errors. These hard-decision errors will result in a power offset that undermines the accuracy of absolute power monitoring. In this paper, we present the first analytical expression for power offset in MMSE-PPE when using pre-FEC hard-decision data, achieved by introducing a virtual hard-decision nonlinear perturbation term. Based on this analytical expression, we also establish the first nonlinear relationship between the power offset and the symbol error rate (SER) of M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM) formats based on Gaussian assumptions. Verified in a numerical 130-GBaud single-wavelength coherent optical fiber transmission system, the correctness of the analytical expression of power offset has been confirmed with 4-QAM, 16-QAM, and 64-QAM formats under different SER situations. Furthermore, the nonlinear relationship between the power offset and SER of $M$-QAM formats has also been thoroughly validated under both linear scale (measured in mW) and logarithmic scale (measured in dB). These theoretical insights offer significant contributions to the design of potential power offset mitigation strategies in MMSE-PPE, thereby enhancing its real-time application.</description>

      <title>Phase-Center-Constrained Beamforming for Minimizing Phase-Center Displacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate knowledge and control of the phase center in antenna arrays is essential for high-precision applications such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), where even small displacements can introduce significant localization errors. Traditional beamforming techniques applied to array antennas often neglect the variation of the phase center, resulting in unwanted spatial shifts, and in consequence, localization errors. In this work, we propose a novel beamforming algorithm, called Phase-Center-Constrained Beamforming (PCCB), which explicitly minimizes the displacement of the phase center (Phase Center Offset, PCO) while preserving a chosen directional gain. We formulate the problem as a constrained optimization problem and incorporate regularization terms that enforce energy compactness and beampattern fidelity. The resulting PCCB approach allows for directional gain control and interference nulling while significantly reducing PCO displacement. Experimental validation using a simulated GNSS antenna array demonstrates that our PCCB approach achieves a fivefold reduction in PCO shift compared to the PCO shifts obtained when using conventional beamforming. A stability analysis across multiple random initializations confirms the robustness of our method and highlights the benefit of repeated optimization. These results indicate that our PCCB approach can serve as a practical and effective solution for decreasing phase center variability.</description>

      <title>GNSS jammer localization and identification with airborne commercial GNSS receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are fundamental in ubiquitously providing position and time to a wide gamut of systems. Jamming remains a realistic threat in many deployment settings, civilian and tactical. Specifically, in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) sustained denial raises safety critical concerns. This work presents a strategy that allows detection, localization, and classification both in the frequency and time domain of interference signals harmful to navigation. A high-performance Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) UAV with a single antenna and a commercial GNSS receiver is used to geolocate and characterize RF emitters at long range, to infer the navigation impairment. Raw IQ baseband snapshots from the GNSS receiver make the application of spectral correlation methods possible without extra software-defined radio payload, paving the way to spectrum identification and monitoring in airborne platforms, aiming at RF situational awareness. Live testing at Jammertest, in Norway, with portable, commercially available GNSS multi-band jammers demonstrates the ability to detect, localize, and characterize harmful interference. Our system pinpointed the position with an error of a few meters of the transmitter and the extent of the affected area at long range, without entering the denied zone. Additionally, further spectral content extraction is used to accurately identify the jammer frequency, bandwidth, and modulation scheme based on spectral correlation techniques.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of clustering methods for power delay profile in MMW bands and in-vehicle scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial statistics of radio wave propagation in specific environments and scenarios, as well as being able to recognize important signal components, are prerequisites for dependable connectivity. There are several reasons why in-vehicle communication is unique, including safety considerations and vehicle-to-vehicle/infrastructure communication.The paper examines the characteristics of clustering power delay profiles to investigate in-vehicle communication. It has been demonstrated that the Saleh-Valenzuela channel model can also be adapted for in-vehicle communication, and that the signal is received in clusters with exponential decay. A measurement campaign was conducted, capturing the power delay profile inside the vehicle cabin, and the reweighted l1 minimization method was compared with the traditional k-means clustering techniques.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis and evaluation of ageing forecasting methods for semiconductor devices in online health monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor devices, especially MOSFETs (Metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor), are crucial in power electronics, but their reliability is affected by aging processes influenced by cycling and temperature. The primary aging mechanism in discrete semiconductors and power modules is the bond wire lift-off, caused by crack growth due to thermal fatigue. The process is empirically characterized by exponential growth and an abrupt end of life, making long-term aging forecasts challenging. This research presents a comprehensive comparative assessment of different forecasting methods for MOSFET failure forecasting applications. Classical tracking, statistical forecasting and Neural Network (NN) based forecasting models are implemented along with novel Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs). A comprehensive comparison is performed assessing their MOSFET ageing forecasting ability for different forecasting horizons. For short-term predictions, all algorithms result in acceptable results, with the best results produced by classical NN forecasting models at the expense of higher computations. For long-term forecasting, only the TFT is able to produce valid outcomes owing to the ability to integrate covariates from the expected future conditions. Additionally, TFT attention points identify key ageing turning points, which indicate new failure modes or accelerated ageing phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network-based receivers leverage deep learning to optimize signal detection and decoding, significantly improving bit-error rate (BER) and block-error rate (BLER) in challenging environments. This study evaluates various architectures and compares their BER and BLER performance across different noise levels. Two novel models, the Dual Attention Transformer (DAT) and the Residual Dual Non-Local Attention Network (RDNLA), integrate self-attention and residual learning to enhance signal reconstruction. These models bypass conventional channel estimation and equalization by directly predicting log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) from received signals, with noise variance as an additional input. Simulations show that DAT and RDNLA outperform traditional and other neural receiver models under varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), while their computational efficiency supports their feasibility for next-generation communication systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating sensing capabilities into existing massive MIMO communication networks has become crucial, stemming from a need for a more interconnected society. Improved coverage and performance can be obtained by incorporating new network components, such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces or network-controlled repeaters (NCR). Integrating such components into modern networks brings a number of challenges. Thus, this paper contributes with the analysis of NCR impact in integrated sensing and communication networks. Particularly, the Cram\'er-Rao bound for a range estimator is derived where the interference from the repeater is taken into consideration. Additionally, a joint procedure for determining the repeater amplification factor, along with the precoders of the transmitting access point, is proposed.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Forecasting for Network Resource Analysis in Integrated Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient resource management is critical for Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) to provide consistent, high-quality service in remote and under-served regions. While traditional single-point prediction methods, such as Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), have been used in terrestrial networks, they often fall short in NTNs due to the complexity of satellite dynamics, signal latency and coverage variability. Probabilistic forecasting, which quantifies the uncertainties of the predictions, is a robust alternative. In this paper, we evaluate the application of probabilistic forecasting techniques, in particular SFF, to NTN resource allocation scenarios. Our results show their effectiveness in predicting bandwidth and capacity requirements in different NTN segments of probabilistic forecasting compared to single-point prediction techniques such as LSTM. The results show the potential of black probabilistic forecasting models to provide accurate and reliable predictions and to quantify their uncertainty, making them indispensable for optimizing NTN resource allocation. At the end of the paper, we also present application scenarios and a standardization roadmap for the use of probabilistic forecasting in integrated Terrestrial Network (TN)-NTN environments.</description>

Additionally, the presence of an interfering node is considered, and an analytical solution is derived to determine the optimal orientation of the DRS at each time step, minimizing interference to the receiver. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

Abstract: Mutual information (MI)-based guidelines have recently proven to be effective for designing task-oriented communication systems, where the ultimate goal is to extract and transmit task-relevant information for downstream task. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of MI-empowered task-oriented communication, highlighting how MI-based methods can serve as a unifying design framework in various task-oriented communication scenarios. We begin with the roadmap of MI for designing task-oriented communication systems, and then introduce the roles and applications of MI to guide feature encoding, transmission optimization, and efficient training with two case studies. We further elaborate the limitations and challenges of MI-based methods. Finally, we identify several open issues in MI-based task-oriented communication to inspire future research.</description>

      <title>Sequential Task Assignment and Resource Allocation in V2X-Enabled Mobile Edge Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, the convergence of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and vehicular networks has emerged as a vital facilitator for the ever-increasing intelligent onboard applications. This paper introduces a multi-tier task offloading mechanism for MEC-enabled vehicular networks leveraging vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. The study focuses on applications with sequential subtasks and explores two tiers of collaboration. In the vehicle tier, we design a needing vehicle (NV)-helping vehicle (HV) matching scheme and inter-vehicle collaborative computation is studied, with joint optimization of task offloading decision, communication, and computation resource allocation to minimize energy consumption and meet latency requirements. In the roadside unit (RSU) tier, collaboration among RSUs is investigated to address multi-access issues of bandwidth and computation resources for multiple vehicles. A two-step method is proposed to solve the subchannel allocation problem. Detailed experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and assess the impact of different parameters on system energy consumption.</description>

      <title>UnReference: analysis of the effect of spoofing on RTK reference stations for connected rovers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) provide standalone precise navigation for a wide gamut of applications. Nevertheless, applications or systems such as unmanned vehicles (aerial or ground vehicles and surface vessels) generally require a much higher level of accuracy than those provided by standalone receivers. The most effective and economical way of achieving centimeter-level accuracy is to rely on corrections provided by fixed \emph{reference station} receivers to improve the satellite ranging measurements. Differential GNSS (DGNSS) and Real Time Kinematics (RTK) provide centimeter-level accuracy by distributing online correction streams to connected nearby mobile receivers typically termed \emph{rovers}. However, due to their static nature, reference stations are prime targets for GNSS attacks, both simplistic jamming and advanced spoofing, with different levels of adversarial control and complexity. Jamming the reference station would deny corrections and thus accuracy to the rovers. Spoofing the reference station would force it to distribute misleading corrections. As a result, all connected rovers using those corrections will be equally influenced by the adversary independently of their actual trajectory. We evaluate a battery of tests generated with an RF simulator to test the robustness of a common DGNSS/RTK processing library and receivers. We test both jamming and synchronized spoofing to demonstrate that adversarial action on the rover using reference spoofing is both effective and convenient from an adversarial perspective. Additionally, we discuss possible strategies based on existing countermeasures (self-validation of the PNT solution and monitoring of own clock drift) that the rover and the reference station can adopt to avoid using or distributing bogus corrections.</description>

      <title>A Low-complexity Structured Neural Network Approach to Intelligently Realize Wideband Multi-beam Beamformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: True-time-delay (TTD) beamformers can produce wideband, squint-free beams in both analog and digital signal domains, unlike frequency-dependent FFT beams. Our previous work showed that TTD beamformers can be efficiently realized using the elements of delay Vandermonde matrix (DVM), answering the longstanding beam-squint problem. Thus, building on our work on classical algorithms based on DVM, we propose neural network (NN) architecture to realize wideband multi-beam beamformers using structure-imposed weight matrices and submatrices. The structure and sparsity of the weight matrices and submatrices are shown to reduce the space and computational complexities of the NN greatly. The proposed network architecture has O(pLM logM) complexity compared to a conventional fully connected L-layers network with O(M2L) complexity, where M is the number of nodes in each layer of the network, p is the number of submatrices per layer, and M &gt;&gt; p. We will show numerical simulations in the 24 GHz to 32 GHz range to demonstrate the numerical feasibility of realizing wideband multi-beam beamformers using the proposed neural architecture. We also show the complexity reduction of the proposed NN and compare that with fully connected NNs, to show the efficiency of the proposed architecture without sacrificing accuracy. The accuracy of the proposed NN architecture was shown using the mean squared error, which is based on an objective function of the weight matrices and beamformed signals of antenna arrays, while also normalizing nodes. The proposed NN architecture shows a low-complexity NN realizing wideband multi-beam beamformers in real-time for low-complexity intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy UAV Cooperative Localization: Information Analysis of Performance and Security</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09810v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a trustworthy framework for achieving accurate cooperative localization in multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. The The Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the three-dimensional (3D) cooperative localization network is derived, with particular attention given to practical scenarios involving non-uniform spatial distribution of anchor nodes. Challenges of mobility are then addressed with Mobility Adaptive Gradient Descent (MAGD).
  In the context of system security, we derive the CRLB of localization under the influence of falsified information. The methods and strategies of injecting such information and their impact on system performance are studied. To assure robust performance under falsified data, we propose a mitigation solution named Time-evolving Anomaly Detection (TAD). Furthermore, we model the system performance regarding the density and magnitude of falsified information, focusing on realistic scenarios where the adversary is resource-constrained. With the vulnerability of cooperative localization understood, we apply TAD and formulate an optimization problem from the adversary's perspective. Next, we discuss the design principles of an anomaly detector, with emphasis of the trade-off of reducing such optimum and system performance. Additionally, we also deploy a reputation propagation (RP) mechanism to fully utilize the anomaly detection and further optimize the TAD. Our proposed approaches are demonstrated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Analytic Models for the Capacity Distribution in MDG-impaired Optical SDM Transmission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In coupled space-division multiplexing (SDM) transmission systems, imperfections in optical amplifiers and passive devices introduce mode-dependent loss (MDL) and gain (MDG). These effects render the channel capacity stochastic and result in a decrease in average capacity. Several previous studies employ multi-section simulations to model the capacity of these systems. Additionally, relevant works derive analytically the capacity distribution for a single-mode system with polarization-dependent gain and loss (mode count D = 2). However, to the best of our knowledge, analytic expressions of the capacity distribution for systems with D &gt; 2 have not been presented. In this paper, we provide analytic expressions for the capacity of optical systems with arbitrary mode counts. The expressions rely on Gaussian approximations for the per-mode capacity distributions and for the overall capacity distribution, as well as on fitting parameters for the capacity cross-correlation among different modes. Compared to simulations, the derived analytical expressions exhibit a suitable level of accuracy across a wide range of practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Desynchronization Index: a New Approach for Exploring Complex Epileptogenic Networks in Stereoelectroencephalography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16347v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new computational framework to assist neurophysiologists in Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) analysis, with the final aim of improving the definition of the Epileptogenic Zone (EZ) in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. We design a new algorithm, named Desynchronization Index (DI), that classifies as most epileptogenic those SEEG channels that show independent behavior during the seconds preceding the seizure propagation. We test the proposed DI algorithm against the Epileptogenic Index (EI) algorithm on a clinical dataset of 11 patients, considering the neurophysiological evaluation of the EZ as the clinical ground truth. Our results denote that DI overcomes EI in terms of area under the ROC curve (AUC=0.81 vs AUC=0.74) while combining the two algorithms as a unique tool leads to the best performance (AUC=0.87). The DI algorithm underscores connectivity dynamics that can hardly be identified with a pure visual analysis, increasing the accuracy of the EZ definition compared to traditional methods. This technique can lead to the definition of a new effective biomarker of the EZ, reducing the burden required by the SEEG review in the case of extensive implants and improving our understanding of the dynamics leading to the generation of seizures.</description>

      <title>Point Data for Site-Specific Mid-band Radio Propagation Channel Statistics in the Indoor Hotspot (InH) Environment for 3GPP and Next Generation Alliance (NGA) Channel Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19873v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extensive work has been carried out in the past year by various organizations in an effort to determine standardized statistical channel impulse response (CIR) parameters for the newly-released FR3 mid-band spectrum (7.25 GHz -- 24.25 GHz). In this work, we show that the wireless community currently lacks a unified method for presenting key parameters required for transparency and utilization by several constituencies when presenting propagation data for use by standard bodies or third parties to create statistical CIR models. This paper aims to solve the existing problem by offering a standard method to provide key propagation parameters in a point-data format that supports both statistical and site-specific channel characterization. As shown here, the point-data format enables multiple contributors to create channel model standards or pool measurement data to create larger datasets for exploring ray-tracing (e.g. site-specific) channel modeling or training in AI/ML propagation work, and to ensure the most accurate model using a larger dataset that is continually expanded through measurement contributions. The point-data approach includes site-specific point-by-point propagation data while readily supporting the creation of commonly-used cumulative distribution function (CDF) plot. The indoor hotspot (InH) datasets collected in Spring 2024 at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHZ by NYU WIRELESS are provided for the first time in point-data form, to augment statistical models previously presented solely as CDFs, in order to demonstrate how a standardized approach to measurement data could allow others to utilize the site-specific locations and key channel parameters observed at each location, to better understand, vet, and build upon statistical or site-specific CIRs from the contributions of many different data sources.</description>

      <title>Degrees of Freedom of Holographic MIMO in Multi-user Near-field Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05013v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) is an emerging technology for 6G communications, in which numerous antenna units are integrated in a limited space. As the HMIMO array aperture expands, the near-field region of the array is dramatically enlarged, resulting in more users being located in the near-field region. This creates new opportunities for wireless communications. In this context, the evaluation of the spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) of HMIMO multi-user systems in near-field channels is an open problem, as the analytical methods utilized for evaluating the DoF in far-field channels cannot be directly applied. In this paper, we propose a novel method to calculate the DoF of HMIMO in multi-user near-field channels. We first derive the DoF for a single user in the near field, and then extend the analysis to multi-user scenarios. In this latter scenario, we focus on the impact of spatial blocking between HMIMO users. The derived analytical framework reveals that the DoF of HMIMO in multi-user near-field channels is not in general given by the sum of the DoF of the HMIMO single-user setting because of spatial blocking. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In the considered case study, the number of DoF reduces by $21.2\%$ on average due to spatial blocking.</description>

      <title>Upper Mid-Band Channel Measurements and Characterization at 6.75 GHz FR1(C) and 16.95 GHz FR3 in an Indoor Factory Scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03565v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents detailed radio propagation measurements for an indoor factory (InF) environment at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz using a 1 GHz bandwidth channel sounder. Conducted at the NYU MakerSpace in the NYU Tandon School of Engineering campus in Brooklyn, NY, USA, our measurement campaign characterizes the radio propagation in a representative small factory with diverse machinery and open workspaces across 12 locations, comprising 5 line-of-sight (LOS) and 7 non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. Analysis using the close-in (CI) free space path loss (FSPL) model with a 1 m reference distance reveals path loss exponents (PLE) below 2 in LOS at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz, while in NLOS, PLE is similar to free-space propagation (e.g., PLE = 2). The RMS delay spread (DS) decreases at higher frequencies with a clear frequency dependence. Also, measurements show a wider RMS angular spread (AS) in NLOS compared to LOS at both frequency bands, with a decreasing trend as frequency increases. These observations in a dense-scatterer factory environment demonstrate frequency-dependent behavior that differs from existing industry-standard 3GPP models. Our findings provide crucial insights into complex propagation mechanisms in factory environments, essential for designing robust air interface and industrial wireless networks at the upper mid-band FR3 spectrum.</description>

Abstract: Radio deployments and spectrum planning benefit from path loss predictions. Obstructions along a communications link are often considered implicitly or through derived metrics such as representative clutter height or total obstruction depth. In this paper, we propose a path-specific path loss prediction method that uses convolutional neural networks to automatically perform feature extraction from 2-D obstruction height maps. Our methods result in low prediction error in a variety of environments without requiring derived metrics.</description>

      <title>Iterative Decoder of Channel-polarized Multilevel Coding for Data Center Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data center networks (DCNs) require a low-cost, low-power optical transceiver to handle increased traffic from generative artificial intelligence, video streaming services, and more. Improving the required signal-to-noise ratio (RSNR) by digital signal processing such as forward error correction (FEC) mitigates the requirements for electrical and optical components. The optical transceivers in DCNs exploit a low-complexity soft-decision (SD) FEC, consisting of short block-length linear error-correcting codes and a low-complexity SD decoder (SDD), such as a Chase decoder and ordered statistical decoding. The low complexity SDD efficiently approaches a maximum likelihood decoding (MLD). However, the decoding performance of MLD is limited by its finite block length. In this paper, we describe the detail of our proposed channel-polarized multilevel coding with iterative decoding (CP-MLC-ID), which improves the decoding performance. The 19.5$\%$-OH CP-MLC-ID 128-bit extended Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (eBCH) and KP4 codes outperform the concatenated eBCH and KP4 codes with a net coding gain of 0.25 and 0.40 dB for the same and double the number of SDDs, respectively. We also investigate the dependency of the decoding performance on the size of a bit interleaver. The performance degradation of CP-MLC-ID using an 8-bit interleaver is about 0.1 dB compared to using the large-bit interleaver. Our results indicate that even a weak connection by exclusive-OR between codewords improves the decoding performance, compared to simple concatenated codes in the DCNs.</description>

      <title>CATD: Unified Representation Learning for EEG-to-fMRI Cross-Modal Generation</title>

Abstract: Multi-modal neuroimaging analysis is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of brain function and pathology, as it allows for the integration of different imaging techniques, thus overcoming the limitations of individual modalities. However, the high costs and limited availability of certain modalities pose significant challenges. To address these issues, this paper proposes the Condition-Aligned Temporal Diffusion (CATD) framework for end-to-end cross-modal synthesis of neuroimaging, enabling the generation of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-detected Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signals from more accessible Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. By constructing Conditionally Aligned Block (CAB), heterogeneous neuroimages are aligned into a latent space, achieving a unified representation that provides the foundation for cross-modal transformation in neuroimaging. The combination with the constructed Dynamic Time-Frequency Segmentation (DTFS) module also enables the use of EEG signals to improve the temporal resolution of BOLD signals, thus augmenting the capture of the dynamic details of the brain. Experimental validation demonstrates that the framework improves the accuracy of brain activity state prediction by 9.13% (reaching 69.8%), enhances the diagnostic accuracy of brain disorders by 4.10% (reaching 99.55%), effectively identifies abnormal brain regions, enhancing the temporal resolution of BOLD signals. The proposed framework establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal synthesis of neuroimaging by unifying heterogeneous neuroimaging data into a latent representation space, showing promise in medical applications such as improving Parkinson's disease prediction and identifying abnormal brain regions.</description>

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) is regarded as a promising and revolutionary technology in 6G, aiming to transcend the constraints of ``Shannon's trap" by filtering out redundant information and extracting the core of effective data. Compared to traditional communication paradigms, SemCom offers several notable advantages, such as reducing the burden on data transmission, enhancing network management efficiency, and optimizing resource allocation. Numerous researchers have extensively explored SemCom from various perspectives, including network architecture, theoretical analysis, potential technologies, and future applications. However, as SemCom continues to evolve, a multitude of security and privacy concerns have arisen, posing threats to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of SemCom systems. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the technologies that can be utilized to secure SemCom. Firstly, we elaborate on the entire life cycle of SemCom, which includes the model training, model transfer, and semantic information transmission phases. Then, we identify the security and privacy issues that emerge during these three stages. Furthermore, we summarize the techniques available to mitigate these security and privacy threats, including data cleaning, robust learning, defensive strategies against backdoor attacks, adversarial training, differential privacy, cryptography, blockchain technology, model compression, and physical-layer security. Lastly, this paper outlines future research directions to guide researchers in related fields.</description>
