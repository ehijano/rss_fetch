      <title>Wormhole-induced effective coupling in SYK chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inhomogeneous quantum chains have recently been considered in the context of developing novel discrete realizations of holographic dualities. To advance this programme, we explore the ground states of infinite chains with large number $N$ of Majorana fermions on each site, which interact via on-site $q$-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) couplings, as well as via additional inhomogeneous hopping terms between nearest-neighbour sites. The hopping parameters are either aperiodically or randomly distributed. Our approach unifies techniques to solve SYK-like models in the large $N$ limit with a real-space renormalization group method known as strong-disorder renormalization group (SDRG). We show that the SDRG decimation of SYK dots linked by a strong hopping induces an effective hopping interaction between their neighbouring sites. If two decimated sites are nearest neighbours, in the large $q$ limit their local ground states admit a holographic dual description in terms of eternal traversable wormholes. At the end of the SDRG procedure, we obtain a factorised ground state of the infinite inhomogeneous SYK chains that we consider, which has a spacetime description involving a sequence of wormholes. This amounts to a local near-boundary description of the bulk geometry in the context of discrete holography.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal activity patterns induced by triadic interactions in an in silico neural medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Triadic interactions are general mechanisms by which a node or neuron can regulate directly the link or synapse between other two neurons. The regulation takes place in a familiar way by either depressing or facilitating synaptic transmission. Such interactions are ubiquitous in neural systems, accounting for axo-axonic synapses and tripartite synapses mediated by astrocytes, for instance, and have been related to neuronal and synaptic processes at different time-scales, including short and long-term synaptic plasticity. In the field of network science, triadic interactions have been shown to produce complex spatio-temporal patterns of connectivity. Here, we investigate the emergent behavior of an in silico neural medium constituted by a population of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with triadic interactions. We observe that, depending on relevant parameters defining triadic interactions, different activity patterns emerge. These include i) a silent phase, ii) a low-activity phase in which complex spatio-temporal patterns of low neuronal firing rate emerge that propagate through the medium, iii) a high-activity phase characterized by complex spatio-temporal patterns of high neuronal firing rate that propagate through the neural medium as waves of high firing activity over a bulk of low activity neurons, and iv) a pseudo-blinking phase in which the neural medium switches between high and low activity states, in a similar fashion to up/down state transitions. Here we analyse in depth the features of such patterns and relate our findings to the recently proposed model of triadic percolation.</description>

      <title>Gardner transition coincides with the emergence of jamming scalings in hard spheres and disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gardner transition in structural glasses is characterized by full-replica symmetry breaking of the free-energy landscape and the onset of anomalous aging dynamics due to marginal stability. Here we show that this transition also has a structural signature in finite-dimensional glasses consisting of hard spheres and disks. By analyzing the distribution of inter-particle gaps in the simulated static configurations at different pressures, we find that the Gardner transition coincides with the emergence of two well-known jamming scalings in the gap distribution, which enables the extraction of a structural order parameter. The jamming scalings reflect a compressible effective force network formed by contact and quasi-contact gaps, while non-contact gaps that do not participate in the effective force network are incompressible. Our results suggest that the Gardner transition in hard-particle glasses is a precursor of the jamming transition. The proposed structural signature and order parameter provide a convenient approach to detecting the Gardner transition in future granular experiments.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Matrix Product Operator: A Multi-Dimensionally Integrable Machine Learning Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A neural network-based machine learning potential energy surface (PES) expressed in a matrix product operator (NN-MPO) is proposed. The MPO form enables efficient evaluation of high-dimensional integrals that arise in solving the time-dependent and time-independent Schr\"odinger equation and effectively overcomes the so-called curse of dimensionality. This starkly contrasts with other neural network-based machine learning PES methods, such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), where evaluating high-dimensional integrals is not straightforward due to the fully connected topology in their backbone architecture. Nevertheless, the NN-MPO retains the high representational capacity of neural networks. NN-MPO can achieve spectroscopic accuracy with a test mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.03 cm$^{-1}$ for a fully coupled six-dimensional ab initio PES, using only 625 training points distributed across a 0 to 17,000 cm$^{-1}$ energy range. Our Python implementation is available at https://github.com/KenHino/Pompon.</description>

      <title>Non-linear sigma models for non-Hermitian random matrices in symmetry classes AI$^{\dagger}$ and AII$^{\dagger}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry of non-Hermitian matrices underpins many physical phenomena. In particular, chaotic open quantum systems exhibit universal bulk spectral correlations classified on the basis of time-reversal symmetry$^{\dagger}$ (TRS$^{\dagger}$), coinciding with those of non-Hermitian random matrices in the same symmetry class. Here, we analytically study the spectral correlations of non-Hermitian random matrices in the presence of TRS$^{\dagger}$ with signs $+1$ and $-1$, corresponding to symmetry classes AI$^{\dagger}$ and AII$^{\dagger}$, respectively. Using the fermionic replica non-linear sigma model approach, we derive $n$-fold integral expressions for the $n$th moment of the one-point and two-point characteristic polynomials. Performing the replica limit $n\to 0$, we qualitatively reproduce the density of states and level-level correlations of non-Hermitian random matrices with TRS$^{\dagger}$.</description>

      <title>Entropy alternatives for equilibrium and out of equilibrium systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an entropy-related function (non-repeatability) that describes dynamical behaviors in complex systems. A normalized version of this function (mutability) has been previously used in statistical physics. To illustrate their characteristics, we apply these functions to different systems: (a) magnetic moments on a square lattice and (b) real seismic data extracted from the IPOC-2007-2014 catalog. These systems are well-established in the literature, making them suitable benchmarks for testing the new approach. Shannon entropy is used as a reference to facilitate comparison, enabling us to highlight similarities, differences, and the potential benefits of the new measure. Notably, non-repeatability and mutability are sensitive to the order in which the data sequence is collected, distinguishing them from traditional entropy measures.</description>

      <title>Measurement-invisible quantum correlations in scrambling dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scrambling unitary dynamics in a quantum system transmutes local quantum information into a non-local web of correlations which manifests itself in a complex spatio-temporal pattern of entanglement. In such a context, we show there can exist three distinct dynamical phases characterised by qualitatively different forms of quantum correlations between two disjoint subsystems of the system. Transitions between these phases are driven by the relative sizes of the subsystems and the degree scrambling that the dynamics effects. Besides a phase which has no quantum correlations as manifested by vanishing entanglement between the parts and a phase which has non-trivial quantum correlations quantified by a finite entanglement monotone, we reveal a new phase transition within the entangled phase which separates phases wherein the quantum correlations are invisible or visible to measurements on one of the subsystems. This is encoded in the qualitatively different properties of the ensemble of states on one of the subsystems conditioned on the various measurement outcomes on the other subsystem. This provides a new characterisation of entanglement phases in terms of their response to measurements instead of the more ubiquitous measurement-induced entanglement transitions. Our results have implications for the kind of tasks that can be performed using measurement feedback within the framework of quantum interactive dynamics.</description>

      <title>Boolean SK Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For over half a century, statistical mechanics of spin glasses played as a paradigm to model and interpret disparate phenomena, ranging from quantitative biology to computer science. However, despite the extensive body of research in this area, there is still a notable lack of studies addressing the replacement of Ising spins with Boolean spins: as the latter play as bits in Machine Learning, this gap to fill is now mandatory. Purpose of this paper is to address this study by focusing on the mean field assumption, providing a comprehensive description of the results pertaining to these networks, referred to as the Boolean SK model due to their close relationship with the SK one. We provide a comprehensive framework for this model by employing Guerra interpolation: the thermodynamic limit, the replica symmetric and the broken replica free energy expressions are derived. Further, we inspect the onset of the replica symmetry breaking -- i.e., the de Almeida-Thouless line -- and derive Ghirlanda-Guerra fluctuations. All theoretical findings are corroborated by numerical inspections and both highlight crucial differences in the network's behavior if compared with the Ising SK model: as the temperature is lowered, no phase transitions are evidenced and the model continuously moves from a random (ergodic) behavior to a disordered (glassy) phase.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Universality in Neural Network Dynamics with Generalized Structured Input Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bridging the gap between the practical performance of deep learning and its theoretical foundations often involves analyzing neural networks through stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Expanding on previous research that focused on modeling structured inputs under a simple Gaussian setting, we analyze the behavior of a deep learning system trained on inputs modeled as Gaussian mixtures to better simulate more general structured inputs. Through empirical analysis and theoretical investigation, we demonstrate that under certain standardization schemes, the deep learning model converges toward Gaussian setting behavior, even when the input data follow more complex or real-world distributions. This finding exhibits a form of universality in which diverse structured distributions yield results consistent with Gaussian assumptions, which can support the theoretical understanding of deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Complete mathematical theory of the jamming transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The jamming transition of frictionless athermal particles is a paradigm to understand the mechanics of amorphous materials at the atomic scale. Concepts related to the jamming transition and the mechanical response of jammed packings have cross-fertilized into other areas such as atomistic descriptions of the elasticity and plasticity of glasses. In this perspective article, the microscopic mathematical theory of the jamming transition is reviewed from first-principles. The starting point of the derivation is a microscopically-reversible particle-bath Hamiltonian from which the governing equation of motion for the grains under an external deformation is derived. From this equation of motion, microscopic expressions are obtained for both the shear modulus and the viscosity as a function of the distance from the jamming transition (respectively, above and below the transition). Regarding the vanishing of the shear modulus at the unjamming transition, this theory, as originally demonstrated in [Zaccone \&amp; Scossa-Romano, Phys. Rev. B 83, 184205 (2011)], is currently the only quantitative microscopic theory in parameter-free agreement with numerical simulations of [O'Hern et al. Phys. Rev. E 68, 011306 (2003)] for jammed packings. The divergence of the viscosity upon approaching the jamming transition from below is derived here, for the first time, from the same microscopic Hamiltonian. The quantitative microscopic prediction of the diverging viscosity is shown to be in fair agreement with numerical results of sheared 2D soft disks from [Olsson \&amp; Teitel, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 178001 (2007)].</description>
