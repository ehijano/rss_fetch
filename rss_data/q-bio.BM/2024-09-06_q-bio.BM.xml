      <title>A multi-scale analysis of the CzrA transcription repressor highlights the allosteric changes induced by metal ion binding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Allosteric regulation is a widespread strategy employed by several proteins to transduce chemical signals and perform biological functions. Metal sensor proteins are exemplary in this respect, e.g., in that they selectively bind and unbind DNA depending on the state of a distal ion coordination site. In this work, we carry out an investigation of the structural and mechanical properties of the CzrA transcription repressor through the analysis of microsecond-long molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories; the latter are processed through the mapping entropy optimisation workflow (MEOW), a recently developed information-theoretical method that highlights, in an unsupervised manner, residues of particular mechanical, functional, and biological importance. This approach allows us to unveil how differences in the properties of the molecule are controlled by the state of the zinc coordination site, with particular attention to the DNA binding region. These changes correlate with a redistribution of the conformational variability of the residues throughout the molecule, in spite of an overall consistency of its architecture in the two (ion-bound and free) coordination states. The results of this work corroborate previous studies, provide novel insight into the fine details of the mechanics of CzrA, and showcase the MEOW approach as a novel instrument for the study of allosteric regulation and other processes in proteins through the analysis of plain MD simulations.</description>

      <title>Implementation of The Future of Drug Discovery: QuantumBased Machine Learning Simulation (QMLS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) phase of drug development is a lengthy and costly process. To revolutionize this process, we introduce our new concept QMLS to shorten the whole R&amp;D phase to three to six months and decrease the cost to merely fifty to eighty thousand USD. For Hit Generation, Machine Learning Molecule Generation (MLMG) generates possible hits according to the molecular structure of the target protein while the Quantum Simulation (QS) filters molecules from the primary essay based on the reaction and binding effectiveness with the target protein. Then, For Lead Optimization, the resultant molecules generated and filtered from MLMG and QS are compared, and molecules that appear as a result of both processes will be made into dozens of molecular variations through Machine Learning Molecule Variation (MLMV), while others will only be made into a few variations. Lastly, all optimized molecules would undergo multiple rounds of QS filtering with a high standard for reaction effectiveness and safety, creating a few dozen pre-clinical-trail-ready drugs. This paper is based on our first paper, where we pitched the concept of machine learning combined with quantum simulations. In this paper we will go over the detailed design and framework of QMLS, including MLMG, MLMV, and QS.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Molecular Design: Integrating Latent Variable and Auto-Regressive Models for Goal Directed Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: De novo molecule design has become a highly active research area, advanced significantly through the use of state-of-the-art generative models. Despite these advances, several fundamental questions remain unanswered as the field increasingly focuses on more complex generative models and sophisticated molecular representations as an answer to the challenges of drug design. In this paper, we return to the simplest representation of molecules, and investigate overlooked limitations of classical generative approaches, particularly Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and auto-regressive models. We propose a hybrid model in the form of a novel regularizer that leverages the strengths of both to improve validity, conditional generation, and style transfer of molecular sequences. Additionally, we provide an in depth discussion of overlooked assumptions of these models' behaviour.</description>
