      <title>Information Entropy of the Financial Market: Modelling Random Processes Using Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the role of information entropy on the behaviour of random processes, and how this might take effect in the dynamics of financial market prices. We then go on to show how the Open Quantum Systems approach can be used as a more flexible alternative to classical methods in terms of modelling the entropy gain of a random process. We start by describing an open quantum system that can be used to model the state of a financial market. We then go on to show how to represent an essentially classical diffusion in this framework. Finally, we show how by relaxing certain assumptions, one can generate interesting and essentially non-classical results, which are highlighted through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Optimal consumption under loss-averse multiplicative habit-formation preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a loss-averse version of the multiplicative habit formation preference and the corresponding optimal investment and consumption strategies over an infinite horizon. The agent's consumption preference is depicted by a general S-shaped utility function of her consumption-to-habit ratio. By considering the concave envelope of the S-shaped utility and the associated dual value function, we provide a thorough analysis of the HJB equation for the concavified problem via studying a related nonlinear free boundary problem. Based on established properties of the solution to this free boundary problem, we obtain the optimal consumption and investment policies in feedback form. Some new and technical verification arguments are developed to cope with generality of the utility function. The equivalence between the original problem and the concavified problem readily follows from the structure of the feedback policies. We also discuss some quantitative properties of the optimal policies under several commonly used S-shaped utilities, complemented by illustrative numerical examples and their financial implications.</description>

      <title>An empirical study of market risk factors for Bitcoin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study examines whether broader market factors and the Fama-French three-factor model can effectively analyze the idiosyncratic risk and return characteristics of Bitcoin. By incorporating Fama-french factors, the explanatory power of these factors on Bitcoin's excess returns over various moving average periods is tested. The analysis aims to determine if equity market factors are significant in explaining and modeling systemic risk in Bitcoin.</description>

      <title>Dynamically Consistent Analysis of Realized Covariations in Term Structure Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we show how to analyze the covariation of bond prices nonparametrically and robustly, staying consistent with a general no-arbitrage setting. This is, in particular, motivated by the problem of identifying the number of statistically relevant factors in the bond market under minimal conditions. We apply this method in an empirical study which suggests that a high number of factors is needed to describe the term structure evolution and that the term structure of volatility varies over time.</description>

      <title>Gordon Growth Model with Vector Autoregressive Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a Gordon's dividend discount model, based on Vector Autoregressive Process (VAR). We provide two Propositions, which are related to generic Gordon growth model and Gordon growth model, which is based on the VAR process.</description>
