      <title>Strategic Analysis of Fair Rank-Minimizing Mechanisms with Agent Refusal Option</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines strategic issues in fair rank-minimizing mechanisms, which choose an assignment that minimizes the average rank of object types to which agents are assigned and satisfy a fairness property called equal treatment of equals. As one of these fair mechanisms, the uniform rank-minimizing mechanism is considered. We particularly focus on the case where agents can refuse their assignment and obtain the outside option instead. Without the refusal option, if the uniform rank-minimizing mechanism is used, truth-telling is not strategically dominated by any strategies. However, if agents have the option, then an outside option demotion strategy -- revealing all object types as acceptable without changing the ranking of truly acceptable ones -- strategically dominates truth-telling. Moreover, we show that adopting this strategy may lead to inefficient assignments. To counter this, we propose the modified uniform rank-minimizing mechanism, though it may lead agents to strategically reduce the number of acceptable types.</description>

      <title>The Logic of Political Survival Revisited: Consequences of Elite Uncertainty Under Authoritarian Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing research has established that autocrats offer concessions to prevent ouster by their inner circle. This paper examines how those concessions are influenced by the relative uncertainty of an autocrat's inner circle about remaining in that favored body. I take as my starting point the formal model of political survival presented in Bueno de Mesquita et al.'s The Logic of Political Survival. I extend the model to account for variation in the relative uncertainty of an autocrat's inner circle. To make the math tractable, I dispense with convention and introduce comparative statics across two models with different formulations of uncertainty. This exercise reveals a set of conditions under which to expect an increase in the concessions offered by an autocrat, with implications for development and democracy. Those findings yield a corresponding set of logical corollaries with potential to further our understanding of authoritarian politics, including an unexamined facet of the "dictator's dilemma" (Wintrobe 1990, 1998) and related incentives for members of an inner circle to permit purges or act to destabilize their ranks. The models also identify a source of policy volatility not found outside of autocracies. Taken together, the findings suggest a need for more research on elite uncertainty in autocracies.</description>

      <title>Bargaining via Weber's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the two-player bargaining problem using Weber's law in psychophysics, which is applied to the perception of utility changes. By applying this law, one of the players (or both of them) defines lower and upper utility thresholds, such that once the lower threshold is established, bargaining continues in the inter-threshold domain where the solutions are acceptable to both parties. This provides a sequential solution to the bargaining problem, and it can be implemented iteratively reaching well-defined outcomes. The solution is Pareto-optimal, symmetric, and is invariant to affine-transformations of utilities. For susceptible players, iterations are unnecessary, so they converge in one stage toward the (axiomatic) Nash solution of the bargaining problem. This situation also accounts for the asymmetric Nash solution, where the weights of each player are expressed via their Weber constants. Thus the Nash solution is reached without external arbiters and without requiring the independence of irrelevant alternatives. For non-susceptible players our approach leads to different results.</description>

      <title>Fairness in Multi-Proposer-Multi-Responder Ultimatum Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ultimatum Game is conventionally formulated in the context of two players. Nonetheless, real-life scenarios often entail community interactions among numerous individuals. To address this, we introduce an extended version of the Ultimatum Game, called the Multi-Proposer-Multi-Responder Ultimatum Game. In this model, multiple responders and proposers simultaneously interact in a one-shot game, introducing competition both within proposers and within responders. We derive subgame-perfect Nash equilibria for all scenarios and explore how these non-trivial values might provide insight into proposal and rejection behavior experimentally observed in the context of one vs. one Ultimatum Game scenarios. Additionally, by considering the asymptotic numbers of players, we propose two potential estimates for a "fair" threshold: either 31.8% or 36.8% of the pie (share) for the responder.</description>

      <title>School Choice with Multiple Priorities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04780v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study considers the method to derive a ranking of alternatives by aggregating the rankings submitted by several individuals who may not evaluate all of them. The collection of subsets of alternatives that individuals (can) evaluate is referred to as an evaluability profile. For a given evaluability profile, we define an aggregating ranking function whose inputs are the rankings of individuals on the alternatives they evaluate. We investigate the properties of aggregating ranking functions, which are modifications of those introduced in previous studies. Whether an aggregating ranking function satisfying a combination of properties exists depends on the evaluability profile. Thus, we identify the necessary and sufficient conditions on evaluability profiles to ensure the existence of the functions satisfying four different combinations of properties. Furthermore, to examine how frequently possible or impossible evaluability profiles occur, we derive the proportion of each type in specific cases.</description>

      <title>Costly Persuasion by a Partially Informed Sender</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14087v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study a model of costly Bayesian persuasion by a privately and partially informed sender who conducts a public experiment. The cost of running an experiment is the expected reduction of a weighted log-likelihood ratio function of the sender's belief. This is microfounded by a Wald sequential sampling problem where good news and bad news cost differently. I focus on equilibria that satisfy the D1 criterion. The equilibrium outcome depends crucially on the relative costs of drawing good and bad news in the experiment. If bad news is costlier, there exists a unique separating equilibrium, and the receiver unambiguously benefits from the sender's private information. If good news is costlier, the single-crossing property fails. There may exist pooling and partial pooling equilibria, and in some equilibria, the receiver suffers from sender private information.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Impartial Selection with Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the impartial selection problem, a subset of agents up to a fixed size $k$ among a group of $n$ is to be chosen based on votes cast by the agents themselves. A selection mechanism is impartial if no agent can influence its own chance of being selected by changing its vote. It is $\alpha$-optimal if, for every instance, the ratio between the votes received by the selected subset is at least a fraction of $\alpha$ of the votes received by the subset of size $k$ with the highest number of votes. We study deterministic impartial mechanisms in a more general setting with arbitrarily weighted votes and provide the first approximation guarantee, roughly $1/\lceil 2n/k\rceil$. When the number of agents to select is large enough compared to the total number of agents, this yields an improvement on the previously best known approximation ratio of $1/k$ for the unweighted setting. We further show that our mechanism can be adapted to the impartial assignment problem, in which multiple sets of up to $k$ agents are to be selected, with a loss in the approximation ratio of $1/2$.</description>
