      <title>Numerical exploration of the bootstrap in spin chain models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the bootstrap approach (a dual optimization method to the variational approach) to one-dimensional spin chains, leveraging semidefinite programming to extract numerical results. We study how correlation functions in the ground state converge to their true values at and away from criticality and at relaxed optimality. We consider the transverse Ising model, the three state Potts model, and other non-integrable spin chains and investigate to what extent semidefinite methods can reliably extract numerical emergent physical data, including conformal central charges, correlation lengths and scaling dimensions. We demonstrate procedures to extract these data and show preliminary results in the various models considered. We compare to exact analytical results and to exact diagonalization when the system volume is small enough. When we attempt to go to the thermodynamic limit, the semidefinite numerical method with translation invariance imposed as a constraint finds the solution with periodic boundary conditions even if these have not been specified. This implies that the determination of all conformal data in correlators has to be handled at finite volume. Our investigation reveals that the approach has practical challenges. In particular, the correlation functions extracted from the optimal solution, which function as slack variables in the optimization, have convergence issues that suggest an underlying exponential complexity in the system size.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of Species Thermodynamics and the Black Hole - Tower Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Species thermodynamics has been proposed in analogy to black hole thermodynamics. The entropy scales like an area and is given by the mere counting of the number of the species. In this work, we $\textit{derive}$ the rules of species thermodynamics and explain how those $\textit{originate}$ from standard thermodynamics. We consider configurations of species in thermal equilibrium inside a box of size $L$ and show that the temperature $T$ of the system, which plays a crucial role, is always upper bounded by the species scale $\Lambda_{\rm sp}$. We highlight three relevant regimes: (i) when $L^{-1}&lt; T&lt;\Lambda_{\rm sp}$, and gravitational collapse is avoided, the system exhibits standard thermodynamics features, for example, with the entropy scaling like the volume of the box; (ii) in the limit $L^{-1}\simeq T\rightarrow \Lambda_{\rm sp}$ we recover the rules of species thermodynamics with the entropy scaling like the area of the box; (iii) an intermediate regime with $ L^{-1}\simeq T&lt; \Lambda_{\rm sp}$ that avoids gravitational collapse and fulfills the Covariant Entropy Bound; this interpolates between the previous two regimes and its entropy is given merely in terms of the counting of the species contributing to the thermodynamic ensemble. This study also allows us to find a novel and independent bottom-up rationale for the Emergent String Conjecture. Finally, we propose the $\textit{Black Hole - Tower Correspondence}$, a generalization of the celebrated Black Hole - String Correspondence. This provides us with a robust framework to interpret the results of our thermodynamic investigation. Moreover, it allows us to qualitatively account for the entropy of black holes in terms of the degrees of freedom of the weakly coupled species in the tower.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative topological strings from resurgence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The partition function of topological string theory on any family of Calabi-Yau threefolds is defined perturbatively as an asymptotic series in the topological string coupling and encodes, in a holomorphic limit, higher genus Gromov-Witten as well as Gopakumar-Vafa invariants. We prove that the partition function of topological strings of any CY in this limit can be written as a product, where each factor is given by the partition function of the resolved conifold with shifted arguments, raised to the power of certain sheaf invariants. We use this result to put forward an expression for the non-perturbative topological string partition function in this limit, as a product over analytic functions in the topological string coupling which correspond to the Borel sums for the resolved conifold found previously. The non-perturbative corrections to the partition function are identified with Stokes jumps of a Borel summation. They depend only on genus zero GV invariants and can be expressed entirely in terms of a single function which is introduced as a deformation of the prepotential.</description>

      <title>In-in formalism for the entropy of quantum fields in curved spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to compute the purity and entanglement entropy for quantum fields in a systematic perturbative expansion. To that end, we generalize the in-in formalism to non-unitary dynamics (i.e. accounting for the presence of an environment) and to the calculation of quantum information measures, which are not observables in the usual sense. This allows us to reduce the problem to one involving standard correlation functions, and to organize their computation in a diagrammatic expansion for which we construct the corresponding Feynman rules. As an illustration, we apply the formalism to a cosmological setting inspired by the effective field theory of inflation. We find that at late times, non-linear loop corrections share the same time behavior as the linear contribution, and only yield a slight redressing of the purity. In particular, when the environment is heavy compared to the Hubble scale, the phenomenon of recoherence previously encountered is robust to the class of non-linear extensions considered. Bridging the gap between perturbative quantum field theory and open quantum systems paves the way to a better understanding of renormalization and resummation in open effective field theories. It also enables a more systematic exploration of quantum information properties in field theoretic settings.</description>

      <title>Quantum inequalities for quantum black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate spacetime inequalities applicable to quantum-corrected black holes to all orders of backreaction in semiclassical gravity. Namely, we propose refined versions of the quantum Penrose and reverse isoperimetric inequalities, valid for all known three-dimensional asymptotically anti-de Sitter quantum black holes. Previous proposals of the quantum Penrose inequality apply in higher dimensions but fail when applied in three dimensions beyond the perturbative regime. Our quantum Penrose inequality, valid in three dimensions, holds at all orders of backreaction. This suggests cosmic censorship must exist in non-perturbative semiclassical gravity. Our quantum reverse isoperimetric inequality implies a maximum entropy state for quantum black holes at fixed volume.</description>

      <title>Local/Short-range conformal field theories from long-range perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that by imposing the conformal Wald identity, one can extract conformal data of the corresponding short-range/local CFT from the long-range perturbation theory. We first apply this to the O(N) vector model. We demonstrate that by properly re-sum the perturbative series, one gets reasonable estimations of the critical exponents of the local/short-range CFTs. We then apply this method to study fermionic models with four-fermion interactions. In 2+1 dimensions, the model has the Gross-Neveu coupling and the Thirring coupling. We also consider a 4+1 dimensional theory with a generalized Thirring coupling.</description>

      <title>Quantum corrections to tunnelling amplitudes of neutral scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though theoretical treatments of quantum tunnelling within single-particle quantum mechanics are well-established, at present, there is no quantum field-theoretic description (QFT) of tunnelling. Due to the single-particle nature of quantum mechanics, many-particle effects arising from quantum field theory are not accounted for. Such many-particle effects, including pair-production, have proved to be essential in resolving the Klein-paradox. This work seeks to determine how quantum corrections affect the tunnelling probability through an external field. We investigate a massive neutral scalar field, which interacts with an external field in accordance with relativistic quantum mechanics. To consider QFT corrections, we include another massive quantised neutral scalar field coupling to the original via a cubic interaction. This study formulates an all-order recursive expression for the loop-corrected scalar propagator, which contains only the class of vertex-corrected Feynman diagrams. This equation applies for general external potentials. Though there is no closed-form analytic solution, we also demonstrate how to approximate the QFT corrections if a perturbative coupling to the quantised field is assumed.</description>

      <title>Running of the Number of Degrees of Freedom in Quantum Conformal Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how the number of degrees of freedom in Weyl conformal gravity runs with the energy scale from the UV fixed point. To this end we employ two approaches. First, we utilize the Fradkin--Tseytlin prescription for the number of degrees of freedom and demonstrate that the one-loop results are highly dependent on the selected background. We then employ the counting methodology based on the $a$- and $c$-functions, which are typically used to characterize the trace anomaly of conformal field theory in four dimensions. We compute these in the enhanced one-loop approximation and demonstrate that the degrees of freedom decrease monotonically from six degrees in the UV regime. This behavior is independent of the backgrounds considered. Finally, we show how to relate the Fradkin--Tseytlin prescription to counting based on the $a$- and $c$-functions.</description>

      <title>Towards full instanton trans-series in Hofstadter's butterfly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trans-series completion of perturbative series of a wide class of quantum mechanical systems can be determined by combining the resurgence program and extra input coming from exact WKB analysis. In this paper, we reexamine the Harper-Hofstadter model and its spectrum, Hofstadter's butterfly, in light of recent developments. We demonstrate the connection between the perturbative energy series of the Harper-Hofstadter model and the vev of $1/2$-BPS Wilson loop of 5d SYM and clarify the differences between their non-perturbative corrections. Taking insights from the cosine potential model, we construct the full energy trans-series for flux $\phi=2\pi/Q$ and provide numerical evidence with remarkably high precision. Finally, we revisit the problem of self-similarity of the butterfly and discuss the possibility of a completed version of the Rammal-Wilkinson formula.</description>

      <title>Perspective on properties of renormalization schemes at high loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on recent work on a class of renormalization schemes in QCD, termed the MOMt schemes. None of the renormalization group functions of the eight QCD MOMt schemes involve even zetas to five loops. A new scheme is introduced for scalar $\phi^3$ theory in six dimensions where the full Laurent series in the regularizing parameter of the Green's function is absorbed into the renormalization constants. Designated as the MaxSbar scheme it is equivalent to the MOMt scheme in the critical dimension.</description>

      <title>Nicolai maps and uniqueness in the light-cone gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the Nicolai map for the supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, in the light-cone gauge, to the second order in the coupling constant for all critical dimensions (d=3,4,6,10). The process of integrating out unphysical degrees of freedom in this gauge, produces a four fermion interaction term. We show that, to the order investigated here, this term is harmless. We demonstrate the existence of a particularly `simple' map in d=4 in the light-cone gauge and address the issue of uniqueness in the context of the map. We also investigate the map in the light-cone superspace in d=4.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the collective field theory description of the singlet sector of a free and massless matrix field in $d$ dimensions. The $k$-local collective fields are functions of $(d-1)k+1$ coordinates. We provide a map between the collective fields and fields in the dual gravitational theory defined on AdS$_{d+1}$ spacetime. The coordinates of the collective field have a natural interpretation: the $k$-local collective field is a field defined on an AdS$_{d+1}\times$S$^{k-1}\times$S$^{(d-2)(k-2)}\times$S$^{d-3}$ spacetime. The modes of a harmonic expansion on the S$^{k-1}\times$S$^{(d-2)(k-2)}\times$S$^{d-3}$ portion of the spacetime leads to the spinning bulk fields of the dual gravity theory.</description>

      <title>Kink-kink solutions in BPS impurity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that BPS-impurity theories may support BPS kink-kink solutions i.e., an energetically degenerated family of solutions describing two kinks at any mutual distance. This requires a singular impurity. As an example we consider the sine-Gordon and $\phi^6$ models coupled with such a BPS impurity. Interestingly, obtained solutions are identical to double sine-Gordon kinks and Christ-Lee kinks respectively.
  We also study the spectral flow on the moduli space. All the modes have an odd number of nodes to cancel the singularity of the impurity.</description>

      <title>A study of three butterflies: entanglement wedge method, OTOC and pole-skipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate two salient chaotic features, namely Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity, in the context of an asymptotically Lifshitz black hole background with an arbitrary critical exponent. These features are computed using three methods: entanglement wedge method, out-of-time-ordered correlator computation and pole-skipping. We provide a comparative analysis of the results from these methods, where the features derived from the entanglement wedge and OTOC methods are equivalent. On the contrary, the butterfly velocity obtained from pole-skipping matches only when the critical exponent becomes unity, i.e., the usual asymptotically AdS black hole. Furthermore, we evaluate the chaos at the classical level by computing the eikonal phase and Lyapunov exponent from the bulk gravity. These quantities emerge as nontrivial functions of the anisotropy index. By examining the classical eikonal phase, we uncover different scattering scenarios in the near-horizon and near-boundary regimes. We also discuss potential limitations regarding the choice of the turning point of the null geodesic in our approach.</description>

      <title>Restricted baby Skyrme-Maxwell theory in a magnetic medium: BPS configurations and some properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of BPS configurations in a restricted baby Skyrme-Maxwell enlarged via the inclusion of a nontrivial magnetic permeability. In order to attain such a goal, we use the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield prescription, which allows us to obtain the lower bound for the energy and the BPS equations whose [electrically neutral] solutions saturate that bound. During the energy minimization procedure, we find a differential constraint which involves the self-dual potential, the superpotential itself and also the magnetic permeability. In order to solve the BPS system, we focus our attention on those solutions with rotational symmetry. For that, we fix the magnetic permeability and select two BPS potentials which exhibit a similar behavior near to the vacuum. We depict the resulting profiles and proceed to an analytical description of the properties of the BPS magnetic field. Furthermore, we consider some essential aspects of our model, such as the conditions for the overall existence of the BPS solutions, and how the permeability affects the magnetic flux. Finally, we present a family of exact BPS solutions.</description>

      <title>Hint to Supersymmetry from GR Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $S$-matrix formulation of gravity suggests that the $\theta$-vacuum structure must not be sustained by the theory. We point out that, when applied to the vacuum of general relativity, this criterion hints to supersymmetry. The topological susceptibility of gravitational vacuum induced by Eguchi-Hanson instantons can be eliminated neither by spin-$1/2$ fermions nor by an axion coupled via them since such fermions do not provide instanton zero modes. Instead, the job is done by a spin-$3/2$ fermion, hence realizing a local supersymmetry. This scenario also necessitates the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry and predicts the existence of axion of $R$-symmetry which gets mass exclusively from the gravitational instantons. The $R$-axion can be a viable dark matter candidate. Matching between the index and the anomaly imposes a constraint that spin-$1/2$ fermions should not contribute to the chiral gravitational anomaly.</description>

      <title>Gauged Skyrme analogue of Chern-Pontryagin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analogue of the Chern-Pontryagin density for $SO(D)$ gauged $O(D+1)$ Skyrme systems, referred to as Skyrme--Chern-Pontyagin (SCP) densities iss known for dimensions $D=2,3,4$. Since these are defined only through a prescription, it is necessary to extend the realisation to higher $D$, which is carried out here for $D=5$. It is found that in $D=5$ there is limitation on the group gauging the Skyrmion, implying that such limitation will persist in higher dimensions. The construction of SCP densities in $D=2,3,4,5$ is presented here in a unified notation with the aim of of pointing out to possible extarpolation to all dimensions.</description>

      <title>Strong wave turbulence in strongly local large $N$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study wave turbulence in systems with two special properties: a large number of fields (large $N$) and a nonlinear interaction that is strongly local in momentum space. The first property allows us to find the kinetic equation at all interaction strengths -- both weak and strong, at leading order in $1/N$. The second allows us to turn the kinetic equation -- an integral equation -- into a differential equation. We find stationary solutions for the occupation number as a function of wave number, valid at all scales. As expected, on the weak coupling end the solutions asymptote to Kolmogorov-Zakharov scaling. On the strong coupling end, they asymptote to either the widely conjectured generalized Phillips spectrum (also known as critical balance), or a Kolmogorov-like scaling exponent.</description>

      <title>Integrability and renormalizability for the fully anisotropic ${\rm SU}(2)$ principal chiral field and its deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the class of $1+1$ dimensional field theories referred to as the non-linear sigma models, there is known to be a deep connection between classical integrability and one-loop renormalizability. In this work, the phenomenon is reviewed on the example of the so-called fully anisotropic ${\rm SU}(2)$ Principal Chiral Field (PCF). Along the way, we discover a new classically integrable four parameter family of sigma models, which is obtained from the fully anisotropic ${\rm SU}(2)$ PCF by means of the Poisson-Lie deformation. The theory turns out to be one-loop renormalizable and the system of ODEs describing the flow of the four couplings is derived. Also provided are explicit analytical expressions for the full set of functionally independent first integrals (renormalization group invariants).</description>

      <title>Photon frequency variation in non-linear electro-magnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We set a generalised non-linear Lagrangian, encompassing Born-Infeld and Heisenberg-Euler theories among others. The Lagrangian reduces to the Maxwell Lagrangian at lowest order. The field is composed by a propagating light-wave in an electro-magnetic background. The wave exhibits energy variation when the background is space-time dependent. In the photon description, this implies a red or a blue shift, like what we obtained in massive theories, as the de Broglie-Proca or effective mass theories as the Standard-Model Extension under Lorentz symmetry violation. The two results, photon energy-conservation and the frequency shift are instead new for non-linear electro-magnetism. We conclude by discussing how these static frequency shifts when added to the expansion red shift allow new interpretations in cosmology or for atomic spectra. We finally consider the consequences on the Poincar\'e symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate potential scattering and tunneling dynamics of a particle wavepacket evolving according to the relativistic Schr\"odinger equation (also known as the Salpeter equation). The tunneling properties of the Salpeter equation differ from those of the standard relativistic wave equations (such as the Klein-Gordon or Dirac equations). In particular, the tunneling solutions must be found by working in momentum space, given that the equation in configuration space contains a pseudo-differential operator. The resulting integral equations are derived and solved numerically for wavepackets scattering on model potential barriers. The solutions are characterized by the absence of Klein tunneling and an effect of the potential on the fraction of the transmitted wavepacket that propagates outside the light cone, a feature that has in the past been well-studied only for free propagation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observed Standard Model is consistent with the existence of vector-like species with electric charge a multiple of $e/6$. The discovery of a fractionally charged particle would provide nonperturbative information about Standard Model physics, and furthermore rule out some or all of the minimal theories of unification. We discuss the phenomenology of such particles and focus particularly on current LHC constraints, for which we reinterpret various searches to bound a variety of fractionally charged representations. We emphasize that in some circumstances the collider bounds are surprisingly low or nonexistent, which highlights the discovery potential for these species which have distinctive signatures and important implications. We additionally offer pedagogical discussions of the representation theory of gauge groups with different global structures, and separately of the modern framework of Generalized Global Symmetries, either of which serves to underscore the bottom-up importance of these searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Feigin-Frenkel homomorphism underpinning the Wakimoto construction realises an affine Lie algebra at critical level in terms of the $\beta\gamma$-system of free fields. It was recently shown that much of the construction also goes through for double loop algebras. However, certain divergent sums appear. In this paper, we show that, suggestively, these sums vanish when one performs $\zeta$-function regularisation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational spinoptics in a curved space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss propagation of the weak high-frequency gravitational waves in a curved spacetime background. We develop a so-called spinoptics approximation which takes into account interaction of the spin of the field with the curvature of the background metric. This is achieved by modifying the standard geometric optics approximation by including the helicity sensitive terms of the order $1/\omega$ in the eikonal equation. The novelty of the approach developed in this paper is that instead of study of the high-frequency expansion of the equations for the gravitational field perturbations we construct the effective action for the gravitational spinoptics. The gravitational spinoptics equations derived by variation of the effective action correctly reproduce the earlier obtained results. However, the proposed effective action approach is technically more simple and transparent. It allows one to reduce the study of the high-frequency gravitational waves to study classical dynamics of massless particles with internal discrete degree of freedom (helicity). The formalism is covariant and it can be applied for arbitrary vacuum space-time background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been known for some time that the classical concept of radiation is not covariant: for uniformly accelerated particles, it depends on the state of motion of the observer relative to the particle emitting it. Moreover, recent literature in the field of Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetimes suggests a deep connection between bremsstrahlung and the Unruh effect, where zero-Rindler energy particles have played a central role beyond constructing the radiation contents of systems; as this is an unfamiliar concept, it seems unsettling to deal with particles having no energy. This thesis studies such a connection in both the classical and quantum perspectives, showing how the quantum Unruh effect is responsible for the classical radiation detected for the electric and gravitational cases, and studies the role of zero-Rindler-energy particles and how they relate to the radiative field of uniformly accelerated particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the expansion of the universe can create particles. However, due to ambiguities when defining particles during the expansion, there are still debates about how to choose vacuum and particle states. To clarify how particles are produced in an expanding universe, we study the creation of real scalar particles in flat FLRW spacetimes by using a recently developed equal-time Wigner formalism. By comparing this quantum kinetic formalism with the standard Bogoliubov approach, we make a natural definition of a particle number in terms of kinetic phase-space functions, which we then compare with common adiabatic particle numbers. With inspiration from flat spacetime QED, we perform numerical calculations and discuss the interpretation of the particle numbers in terms of a hypothetical switch-off in the expansion rate. Finally, we consider how this interpretation is affected by regularization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of localized initial value profiles when propagated in integrable versions of higher time-derivative theories. In contrast to the standard cases in nonlinear integrable systems, where these profiles evolve into a specific number of N-soliton solutions as dictated by the conservation laws, in the higher time derivative theories the theoretical prediction is that the initial profiles can settle into either two-soliton solutions or into any number of N-soliton solutions. In the latter case this implies that the solutions exhibit oscillations that spread in time but remain finite. We confirm these analytical predictions by explicitly solving the associated Cauchy problem numerically with multiple initial profiles for various higher time-derivative versions of integrable modified Korteweg-de Vries equations. In the case with the theoretical possibility of a decay into two-soliton solutions, the emergence of underlying singularities may prevent the profiles from fully developing or may be accompanied by oscillatory, chargeless standing waves at the origin.</description>

Abstract: We investigate future singularities originating from the anisotropy in the universe. We formulate a new class of singularities in the homogeneous and anisotropic universe, comparing them with the known singularities in the homogeneous and isotropic universe. We also discuss the physical consequences of the new singularities. Moreover, we develop a novel reconstruction method for the anisotropic universe by introducing four scalar fields to reconstruct cosmological models in which future singularities appear. We present an explicit example where the anisotropy may grow in the future up to singularity.</description>

      <title>Theories of flavour from the Planck scale to the electroweak scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The flavour puzzle remains as one of the most intriguing enigmas of particle physics. In this thesis, we propose and study theories of flavour which generically hint to a multi-scale origin of flavour. First we explore the idea of fermiophobic models and messenger dominance, where the chiral fermions of the Standard Model are uncharged under (part of) an extended gauge symmetry, which also forbids Yukawa couplings for chiral fermions. These are generated effectively due to the presence of hierarchically heavy messengers, including vector-like fermions and/or heavy Higgs doublets. Simultaneously, this mechanism generates effective couplings of chiral fermions to the gauge bosons of the extended symmetry, leading to a predictive phenomenology connected to the origin of flavour hierarchies. We present two models of this kind, based on gauge $U(1)$ and twin Pati-Salam symmetries, that have implications for low energy flavour anomalies. Secondly, we study the framework of flavour deconstruction, where the Standard Model emerges from a non-universal gauge theory that contains a separate gauge factor for each fermion family. We argue that one of the most simple ways to achieve this is by assigning a separate gauge hypercharge to each fermion family, denoted as the "tri-hypercharge" theory. If the SM Higgs only carries third family hypercharge, then only the third family is massive at renormalisable level, and light families get their mass from higher dimensional operators. Finally, we propose a gauge unified origin for gauge non-universal frameworks such as the aforementioned tri-hypercharge theory. The model assigns a separate $SU(5)$ group to each fermion family. However, assuming that the three $SU(5)$ groups are related by a cyclic permutation symmetry $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$, then the model is described by a single gauge coupling in the ultraviolet, despite $SU(5)^{3}$ being a non-simple group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shear viscosity is a fundamental transport property of matter. Surprisingly, there is no simple analytical theory for the viscosity of relativistic fluids that is able to recover the viscosity of non-relativistic gases as one of its analytical limits. Here we derive a general theory of the viscosity of gases based on the relativistic Langevin equation (deduced from a relativistic Lagrangian) and nonaffine linear response theory. The proposed relativistic theory is able to recover the viscosity of non-relativistic classical gases, with all its key dependencies on mass, temperature, particle diameter and Boltzmann constant, in the limit of Lorentz factor $\gamma=1$. It also unveils the relativistic enhancement of viscosity, which is a fundamental relativistic effect that has been overlooked so far. In the limit of ultrarelativistic fluids, the theory reproduces the cubic increase of viscosity with temperature in agreement with previous estimates for the QGP-type fluid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations in the vacuum zero point energy associated to quantum fields and their statistical distributions during inflation. It is shown that the perturbations in the vacuum zero point energy have large amplitudes which are highly non-Gaussian. The effects of vacuum zero point fluctuations can be interpreted as the loop corrections in primordial power spectrum and bispectrum. Requiring that the primordial curvature perturbation to remain nearly scale-invariant and Gaussian imposes strong upper bounds on the mass of fundamental fields during inflation. We show that the fundamental fields can not be much heavier than the Hubble scale during inflation, otherwise their vacuum zero point fluctuations induce large non-Gaussianities and scale-dependence in primordial perturbations. Considering the observational upper bound on tensor to scalar ratio, we conclude that all fundamental fields are lighter than $10^{14}$ GeV.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM cosmology: Alleviating major cosmological tensions by predicting standard neutrino properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a two-parameter extension of the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model by allowing variations in the effective number of neutrino species $N_{\rm eff}$ and their total mass $\sum m_\nu$. Our motivation is twofold: (i) to examine whether $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM retains its success in fitting the data and addressing major cosmological tensions, without suggesting a need for a deviation from the standard model of particle physics, and (ii) to determine whether the data indicate new physics that could potentially address cosmological tensions, either in the post-recombination universe through the late-time mirror AdS-dS transition, or in the pre-recombination universe through modifications in the standard values of $N_{\rm eff}$ and $\sum m_\nu$, or both. Within the extended $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, referred to as $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM+$N_{\rm eff}$+$\sum m_{\rm \nu}$, we find no significant tension when considering the Planck-alone analysis. We observe that incorporating BAO data limits the further success of the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM extension. However, the weakly model-dependent BAOtr data, along with Planck and Planck+PP\&amp;SH0ES, favor $H_0\sim 73\,{\rm km\, s^{-1}\, Mpc^{-1}}$. In cases where BAOtr dataset is used, the mirror AdS-dS transition is very effective in providing enhanced $H_0$ values, and thus the model requires no significant deviation from the standard value of $N_{\rm eff} = 3.044$. Both the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions are effectively addressed, with some compromise in the case of the Planck+BAO dataset. Finally, the upper bounds obtained on $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.5$~eV are fully compatible with neutrino oscillation experiments. Our findings provide evidence that late-time physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM, such as $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM, without altering the standard pre-recombination universe, can suffice to alleviate the major cosmological tensions.</description>

Abstract: Some gauge theories with a spontaneously broken $U(1)$ symmetry exhibit fractional Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phases around vortices in the Higgs regime. We discuss continuity between confining and Higgs regimes in such gauge theories with fundamental matter fields, focusing on the AB phases. By explicit calculations in relevant lattice models, we demonstrate that the AB phase is smoothly connected between the confining and Higgs regimes, supporting the Higgs-confinement continuity. This result provides new insight into phase structures of gauge theories with superfluidity, such as dense QCD.</description>

Abstract: We consider the boundary dual of AdS3xS3xK3 for NS5-flux Q5=1, which is described by a sigma model with target space given by the d-fold symmetric product of K3. Building on results in algebraic geometry, we address the problem of deforming it away from the orbifold point from the viewpoint of topological strings. We propose how the 't Hooft expansion can be geometrized in terms of Gromov-Witten invariants and, in favorable settings, how it can be summed up to all orders in closed form. We consider an explicit example in detail for which we discuss the genus expansion around the orbifold point, as well as the divergence in the strong coupling regime. We find that within the domain of convergence, scale separation does not occur. However, in order for the mathematical framework to be applicable in the first place, we need to consider "reduced" Gromov-Witten invariants that fit, as we argue, naturally to topologically twisted N=4 strings. There are some caveats and thus to what extent this toy model captures the physics of strings on AdS3xS3xK3 remains to be seen.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the spectrum of field theories with non-integer $O(N)$ symmetry from quantum evanescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify constraints in the energy spectra of quantum theories that have a global $O(N)$ symmetry, where $N$ is treated as a continuous parameter. We point out that a class of evanescent states fall out of the spectrum at integer values of $N$ in pairs, via an annihilation mechanism. This forces the energies of the states in such a pair to approach equality as $N$ approaches a certain integer, with both states disappearing at precisely integer $N$ and the point of would-be degeneracy. These constraints occur between different irreducible representations of the analytic continuation of $O(N)$ and hold non-perturbatively. We give examples in the spectra of the critical $O(N)$ model.</description>

      <title>Gravity and $T\bar{T}$ flows in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16400v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study systems in arbitrary space-time dimensions where matter, deformed by $\mathrm{T}\bar{\mathrm{T}}$-like irrelevant operators, is coupled to gravity in the Palatini formalism. The dynamically equivalent perspective is investigated, wherein the deformation transitions from the matter action to the gravitational one or vice versa. This alternative viewpoint leads to the emergence of Ricci-based gravity theories, thus providing a high-dimensional generalisation of the well-known equivalence between two-dimensional $\mathrm{T}\bar{\mathrm{T}}$ deformations and coupling to Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. This dynamical equivalence is examined within the framework of the recently introduced Lagrangian flow equation, which notably led to the discovery of a direct link between Nambu-Goto theory and $\mathrm{T}\bar{\mathrm{T}}$ in $d=2$, as well as significant insights into nonlinear electrodynamics models in $d=4$. The investigation involves explicit examples in $d=4$ dimensions; it builds upon earlier research concerning the metric interpretation of $\mathrm{T}\bar{\mathrm{T}}$-like perturbations, incorporates and extends recent findings in the cosmology-related literature associated to the concept of reframing. We focus on scenarios where the resulting modified gravity theories manifest as Born-Infeld and Starobinsky types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct the wedge holography for the de-Sitter space as a bulk theory. First, we discuss a more general mathematical construction of wedge holography in parallel with wedge holography construction for the AdS bulk, and then we construct the wedge holography in the extended static patch. In the first case, we prove that one can construct wedge holography for the de-Sitter bulk for the static patch as well as global coordinate metric on end-of-the-world branes. Extended static patch wedge holography is constructed by joining the two copies of double holography in DS/dS correspondence. We find that wedge holography with extended static patch metric leads to the emergence of communicating universes. Further, we propose a model which provides the theoretical evidence of communicating multiverses.</description>

Abstract: We consider the $4d$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal quiver gauge theory obtained by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills (SYM). By exploiting supersymmetric localization, we study the integrated correlator of two Coulomb branch and two moment map operators and the integrated correlator of four moment map operators, determining exact expressions valid for any value of the 't Hooft coupling in the planar limit. Additionally, for the second correlator, we obtain an exact expression also for the next-to-planar contribution. Then, we derive the leading terms of their strong-coupling expansions and outline the differences with respect to the $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory.</description>

Abstract: We present the first analytical calculation that shows that perturbations with angular dependence can lead to an instability in gauged Q-balls. We find an explicit condition on the parameters for the Q-ball to become unstable.

      <description>arXiv:2406.04393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deformations of the heterotic superpotential give rise to a topological holomorphic theory with similarities to both Kodaira-Spencer gravity and holomorphic Chern-Simons theory. Although the action is cubic, it is only quadratic in the complex structure deformations (the Beltrami differential). Treated separately, for large fluxes, or alternatively at large distances in the background complex structure moduli space, these fields can be integrated out to obtain a new field theory in the remaining fields, which describe the complexified hermitian and gauge degrees of freedom. We investigate properties of this new holomorphic theory, and in particular connections to the swampland distance conjecture in the context of heterotic string theory. In the process, we define a new type of symplectic cohomology theory, where the background complex structure Beltrami differential plays the role of the symplectic form.</description>

      <title>A Scaling Relation, $Z_m$-type Deconfinement Phases and Imaginary Chemical Potentials in Finite Temperature Large-$N$ Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the effective potentials for the Polyakov loops in finite temperature SU$(N)$ gauge theories obey a certain scaling relation with respect to temperature in the large-$N$ limit. This scaling relation strongly constrains the possible terms in the Polyakov loop effective potentials. Moreover, by using the effective potentials in the presence of imaginary chemical potentials or imaginary angular velocities in several models, we find that phase transitions to $Z_m$-type deconfinement phases ($Z_m$ phase) occur, where the eigenvalues of the Polyakov loop are distributed $Z_m$ symmetrically. Physical quantities in the $Z_m$ phase obey the scaling properties of the effective potential. The models include Yang-Mills (YM) theories, the bosonic BFSS matrix model and ${\mathcal N}=4$ supersymmetric YM theory on $S^3$. Thus, the phase diagrams of large-$N$ gauge theories with imaginary chemical potentials are very rich and the stable $Z_m$ phase would be ubiquitous. Monte-Carlo calculations also support this. As a related topic, we discuss the phase diagrams of large-$N$ YM theories with real angular velocities in finite volume spaces.</description>

      <title>The Born regime of gravitational amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $2 \to 2$ scattering in the regime where the wavelength of the scattered objects is comparable to their distance but is much larger than any Compton wavelength in the quantum field theory. We observe that in this regime - which differs from the eikonal - the Feynman diagram expansion takes the form of a geometric series, akin to the Born series of quantum mechanics. Conversely, we can define the Feynman diagram expansion as the Born series of a relativistic effective-one-body (EOB) Schr\"odinger equation. For a gravitational theory in this regime we observe that the EOB Schr\"odinger equation reduces to the Regge-Wheeler or Teukolsky wave equations. We make use of this understanding to study the tree-level Compton scattering off a Kerr black hole. We compute the scalar and photon Compton amplitude up to $O(a^{30})$ in the black hole spin $a$ and propose an all-order expression. Remarkably, we find that boundary terms, which are typically neglected, give non-zero contact pieces necessary for restoring crossing symmetry and gauge invariance of the Kerr-Compton amplitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effective action formalism introduced by Vilkovisky and later modified by DeWitt is completely covariant suitable for obtaining an effective action that is independent of the parametrization of the quantum fields. Among a few basic properties of an effective action, one property is that it can be written as a sum of one-particle irreducible diagrams. In this work, we verify this property up to three-loop order for Vilkovisky-Dewitt effective action (VDEA) by solving the equations satisfied by VDEA written down in the original parametrization for non-gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Equivalence of Complexity Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.04485v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proves the polynomial equivalence of a broad class of definitions of quantum computational complexity. We study right-invariant metrics on the unitary group -- often called `complexity geometries' following the definition of quantum complexity proposed by Nielsen -- and delineate the equivalence class of metrics that have the same computational power as quantum circuits. Within this universality class, any unitary that can be reached in one metric can be approximated in any other metric in the class with a slowdown that is at-worst polynomial in the length and number of qubits and inverse-polynomial in the permitted error. We describe the equivalence classes for two different kinds of error we might tolerate: Killing-distance error, and operator-norm error. All metrics in both equivalence classes are shown to have exponential diameter; all metrics in the operator-norm equivalence class are also shown to give an alternative definition of the quantum complexity class BQP.
  My results extend those of Nielsen et al., who in 2006 proved that one particular metric is polynomially equivalent to quantum circuits. The Nielsen et al. metric is incredibly highly curved. I show that the greatly enlarged equivalence class established in this paper also includes metrics that have modest curvature. I argue that the modest curvature makes these metrics more amenable to the tools of differential geometry, and therefore makes them more promising starting points for Nielsen's program of using differential geometry to prove complexity lowerbounds.</description>

Abstract: We consider a type of k-inflation under the Hamilton-Jacobi approach. We calculate various observables such as the scalar power spectrum, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the scalar spectra index for the case where the Hubble parameter is a power-law function of k-field. The model's parameters are constrained with Planck data and the concrete form of the potential is presented. The results show that the model can be in good agreement with observations.</description>

      <title>Tri-unification: a separate $SU(5)$ for each fermion family</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05683v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss $SU(5)^{3}$ with cyclic symmetry as a possible grand unified theory (GUT). The basic idea of such a tri-unification is that there is a separate $SU(5)$ for each fermion family, with the light Higgs doublet(s) arising from the third family $SU(5)$, providing a basis for charged fermion mass hierarchies. $SU(5)^{3}$ tri-unification reconciles the idea of gauge non-universality with the idea of gauge coupling unification, opening the possibility to build consistent non-universal descriptions of Nature that are valid all the way up to the scale of grand unification. As a concrete example, we propose a grand unified embedding of the tri-hypercharge model $U(1)_Y^3$ based on an $SU(5)^{3}$ framework with cyclic symmetry. We discuss a minimal tri-hypercharge example which can account for all the quark and lepton (including neutrino) masses and mixing parameters. We show that it is possible to unify the many gauge couplings into a single gauge coupling associated with the cyclic $SU(5)^{3}$ gauge group, by assuming minimal multiplet splitting, together with a set of relatively light colour octet scalars. We also study proton decay in this example, and present the predictions for the proton lifetime in the dominant $e^+\pi^0$ channel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigated the thermodynamics of Schwarzschild-like bumblebee black hole using Iyer-Wald covariant phase space formalism. With a non zero vacuum expectation value, the bumblebee field is responsible for spontaneously breaking the Lorentz symmetry. As the bumblebee field is non-minimally coupled to gravity, we showed that the thermodynamic variables will be different from the counterpart in Einstein gravity. Especially, by using Iyer-Wald formalism, we found that the black hole entropy also differs from the result obtained from Wald entropy formula. Like Horndeski gravity, this mismatch is due to the divergence of bumblebee one-form field at the horizon. After figuring out the thermodynamics, we also briefly discussed the evaporation behavior of Schwarzschild like bumblebee black hole. We found that although bumblebee field has no influence on the critical impact factor, it can influence the black hole evaporation time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17357v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement measures of many-body states have been increasingly useful to characterize phases of matter. Here we explore a surprising connection between mixed state entanglement and 't Hooft anomaly. More specifically, we consider lattice systems in $d$ space dimensions with anomalous symmetry $G$ where the anomaly is characterized by an invariant in the group cohomology $H^{d+2}(G,U(1))$. We show that any mixed state $\rho$ that is strongly symmetric under $G$, in the sense that $G\rho\propto\rho$, is necessarily $(d+2)$-nonseparable, i.e. is not the mixture of tensor products of $d+2$ states in the Hilbert space. Furthermore, such states cannot be prepared from any $(d+2)$-separable states using finite-depth local quantum channels, so the nonseparability is long-ranged in nature. We provide proof of these results in $d\leq1$, and plausibility arguments in $d&gt;1$. The anomaly-nonseparability connection thus allows us to generate simple examples of mixed states with nontrivial long-ranged multipartite entanglement. In particular, in $d=1$ we found an example of intrinsically mixed quantum phase, in the sense that states in this phase cannot be two-way connected to any pure state through finite-depth local quantum channels. We also briefly discuss mixed anomaly involving both strong and weak symmetries, including systems constrained by the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type of anomaly.</description>

Abstract: The classical dynamics and the construction of quantum states in a plane wave curved spacetime are examined, paying particular attention to the similarities with the case of an electromagnetic plane wave in flat spacetime. A natural map connecting the dynamics of a particle in the Rosen metric and the motion of a charged particle in an electromagnetic plane wave is unveiled. We then discuss how this map can be translated into the quantum description by exploiting the large number of underlying symmetries. We examine the complete analogy between Volkov solutions and fermion states in the Rosen chart and properly extend this to massive vector bosons. We finally report the squared S-matrix element of Compton scattering in a sandwich plane wave spacetime in the form of a two-dimensional integral.</description>

      <title>Entanglement suppression and low-energy scattering of heavy mesons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently entanglement suppression was proposed to be one possible origin of emergent symmetries. Here we test this conjecture in the context of heavy meson scatterings. The low-energy interactions of $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ and $D^{(*)} D^{(*)}$ are closely related to the hadronic molecular candidates $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$, respectively, and can be described by a nonrelativistic effective Lagrangian manifesting heavy-quark spin symmetry, which includes only constant contact potentials at leading order. We explore entanglement suppression in a tensor-product framework to treat both the isospin and spin degrees of freedom. Using the $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ as inputs, we find that entanglement suppression indeed leads to an emergent symmetry, namely, a light-quark spin symmetry, and as such the $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ or $D^{(*)} D^{(*)}$ interaction strengths for a given total isospin do not depend on the total angular momentum of light (anti)quarks. The $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ are predicted to have five and one isoscalar partner, respectively, while the corresponding partner numbers derived solely from heavy-quark spin symmetry are three and one, respectively. The predictions need to be confronted with experimental data and lattice quantum chromodynamics results to further test the entanglement suppression conjecture.</description>

      <title>Realizing triality and $p$-ality by lattice twisted gauging in (1+1)d quantum spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the twisted gauging on the (1+1)d lattice and construct various non-local mappings on the lattice operators. To be specific, we define the twisted Gauss law operator and implement the twisted gauging of the finite group on the lattice motivated by the orbifolding procedure in the conformal field theory, which involves the data of non-trivial element in the second cohomology group of the gauge group. We show the twisted gauging is equivalent to the two-step procedure of first applying the SPT entangler and then untwisted gauging. We use the twisted gauging to construct the triality (order 3) and $p$-ality (order $p$) mapping on the $\mathbb{Z}_p\times \mathbb{Z}_p$ symmetric Hamiltonians, where $p$ is a prime. Such novel non-local mappings generalize Kramers-Wannier duality and they preserve the locality of symmetric operators but map charged operators to non-local ones. We further construct quantum process to realize these non-local mappings and analyze the induced mappings on the phase diagrams. For theories that are invariant under these non-local mappings, they admit the corresponding non-invertible symmetries. The non-invertible symmetry will constrain the theory at the multicritical point between the gapped phases. We further give the condition when the non-invertible symmetry can have symmetric gapped phase with a unique ground state.</description>

      <title>Black hole scattering near the transition to plunge: Self-force and resummation of post-Minkowskian theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geodesic scattering of a test particle off a Schwarzschild black hole can be parameterized by the speed-at-infinity $v$ and the impact parameter $b$, with a "separatrix", $b=b_c(v)$, marking the threshold between scattering and plunge. Near the separatrix, the scattering angle diverges as $\sim\log(b-b_c)$. The self-force correction to the scattering angle (at fixed $v,b$) diverges even faster, like $\sim A_1(v)b_c/(b-b_c)$. Here we numerically calculate the divergence coefficient $A_1(v)$ in a scalar-charge toy model. We then use our knowledge of $A_1(v)$ to inform a resummation of the post-Minkowskian expansion for the scattering angle, and demonstrate that the resummed series agrees remarkably well with numerical self-force results even in the strong-field regime. We propose that a similar resummation technique, applied to a mass particle subject to a gravitational self-force, can significantly enhance the utility and regime of validity of post-Minkowskian calculations for black-hole scattering.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter and General Relativistic Instability in Supermassive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the extent to which collisionless dark matter impacts the stability of supermassive stars $(M\gtrsim10^4\,M_\odot)$. We find that, depending on the star's mass, a dark matter content in excess of ${\sim}1\%$ by mass throughout the entire star can raise the critical central density for the onset general relativistic instability, in some cases by orders of magnitude. We consider implications of this effect for the onset of nuclear burning and significant neutrino energy losses.</description>
