      <title>The Parameterized Complexity of Terminal Monitoring Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Terminal Monitoring Set (TMS), the input is an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, together with a collection $T$ of terminal pairs and the goal is to find a subset $S$ of minimum size that hits a shortest path between every pair of terminals. We show that this problem is W[2]-hard with respect to solution size. On the positive side, we show that TMS is fixed parameter tractable with respect to solution size plus distance to cluster, solution size plus neighborhood diversity, and feedback edge number. For the weighted version of the problem, we obtain a FPT algorithm with respect to vertex cover number, and for a relaxed version of the problem, we show that it is W[1]-hard with respect to solution size plus feedback vertex number.</description>

      <title>Phenotype control and elimination of variables in Boolean networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how elimination of variables can affect the asymptotic dynamics and phenotype control of Boolean networks. In particular, we look at the impact on minimal trap spaces, and identify a structural condition that guarantees their preservation. We examine the possible effects of variable elimination under three of the most popular approaches to control (attractor-based control, value propagation and control of minimal trap spaces), and under different update schemes (synchronous, asynchronous, generalized asynchronous). We provide some insights on the application of reduction, and an ample inventory of examples and counterexamples.</description>

      <title>Representing Piecewise-Linear Functions by Functions with Minimal Arity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any continuous piecewise-linear function $F\colon \mathbb{R}^{n}\to \mathbb{R}$ can be represented as a linear combination of $\max$ functions of at most $n+1$ affine-linear functions. In our previous paper [``Representing piecewise linear functions by functions with small arity'', AAECC, 2023], we showed that this upper bound of $n+1$ arguments is tight. In the present paper, we extend this result by establishing a correspondence between the function $F$ and the minimal number of arguments that are needed in any such decomposition. We show that the tessellation of the input space $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ induced by the function $F$ has a direct connection to the number of arguments in the $\max$ functions.</description>

      <title>A Diffusion Model Framework for Unsupervised Neural Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning to sample from intractable distributions over discrete sets without relying on corresponding training data is a central problem in a wide range of fields, including Combinatorial Optimization. Currently, popular deep learning-based approaches rely primarily on generative models that yield exact sample likelihoods. This work introduces a method that lifts this restriction and opens the possibility to employ highly expressive latent variable models like diffusion models. Our approach is conceptually based on a loss that upper bounds the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and evades the requirement of exact sample likelihoods. We experimentally validate our approach in data-free Combinatorial Optimization and demonstrate that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art on a wide range of benchmark problems.</description>

      <title>Random Abstract Cell Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a model for random (abstract) cell complexes (CCs), similiar to the well-known Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model for graphs and its extensions for simplicial complexes. To build a random cell complex, we first draw from an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph, and consecutively augment the graph with cells for each dimension with a specified probability. As the number of possible cells increases combinatorially -- e.g., 2-cells can be represented as cycles, or permutations -- we derive an approximate sampling algorithm for this model limited to two-dimensional abstract cell complexes. Since there is a large variance in the number of simple cycles on graphs drawn from the same configuration of ER, we also provide an efficient method to approximate that number, which is of independent interest. Moreover, it enables us to specify the expected number of 2-cells of each boundary length we want to sample. We provide some initial analysis into the properties of random CCs drawn from this model. We further showcase practical applications for our random CCs as null models, and in the context of (random) liftings of graphs to cell complexes. Both the sampling and cycle count estimation algorithms are available in the package `py-raccoon` on the Python Packaging Index.</description>

      <title>Trees and co-trees in planar 3-connected graphs An easier proof via Schnyder woods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a 3-connected planar graph. Define the co-tree of a spanning tree $T$ of $G$ as the graph induced by the dual edges of $E(G)-E(T)$. The well-known cut-cycle duality implies that the co-tree is itself a tree. Let a $k$-tree be a spanning tree with maximum degree $k$. In 1970, Gr\"unbaum conjectured that every 3-connected planar graph contains a 3-tree whose co-tree is also a 3-tree. In 2014, Biedl showed that every such graph contains a 5-tree whose co-tree is a 5-tree. In this paper, we present an easier proof of Biedl's result</description>

      <title>Prophet Inequalities: Separating Random Order from Order Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04024v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prophet inequalities are a central object of study in optimal stopping theory. A gambler is sent values in an online fashion, sampled from an instance of independent distributions, in an adversarial, random or selected order, depending on the model. When observing each value, the gambler either accepts it as a reward or irrevocably rejects it and proceeds to observe the next value. The goal of the gambler, who cannot see the future, is maximising the expected value of the reward while competing against the expectation of a prophet (the offline maximum). In other words, one seeks to maximise the gambler-to-prophet ratio of the expectations.
  The model, in which the gambler selects the arrival order first, and then observes the values, is known as Order Selection. In this model a ratio of $0.7251$ has been proved to be attainable for any instance. In very recent work, this has been improved up to $0.7258$. If the gambler chooses the arrival order (uniformly) at random, we obtain the Random Order model. The worst case ratio over all possible instances has been extensively studied for at least $40$ years. In the recent work aforementioned, through simulations, this ratio has been shown to be at most $0.7254$ for the Random Order model, thus establishing for the first time that carefully choosing the order, instead of simply taking it at random, benefits the gambler. We give an alternative, non-simulation-assisted proof of this fact, by showing mathematically that in the Random Order model, no algorithm can achieve a ratio larger than $0.7235$. This sets a new state-of-the-art hardness for this model, and establishes more formally that there is a real benefit in choosing the order.</description>

      <title>Twin-width of subdivisions of multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For each $d\leq3$, we construct a finite set $F_d$ of multigraphs such that for each graph $H$ of girth at least $5$ obtained from a multigraph $G$ by subdividing each edge at least two times, $H$ has twin-width at most $d$ if and only if $G$ has no minor in $F_d$. This answers a question of Berg\'{e}, Bonnet, and D\'{e}pr\'{e}s asking for the structure of graphs $G$ such that each long subdivision of $G$ has twin-width $4$. As a corollary, we show that the $7\times7$ grid has twin-width $4$, which answers a question of Schidler and Szeider.</description>
