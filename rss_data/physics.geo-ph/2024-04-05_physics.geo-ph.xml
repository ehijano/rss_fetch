      <title>Magnetic signals from oceanic tides: new satellite observations and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal flow of seawater across the Earth's magnetic field induces electric currents and magnetic fields within the ocean and solid Earth. The amplitude and phase of the induced fields depends on electrical properties of both the seawater and the solid Earth, thus can be used as a proxy to study seabed properties or potentially for monitoring long-term trends in the global ocean climatology. This paper presents new global oceanic tidal magnetic field models and their uncertainties for four tidal constituents, including $M_2, N_2, O_1$ and for the first time $Q_1$. Models are obtained through a robust least-squares analysis of magnetic field observations from the Swarm and CHAMP satellites using a specially designed data selection scheme. We compare the retrieved magnetic signals with several alternative models reported in the literature. Additionally, we validate them using a series of high-resolution global 3-D electromagnetic simulations and place constraints on the conductivity of sub-oceanic mantle for all tidal constituents, revealing an excellent agreement between all tidal constituents and the oceanic upper mantle structure.</description>

      <title>Seismic and acoustic signals from the 2014 'Interstellar Meteor'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03966v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct a thorough analysis of seismic and acoustic data from the so-called `Interstellar Meteor' which entered the Earth's atmosphere off the coast of Papua New Guinea on 2014-01-08. We conclude that both previously-reported seismic signals are spurious -- one has characteristics suggesting a local vehicular-traffic based origin; whilst the other is statistically indistinguishable from the background noise. As such, previously-reported localisations based on this data are spurious. Analysis of acoustic data provides a best fit location estimate which is very far ($\sim$170~km) from the reported fireball location. Accordingly, we conclude that material recovered from the seafloor and purported to be from the meteor is almost certainly unrelated to it, and is likely of more mundane (non-interstellar) origin.</description>
