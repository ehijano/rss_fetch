      <title>Do Sharpness-based Optimizers Improve Generalization in Medical Image Analysis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective clinical deployment of deep learning models in healthcare demands high generalization performance to ensure accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. In recent years, significant research has focused on improving the generalization of deep learning models by regularizing the sharpness of the loss landscape. Among the optimization approaches that explicitly minimize sharpness, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has shown potential in enhancing generalization performance on general domain image datasets. This success has led to the development of several advanced sharpness-based algorithms aimed at addressing the limitations of SAM, such as Adaptive SAM, surrogate-Gap SAM, Weighted SAM, and Curvature Regularized SAM. These sharpness-based optimizers have shown improvements in model generalization compared to conventional stochastic gradient descent optimizers and their variants on general domain image datasets, but they have not been thoroughly evaluated on medical images. This work provides a review of recent sharpness-based methods for improving the generalization of deep learning networks and evaluates the methods performance on medical breast ultrasound images. Our findings indicate that the initial SAM method successfully enhances the generalization of various deep learning models. While Adaptive SAM improves generalization of convolutional neural networks, it fails to do so for vision transformers. Other sharpness-based optimizers, however, do not demonstrate consistent results. The results reveal that, contrary to findings in the non-medical domain, SAM is the only recommended sharpness-based optimizer that consistently improves generalization in medical image analysis, and further research is necessary to refine the variants of SAM to enhance generalization performance in this field</description>

      <title>The Quest for Early Detection of Retinal Disease: 3D CycleGAN-based Translation of Optical Coherence Tomography into Confocal Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and confocal microscopy are pivotal in retinal imaging, offering distinct advantages and limitations. In vivo OCT offers rapid, non-invasive imaging but can suffer from clarity issues and motion artifacts, while ex vivo confocal microscopy, providing high-resolution, cellular-detailed color images, is invasive and raises ethical concerns. To bridge the benefits of both modalities, we propose a novel framework based on unsupervised 3D CycleGAN for translating unpaired in vivo OCT to ex vivo confocal microscopy images. This marks the first attempt to exploit the inherent 3D information of OCT and translate it into the rich, detailed color domain of confocal microscopy. We also introduce a unique dataset, OCT2Confocal, comprising mouse OCT and confocal retinal images, facilitating the development of and establishing a benchmark for cross-modal image translation research. Our model has been evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores of 0.766 and Kernel Inception Distance (KID) scores as low as 0.153, and leading subjective Mean Opinion Scores (MOS). Our model demonstrated superior image fidelity and quality with limited data over existing methods. Our approach effectively synthesizes color information from 3D confocal images, closely approximating target outcomes and suggesting enhanced potential for diagnostic and monitoring applications in ophthalmology.</description>

      <title>Performance and Non-adversarial Robustness of the Segment Anything Model 2 in Surgical Video Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully supervised deep learning (DL) models for surgical video segmentation have been shown to struggle with non-adversarial, real-world corruptions of image quality including smoke, bleeding, and low illumination. Foundation models for image segmentation, such as the segment anything model (SAM) that focuses on interactive prompt-based segmentation, move away from semantic classes and thus can be trained on larger and more diverse data, which offers outstanding zero-shot generalization with appropriate user prompts. Recently, building upon this success, SAM-2 has been proposed to further extend the zero-shot interactive segmentation capabilities from independent frame-by-frame to video segmentation. In this paper, we present a first experimental study evaluating SAM-2's performance on surgical video data. Leveraging the SegSTRONG-C MICCAI EndoVIS 2024 sub-challenge dataset, we assess SAM-2's effectiveness on uncorrupted endoscopic sequences and evaluate its non-adversarial robustness on videos with corrupted image quality simulating smoke, bleeding, and low brightness conditions under various prompt strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that SAM-2, in zero-shot manner, can achieve competitive or even superior performance compared to fully-supervised deep learning models on surgical video data, including under non-adversarial corruptions of image quality. Additionally, SAM-2 consistently outperforms the original SAM and its medical variants across all conditions. Finally, frame-sparse prompting can consistently outperform frame-wise prompting for SAM-2, suggesting that allowing SAM-2 to leverage its temporal modeling capabilities leads to more coherent and accurate segmentation compared to frequent prompting.</description>

      <title>Efficient Single Image Super-Resolution with Entropy Attention and Receptive Field Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based deep models for single image super-resolution (SISR) have greatly improved the performance of lightweight SISR tasks in recent years. However, they often suffer from heavy computational burden and slow inference due to the complex calculation of multi-head self-attention (MSA), seriously hindering their practical application and deployment. In this work, we present an efficient SR model to mitigate the dilemma between model efficiency and SR performance, which is dubbed Entropy Attention and Receptive Field Augmentation network (EARFA), and composed of a novel entropy attention (EA) and a shifting large kernel attention (SLKA). From the perspective of information theory, EA increases the entropy of intermediate features conditioned on a Gaussian distribution, providing more informative input for subsequent reasoning. On the other hand, SLKA extends the receptive field of SR models with the assistance of channel shifting, which also favors to boost the diversity of hierarchical features. Since the implementation of EA and SLKA does not involve complex computations (such as extensive matrix multiplications), the proposed method can achieve faster nonlinear inference than Transformer-based SR models while maintaining better SR performance. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model can significantly reduce the delay of model inference while achieving the SR performance comparable with other advanced models.</description>

      <title>Is SAM 2 Better than SAM in Medical Image Segmentation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) demonstrated impressive performance in zero-shot promptable segmentation on natural images. The recently released Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) model claims to have better performance than SAM on images while extending the model's capabilities to video segmentation. It is important to evaluate the recent model's ability in medical image segmentation in a zero-shot promptable manner. In this work, we performed extensive studies with multiple datasets from different imaging modalities to compare the performance between SAM and SAM 2. We used two point prompt strategies: (i) single positive prompt near the centroid of the target structure and (ii) additional positive prompts placed randomly within the target structure. The evaluation included 21 unique organ-modality combinations including abdominal structures, cardiac structures, and fetal head images acquired from publicly available MRI, CT, and Ultrasound datasets. The preliminary results, based on 2D images, indicate that while SAM 2 may perform slightly better in a few cases, but it does not in general surpass SAM for medical image segmentation. Especially when the contrast is lower like in CT, Ultrasound images, SAM 2 performs poorly than SAM. For MRI images, SAM 2 performs at par or better than SAM. Similar to SAM, SAM 2 also suffers from over-segmentation issue especially when the boundaries of the to-be-segmented organ is fuzzy in nature.</description>

      <title>Physical prior guided cooperative learning framework for joint turbulence degradation estimation and infrared video restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared imaging and turbulence strength measurements are in widespread demand in many fields. This paper introduces a Physical Prior Guided Cooperative Learning (P2GCL) framework to jointly enhance atmospheric turbulence strength estimation and infrared image restoration. P2GCL involves a cyclic collaboration between two models, i.e., a TMNet measures turbulence strength and outputs the refractive index structure constant (Cn2) as a physical prior, a TRNet conducts infrared image sequence restoration based on Cn2 and feeds the restored images back to the TMNet to boost the measurement accuracy. A novel Cn2-guided frequency loss function and a physical constraint loss are introduced to align the training process with physical theories. Experiments demonstrate P2GCL achieves the best performance for both turbulence strength estimation (improving Cn2 MAE by 0.0156, enhancing R2 by 0.1065) and image restoration (enhancing PSNR by 0.2775 dB), validating the significant impact of physical prior guided cooperative learning.</description>

      <title>SG-JND: Semantic-Guided Just Noticeable Distortion Predictor For Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Just noticeable distortion (JND), representing the threshold of distortion in an image that is minimally perceptible to the human visual system (HVS), is crucial for image compression algorithms to achieve a trade-off between transmission bit rate and image quality. However, traditional JND prediction methods only rely on pixel-level or sub-band level features, lacking the ability to capture the impact of image content on JND. To bridge this gap, we propose a Semantic-Guided JND (SG-JND) network to leverage semantic information for JND prediction. In particular, SG-JND consists of three essential modules: the image preprocessing module extracts semantic-level patches from images, the feature extraction module extracts multi-layer features by utilizing the cross-scale attention layers, and the JND prediction module regresses the extracted features into the final JND value. Experimental results show that SG-JND achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two publicly available JND datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness of SG-JND and highlight the significance of incorporating semantic information in JND assessment.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Accurate Pneumonia Detection Using a Novel Multi-Scale Transformer Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pneumonia, a severe respiratory disease, poses significant diagnostic challenges, especially in underdeveloped regions. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as chest X-rays, suffer from variability in interpretation among radiologists, necessitating reliable automated tools. In this study, we propose a novel approach combining deep learning and transformer-based attention mechanisms to enhance pneumonia detection from chest X-rays. Our method begins with lung segmentation using a TransUNet model that integrates our specialized transformer module, which has fewer parameters compared to common transformers while maintaining performance. This model is trained on the "Chest Xray Masks and Labels" dataset and then applied to the Kermany and Cohen datasets to isolate lung regions, enhancing subsequent classification tasks. For classification, we employ pre-trained ResNet models (ResNet-50 and ResNet-101) to extract multi-scale feature maps, processed through our modified transformer module. By employing our specialized transformer, we attain superior results with significantly fewer parameters compared to common transformer models. Our approach achieves high accuracy rates of 92.79% on the Kermany dataset and 95.11% on the Cohen dataset, ensuring robust and efficient performance suitable for resource-constrained environments.

      <title>An Explainable Non-local Network for COVID-19 Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CNN has achieved excellent results in the automatic classification of medical images. In this study, we propose a novel deep residual 3D attention non-local network (NL-RAN) to classify CT images included COVID-19, common pneumonia, and normal to perform rapid and explainable COVID-19 diagnosis. We built a deep residual 3D attention non-local network that could achieve end-to-end training. The network is embedded with a nonlocal module to capture global information, while a 3D attention module is embedded to focus on the details of the lesion so that it can directly analyze the 3D lung CT and output the classification results. The output of the attention module can be used as a heat map to increase the interpretability of the model. 4079 3D CT scans were included in this study. Each scan had a unique label (novel coronavirus pneumonia, common pneumonia, and normal). The CT scans cohort was randomly split into a training set of 3263 scans, a validation set of 408 scans, and a testing set of 408 scans. And compare with existing mainstream classification methods, such as CovNet, CBAM, ResNet, etc. Simultaneously compare the visualization results with visualization methods such as CAM. Model performance was evaluated using the Area Under the ROC Curve(AUC), precision, and F1-score. The NL-RAN achieved the AUC of 0.9903, the precision of 0.9473, and the F1-score of 0.9462, surpass all the classification methods compared. The heat map output by the attention module is also clearer than the heat map output by CAM. Our experimental results indicate that our proposed method performs significantly better than existing methods. In addition, the first attention module outputs a heat map containing detailed outline information to increase the interpretability of the model. Our experiments indicate that the inference of our model is fast. It can provide real-time assistance with diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Deep Transfer Learning for Kidney Cancer Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many incurable diseases prevalent across global societies stem from various influences, including lifestyle choices, economic conditions, social factors, and genetics. Research predominantly focuses on these diseases due to their widespread nature, aiming to decrease mortality, enhance treatment options, and improve healthcare standards. Among these, kidney disease stands out as a particularly severe condition affecting men and women worldwide. Nonetheless, there is a pressing need for continued research into innovative, early diagnostic methods to develop more effective treatments for such diseases. Recently, automatic diagnosis of Kidney Cancer has become an important challenge especially when using deep learning (DL) due to the importance of training medical datasets, which in most cases are difficult and expensive to obtain. Furthermore, in most cases, algorithms require data from the same domain and a powerful computer with efficient storage capacity. To overcome this issue, a new type of learning known as transfer learning (TL) has been proposed that can produce impressive results based on other different pre-trained data. This paper presents, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first comprehensive survey of DL-based TL frameworks for kidney cancer diagnosis. This is a strong contribution to help researchers understand the current challenges and perspectives of this topic. Hence, the main limitations and advantages of each framework are identified and detailed critical analyses are provided. Looking ahead, the article identifies promising directions for future research. Moving on, the discussion is concluded by reflecting on the pivotal role of TL in the development of precision medicine and its effects on clinical practice and research in oncology.</description>

      <title>Synchronous Multi-modal Semantic CommunicationSystem with Packet-level Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the semantic communication with joint semantic-channel coding design has shown promising performance in transmitting data of different modalities over physical layer channels, the synchronization and packet-level forward error correction of multimodal semantics have not been well studied. Due to the independent design of semantic encoders, synchronizing multimodal features in both the semantic and time domains is a challenging problem. In this paper, we take the facial video and speech transmission as an example and propose a Synchronous Multimodal Semantic Communication System (SyncSC) with Packet-Level Coding. To achieve semantic and time synchronization, 3D Morphable Mode (3DMM) coefficients and text are transmitted as semantics, and we propose a semantic codec that achieves similar quality of reconstruction and synchronization with lower bandwidth, compared to traditional methods. To protect semantic packets under the erasure channel, we propose a packet-Level Forward Error Correction (FEC) method, called PacSC, that maintains a certain visual quality performance even at high packet loss rates. Particularly, for text packets, a text packet loss concealment module, called TextPC, based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is proposed, which significantly improves the performance of traditional FEC methods. The simulation results show that our proposed SyncSC reduce transmission overhead and achieve high-quality synchronous transmission of video and speech over the packet loss network.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Impact of Population Shift Across Age and Sex for Abdominal Organ Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based medical image segmentation has seen tremendous progress over the last decade, but there is still relatively little transfer into clinical practice. One of the main barriers is the challenge of domain generalisation, which requires segmentation models to maintain high performance across a wide distribution of image data. This challenge is amplified by the many factors that contribute to the diverse appearance of medical images, such as acquisition conditions and patient characteristics. The impact of shifting patient characteristics such as age and sex on segmentation performance remains relatively under-studied, especially for abdominal organs, despite that this is crucial for ensuring the fairness of the segmentation model. We perform the first study to determine the impact of population shift with respect to age and sex on abdominal CT image segmentation, by leveraging two large public datasets, and introduce a novel metric to quantify the impact. We find that population shift is a challenge similar in magnitude to cross-dataset shift for abdominal organ segmentation, and that the effect is asymmetric and dataset-dependent. We conclude that dataset diversity in terms of known patient characteristics is not necessarily equivalent to dataset diversity in terms of image features. This implies that simple population matching to ensure good generalisation and fairness may be insufficient, and we recommend that fairness research should be directed towards better understanding and quantifying medical image dataset diversity in terms of performance-relevant characteristics such as organ morphology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Path loss prediction for wireless communications is highly dependent on the local environment. Propagation models including clutter information have been shown to significantly increase model accuracy. This paper explores the application of deep learning to satellite imagery to identify environmental clutter types automatically. Recognizing these clutter types has numerous uses, but our main application is to use clutter information to enhance propagation prediction models. Knowing the type of obstruction (tree, building, and further classifications) can improve the prediction accuracy of key propagation metrics such as path loss.</description>

      <title>SAM 2 in Robotic Surgery: An Empirical Evaluation for Robustness and Generalization in Surgical Video Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) 2 has demonstrated remarkable foundational competence in semantic segmentation, with its memory mechanism and mask decoder further addressing challenges in video tracking and object occlusion, thereby achieving superior results in interactive segmentation for both images and videos. Building upon our previous empirical studies, we further explore the zero-shot segmentation performance of SAM 2 in robot-assisted surgery based on prompts, alongside its robustness against real-world corruption. For static images, we employ two forms of prompts: 1-point and bounding box, while for video sequences, the 1-point prompt is applied to the initial frame. Through extensive experimentation on the MICCAI EndoVis 2017 and EndoVis 2018 benchmarks, SAM 2, when utilizing bounding box prompts, outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in comparative evaluations. The results with point prompts also exhibit a substantial enhancement over SAM's capabilities, nearing or even surpassing existing unprompted SOTA methodologies. Besides, SAM 2 demonstrates improved inference speed and less performance degradation against various image corruption. Although slightly unsatisfactory results remain in specific edges or regions, SAM 2's robust adaptability to 1-point prompts underscores its potential for downstream surgical tasks with limited prompt requirements.</description>

      <title>Improving Automated Hemorrhage Detection in Sparse-view Computed Tomography via Deep Convolutional Neural Network based Artifact Reduction</title>

Abstract: This is a preprint. The latest version has been published here: https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/ryai.230275
  Purpose: Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) is an effective way to reduce dose by lowering the total number of views acquired, albeit at the expense of image quality, which, in turn, can impact the ability to detect diseases. We explore deep learning-based artifact reduction in sparse-view cranial CT scans and its impact on automated hemorrhage detection. Methods: We trained a U-Net for artefact reduction on simulated sparse-view cranial CT scans from 3000 patients obtained from a public dataset and reconstructed with varying levels of sub-sampling. Additionally, we trained a convolutional neural network on fully sampled CT data from 17,545 patients for automated hemorrhage detection. We evaluated the classification performance using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curves (AUC-ROCs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and the DeLong test, along with confusion matrices. The performance of the U-Net was compared to an analytical approach based on total variation (TV). Results: The U-Net performed superior compared to unprocessed and TV-processed images with respect to image quality and automated hemorrhage diagnosis. With U-Net post-processing, the number of views can be reduced from 4096 (AUC-ROC: 0.974; 95% CI: 0.972-0.976) views to 512 views (0.973; 0.971-0.975) with minimal decrease in hemorrhage detection (P&lt;.001) and to 256 views (0.967; 0.964-0.969) with a slight performance decrease (P&lt;.001). Conclusion: The results suggest that U-Net based artifact reduction substantially enhances automated hemorrhage detection in sparse-view cranial CTs. Our findings highlight that appropriate post-processing is crucial for optimal image quality and diagnostic accuracy while minimizing radiation dose.</description>

Abstract: The online shopping behavior has the characteristics of rich granularity dimension and data sparsity and previous researches on user behavior prediction did not seriously discuss feature selection and ensemble design. In this paper, we proposed a SE-Stacking model based on information fusion and ensemble learning for user purchase behavior prediction. After successfully utilizing the ensemble feature selection method to screen purchase-related factors, we used the Stacking algorithm for user purchase behavior prediction. In our efforts to avoid the deviation of prediction results, we optimized the model by selecting ten different kinds of models as base learners and modifying relevant parameters specifically for them. The experiments conducted on a publicly-available dataset shows that the SE-Stacking model can achieve a 98.40% F1-score, about 0.09% higher than the optimal base models. The SE-Stacking model not only has a good application in the prediction of user purchase behavior but also has practical value combining with the actual e-commerce scene. At the same time, it has important significance for academic research and the development of this field.</description>

Abstract: Chest X-ray is one of the most common radiological examination types for the diagnosis of chest diseases. Nowadays, the automatic classification technology of radiological images has been widely used in clinical diagnosis and treatment plans. However, each disease has its own different response characteristic receptive field region, which is the main challenge for chest disease classification tasks. Besides, the imbalance of sample data categories further increases the difficulty of tasks. To solve these problems, we propose a new multi-label chest disease image classification scheme based on a multi-scale attention network. In this scheme, multi-scale information is iteratively fused to focus on regions with a high probability of disease, to effectively mine more meaningful information from data, and the classification performance can be improved only by image level annotation. We also designed a new loss function to improve the rationality of visual perception and the performance of multi-label image classification by forcing the consistency of attention regions before and after image transformation. A comprehensive experiment was carried out on the public Chest X-Ray14 and CheXpert datasets to achieve state of the art results, which verified the effectiveness of this method in chest X-ray image classification.</description>

      <title>Harmonized Spatial and Spectral Learning for Robust and Generalized Medical Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning has demonstrated remarkable achievements in medical image segmentation. However, prevailing deep learning models struggle with poor generalization due to (i) intra-class variations, where the same class appears differently in different samples, and (ii) inter-class independence, resulting in difficulties capturing intricate relationships between distinct objects, leading to higher false negative cases. This paper presents a novel approach that synergies spatial and spectral representations to enhance domain-generalized medical image segmentation. We introduce the innovative Spectral Correlation Coefficient objective to improve the model's capacity to capture middle-order features and contextual long-range dependencies. This objective complements traditional spatial objectives by incorporating valuable spectral information. Extensive experiments reveal that optimizing this objective with existing architectures like UNet and TransUNet significantly enhances generalization, interpretability, and noise robustness, producing more confident predictions. For instance, in cardiac segmentation, we observe a 0.81 pp and 1.63 pp (pp = percentage point) improvement in DSC over UNet and TransUNet, respectively. Our interpretability study demonstrates that, in most tasks, objectives optimized with UNet outperform even TransUNet by introducing global contextual information alongside local details. These findings underscore the versatility and effectiveness of our proposed method across diverse imaging modalities and medical domains.</description>

      <title>RRWNet: Recursive Refinement Network for Effective Retinal Artery/Vein Segmentation and Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03166v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The caliber and configuration of retinal blood vessels serve as important biomarkers for various diseases and medical conditions. A thorough analysis of the retinal vasculature requires the segmentation of the blood vessels and their classification into arteries and veins, typically performed on color fundus images obtained by retinography. However, manually performing these tasks is labor-intensive and prone to human error. While several automated methods have been proposed to address this task, the current state of art faces challenges due to manifest classification errors affecting the topological consistency of segmentation maps. In this work, we introduce RRWNet, a novel end-to-end deep learning framework that addresses this limitation. The framework consists of a fully convolutional neural network that recursively refines semantic segmentation maps, correcting manifest classification errors and thus improving topological consistency. In particular, RRWNet is composed of two specialized subnetworks: a Base subnetwork that generates base segmentation maps from the input images, and a Recursive Refinement subnetwork that iteratively and recursively improves these maps. Evaluation on three different public datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method, yielding more topologically consistent segmentation maps with fewer manifest classification errors than existing approaches. In addition, the Recursive Refinement module within RRWNet proves effective in post-processing segmentation maps from other methods, further demonstrating its potential. The model code, weights, and predictions will be publicly available at https://github.com/j-morano/rrwnet.</description>

      <title>Adapting SAM for Surgical Instrument Tracking and Segmentation in Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precise tracking and segmentation of surgical instruments have led to a remarkable enhancement in the efficiency of surgical procedures. However, the challenge lies in achieving accurate segmentation of surgical instruments while minimizing the need for manual annotation and reducing the time required for the segmentation process. To tackle this, we propose a novel framework for surgical instrument segmentation and tracking. Specifically, with a tiny subset of frames for segmentation, we ensure accurate segmentation across the entire surgical video. Our method adopts a two-stage approach to efficiently segment videos. Initially, we utilize the Segment-Anything (SAM) model, which has been fine-tuned using the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on the EndoVis17 Dataset. The fine-tuned SAM model is applied to segment the initial frames of the video accurately. Subsequently, we deploy the XMem++ tracking algorithm to follow the annotated frames, thereby facilitating the segmentation of the entire video sequence. This workflow enables us to precisely segment and track objects within the video. Through extensive evaluation of the in-distribution dataset (EndoVis17) and the out-of-distribution datasets (EndoVis18 &amp; the endoscopic submucosal dissection surgery (ESD) dataset), our framework demonstrates exceptional accuracy and robustness, thus showcasing its potential to advance the automated robotic-assisted surgery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce SAM3D, a new approach to semi-automatic zero-shot segmentation of 3D images building on the existing Segment Anything Model. We achieve fast and accurate segmentations in 3D images with a four-step strategy involving: user prompting with 3D polylines, volume slicing along multiple axes, slice-wide inference with a pretrained model, and recomposition and refinement in 3D. We evaluated SAM3D performance qualitatively on an array of imaging modalities and anatomical structures and quantify performance for specific structures in abdominal pelvic CT and brain MRI. Notably, our method achieves good performance with zero model training or finetuning, making it particularly useful for tasks with a scarcity of preexisting labeled data. By enabling users to create 3D segmentations of unseen data quickly and with dramatically reduced manual input, these methods have the potential to aid surgical planning and education, diagnostic imaging, and scientific research.</description>

      <title>ESP-MedSAM: Efficient Self-Prompting SAM for Universal Domain-Generalized Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14153v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The universality of deep neural networks across different modalities and their generalization capabilities to unseen domains play an essential role in medical image segmentation. The recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated its potential in both settings. However, the huge computational costs, demand for manual annotations as prompts and conflict-prone decoding process of SAM degrade its generalizability and applicability in clinical scenarios. To address these issues, we propose an efficient self-prompting SAM for universal domain-generalized medical image segmentation, named ESP-MedSAM. Specifically, we first devise the Multi-Modal Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (MMDKD) strategy to construct a lightweight semi-parameter sharing image encoder that produces discriminative visual features for diverse modalities. Further, we introduce the Self-Patch Prompt Generator (SPPG) to automatically generate high-quality dense prompt embeddings for guiding segmentation decoding. Finally, we design the Query-Decoupled Modality Decoder (QDMD) that leverages a one-to-one strategy to provide an independent decoding channel for every modality. Extensive experiments indicate that ESP-MedSAM outperforms state-of-the-arts in diverse medical imaging segmentation tasks, displaying superior modality universality and generalization capabilities. Especially, ESP-MedSAM uses only 4.5\% parameters compared to SAM-H. The source code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/ESP-MedSAM.</description>

      <title>GMAI-MMBench: A Comprehensive Multimodal Evaluation Benchmark Towards General Medical AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are capable of handling diverse data types such as imaging, text, and physiological signals, and can be applied in various fields. In the medical field, LVLMs have a high potential to offer substantial assistance for diagnosis and treatment. Before that, it is crucial to develop benchmarks to evaluate LVLMs' effectiveness in various medical applications. Current benchmarks are often built upon specific academic literature, mainly focusing on a single domain, and lacking varying perceptual granularities. Thus, they face specific challenges, including limited clinical relevance, incomplete evaluations, and insufficient guidance for interactive LVLMs. To address these limitations, we developed the GMAI-MMBench, the most comprehensive general medical AI benchmark with well-categorized data structure and multi-perceptual granularity to date. It is constructed from 285 datasets across 39 medical image modalities, 18 clinical-related tasks, 18 departments, and 4 perceptual granularities in a Visual Question Answering (VQA) format. Additionally, we implemented a lexical tree structure that allows users to customize evaluation tasks, accommodating various assessment needs and substantially supporting medical AI research and applications. We evaluated 50 LVLMs, and the results show that even the advanced GPT-4o only achieves an accuracy of 52%, indicating significant room for improvement. Moreover, we identified five key insufficiencies in current cutting-edge LVLMs that need to be addressed to advance the development of better medical applications. We believe that GMAI-MMBench will stimulate the community to build the next generation of LVLMs toward GMAI.

      <title>Paying U-Attention to Textures: Multi-Stage Hourglass Vision Transformer for Universal Texture Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.11703v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel U-Attention vision Transformer for universal texture synthesis. We exploit the natural long-range dependencies enabled by the attention mechanism to allow our approach to synthesize diverse textures while preserving their structures in a single inference. We propose a hierarchical hourglass backbone that attends to the global structure and performs patch mapping at varying scales in a coarse-to-fine-to-coarse stream. Completed by skip connection and convolution designs that propagate and fuse information at different scales, our hierarchical U-Attention architecture unifies attention to features from macro structures to micro details, and progressively refines synthesis results at successive stages. Our method achieves stronger 2$\times$ synthesis than previous work on both stochastic and structured textures while generalizing to unseen textures without fine-tuning. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each component of our architecture.</description>

      <title>FOOL: Addressing the Downlink Bottleneck in Satellite Computing with Neural Feature Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanosatellite constellations equipped with sensors capturing large geographic regions provide unprecedented opportunities for Earth observation. As constellation sizes increase, network contention poses a downlink bottleneck. Orbital Edge Computing (OEC) leverages limited onboard compute resources to reduce transfer costs by processing the raw captures at the source. However, current solutions have limited practicability due to reliance on crude filtering methods or over-prioritizing particular downstream tasks.
  This work presents FOOL, an OEC-native and task-agnostic feature compression method that preserves prediction performance. FOOL partitions high-resolution satellite imagery to maximize throughput. Further, it embeds context and leverages inter-tile dependencies to lower transfer costs with negligible overhead. While FOOL is a feature compressor, it can recover images with competitive scores on quality measures at lower bitrates. We extensively evaluate transfer cost reduction by including the peculiarity of intermittently available network connections in low earth orbit. Lastly, we test the feasibility of our system for standardized nanosatellite form factors. We demonstrate that FOOL permits downlinking over 100x the data volume without relying on prior information on the downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Compression-Realized Deep Structural Network for Video Quality Enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06342v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the task of quality enhancement for compressed videos. Although deep network-based video restorers achieve impressive progress, most of the existing methods lack a structured design to optimally leverage the priors within compression codecs. Since the quality degradation of the video is primarily induced by the compression algorithm, a new paradigm is urgently needed for a more ``conscious'' process of quality enhancement. As a result, we propose the Compression-Realized Deep Structural Network (CRDS), introducing three inductive biases aligned with the three primary processes in the classic compression codec, merging the strengths of classical encoder architecture with deep network capabilities. Inspired by the residual extraction and domain transformation process in the codec, a pre-trained Latent Degradation Residual Auto-Encoder is proposed to transform video frames into a latent feature space, and the mutual neighborhood attention mechanism is integrated for precise motion estimation and residual extraction. Furthermore, drawing inspiration from the quantization noise distribution of the codec, CRDS proposes a novel Progressive Denoising framework with intermediate supervision that decomposes the quality enhancement into a series of simpler denoising sub-tasks. Experimental results on datasets like LDV 2.0 and MFQE 2.0 indicate our approach surpasses state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>3DSS-Mamba: 3D-Spectral-Spatial Mamba for Hyperspectral Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification constitutes the fundamental research in remote sensing fields. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have demonstrated impressive capability in capturing spectral-spatial contextual dependencies. However, these architectures suffer from limited receptive fields and quadratic computational complexity, respectively. Fortunately, recent Mamba architectures built upon the State Space Model integrate the advantages of long-range sequence modeling and linear computational efficiency, exhibiting substantial potential in low-dimensional scenarios. Motivated by this, we propose a novel 3D-Spectral-Spatial Mamba (3DSS-Mamba) framework for HSI classification, allowing for global spectral-spatial relationship modeling with greater computational efficiency. Technically, a spectral-spatial token generation (SSTG) module is designed to convert the HSI cube into a set of 3D spectral-spatial tokens. To overcome the limitations of traditional Mamba, which is confined to modeling causal sequences and inadaptable to high-dimensional scenarios, a 3D-Spectral-Spatial Selective Scanning (3DSS) mechanism is introduced, which performs pixel-wise selective scanning on 3D hyperspectral tokens along the spectral and spatial dimensions. Five scanning routes are constructed to investigate the impact of dimension prioritization. The 3DSS scanning mechanism combined with conventional mapping operations forms the 3D-spectral-spatial mamba block (3DMB), enabling the extraction of global spectral-spatial semantic representations. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on HSI classification benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Sparse Multi-baseline SAR Cross-modal 3D Reconstruction of Vehicle Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-baseline SAR 3D imaging faces significant challenges due to data sparsity. In recent years, deep learning techniques have achieved notable success in enhancing the quality of sparse SAR 3D imaging. However, previous work typically rely on full-aperture high-resolution radar images to supervise the training of deep neural networks (DNNs), utilizing only single-modal information from radar data. Consequently, imaging performance is limited, and acquiring full-aperture data for multi-baseline SAR is costly and sometimes impractical in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Modal Reconstruction Network (CMR-Net), which integrates differentiable render and cross-modal supervision with optical images to reconstruct highly sparse multi-baseline SAR 3D images of vehicle targets into visually structured and high-resolution images. We meticulously designed the network architecture and training strategies to enhance network generalization capability. Remarkably, CMR-Net, trained solely on simulated data, demonstrates high-resolution reconstruction capabilities on both publicly available simulation datasets and real measured datasets, outperforming traditional sparse reconstruction algorithms based on compressed sensing and other learning-based methods. Additionally, using optical images as supervision provides a cost-effective way to build training datasets, reducing the difficulty of method dissemination. Our work showcases the broad prospects of deep learning in multi-baseline SAR 3D imaging and offers a novel path for researching radar imaging based on cross-modal learning theory.</description>
