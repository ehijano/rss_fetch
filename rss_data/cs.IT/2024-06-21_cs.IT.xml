      <title>Factor Graph Optimization of Error-Correcting Codes for Belief Propagation Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of optimal linear block codes capable of being efficiently decoded is of major concern, especially for short block lengths. As near capacity-approaching codes, Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes possess several advantages over other families of codes, the most notable being its efficient decoding via Belief Propagation. While many LDPC code design methods exist, the development of efficient sparse codes that meet the constraints of modern short code lengths and accommodate new channel models remains a challenge. In this work, we propose for the first time a data-driven approach for the design of sparse codes. We develop locally optimal codes with respect to Belief Propagation decoding via the learning on the Factor graph (also called the Tanner graph) under channel noise simulations. This is performed via a novel tensor representation of the Belief Propagation algorithm, optimized over finite fields via backpropagation coupled with an efficient line-search method. The proposed approach is shown to outperform the decoding performance of existing popular codes by orders of magnitude and demonstrates the power of data-driven approaches for code design.</description>

      <title>An End-to-End Coding Scheme for DNA-Based Data Storage With Nanopore-Sequenced Reads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider error-correcting coding for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-based storage using nanopore sequencing. We model the DNA storage channel as a sampling noise channel where the input data is chunked into $M$ short DNA strands, which are copied a random number of times, and the channel outputs a random selection of $N$ noisy DNA strands. The retrieved DNA reads are prone to strand-dependent insertion, deletion, and substitution (IDS) errors. We construct an index-based concatenated coding scheme consisting of the concatenation of an outer code, an index code, and an inner code. We further propose a low-complexity (linear in $N$) maximum a posteriori probability decoder that takes into account the strand-dependent IDS errors and the randomness of the drawing to infer symbolwise a posteriori probabilities for the outer decoder. We present Monte-Carlo simulations for information-outage probabilities and frame error rates for different channel setups on experimental data. We finally evaluate the overall system performance using the read/write cost trade-off. A powerful combination of tailored channel modeling and soft information processing allows us to achieve excellent performance even with error-prone nanopore-sequenced reads outperforming state-of-the-art schemes.%</description>

      <title>Abelian Group Codes for Classical and Classical-Quantum Channels: One-shot and Asymptotic Rate Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of transmission of information over classical and classical-quantum channels in the one-shot regime where the underlying codes are constrained to be group codes. In the achievability part, we introduce a new input probability distribution that incorporates the encoding homomorphism and the underlying channel law. Using a random coding argument, we characterize the performance of group codes in terms of hypothesis testing relative-entropic quantities. In the converse part, we establish bounds by leveraging a hypothesis testing-based approach. Furthermore, we apply the one-shot result to the asymptotic stationary memoryless setting, and establish a single-letter lower bound on group capacities for both classes of channels. Moreover, we derive a matching upper bound on the asymptotic group capacity.</description>

      <title>Overlay Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks with SWIPT-Empowered Aerial Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider overlay space-air-ground integrated networks (OSAGINs) where a low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communicates with ground users (GUs) with the assistance of an energy-constrained coexisting air-to-air (A2A) network. Particularly, a non-linear energy harvester with a hybrid SWIPT utilizing both power-splitting and time-switching energy harvesting (EH) techniques is employed at the aerial transmitter. Specifically, we take the random locations of the satellite, ground and aerial receivers to investigate the outage performance of both the satellite-to-ground and aerial networks leveraging the stochastic tools. By taking into account the Shadowed-Rician fading for satellite link, the Nakagami-\emph{m} for ground link, and the Rician fading for aerial link, we derive analytical expressions for the outage probability of these networks. For a comprehensive analysis of aerial network, we consider both the perfect and imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) scenarios. Through our analysis, we illustrate that, unlike linear EH, the implementation of non-linear EH provides accurate figures for any target rate, underscoring the significance of using non-linear EH models. Additionally, the influence of key parameters is emphasized, providing guidelines for the practical design of an energy-efficient as well as spectrum-efficient future non-terrestrial networks. Monte Carlo simulations validate the accuracy of our theoretical developments.</description>

      <title>Linear codes in the folded Hamming distance and the quasi MDS property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study linear codes with the folded Hamming distance, or equivalently, codes with the classical Hamming distance that are linear over a subfield. This includes additive codes. We study MDS codes in this setting and define quasi MDS (QMDS) codes and dually QMDS codes, which attain a more relaxed variant of the classical Singleton bound. We provide several general results concerning these codes, including restriction, shortening, weight distributions, existence, density, geometric description and bounds on their lengths relative to their field sizes. We provide explicit examples and a binary construction with optimal lengths relative to their field sizes, which beats any MDS code.</description>

      <title>Consensus analysis of a two-step communication opinion dynamics model with group pressure and self-confidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the consensus problem of a novel opinion dynamics model with group pressure and self-confidence. Different with the most existing paper, the influence of friends of friends in a social network is taken into account, which is modeled to be two-step communication. Based on this consideration, the neighbors of agents are classified into direct neighbors and indirect neighbors. Accordingly, the communication between agents and their neighbors is classified into one-step communication and two-step communication. By applying matrix analytic theory and graph theory, it is shown that the opinion consensus can be achieved. Moreover, the exactly consensus value of the opinion is obtained for three cases of the group pressure. Finally, simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the validity of the conclusions drawn in the paper.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Covert Semantics: Joint Source-Channel Coding Under a Covertness Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental limit of Semantic Communications (joint source-channel coding) is established when the transmission needs to be kept covert from an external warden. We derive information-theoretic achievability and matching converse results and we show that source and channel coding separation holds for this setup. Furthermore, we show through an experimental setup that one can train a deep neural network to achieve covert semantic communication for the classification task. Our numerical experiments confirm our theoretical findings, which indicate that for reliable joint source-channel coding the number of transmitted source symbols can only scale as the square-root of the number of channel uses.</description>

      <title>Wiretapped Commitment over Binary Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the problem of wiretapped commitment, where two parties, say committer Alice and receiver Bob, engage in a commitment protocol using a noisy channel as a resource, in the presence of an eavesdropper, say Eve. Noisy versions of Alice's transmission over the wiretap channel are received at both Bob and Eve. We seek to determine the maximum commitment throughput in the presence of an eavesdropper, i.e., wiretapped commitment capacity, where in addition to the standard security requirements for two-party commitment, one seeks to ensure that Eve doesn't learn about the commit string.
  A key interest in this work is to explore the effect of collusion (or lack of it) between the eavesdropper Eve and either Alice or Bob. Toward the same, we present results on the wiretapped commitment capacity under the so-called 1-private regime (when Alice or Bob cannot collude with Eve) and the 2-private regime (when Alice or Bob may possibly collude with Eve).</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Dynamic Port and Waveform Switching for Enhancing UL Coverage in 5G NR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uplink of 5G networks allows selecting the transmit waveform between cyclic prefix orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CP-OFDM) and discrete Fourier transform spread OFDM (DFT-S-OFDM), which is appealing for cell-edge users using high-frequency bands, since it shows a smaller peak-to-average power ratio, and allows a higher transmit power. Nevertheless, DFT-S-OFDM exhibits a higher block error rate (BLER) which complicates an optimal waveform selection. In this paper, we propose an intelligent waveform-switching mechanism based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In this proposal, a learning agent aims at maximizing a function built using available throughput percentiles in real networks. Said percentiles are weighted so as to improve the cell-edge users' service without dramatically reducing the cell average. Aggregated measurements of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and timing advance (TA), available in real networks, are used in the procedure. Results show that our proposed scheme greatly outperforms both metrics compared to classical approaches.</description>

      <title>Channel Charting in Real-World Coordinates with Distributed MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel charting is an emerging self-supervised method that maps channel-state information (CSI) to a low-dimensional latent space (the channel chart) that represents pseudo-positions of user equipments (UEs). While channel charts preserve local geometry, i.e., nearby UEs are nearby in the channel chart (and vice versa), the pseudo-positions are in arbitrary coordinates and global geometry is typically not preserved. In order to embed channel charts in real-world coordinates, we first propose a bilateration loss for distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) wireless systems in which only the access point (AP) positions are known. The idea behind this loss is to compare the received power at pairs of APs to determine whether a UE should be placed closer to one AP or the other in the channel chart. Second, we propose a line-of-sight (LoS) bounding-box loss that places the UE in a predefined LoS area of each AP that is estimated to have a LoS path to the UE. We demonstrate the efficacy of combining both of these loss functions with neural-network-based channel charting using ray-tracing-based and measurement-based channel vectors. Our approach outperforms several baselines and maintains the self-supervised nature of channel charting as it does not rely on geometrical propagation models or require ground-truth UE position information.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Wireless Discontinuous Reception via MAC Signaling Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to the problem of controlling the Discontinuous Reception (DRX) policy from a Base Transceiver Station (BTS) in a cellular network. We do so by means of optimally timing the transmission of fast Layer-2 signaling messages (a.k.a. Medium Access Layer (MAC) Control Elements (CEs) as specified in 5G New Radio). Unlike more conventional approaches to DRX optimization, which rely on fine-tuning the values of DRX timers, we assess the gains that can be obtained solely by means of this MAC CE signalling. For the simulation part, we concentrate on traffic types typically encountered in Extended Reality (XR) applications, where the need for battery drain minimization and overheating mitigation are particularly pressing. Both 3GPP 5G New Radio (5G NR) compliant and non-compliant ("beyond 5G") MAC CEs are considered. Our simulation results show that our proposed technique strikes an improved trade-off between latency and energy savings as compared to conventional timer-based approaches that are characteristic of most current implementations. Specifically, our RL-based policy can nearly halve the active time for a single User Equipment (UE) with respect to a na\"ive MAC CE transmission policy, and still achieve near 20% active time reduction for 9 simultaneously served UEs.</description>

      <title>Error-Correcting Graph Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define, study, and construct {\em Error-Correcting Graph Codes}. An error-correcting graph code of distance $\delta$ is a family $C$ of graphs, on a common vertex set of size $n$, such that if we start with any graph in $C$, we would have to modify the neighborhoods of at least $\delta n$ vertices in order to reach some other graph in $C$.
  This is a natural graph generalization of the standard Hamming distance error-correcting codes for binary strings. We show:
  1. Combinatorial results determining the optimal rate vs distance tradeoff nonconstructively.
  2. A connection to rank-metric codes, enabling some simple and some involved constructions achieving certain positive rates and distances.
  3. Graph code analogues of Reed-Solomon codes and code concatenation, leading to positive distance codes for all rates and positive rate codes for all distances.
  4. Graph code analogues of dual-BCH codes, yielding large codes with distance $\delta = 1-o(1)$. This gives an explicit "graph code of Ramsey graphs".
  Several recent works, starting with the paper of Alon, Gujgiczer, K\"orner, Milojevi\'c, and Simonyi, have studied more general graph codes; where the symmetric difference between any two graphs in the code is required to have a desired property. Error-correcting graph codes are a particularly interesting instantiation of this concept.</description>

      <title>Explicit Performance Bound of Finite Blocklength Coded MIMO: Time-Domain versus Spatiotemporal Channel Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the sixth generation (6G), ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) will further develop to achieve TKu extreme connectivity, and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is expected to be a key enabler for its realization. Since the latency constraint can be represented by the blocklength of a codeword, it is essential to analyze different coded MIMO schemes under finite blocklength regime. In this paper, we analyze the statistical characteristics of information density of time-domain coding and spatiotemporal coding MIMO, compute the channel capacity and dispersion, and present new explicit performance bounds of finite blocklength coded MIMO for different coding modes via normal approximation. As revealed by the analysis and simulation, spatiotemporal coding can effectively mitigate the performance loss induced by short blocklength by increasing the spatial degree of freedom (DoF). However, for time-domain coding, each spatial link is encoded independently, and the performance loss will be more severe with short blocklength under any spatial DoF. These results indicate that spatiotemporal coding can optimally exploit the spatial dimension advantages of MIMO systems compared with time-domain coding, and it has the potential to support URLLC transmission, enabling very low error-rate communication under stringent blocklength constraint.</description>

      <title>New QEC codes and EAQEC codes from repeated-root cyclic codes of length $2^rp^s$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime and $r,s,m$ be positive integers. In this study, we initiate our exploration by delving into the intricate structure of all repeated-root cyclic codes and their duals with a length of $2^rp^s$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$. Through the utilization of CSS and Steane's constructions, a series of new quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes are constructed with parameters distinct from all previous constructions. Furthermore, we provide all maximum distance separable (MDS) cyclic codes of length $2^rp^s$, which are further utilized in the construction of QEC MDS codes. Finally, we introduce a significant number of novel entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting (EAQEC) codes derived from these repeated-root cyclic codes. Notably, these newly constructed codes exhibit parameters distinct from those of previously known constructions.</description>

      <title>PAPR Reduction with Pre-chirp Selection for Affine Frequency Division Multiple</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is a promising new multicarrier technique based on discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT). By properly tuning pre-chirp parameter and post-chirp parameter in the DAFT, the effective channel in the DAFT domain can completely avoid overlap of different paths, thus constitutes a full representation of delay-Doppler profile, which significantly improves the system performance in high mobility scenarios. However, AFDM has the crucial problem of high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) caused by phase randomness of modulated symbols. In this letter, an algorithm named grouped pre-chirp selection (GPS) is proposed to reduce the PAPR by changing the value of pre-chirp parameter on sub-carriers group by group. Specifically, it is demonstrated first that the important properties of AFDM system are maintained when implementing GPS. Secondly, we elaborate the operation steps of GPS algorithm, illustrating its effect on PAPR reduction and its advantage in terms of computational complexity compared with the ungrouped approach. Finally, simulation results of PAPR reduction in the form of complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) show the effectiveness of the proposed GPS algorithm.</description>

      <title>On Unique Error Patterns in the Levenshtein's Sequence Reconstruction Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Levenshtein's sequence reconstruction problem a codeword is transmitted through $N$ channels and in each channel a set of errors is introduced to the transmitted word. In previous works, the restriction that each channel provides a unique output word has been essential. In this work, we assume only that each channel introduces a unique set of errors to the transmitted word and hence some output words can also be identical. As we will discuss, this interpretation is both natural and useful for deletion and insertion errors. We give properties, techniques and (optimal) results for this situation.
  Quaternary alphabets are relevant due to applications related to DNA-memories. Hence, we introduce an efficient Las Vegas style decoding algorithm for simultaneous insertion, deletion and substitution errors in $q$-ary Hamming spaces for $q \geq 4$.</description>

      <title>Region-Specific Coarse Quantization with Check Node Awareness in 5G-LDPC Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents novel techniques for improving the error correction performance and reducing the complexity of coarsely quantized 5G-LDPC decoders. The proposed decoder design supports arbitrary message-passing schedules on a base-matrix level by modeling exchanged messages with entry-specific discrete random variables. Variable nodes (VNs) and check nodes (CNs) involve compression operations designed using the information bottleneck method to maximize preserved mutual information between code bits and quantized messages. We introduce alignment regions that assign the messages to groups with aligned reliability levels to decrease the number of individual design parameters. Group compositions with degree-specific separation of messages improve performance by up to 0.4 dB. Further, we generalize our recently proposed CN-aware quantizer design to irregular LDPC codes and layered schedules. The method optimizes the VN quantizer to maximize preserved mutual information at the output of the subsequent CN update, enhancing performance by up to 0.2 dB. A schedule optimization modifies the order of layer updates, reducing the average iteration count by up to 35 %. We integrate all new techniques in a rate-compatible decoder design by extending the alignment regions along a rate-dimension. Our complexity analysis for 2-bit decoding estimates up to 64 % higher throughput versus 4-bit decoding at similar performance.</description>

      <title>Finite Alphabet Fast List Decoders for Polar Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The so-called fast polar decoding schedules are meant to improve the decoding speed of the sequential-natured successive cancellation list decoders. The decoding speedup is achieved by replacing various parts of the serial decoding process with efficient special-purpose decoder nodes. This work incorporates the fast decoding schedules for polar codes into their quantized finite alphabet decoding. In a finite alphabet successive cancellation list decoder, the log-likelihood ratio computations are replaced with lookup operations on low-resolution integer messages. The lookup tables are designed using the information bottleneck method. It is shown that the finite alphabet decoders can also leverage the special decoder nodes found in the literature. Besides their inherent decoding speed improvement, the use of these special decoder nodes drastically reduces the number of lookup tables required to perform the finite alphabet decoding. In order to perform quantized decoding using lookup operations, the proposed decoders require up to 93% less unique lookup tables as compared to the ones that use the conventional successive cancellation schedule. Moreover, the proposed decoders exhibit negligible loss in error correction performance without necessitating alterations to the lookup table design process.</description>

      <title>A Variational Characterization of $H$-Mutual Information and its Application to Computing $H$-Capacity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $H$-mutual information ($H$-MI) is a wide class of information leakage measures, where $H=(\eta, F)$ is a pair of monotonically increasing function $\eta$ and a concave function $F$, which is a generalization of Shannon entropy. $H$-MI is defined as the difference between the generalized entropy $H$ and its conditional version, including Shannon mutual information (MI), Arimoto MI of order $\alpha$, $g$-leakage, and expected value of sample information. This study presents a variational characterization of $H$-MI via statistical decision theory. Based on the characterization, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm for computing $H$-capacity.</description>

      <title>High-probability minimax lower bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimax risk is often considered as a gold standard against which we can compare specific statistical procedures. Nevertheless, as has been observed recently in robust and heavy-tailed estimation problems, the inherent reduction of the (random) loss to its expectation may entail a significant loss of information regarding its tail behaviour. In an attempt to avoid such a loss, we introduce the notion of a minimax quantile, and seek to articulate its dependence on the quantile level. To this end, we develop high-probability variants of the classical Le Cam and Fano methods, as well as a technique to convert local minimax risk lower bounds to lower bounds on minimax quantiles. To illustrate the power of our framework, we deploy our techniques on several examples, recovering recent results in robust mean estimation and stochastic convex optimisation, as well as obtaining several new results in covariance matrix estimation, sparse linear regression, nonparametric density estimation and isotonic regression. Our overall goal is to argue that minimax quantiles can provide a finer-grained understanding of the difficulty of statistical problems, and that, in wide generality, lower bounds on these quantities can be obtained via user-friendly tools.</description>

      <title>DRACO: Decentralized Asynchronous Federated Learning over Continuous Row-Stochastic Network Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments and emerging use cases, such as smart Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge AI, have sparked considerable interest in the training of neural networks over fully decentralized (serverless) networks. One of the major challenges of decentralized learning is to ensure stable convergence without resorting to strong assumptions applied for each agent regarding data distributions or updating policies. To address these issues, we propose DRACO, a novel method for decentralized asynchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) over row-stochastic gossip wireless networks by leveraging continuous communication. Our approach enables edge devices within decentralized networks to perform local training and model exchanging along a continuous timeline, thereby eliminating the necessity for synchronized timing. The algorithm also features a specific technique of decoupling communication and computation schedules, which empowers complete autonomy for all users and manageable instructions for stragglers. Through a comprehensive convergence analysis, we highlight the advantages of asynchronous and autonomous participation in decentralized optimization. Our numerical experiments corroborate the efficacy of the proposed technique.</description>

      <title>Bayes' capacity as a measure for reconstruction attacks in federated learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the machine learning community, reconstruction attacks are a principal attack of concern and have been identified even in federated learning, which was designed with privacy preservation in mind. In federated learning, it has been shown that an adversary with knowledge of the machine learning architecture is able to infer the exact value of a training element given an observation of the weight updates performed during stochastic gradient descent. In response to these threats, the privacy community recommends the use of differential privacy in the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, termed DP-SGD. However, DP has not yet been formally established as an effective countermeasure against reconstruction attacks. In this paper, we formalise the reconstruction threat model using the information-theoretic framework of quantitative information flow. We show that the Bayes' capacity, related to the Sibson mutual information of order infinity, represents a tight upper bound on the leakage of the DP-SGD algorithm to an adversary interested in performing a reconstruction attack. We provide empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of this measure for comparing mechanisms against reconstruction threats.</description>

      <title>Random pairing MLE for estimation of item parameters in Rasch model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rasch model, a classical model in the item response theory, is widely used in psychometrics to model the relationship between individuals' latent traits and their binary responses on assessments or questionnaires. In this paper, we introduce a new likelihood-based estimator -- random pairing maximum likelihood estimator ($\mathsf{RP\text{-}MLE}$) and its bootstrapped variant multiple random pairing MLE ($\mathsf{MRP\text{-}MLE}$) that faithfully estimate the item parameters in the Rasch model. The new estimators have several appealing features compared to existing ones. First, both work for sparse observations, an increasingly important scenario in the big data era. Second, both estimators are provably minimax optimal in terms of finite sample $\ell_{\infty}$ estimation error. Lastly, $\mathsf{RP\text{-}MLE}$ admits precise distributional characterization that allows uncertainty quantification on the item parameters, e.g., construction of confidence intervals of the item parameters. The main idea underlying $\mathsf{RP\text{-}MLE}$ and $\mathsf{MRP\text{-}MLE}$ is to randomly pair user-item responses to form item-item comparisons. This is carefully designed to reduce the problem size while retaining statistical independence. We also provide empirical evidence of the efficacy of the two new estimators using both simulated and real data.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Switching Point and Power Control in Dynamic TDD Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) network operating in dynamic time division duplex (DTDD). The switching point between the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) data transmission phases can be adapted dynamically to the instantaneous quality-of-service (QoS) requirements in order to improve energy efficiency (EE). To this end, we formulate a problem of optimizing the DTDD switching point jointly with the UL and DL power control coefficients, and the large-scale fading decoding (LSFD) weights for EE maximization. Then, we propose an iterative algorithm to solve the formulated challenging problem using successive convex approximation with an approximate stationary solution. Simulation results show that optimizing switching points remarkably improves EE compared with baseline schemes that adjust switching points heuristically.</description>

      <title>A DRL Approach for RIS-Assisted Full-Duplex UL and DL Transmission: Beamforming, Phase Shift and Power Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for a full-duplex (FD) transmission that predicts the phase shifts of the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), base station (BS) active beamformers, and the transmit powers to maximize the weighted sum rate of uplink and downlink users. Existing methods require channel state information (CSI) and residual self-interference (SI) knowledge to calculate exact active beamformers or the DRL rewards, which typically fail without CSI or residual SI. Especially for time-varying channels, estimating and signaling CSI to the DRL agent is required at each time step and is costly. We propose a two-stage DRL framework with minimal signaling overhead to address this. The first stage uses the least squares method to initiate learning by partially canceling the residual SI. The second stage uses DRL to achieve performance comparable to existing CSI-based methods without requiring the CSI or the exact residual SI. Further, the proposed DRL framework for quantized RIS phase shifts reduces the signaling from BS to the RISs using $32$ times fewer bits than the continuous version. The quantized methods reduce action space, resulting in faster convergence and $7.1\%$ and $22.28\%$ better UL and DL rates, respectively than the continuous method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Locally repairable codes (LRCs) have attracted a lot of attention due to their applications in distributed storage systems. In this paper, we provide new constructions of optimal $(2, \delta)$-LRCs over $\mathbb{F}_q$ with flexible parameters. Firstly, employing techniques from finite geometry, we introduce a simple yet useful condition to ensure that a punctured simplex code becomes a $(2, \delta)$-LRC. It is worth noting that this condition only imposes a requirement on the size of the puncturing set. Secondly, utilizing character sums over finite fields and Krawtchouk polynomials, we determine the parameters of more punctured simplex codes with puncturing sets of new structures. Several infinite families of LRCs with new parameters are derived. All of our new LRCs are optimal with respect to the generalized Cadambe-Mazumdar bound and some of them are also Griesmer codes or distance-optimal codes.</description>

Abstract: By solving a problem regarding polynomials in a quotient ring, we obtain the relative hull and the Hermitian hull of projective Reed-Muller codes over the projective plane. The dimension of the hull determines the minimum number of maximally entangled pairs required for the corresponding entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting code. Hence, by computing the dimension of the hull we now have all the parameters of the symmetric and asymmetric entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes constructed with projective Reed-Muller codes over the projective plane. As a byproduct, we also compute the dimension of the Hermitian hull for affine Reed-Muller codes in 2 variables.</description>

      <title>Griesmer and Optimal Linear Codes from the Affine Solomon-Stiffler Construction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In their fundamental paper published in 1965, G. Solomon and J. J. Stiffler invented infinite families of codes meeting the Griesmer bound. These codes are then called Solomon-Stiffler codes and have motivated various constructions of codes meeting or close the Griesmer bound.
  In this paper, we give a geometric construction of infinite families of affine and modified affine Solomon-Stiffler codes. Projective Solomon-Stiffler codes are special cases of our modified affine Solomon-Stiffler codes. Several infinite families of $q$-ary Griesmer, optimal, almost optimal two-weight, three-weight, four-weight and five-weight linear codes are constructed as special cases of our construction. Weight distributions of these Griesmer, optimal or almost optimal codes are determined. Many optimal linear codes documented in Grassl's list are re-constructed as (modified) affine Solomon-Stiffler codes.
  Several infinite families of optimal or Griesmer codes were constructed in two published papers in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 2017 and 2019, via Gray images of codes over finite rings. Parameters and weight distributions of these Griesmer or optimal codes and very special case codes in our construction are the same. We also indicate that more general distance-optimal binary linear codes than that constructed in a recent paper of IEEE Transactions on Information Theory can be obtained directly from codimension one subcodes in binary Solomon-Stiffler codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.11698v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with quantum data compression of asymptotically many independent and identically distributed copies of ensembles of mixed quantum states. The encoder has access to a side information system. The figure of merit is per-copy or local error criterion. Rate-distortion theory studies the trade-off between the compression rate and the per-copy error. The optimal trade-off can be characterized by the rate-distortion function, which is the best rate given a certain distortion. In this paper, we derive the rate-distortion function of mixed-state compression. The rate-distortion functions in the entanglement-assisted and unassisted scenarios are in terms of a single-letter mutual information quantity and the regularized entanglement of purification, respectively. For the general setting where the consumption of both communication and entanglement are considered, we present the full qubit-entanglement rate region. Our compression scheme covers both blind and visible compression models (and other models in between) depending on the structure of the side information system.</description>

Abstract: Efficient computation of the optimal transport distance between two distributions serves as an algorithm subroutine that empowers various applications. This paper develops a scalable first-order optimization-based method that computes optimal transport to within $\varepsilon$ additive accuracy with runtime $\widetilde{O}( n^2/\varepsilon)$, where $n$ denotes the dimension of the probability distributions of interest. Our algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art computational guarantees among all first-order methods, while exhibiting favorable numerical performance compared to classical algorithms like Sinkhorn and Greenkhorn. Underlying our algorithm designs are two key elements: (a) converting the original problem into a bilinear minimax problem over probability distributions; (b) exploiting the extragradient idea -- in conjunction with entropy regularization and adaptive learning rates -- to accelerate convergence.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic generalization bounds for learning from quantum data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning tasks play an increasingly prominent role in quantum information and computation. They range from fundamental problems such as state discrimination and metrology over the framework of quantum probably approximately correct (PAC) learning, to the recently proposed shadow variants of state tomography. However, the many directions of quantum learning theory have so far evolved separately. We propose a general mathematical formalism for describing quantum learning by training on classical-quantum data and then testing how well the learned hypothesis generalizes to new data. In this framework, we prove bounds on the expected generalization error of a quantum learner in terms of classical and quantum information-theoretic quantities measuring how strongly the learner's hypothesis depends on the specific data seen during training. To achieve this, we use tools from quantum optimal transport and quantum concentration inequalities to establish non-commutative versions of decoupling lemmas that underlie recent information-theoretic generalization bounds for classical machine learning. Our framework encompasses and gives intuitively accessible generalization bounds for a variety of quantum learning scenarios such as quantum state discrimination, PAC learning quantum states, quantum parameter estimation, and quantumly PAC learning classical functions. Thereby, our work lays a foundation for a unifying quantum information-theoretic perspective on quantum learning.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Coding Gain Due to In-Loop Reshaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reshaping, a point operation that alters the characteristics of signals, has been shown capable of improving the compression ratio in video coding practices. Out-of-loop reshaping that directly modifies the input video signal was first adopted as the supplemental enhancement information (SEI) for the HEVC/H.265 without the need to alter the core design of the video codec. VVC/H.266 further improves the coding efficiency by adopting in-loop reshaping that modifies the residual signal being processed in the hybrid coding loop. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the rate-distortion performance of the in-loop reshaping and use experiments to verify the theoretical result. We prove that the in-loop reshaping can improve coding efficiency when the entropy coder adopted in the coding pipeline is suboptimal, which is in line with the practical scenarios that video codecs operate in. We derive the PSNR gain in a closed form and show that the theoretically predicted gain is consistent with that measured from experiments using standard testing video sequences.</description>

      <title>On a Rice theorem for dynamical properties of SFTs on groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group with undecidable domino problem (such as $\mathbb{Z}^2$). We prove the undecidability of all nontrivial dynamical properties for sofic $G$-subshifts, that such a result fails for SFTs, and an undecidability result for dynamical properties of $G$-SFTs similar to the Adian-Rabin theorem. For $G$ amenable we prove that topological entropy is not computable from presentations of SFTs, and a more general result for dynamical invariants taking values in partially ordered sets.</description>

      <title>Top-$K$ ranking with a monotone adversary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the top-$K$ ranking problem with a monotone adversary. We consider the scenario where a comparison graph is randomly generated and the adversary is allowed to add arbitrary edges. The statistician's goal is then to accurately identify the top-$K$ preferred items based on pairwise comparisons derived from this semi-random comparison graph. The main contribution of this paper is to develop a weighted maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) that achieves near-optimal sample complexity, up to a $\log^2(n)$ factor, where $n$ denotes the number of items under comparison. This is made possible through a combination of analytical and algorithmic innovations. On the analytical front, we provide a refined~$\ell_\infty$ error analysis of the weighted MLE that is more explicit and tighter than existing analyses. It relates the~$\ell_\infty$ error with the spectral properties of the weighted comparison graph. Motivated by this, our algorithmic innovation involves the development of an SDP-based approach to reweight the semi-random graph and meet specified spectral properties. Additionally, we propose a first-order method based on the Matrix Multiplicative Weight Update (MMWU) framework. This method efficiently solves the resulting SDP in nearly-linear time relative to the size of the semi-random comparison graph.</description>

      <title>New scattered linearized quadrinomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14742v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $1&lt;t&lt;n$ be integers, where $t$ is a divisor of $n$. An R-$q^t$-partially scattered polynomial is a $\mathbb F_q$-linearized polynomial $f$ in $\mathbb F_{q^n}[X]$ that satisfies the condition that for all $x,y\in\mathbb F_{q^n}^*$ such that $x/y\in\mathbb F_{q^t}$, if $f(x)/x=f(y)/y$, then $x/y\in\mathbb F_q$; $f$ is called scattered if this implication holds for all $x,y\in\mathbb F_{q^n}^*$. Two polynomials in $\mathbb F_{q^n}[X]$ are said to be equivalent if their graphs are in the same orbit under the action of the group $\Gamma L(2,q^n)$. For $n&gt;8$ only three families of scattered polynomials in $\mathbb F_{q^n}[X]$ are known: $(i)$~monomials of pseudoregulus type, $(ii)$~binomials of Lunardon-Polverino type, and $(iii)$~a family of quadrinomials defined in [1,10] and extended in [8,13]. In this paper we prove that the polynomial $\varphi_{m,q^J}=X^{q^{J(t-1)}}+X^{q^{J(2t-1)}}+m(X^{q^J}-X^{q^{J(t+1)}})\in\mathbb F_{q^{2t}}[X]$, $q$ odd, $t\ge3$ is R-$q^t$-partially scattered for every value of $m\in\mathbb F_{q^t}^*$ and $J$ coprime with $2t$. Moreover, for every $t&gt;4$ and $q&gt;5$ there exist values of $m$ for which $\varphi_{m,q}$ is scattered and new with respect to the polynomials mentioned in $(i)$, $(ii)$ and $(iii)$ above. The related linear sets are of $\Gamma L$-class at least two.</description>

      <title>On the Inductive Biases of Demographic Parity-based Fair Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fair supervised learning algorithms assigning labels with little dependence on a sensitive attribute have attracted great attention in the machine learning community. While the demographic parity (DP) notion has been frequently used to measure a model's fairness in training fair classifiers, several studies in the literature suggest potential impacts of enforcing DP in fair learning algorithms. In this work, we analytically study the effect of standard DP-based regularization methods on the conditional distribution of the predicted label given the sensitive attribute. Our analysis shows that an imbalanced training dataset with a non-uniform distribution of the sensitive attribute could lead to a classification rule biased toward the sensitive attribute outcome holding the majority of training data. To control such inductive biases in DP-based fair learning, we propose a sensitive attribute-based distributionally robust optimization (SA-DRO) method improving robustness against the marginal distribution of the sensitive attribute. Finally, we present several numerical results on the application of DP-based learning methods to standard centralized and distributed learning problems. The empirical findings support our theoretical results on the inductive biases in DP-based fair learning algorithms and the debiasing effects of the proposed SA-DRO method.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Subgraph Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of federated learning on graph-structured data distributed across multiple clients. Specifically, we focus on the prevalent scenario of interconnected subgraphs, where interconnections between different clients play a critical role. We present a novel framework for this scenario, named FedStruct, that harnesses deep structural dependencies. To uphold privacy, unlike existing methods, FedStruct eliminates the necessity of sharing or generating sensitive node features or embeddings among clients. Instead, it leverages explicit global graph structure information to capture inter-node dependencies. We validate the effectiveness of FedStruct through experimental results conducted on six datasets for semi-supervised node classification, showcasing performance close to the centralized approach across various scenarios, including different data partitioning methods, varying levels of label availability, and number of clients.</description>

      <title>Timely Communications for Remote Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the impact of data freshness on remote inference systems, where a pre-trained neural network blue infers a time-varying target (e.g., the locations of vehicles and pedestrians) based on features (e.g., video frames) observed at a sensing node (e.g., a camera). One might expect that the performance of a remote inference system degrades monotonically as the feature becomes stale. Using an information-theoretic analysis, we show that this is true if the feature and target data sequence can be closely approximated as a Markov chain, whereas it is not true if the data sequence is far from being Markovian. Hence, the inference error is a function of Age of Information (AoI), where the function could be non-monotonic. To minimize the inference error in real-time, we propose a new "selection-from-buffer" model for sending the features, which is more general than the "generate-at-will" model used in earlier studies. In addition, we design low-complexity scheduling policies to improve inference performance. For single-source, single-channel systems, we provide an optimal scheduling policy. In multi-source, multi-channel systems, the scheduling problem becomes a multi-action restless multi-armed bandit problem. For this setting, we design a new scheduling policy by integrating Whittle index-based source selection and duality-based feature selection-from-buffer algorithms. This new scheduling policy is proven to be asymptotically optimal. These scheduling results hold for minimizing general AoI functions (monotonic or non-monotonic). Data-driven evaluations demonstrate the significant advantages of our proposed scheduling policies.</description>

      <title>Stable Phase Retrieval with Mirror Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to reconstruct an n-dimensional real vector from m phaseless measurements corrupted by an additive noise. We extend the noiseless framework developed in [15], based on mirror descent (or Bregman gradient descent), to deal with noisy measurements and prove that the procedure is stable to (small enough) additive noise. In the deterministic case, we show that mirror descent converges to a critical point of the phase retrieval problem, and if the algorithm is well initialized and the noise is small enough, the critical point is near the true vector up to a global sign change. When the measurements are i.i.d Gaussian and the signal-to-noise ratio is large enough, we provide global convergence guarantees that ensure that with high probability, mirror descent converges to a global minimizer near the true vector (up to a global sign change), as soon as the number of measurements m is large enough. The sample complexity bound can be improved if a spectral method is used to provide a good initial guess. We complement our theoretical study with several numerical results showing that mirror descent is both a computationally and statistically efficient scheme to solve the phase retrieval problem.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Aided RIS Communication: Robust Beamforming and Interference Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are envisioned to play a key role in future wireless communication networks. However, channel estimation in RIS-aided wireless networks is challenging due to their passive nature and the large number of reflective elements, leading to high channel estimation overhead. Additionally, conventional methods like beam sweeping, which do not rely on explicit channel state information, often struggle in managing interference in multi-user networks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages digital twins (DTs) of the physical environments to approximate channels using electromagnetic 3D models and ray tracing, thus relaxing the need for channel estimation and extensive over-the-air computations in RIS-aided wireless networks. To address the digital twins channel approximation errors, we further refine this approach with a DT-specific robust transmission design that reliably meets minimum desired rates. The results show that our method secures these rates over 90% of the time, significantly outperforming beam sweeping, which achieves these rates less than 8% of the time due to its poor management of transmitting power and interference.</description>
