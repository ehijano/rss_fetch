      <title>Exploring the Potential of Resonance Islands and Bent Crystals for a Novel Slow Extraction from Circular Hadron Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New developments in accelerator physics have broadened the set of available techniques for manipulating charged-particle beams. Adiabatic trapping and transport of beam in resonance islands has been studied and successfully implemented at the CERN Proton Synchrotron to perform multiturn extraction. Bent crystals have been successfully installed in the CERN Large Hadron Collider, improving the cleaning performance of the collimation system, and at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron for reducing losses at the extraction septum in the case of slow extraction. In this paper, we discuss the potential of the combined use of resonance islands and bent crystals to devise a novel technique to perform slow extraction in circular hadron accelerators. The proposed approach is promising, particularly for applications with high-intensity beams, as it could dramatically reduce the losses on the extraction devices.</description>

      <title>New interferometric aperture masking technique for full transverse beam characterization using synchrotron radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emittance measurements using synchrotron radiation are usually performed using x-rays to avoid diffraction limits. Interferometric techniques using visible light are also used to measure either the horizontal or the vertical beam projection. Several measurements rotating the interferometry axis are needed to obtain a full beam reconstruction. In this report we present a new interferometric multi-aperture masking technique and data analysis, inspired by astronomical methods, that are able to provide a full 2-D transverse beam reconstruction in a single acquisition. Results of beam characterization obtained at ALBA synchrotron light source will also been shown.</description>

      <title>Preliminary Investigation of a Higgs Factory based on Proton-Driven Plasma Wakefield Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Higgs Factory is considered the highest priority next collider project by the high-energy physics community. Very advanced designs based on radio-frequency cavities exist, and variations on this approach are still being developed. Recently, an option based on electron-bunch driven plasma wakefield acceleration has also been proposed. In this article, we discuss a further option based on proton-driven plasma wakefield acceleration. This option has significant potential advantages due to the high energy of the plasma wakefield driver, simplifying the plasma acceleration stage. Its success will depend on further developments in producing compact high-energy proton bunches at a high rate, which would also make possible a broad range of synergistic particle-physics research.</description>

      <title>Online regularization of Poincar\'e map of storage rings with Shannon entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shannon entropy, as a chaos indicator, is used for online Poincar\'e map regularization and dynamic aperture optimization in the National Synchrotron Light Source-II (NSLS-II) ring. Although various chaos indicators are widely used in studying nonlinear dynamical systems, including modern particle accelerators, it is the first time to use a measurable one in a real-world machine for online nonlinear optimization. Poincar\'e maps, constructed with the turn-by-turn beam trajectory readings from beam position monitors, are commonly used to observe the nonlinearity in ring-based accelerators. However, such observations typically only provide a qualitative interpretation. We analyze their entropy to quantify the chaos in measured Poincar\'e maps. After some canonical transformations on the Poincar\'e maps, not only can the commonly used nonlinear characterizations be extracted, but more importantly, the chaos can be quantitatively calibrated with Shannon entropy, and then used as the online optimization objectives.</description>
