      <title>Examining the Interface Design of Tidyverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10382</link>

Abstract: The tidyverse is a popular meta-package comprising several core R packages to aid in various data science tasks, including data import, manipulation and visualisation. Although functionalities offered by the tidyverse can generally be replicated using other packages, its widespread adoption in both teaching and practice indicates there are factors contributing to its preference, despite some debate over its usage. This suggests that particular aspects, such as interface design, may play a significant role in its selection. Examining the interface design can potentially reveal aspects that aid the design process for developers. While Tidyverse has been lauded for adopting a user-centered design, arguably some elements of the design focus on the work domain instead of the end-user. We examine the Tidyverse interface design via the lens of human computer interaction, with an emphasis on data visualisation and data wrangling, to identify factors that might serve as a model for developers designing their packages. We recommend that developers adopt an iterative design that is informed by user feedback, analysis and complete coverage of the work domain, and ensure perceptual visibility of system constraints and relationships.</description>
