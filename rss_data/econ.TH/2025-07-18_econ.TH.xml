      <title>Coarse Addition and the St. Petersburg Paradox: A Heuristic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The St. Petersburg paradox presents a longstanding challenge in decision theory. It describes a game whose expected value is infinite, yet for which no rational finite stake can be determined. Traditional solutions introduce auxiliary assumptions, such as diminishing marginal utility, temporal discounting, or extended number systems. These methods often involve mathematical refinements that may not correspond to how people actually perceive or process numerical information. This paper explores an alternative approach based on a modified operation of addition defined over coarse partitions of the outcome space. In this model, exact numerical values are grouped into perceptual categories, and each value is replaced by a representative element of its group before being added. This method allows for a phenomenon where repeated additions eventually cease to affect the outcome, a behavior described as inertial stabilization. Although this is not intended as a definitive resolution of the paradox, the proposed framework offers a plausible way to represent how agents with limited cognitive precision might handle divergent reward structures. We demonstrate that the St. Petersburg series can become inert under this coarse addition for a suitably constructed partition. The approach may also have broader applications in behavioral modeling and the study of machine reasoning under perceptual limitations.</description>

      <title>Comparisons of Experiments in Moral Hazard Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I use a novel geometric approach to compare information in moral hazard problems. I study three nested geometric orders on information, namely the column space, the conic span, and the zonotope orders. The orders are defined by the inclusion of the column space, the conic span, and the zonotope of the matrices representing the experiments. For each order, I establish four equivalent characterizations, (i) inclusion of polyhedral sets of feasible state dependent utilities, (ii) matrix factorization, (iii) posterior belief distributions, and (iv) classes of moral hazard problems. The column space order characterizes the comparison of feasibility in all moral hazard problems. The conic span order characterizes the comparison of costs in all moral hazard problems with a risk neutral agent and limited liability. The zonotope order characterizes the comparison of costs in all moral hazard problems when the agent can have any utility exhibiting risk aversion.</description>

      <title>Rational Bubbles on Dividend-Paying Assets: A Comment on Tirole (1985)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tirole (1985) studied an overlapping generations model with capital accumulation and showed that the emergence of asset bubbles solves the capital over-accumulation problem. His Proposition 1(c) claims that if the dividend growth rate is above the bubbleless interest rate (the steady-state interest rate in the Diamond economy without bubbles) but below the population growth rate, then bubbles are necessary in the sense that there exists no bubbleless equilibrium but there exists a unique bubbly equilibrium. We provide a counterexample to this claim based on an analytical example but prove the claim under the additional assumptions that initial capital is sufficiently large and dividends are sufficiently small.</description>

      <title>Monopoly Pricing with a Public Option</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines how a profit-maximizing monopolist competes against a free but capacity-constrained public option. The monopolist strategically restricts its supply beyond standard monopoly levels, thereby intensifying congestion at the public option and increasing consumers' willingness-to-pay for guaranteed access. Expanding the capacity of the public option always reduces producer welfare and, counterintuitively, may also reduce consumer welfare. In contrast, introducing a monopolist to a market served only by a capacity-constrained public option unambiguously improves consumer welfare. These findings have implications for mixed public-private markets, such as housing, education, and healthcare.</description>

      <title>Durable Goods Monopoly with Free Disposal: A Folk Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a model of dynamic monopoly with differentiated goods that buyers can freely dispose of. The model extends the framework of Coasian bargaining to situations in which the quantity or quality of the good is endogenously determined. Our main result is that when players are patient, the seller can sustain in equilibrium any payoff between the lowest possible buyer valuation and (approximately) the highest payoff achievable with commitment power, thus establishing a folk theorem. We apply our model to data markets, where data brokers sell marketing lists to producers. Methodologically, we leverage the connection between sequential bargaining and static mechanism design.</description>

      <title>Power in Sharing Networks with a priori Unions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a novel family of power indices tailored for sharing networks in technological markets, where firms operate competitively within, but not across, distinct industrial sectors. In these settings, inter-firm collaboration structures emerge from formal technology licensing agreements. The proposed indices are defined over graphs with a priori unions and combine two key centrality measures - degree-based and rescaled eigenvector centrality - modulated by positive market coefficients that reflect sectoral dynamics. We first explore the monotonicity properties of these indices, highlighting their responsiveness to local changes in network structure. Interestingly, major economic actors exhibit structural stability when inter-sectoral technological spillovers are minimal. Building on these findings, we provide theoretical underpinnings by characterizing the indices as the Shapley values of a family of coherent and economically interpretable transferable utility (TU) games defined over such graphs. However, for a broad class of network structures, the core of these TU games is often empty, signaling inherent instability in technological sharing arrangements. Finally, we offer an axiomatic foundation for this family of indices, proving independence of the proposed axioms. This axiomatization extends naturally to exchange networks, even when stage-propagation coefficients are not positive.</description>

      <title>Analysis Theory of Data Economy: Dataization, Technological Progress and Dynamic General Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper constructs a clean and efficient representative agent model of the data economy from a macroeconomics perspective, in order to analyze the impact of datatization and technological progress on the dynamic general equilibrium of 'consumption-capital', and the catalysis effect of datatization on technological progress. We first set the data in production comes from datatization of the total output of the society and is exponentially functionally related to the technology. Secondly, the data production function is used to solve the optimization problem for firms and households and to construct a dynamic general equilibrium of 'consumption-capital' based on the endogenous interest rate solved by maximizing the returns of firms. Finally, by using numerical simulation and phase diagram analysis, we find that the effects of increasing datatization and encouraging technological progress each exhibit different nonlinear characteristics for equilibrium capital and equilibrium consumption, we thus conclude that datatization enables the positive effects of technological progress on economic development to be more rapid and persistent. We select two types of Chinese policies regarding data openness to represent the role of datatization, and demonstrate the catalysis role of datatization for the development of the digital economy by setting up difference in difference (DID) experiments, which provide persuasive evidence for the theoretical interpretation of the paper.</description>

      <title>Beyond Scalars: Zonotope-Valued Utility for Representation of Multidimensional Incomplete Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05844v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, I propose a new framework for representing multidimensional incomplete preferences through zonotope-valued utilities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional scalar and vector-based models in decision theory. Traditional approaches assign single numerical values to alternatives, failing to capture the complexity of preferences where alternatives remainmain incomparable due to conflicting criteria across multiple dimensions. Our method maps each alternative to a zonotope, a convex geometric object in \(\mathbb{R}^m\) formed by Minkowski sums of intervals, which encapsulates the multidimensional structure of preferences with mathematical rigor. The set-valued nature of these payoffs stems from multiple sources, including non-probabilistic uncertainty, such as imprecise utility evaluation due to incomplete information about criteria weights, and probabilistic uncertainty arising from stochastic decision environments. By decomposing preference relations into interval orders and utilizing an extended set difference operator, we establish a rigorous axiomatization that defines preference as one alternative's zonotope differing from another's within the non-negative orthant of \(\mathbb{R}^m\). This framework generalizes existing representations and provides a visually intuitive and theoretically robust tool for modeling trade-offs among each dimension, while preferences are incomparable.</description>
