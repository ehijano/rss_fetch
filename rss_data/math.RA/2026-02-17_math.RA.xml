      <title>Separable functors and firm modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of separable ring extensions and separable functors for nonunital rings in the setting of firm modules. We prove nonunital analogues of classical results on functorial separability and semisimplicity, and apply these results to obtain a locally unital version of Maschke's theorem for group rings.</description>

      <title>PI Artin--Schelter regular algebras of dimension 3 are unique factorization rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that all noetherian PI Artin--Schelter regular algebras of dimension $3$ are unique factorization rings. In a certain sense, this result is a noncommutative analogue to the fact that regular local rings of dimension 3 are UFDs. The fact constitutes a crucial component in the proof of the assertion that all regular local rings are UFDs, known as the Auslander--Buchsbaum theorem.</description>

      <title>Similarity Algebra: A Framework for Approximate Algebraic and Lie Structures with Collapse to Classical Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical algebraic structures require exact satisfaction of their defining axioms. We propose similarity algebra, a framework extending algebraic and Lie structures to settings where operations satisfy quantitative bounds up to a tolerance $\varepsilon$. Instead of strict associativity, inverses, or distributivity, we study families of operations controlled by explicit $\varepsilon$-estimates and analyze their behavior under limit collapse.
  Under uniform error control and $C^1_{\mathrm{loc}}$ convergence of the structure maps, we prove a general collapse theorem showing that similarity structures converge to classical algebraic objects, as $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$. We develop a hierarchy of approximate structures, including similarity groups, rings, fields, vector spaces, and Lie groups, formalized through axioms satisfied within metric distance $\varepsilon$. We further define a category of similarity algebras governing morphisms between approximate systems. Moreover, we clarify the relationship between similarity algebra and fuzzy algebra, showing that the former generalizes the latter. The proposed similarity algebra can be useful to model real-world phenomena where operations or relations are inherently approximate.</description>

      <title>The algebraic and geometric classification of noncommutative Jordan superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The algebraic and geometric classifications of complex $3$-dimensional noncommutative Jordan superalgebras are given. In particular, we obtain the algebraic and geometric classification of $3$-dimensional Kokoris and standard superalgebras, and, due to one-to-one correspondences between suitable superalgebras, we have classifications for generic Poisson-Jordan and generic Poisson superalgebras. As a byproduct, we have the algebraic and geometric classification of the variety of $3$-dimensional anticommutative superalgebras and its principal subvarieties: Lie, Malcev, binary Lie, Tortkara, anticommutative $\mathfrak{CD}$-, $\mathfrak{s}_4$-, anticommutative terminal superalgebras, anticommutative conservative and anticommutative quasi-conservative $\big($rigid$\big)$ superalgebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces and studies the higher-order group inverse in a ring. We extend known properties of the higher-order group inverse from complex matrices to elements of a ring and, in the process, derive new results. We further characterize when a ring element can be expressed as the sum of a higher-order group element and a nilpotent element.</description>

      <title>Rings in which the square of a unit is the sum of 1 and an element from $\sqrt{J(R)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through this paper, we study the rings in which every unit's square is an element of the set $1+\sqrt{J(R)}$, and call them $2-\sqrt{J}U$ rings. Here, $\sqrt{J(R)}=\{x \in R: x^m \in J(R)$ for some $m \geq 1 \}$. We show that every $UU,~UJ,~2-UU,~2-UJ$ and $\sqrt{J}U$ ring is a $2-\sqrt{J}U$ ring. After exploring the basic properties, we show that the corner ring and unit closed subring of a $2-\sqrt{J}U$ ring are also $2-\sqrt{J}U$ rings. The ring of all $n\times n$ matrix rings for any $n&gt;1$ is never a $2-\sqrt{J}U$ ring. We have focused on several other matrix extensions and group rings.</description>

      <title>Rings whose Non-Units are a Unit Multiple of an Element from $\sqrt{\Delta(R)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces and studies a new class of rings called {\it $U\sqrt{\Delta}$-rings}. A ring $R$ is $U\sqrt{\Delta}$ if every non-unit element can be written as the product of a unit and an element from $\sqrt{\Delta(R)}$, where $\sqrt{\Delta(R)}$ consists of elements some power of which lies in the special subring $\Delta(R)$. We establish certain basic properties of these rings and, concretely, prove that they are simultaneously indecomposable and Dedekind-finite. We also show that the polynomial ring $R[x]$ and the Laurent polynomial ring $R[x, x^{-1}]$ are never $U\sqrt{\Delta}$-rings, while the power series ring $R[[x]]$ inherits this property from $R$. Likewise, for left (right) Artinian rings, the conditions of being a $U\sqrt{\Delta}$-ring and a $UN$-ring are equivalent, as well as these two conditions are preserved for the full matrix ring $M_n(R)$ of size $n\geq 1$ over $R$. In addition, for a commutative ring $R$, $M_n(R)$ is a $U\sqrt{\Delta}$-ring exactly when $R$ is local. Furthermore, we characterize when a group ring $RG$ is a $U\sqrt{\Delta}$-ring showing that, for a locally solvable group $G$, this occurs precisely when $R$ is a $U\sqrt{\Delta}$-ring and $G$ is a locally finite $p$-group for some prime $p \in J(R)$.</description>

      <title>Weakly $\sqrt{J}U$ Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the so-called {\it weakly $\sqrt{J}U$ rings} (hereafter abbreviated as {\it $W\sqrt{J}U$ rings} for short), in which every unit is of the form $j+1$ or $j-1$ for some $j$ in $\sqrt{J(R)} : = \{x \in R : x^n \in J(R) \text{ for some } n\ge 1\}$. This class of rings non-trivially generalizes the classes of $\sqrt{J}U$, $UU$, $JU$, $WUU$ and $WJU$ rings, respectively. We investigate their basic properties showing that they are Dedekind-finite, that $M_n(R)$ is never $W\sqrt{J}U$ for $n\ge 2$, and that when $\operatorname{char}(R)&gt;0$ it must be equal to $2^\alpha 3^\beta$ for some $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{N} \cup \left\{ 0 \right\}$. Moreover, for group rings $RG$, we prove that if $RG$ is $W\sqrt{J}U$, then $R$ is $W\sqrt{J}U$ and $G$ is a torsion group. In addition, when $R$ has positive characteristic and $G$ is a locally finite $p$-group, we give a complete characterization like this: $RG$ is a $W\sqrt{J}U$ ring if, and only if, either $R$ is a $\sqrt{J}U$ ring and $G$ is a $2$-group, or $R$ is a $W\sqrt{J}U$ ring with $3\in J(R)$ and $G$ is a $3$-group, or $R\cong R_1\times R_2$ with $R_1$ a $\sqrt{J}U$ ring, $R_2$ a $W\sqrt{J}U$ ring and $G$ a trivial group. 
  Our results substantially improve on recent achievements due to Saini and Udar in Czech. Math. J. (2025).</description>

      <title>Semigroups from full lattices in commutative ${\mathbb Q}$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The full lattices in a finite dimensional commutative ${\mathbb Q}$-algebra form a commutative semigroup. In the case of an algebraic number field the top part of a certain quotient semigroup is the class group. For a separable algebra some basic results, especially the Jordan-Zassenhaus theorem, are known for this quotient semigroup. This paper considers also algebras which are not separable. It studies the commutative semigroup of full lattices in such an algebra and also the quotient semigroup. This leads in this commutative, but not separable situation to a certain extension of the Jordan-Zassenhaus theorem. One application concerns $GL_n({\mathbb Z})$-conjugacy classes of regular integer $n\times n$ matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constraint satisfaction problems are computational problems that naturally appear in many areas of theoretical computer science. One of the central themes is their computational complexity, and in particular the border between polynomial-time tractability and NP-hardness. In this course we introduce the universal-algebraic approach to study the computational complexity of finite-domain CSPs. The course covers in particular the cyclic terms and bounded width theorems. To keep the presentation accessible, we start the course in the tangible setting of directed graphs and graph homomorphism problems.</description>

      <title>Triangulated categories with a compact silting object, Brown-Comenetz duality and Brown representability theorems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a dual framework for Neeman's results concerning triangulated categories with compact silting objects by employing Brown--Comenetz duality. This framework introduces an intrinsic non-compact subcategory, provides its characterization, and demonstrates representability theorems for both the low-bounded and bounded subcategories. Additionally, it elucidates how recollements are restricted to short exact sequences on the dual (non-compact) side. Several localization results and specific applications are also derived.</description>

      <title>Actions of Lie 2-algebras and comomentum maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the notion of a 2-action of a Lie 2-algebra on an arbitrary manifold M. Furthermore, in [Rog12], given a n-plectic manifold (M, $\omega$), the authors consider a Lie Infinity-algebra L$\infty$ (M, $\omega$), which is a higher analogue of the Poisson algebra of observables associated to a symplectic manifold. This Lie Infinity-algebra reduces to a Lie 2-algebra L^2 (M, $\omega$) when (M, $\omega$) is 2-plectic. Following ideas of N.L. Delgado [Del18], we introduce the Lie 2-algebra D^2 (M, $\omega$), which generalises the Lie 2-algebra L^2 (M, $\omega$) and its extension containing Hamiltonian pairs. Given a two-plectic manifold (M, $\omega$) and a Lie 2-algebra g_1 $\oplus$ g_0 acting on M we define a comomentum map as a lift of the action, i.e., as a Lie 2-algebra morphism from g_1 $\oplus$ g_0 to the extension of the Lie 2-algebra D^2 (M, $\omega$). In an appendix, we discuss very explicitly numerous examples, classified according to their algebraic properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain formulae for the minimum transformation degrees of the most well-studied families of finite diagram monoids, including the partition, Brauer, Temperley--Lieb and Motzkin monoids. For example, the partition monoid $P_n$ has degree $1 + \frac{B(n+2)-B(n+1)+B(n)}2$ for $n\geq2$, where these are Bell numbers. The proofs involve constructing explicit faithful representations of the minimum degree, many of which can be realised as (partial) actions on projections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A group grading on a semisimple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero is special if its identity component is zero; it is pure if at least one of its components, other than the identity component, contains a Cartan subalgebra. We classify special pure gradings on Lie algebras of types $E_6$, $E_7$, $E_8$ up to equivalence and up to isomorphism. To this end, we use quadratic forms over the field of two elements to show that there are exactly three equivalence classes for $E_6$, four for $E_7$, and five for $E_8$. The computation of the corresponding Weyl groups and their actions on the universal groups yields a set of invariants that allow us to distinguish the isomorphism classes.</description>

      <title>Fuchs' problem for linear groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Which groups can occur as the group of units in a ring? Such groups are called realizable. Though the realizable members of several classes of groups have been determined (e.g., cyclic, odd order, alternating, symmetric, finite simple, indecomposable abelian, and dihedral), the question remains open. The general linear groups are realizable by definition: they are the units in the corresponding matrix rings. In this paper, we study the realizability of two closely related linear groups, the special linear groups and the affine general linear groups. We determine which special linear groups of degree 2 over a finite field are realizable by a finite ring, and we determine which affine general linear groups of degree 1 over a cyclic group are realizable by a finite ring. We also give partial results for certain linear groups of other degrees and for rings of characteristic zero.</description>

Abstract: The notion of faithful flatness of a module over a commutative ring is studied for two $R$-modules $M$ arising in functional analysis, where $R$ is a Banach algebra and $M$ is a Hilbert space. The following results are shown:
  If $X$ is a locally compact Hausdorff topological space, and $\mu$ is a positive Radon measure on $X$, then $L^2(X,\mu)$ is a flat $L^\infty(X,\mu)$-module.
  Moreover:
  (1) If $\mu$ is $\sigma$-finite, then for every finitely generated, nonzero, proper ideal $\mathfrak{n}$ of $L^\infty(X,\mu)$, there holds $\mathfrak{n}L^2(X,\mu)\subsetneq L^2(X,\mu)$.
  (2) If $X$ is the union of an increasing family of Borel sets $U_n$, $n\in \mathbb{N}$, such that for each $n\in \mathbb{N}$, $\overline{U_n}$ is compact and $\mu(U_{n+1}\setminus U_n)&gt;0$, then $L^2(X,\mu)$ is not a faithfully flat $L^\infty(X,\mu)$-module.
  It is shown that the Hardy space $H^2$ is a flat, but not a faithfully flat $H^\infty$-module (answering a 2005 question of Alban Quadrat).</description>

      <title>On the equivalence between the existence of $n$-kernels and $n$-cokernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an elementary proof of the statement that if an idempotent complete preadditive category has weak kernels and weak cokernels, then it has $n$-kernels if and only if it has $n$-cokernels, where $n$ is a nonnegative integer. As a consequence, elementary proofs of two results concerning the equality between the global dimensions of certain right and left module categories are obtained.</description>

      <title>Higher torsion classes, $\tau_d$-tilting theory and silting complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Initiated in work by Adachi, Iyama and Reiten, the area known as $\tau$-tilting theory plays a fundamental role in contemporary representation theory. In this paper we explore a higher-dimensional analogue of this theory, formulated with respect to the higher Auslander-Reiten translation $\tau_d$. In particular, we associate to any functorially finite $d$-torsion class a maximal $\tau_d$-rigid pair and a $(d+1)$-term silting complex. In the case $d=1$, the notions of maximal $\tau_d$-rigid and support $\tau$-tilting pairs coincide, and our theory recovers the classical bijections. However, the proof strategies for $d&gt;1$ differ significantly. As an intermediate step, we prove that a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of a module category induces a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of the category of $(d+1)$-term complexes, producing novel examples of $d$-exact categories. We introduce the notion of a $d$-torsion class in the exact setup, and use this to obtain the aforementioned $(d+1)$-term silting complex. We moreover apply our theory to study $d$-APR tilting modules and slices. To illustrate our results, we provide explicit combinatorial descriptions of maximal $\tau_d$-rigid pairs and $(d+1)$-term silting complexes for higher Auslander and higher Nakayama algebras.</description>
