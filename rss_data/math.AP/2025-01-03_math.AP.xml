      <title>Sharp threshold of scattering versus non-scattering for some mass-sub-critical inhomogeneous NLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the long time asymptotic behavior of some inhomogeneous non-linear Schr\"odinger type equations. We give sharp a threshold of scattering versus non-scattering of mass solutions, depending on the source term. This work complements the literature to the inhomogeneous regime.</description>

      <title>Overview of the proof of the exterior stability of the $(1+3)$-Minkowski space-time governed by the Einstein-Yang-Mills system in the Lorenz gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Einstein-Yang-Mills system in both the Lorenz and harmonic gauges, where the Yang-Mills fields are valued in any arbitrary Lie algebra $\cal G$, associated to any compact Lie group $G$. This gives a system of hyperbolic partial partial differential that does not satisfy the null condition and that has new complications that are not present for the Einstein vacuum equations nor for the Einstein-Maxwell system. We prove the exterior stability of the Minkowski space-time, $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$, governed by the fully coupled Einstein-Yang-Mills system in the Lorenz gauge, valued in any arbitrary Lie algebra $\cal G$, without any assumption of spherical symmetry. We start with an arbitrary sufficiently small initial data, defined in a suitable energy norm for the perturbations of the Yang-Mills potential and of the Minkowski space-time, and we show the well-posedness of the Cauchy development in the exterior, and we prove that this leads to solutions converging in the Lorenz gauge and in wave coordinates to the zero Yang-Mills fields and to the Minkowski space-time. This provides a first detailed proof of the exterior stability of Minkowski governed by the fully non-linear Einstein-Yang-Mills equations in the Lorenz gauge, by using a null frame decomposition that was first used by H. Lindblad and I. Rodnianski for the case of the Einstein vacuum equations. We note that in contrast to the much simpler case of the Einstein-Maxwell equations where one can omit the potential, in fact in the non-abelian case of the Einstein-Yang-Mills equations, the question of stability, or non-stability, is a purely gauge dependent statement and the partial differential equations depend on the gauge on the Yang-Mills potential that is needed to write up the equations.</description>

      <title>Second Order Spectral Estimates and Symmetry Breaking for Rotating Wave Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider rotating wave solutions of the nonlinear wave equation \[ \left\{ \begin{aligned} \partial_{t}^2 v - \Delta v + m v &amp; = |v|^{p-2} v \quad &amp;&amp; \text{in $\mathbb{R} \times \textbf{B}$} \\ v &amp; = 0 &amp;&amp; \text{on $\mathbb{R} \times \partial \textbf{B}$} \end{aligned} \right. \] for $2&lt;p&lt;\infty$, $m \in \mathbb{R}$ on the unit disk $\textbf{B} \subset \mathbb{R}^2$. This leads to the study of a reduced equation involving the elliptic-hyperbolic operator $L_\alpha = -\Delta + \alpha^2 \partial_{\theta}^2$ with $\alpha&gt;1$. We find that the structure of the spectrum of $L_\alpha$ strongly depends on the quantity \[ \sigma = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{\alpha^2- 1} - \arccos \frac{1}{\alpha}} &gt; 0 . \] By giving precise estimates for certain sequences of Bessel function zeros, we can classify the spectrum for all $\alpha&gt;1$ such that $\sigma$ is rational and further find that the existence of accumulation points explicitly depends on arithmetic properties of $\sigma$. Using these characterizations, we deduce existence and symmetry breaking results for ground state solutions of the reduced equation, extending known results.</description>

      <title>On elliptic equations with N-independent stable operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the positive solutions of the semilinear elliptic equation \begin{align*} \sum^{N}_{i=1}\left(-\partial_{ii}\right)^{s}u=u^{p} \end{align*} with one-dimensional symmetric $2s$-stable operators. Firstly, in the whole space $\R^{N}$, we establish the nonexistence of positive supersolutions for $1&lt;p\leq\frac{N}{N-2s}$. Furthermore, the symmetry of positive solutions is obtained when $p&gt;\frac{N}{N-2s}$. It is crucial for these solutions to exhibit suitable decay at infinity to compensate for the absence of the Kelvin transform. Notably, while these solutions are symmetric, they are not radially symmetric due to the non-rotational invariance of the operator involved. Next, in the half space $\R_{+}^{N}$, we observe the nonexistence of positive supersolutions in the region $1&lt;p\leq\frac{N+s}{N-s}$. Additionally, we find that positive solutions with appropriate decay for the Dirichlet boundary problem do not exist. Finally, we present the symmetry of positive solutions in the unit ball $B_{1}$.</description>

      <title>Momentum-based minimization of the Ginzburg-Landau functional on Euclidean spaces and graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the momentum-based minimization of a diffuse perimeter functional on Euclidean spaces and on graphs with applications to semi-supervised classification tasks in machine learning. While the gradient flow in the task at hand is a parabolic partial differential equation, the momentum-method corresponds to a damped hyperbolic PDE, leading to qualitatively and quantitatively different trajectories. Using a convex-concave splitting-based FISTA-type time discretization, we demonstrate empirically that momentum can lead to faster convergence if the time step size is large but not too large. With large time steps, the PDE analysis offers only limited insight into the geometric behavior of solutions and typical hyperbolic phenomena like loss of regularity are not be observed in sample simulations.</description>

      <title>Localization of bubbling for high order nonlinear equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the asymptotic pointwise behavior of families of solutions to the high-order critical equation $$P_\alpha u_\alpha=\Delta_g^k u_\alpha+\hbox{lot}=|u_\alpha|^{2^\star-2-\epsilon_\alpha} u_\alpha\hbox{ in }M$$ that behave like $$u_\alpha=u_0+B_\alpha+o(1)\hbox{ in }H_k^2(M)$$ where $B=(B_\alpha)_\alpha$ is a Bubble, also called a Peak. We give obstructions for such a concentration to occur: depending on the dimension, they involve the mass of the associated Green's function or the difference between $P_\alpha$ and the conformally invariant GJMS operator. The bulk of this analysis is the proof of the pointwise control \begin{equation*} |u_\alpha(x)|\leq C\Vert u_0\Vert_\infty^{(2^\star-1)^2}+C\left(\frac{\mu_\alpha^{2}}{\mu_\alpha^{2 }+d_g(x,x_\alpha)^{2 }}\right)^{\frac{n-2k}{2}}\hbox{ for all }x\in M\hbox{ and }\alpha\in\mathbb{N}, \end{equation*} where $|u_\alpha(x_\alpha)|=\max_M|u_\alpha|\to +\infty$ and $\mu_\alpha:=|u_\alpha(x_\alpha)|^{-\frac{2}{n-2k}}$. The key to obtain this estimate is a sharp control of the Green's function for elliptic operators involving a Hardy potential.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Minkowski problem associated with the solution to the anisotropic $p$-Laplacian (or Finsler $p$-Laplacian) equation, namely, the Minkowski problem of anisotropic $p$-torsional rigidity. The sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of a solution to the anisotropic $p$-torsional rigidity Minkowski problem are presented. Meanwhile, the existence of a solution to the log-Minkowski problem of anisotropic $p$-torsional rigidity without symmetry assumptions is solved.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Dissipation, Taylor Dispersion, and Inviscid Damping of Couette flow in the Boussinesq system on the Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the quantitative asymptotic stability of the stably stratified Couette flow solution to the 2D fully dissipative nonlinear Boussinesq system on $\mathbb{R}^2$ with large Richardson number $R &gt; 1/4$, viscosity $\nu$ and density dissipation $\kappa$. For an initial perturbation $(\omega_{in}, \theta_{in})$ of size $\mu^{1/2 + \epsilon}$ in a low-order anisotropic Sobolev space, for $\mu$ roughly $\min(\nu, \kappa)\left(1 - O(1/\sqrt{R})\right)$ and $\nu$, $\kappa$ comparable, we demonstrate asymptotic stability with explicit enhanced dissipation and Taylor dispersion rates of decay. We also give inviscid damping estimates on the velocity $u$ and the density $\theta$. This is the first result of its type for the Boussinesq system on the fully unbounded domain $\mathbb{R}^2$. We also translate some known linear results from $\mathbb{T} \times \mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}^2$, and we give an alternative theorem for the nonlinear result.</description>

      <title>The Existence of Anomalous Dissipation over Bounded Interior Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A striking feature of three-dimensional turbulence is the presence of anomalous dissipation, or that the mean rate of energy dissipation is bounded below by a positive number in the inviscid limit. In this paper, we establish two results. First, we find sufficient conditions on the regularity of the viscous solutions which guarantee the absence of anomalous dissipation. Moreover, the approach is novel and is independent of whether the domain is bounded or not as well as the kind of boundary condition. Second, we construct an example of a fully three-dimensional flow within a bounded domain that exhibits anomalous dissipation.</description>

      <title>Longtime behaviors of a reducible cooperative system with nonlocal diffusions and free boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims at understanding the longtime behaviors of a reducible cooperative system with nonlocal diffusions and different free boundaries, describing the interactions of two mutually beneficial species. Compared with the irreducible and monostable cooperative system, the system we care about here has many nonnegative steady states, leading to much different and rich longtime behaviors. Moreover, since the possible nonnegative steady states on half space are non-constant, we need to employ more detailed analysis to understand the corresponding steady state problems which in turn helps us to derive a complete classification for the longtime behaviors of our problem. The spreading speeds of free boundaries and more accurate limits of $(u,v)$ as $t\to\infty$ are also discussed, and accelerated spreading can happen if some threshold conditions are violated by kernel functions.</description>

      <title>Wiener-type Criterion for the Removability of the Fundamental Singularity for the Heat Equation and its Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the necessary and sufficient condition for the removability of the fundamental singularity, and equivalently for the unique solvability of the singular Dirichlet problem for the heat equation. In the measure-theoretical context the criterion determines whether the $h$-parabolic measure of the singularity point is null or positive. From the probabilistic point of view, the criterion presents an asymptotic law for conditional Brownian motion. In {\it U.G. Abdulla, J Math Phys, 65, 121503 (2024)} the Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-type test was established. Here we prove a new Wiener-type criterion for the "geometric" characterization of the removability of the fundamental singularity for arbitrary open sets in terms of the fine-topological thinness of the complementary set near the singularity point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes review the theory of Fisher information, especially its use in kinetic theory of gases and plasmas. The recent monotonicity theorem by Guillen--Silvestre for the Landau--Coulomb equation is put in perspective and generalised. Following my joint work with Imbert and Silvestre, it is proven that Fisher information is decaying along the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation, for all relevant interactions, and from this the once longstanding problem of regularity estimates for very singular collision kernels (very soft potentials) is solved.</description>

      <title>Optimal constants of smoothing estimates for the Dirac equation in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give optimal constants of smoothing estimates for the $d$-dimensional free Dirac equation for any $d \geq 2$. Our main abstract theorem shows that the optimal constant $C$ of smoothing estimate associated with a spatial weight $w$ and smoothing function $\psi$ is given by $(2\pi)^{d-1} C = \sup_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \sup_{r &gt; 0} \widetilde{\lambda}_k(r)$, where $\{ \widetilde{\lambda}_k \}$ is a certain sequence of functions defined via integral formulae involving $(w, \psi)$. This is an analogue of a similar result for Schr\"{o}dinger equations given by Bez--Saito--Sugimoto (2015), and also extends previous results of Ikoma (2022) and Ikoma--Suzuki (2024) for $d=2, 3$ to any dimensions $d \geq 2$. In order to prove this, we establish a modified version of the spherical harmonics decomposition of $L^2(\mathbb{S}^{d-1})$, which suits well with the Dirac operator and allows us to find optimal constants. Furthermore, using our abstract theorem, we give explicit values of optimal constants associated with typical examples of $(w, \psi)$. As it turns out, optimal constants for Dirac equations can be written explicitly in many cases, even in the cases that it is impossible for Schr\"{o}dinger equations.</description>

      <title>The Landis Conjecture For Nonlocal Elliptic Operators: Polynomial Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a unique continuation result at infinity for fully nonlinear elliptic integro-differential operators of order 2s which satisfy the maximum and minimum principles in bounded subdomains, under the decay assumption $o(|x|^{-(N+2s)})$ at infinity. Our result is new even in the case of the fractional Laplacian, as it unveils the nonlocal nature of the decay in Landis conjecture, evolving from exponential to polynomial.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the modified concavity inequality for complex Hessian equations
  under the semi-convexity assumption inspired by Lu \cite{Lu23} and Zhang \cite{Z24} for real case. Then second order estimates for admissible solutions of complex Hessian equations on compact Hermitian manifolds with both sides of equations depending on gradient terms are obtained by taking advantage of the crucial inequality.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the general $Q$-tensor model interacting with a rigid body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, the fluid-rigid body interaction problem of nematic liquid crystals described by the general Beris-Edwards $Q$-tensor model is studied. It is proved first that the total energy of this problem decreases in time. The associated mathematical problem is a quasilinear mixed-order system with moving boundary. After the transformation to a fixed domain, a monolithic approach based on the added mass operator and lifting arguments is employed to establish the maximal $L^p$-regularity of the linearized problem in an anisotropic ground space. This paves the way for the local strong well-posedness for large data and global strong well-posedness for small data of the interaction problem.</description>

      <title>Quantitative observability for the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with an anharmonic oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the observability inequalities for the Schr\"{o}dinger equation associated with an anharmonic oscillator $H=-\frac{\d^2}{\d x^2}+|x|$. We build up the observability inequality over an arbitrarily short time interval $(0,T)$, with an explicit expression for the observation constant $C_{obs}$ in terms of $T$, for some observable set that has a different geometric structure compared to those discussed in \cite{HWW}. We obtain the sufficient conditions and the necessary conditions for observable sets, respectively. We also present counterexamples to demonstrate that half-lines are not observable sets, highlighting a major difference in the geometric properties of observable sets compared to those of Schr\"{o}dinger operators $H=-\frac{\d^2}{\d x^2}+|x|^{2m}$ with $m\ge 1$.
  Our approach is based on the following ingredients: First, the use of an Ingham-type spectral inequality constructed in this paper; second, the adaptation of a quantitative unique compactness argument, inspired by the work of Bourgain-Burq-Zworski \cite{Bour13}; third, the application of the Szeg\"{o}'s limit theorem from the theory of Toeplitz matrices, which provides a new mathematical tool for proving counterexamples of observability inequalities.</description>

      <title>Jumps, cusps and fractals in the solution of the periodic linear Benjamin-Ono equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish two complementary results about the regularity of the solution of the periodic initial value problem for the linear Benjamin-Ono equation. We first give a new simple proof of the statement that, for a dense countable set of the time variable, the solution is a finite linear combination of copies of the initial condition and of its Hilbert transform. In particular, this implies that discontinuities in the initial condition are propagated in the solution as logarithmic cusps. We then show that, if the initial condition is of bounded variation (and even if it is not continuous), for almost every time the graph of the solution in space is continuous but fractal, with upper Minkowski dimension equal to 3/2. In order to illustrate this striking dichotomy, in the final section we include accurate numerical evaluations of the solution profile, as well as estimates of its box-counting dimension for two canonical choices of irrational time.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Monge-Amp\`ere eigenfunctions of general bounded convex domains are globally Lipschitz. The same result holds for convex solutions to degenerate Monge-Amp\`ere equations of the form $\det D^2 u =M|u|^p$ with zero boundary condition on general bounded convex domains in ${\mathbb R}^n$ within the sharp threshold $p&gt;n-2$. As a consequence, we obtain global $W^{2, 1}$ estimates for these solutions.</description>

      <title>On higher order isolas of unstable Stokes waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We overview the recent result [3, Theorem 1.1] about the high-frequency instability of Stokes waves subject to longitudinal perturbations. The spectral bands of unstable eigenvalues away from the origin form a sequence of {\it isolas} parameterized by an integer $ \mathtt{p} \geq 2 $ for any value of the depth $ \mathtt{h} &gt; 0 $ such that an explicit analytic function $\beta_1^{(\mathtt{p})}(\mathtt{h}) $ is not zero. In [3] it is proved that the map $ \mathtt{h} \mapsto \beta_1^{(\mathtt{p})}(\mathtt{h}) $ is not identically zero for any $ \mathtt{p} \geq 2 $ by showing that $ \lim_{\mathtt{h} \to 0^+}\beta_1^{(\mathtt{p})}(\mathtt{h}) = - \infty $. In this manuscript we compute the asymptotic expansion of $\beta_1^{(\mathtt{p})}(\mathtt{h}) $ in the deep-water limit $ \mathtt{h} \to + \infty $ -- it vanishes exponentially fast to zero -- for $\mathtt{p}=2$, $3$, $4$.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusive Central Limit Theorem for the Stochastic Burgers Equation at the critical dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Stochastic Burgers Equation (SBE) is a singular, non-linear Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) that describes, on mesoscopic scales, the fluctuations of stochastic driven diffusive systems with a conserved scalar quantity. In space dimension d = 2, the SBE is critical, being formally scale invariant under diffusive scaling. As such, it falls outside of the domain of applicability of the theories of Regularity Structures and paracontrolled calculus. In apparent contrast with the formal scale invariance, we fully prove the conjecture first appeared in [H. van Beijeren, R. Kutner, &amp; H. Spohn, Phys. Rev. Lett., 1986] according to which the 2d-SBE is logarithmically superdiffusive, i.e. its diffusion coefficient diverges like $(\log t)^{2/3}$ as $t\to\infty$, thus removing subleading diverging multiplicative corrections in [D. De Gaspari &amp; L. Haunschmid-Sibitz, Electron. J. Probab., 2024] and in [H.-T. Yau, Ann. of Math., 2004] for 2d-ASEP. We precisely identify the constant prefactor of the logarithm and show it is proportional to $\lambda^{4/3}$, for $\lambda&gt;0$ the coupling constant, which, intriguingly, turns out to be exactly the same as for the one-dimensional Stochastic Burgers/KPZ equation. More importantly, we prove that, under super-diffusive space-time rescaling, the SBE has an explicit Gaussian fixed point in the Renormalization Group sense, by deriving a superdiffusive central limit-type theorem for its solution.
  This is the first scaling limit result for a critical singular SPDE, beyond the weak coupling regime, and is obtained via a refined control, on all length-scales, of the resolvent of the generator of the SBE. We believe our methods are well-suited to study other out-of-equilibrium driven diffusive systems at the critical dimension, such as 2d-ASEP, which, we conjecture, have the same large-scale Fixed Point as SBE.</description>

      <title>The discrete inverse conductivity problem solved by the weights of an interpretable neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel neural network (NN) approach to solve the discrete inverse conductivity problem of recovering the conductivity profile on network edges from the discrete Dirichlet-to-Neumann map on a square lattice. The novelty of the approach lies in the fact that the sought-after conductivity is not provided directly as the output of the NN but is instead encoded in the weights of the post-trainig NN in the second layer. Hence the weights of the trained NN acquire a clear physical meaning, which contrasts with most existing neural network approaches, where the weights are typically not interpretable. This work represents a step toward designing NNs with interpretable post-training weights. Numerically, we observe that the method outperforms the conventional Curtis-Morrow algorithm for both noisy full and partial data.</description>

      <title>Trading linearity for ellipticity: a nonsmooth approach to Einstein's theory of gravity and the Lorentzian splitting theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Einstein's theory of gravity is formulated in a smooth setting, the celebrated singularity theorems of Hawking and Penrose describe many physical situations in which this smoothness must eventually break down. In positive-definite signature, there is a highly successful theory of metric and metric-measure geometry which includes Riemannian manifolds as a special case, but permits the extraction of nonsmooth limits under dimension and curvature bounds analogous to the energy conditions from relativity: here sectional curvature is reformulated through triangle comparison, while Ricci curvature is reformulated using entropic convexity along geodesics of probability measures.
  This lecture highlights recent progress in the development of an analogous theory in Lorentzian signature, whose ultimate goal is to provide a nonsmooth theory of gravity. In particular, we foreshadow a low-regularity splitting theorem obtained by sacrificing linearity of the d'Alembertian to recover ellipticity. We exploit a negative homogeneity $p$-d'Alembert operator for this purpose. The same technique yields a simplified proof of Eschenberg (1988), Galloway (1989), and Newman's (1990) confirmation of Yau's (1982) conjecture, bringing both Lorentzian splitting results into a framework closer to the Cheeger--Gromoll (1971) splitting theorem from Riemannian geometry.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by a paper by T. Chakradhar, K. Gittins, G. Habib and N. Peyerimhoff, we analyze their conjecture that the ground state energy of the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator tends to infinity as the magnetic field tends to infinity. More precisely, we prove refined conjectures for general two dimensional domains, based on the analysis in the case of the half-plane and the disk by two of us (B.H. and F.N.). We also extend our analysis to the three dimensional case, and explore a connection with the eigenvalue asymptotics of the magnetic Robin Laplacian.</description>

Abstract: We analyze semi-classical Schr\"odinger operators with potentials of class $C^{1,1/2}$ and establish commutator estimates for the associated projection operators in Schatten norms. These are then applied to prove quantitative versions of the local and phase space Weyl laws in $L^p$ spaces. We study both non-interacting, and interacting particle systems. In particular, we are able to treat the case of the minimizers of the Hartree energy in the case of repulsive singular pair interactions such as the Coulomb potential.</description>

      <title>A simple example of the weak discontinuity of $f\mapsto \int \det \nabla f$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:1802.03066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Verifying lower-semicontinuity of integral functionals in the weak topology of Sobolev spaces is a central theme in the calculus of variations. For integral functionals with $p$-growth, quasiconvexity is a necessary condition for weak lower-semicontinuity in $W^{1,p}$, but is only sufficient if some additional conditions are met. The standard functional showing the necessity of additional conditions is $f\mapsto \int_\Omega \det \nabla f$, which fails to be weakly lower-semicontinuous. However, the known examples showing this failure are non-injective and have a lot of shear. In this short note we construct a sequence of conformal diffeomorphisms of the $d$-dimensional unit ball that converges weakly to a constant in $W^{1,d}$, showing that the weak discontinuity of this functional prevails even when restricting a space to functions which are ``as nice as possible''.</description>

      <title>Smoothing Properties of a Linearization of the Three Waves Collision Operator in the bosonic Boltzmann-Nordheim Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the kinetic theory of a three-dimensional fluid of weakly interacting bosons in a non-equilibrium state which includes both normal fluid and a condensate. More precisely, we look at the previously postulated nonlinear Boltzmann-Nordheim equations for such systems, in a spatially homogeneous state which has an isotropic momentum distribution, and we linearize the equation around an equilibrium state which has a condensate. We study the most singular part of the linearized operator coming from the three waves collision operator for supercritical initial data. The operator has two types of singularities, one of which is similar to the marginally smoothing operator defined by the symbol $\ln(1+p^2)$. Our main result in this context is that for initial data in a certain Banach space of functions satisfying a H\"{older} type condition, at least for some finite time, evolution determined by the linearized operator improves the H\"{o}lder regularity. The main difficulty in this problem arises from the combination of a point singularity and a line singularity present in the linear operator, and we have to use certain fine-tuned function spaces in order to carry out our analysis.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of the singular self-similar solutions of the fast diffusion equation and logarithmic diffusion equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10221v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $n\ge 3$, $0&lt;m&lt;\frac{n-2}{n}$, $\rho_1&gt;0$, $\eta&gt;0$, $\beta&gt;\frac{m\rho_1}{n-2-nm}$, $\alpha=\alpha_m=\frac{2\beta+\rho_1}{1-m}$, $\beta_0&gt;0$ and $\alpha_0=2\beta_0+1$. We use fixed point argument to give a new proof for the existence and uniqueness of radially symmetric singular solution $f=f^{(m)}$ of the elliptic equation $\Delta (f^m/m)+\alpha f+\beta x\cdot\nabla f=0$, $f&gt;0$, in $\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\{0\}$, satisfying $\displaystyle\lim_{|x|\to 0}|x|^{\alpha/\beta}f(x)=\eta$. We also prove the existence and uniqueness of radially symmetric singular solution $g$ of the equation $\Delta\log g+\alpha_0 g+\beta_0x\cdot\nabla g=0$, $g&gt;0$, in $\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\{0\}$, satisfying $\displaystyle\lim_{|x|\to 0}|x|^{\alpha_0/\beta_0}g(x)=\eta$. Such equations arises from the study of backward singular self-similar solution of the fast diffusion equation $u_t=\Delta u^m$ and the logarithmic diffusion equation $u_t=\Delta\log u$ respectively. We will also prove the asymptotic decay rate of the function $f$ as $|x|\to\infty$.</description>

Abstract: We prove local well-posedness for the Vlasov-Poisson-Landau system and the variant with massless electrons in a 3D periodic spatial domain for large initial data. This is accomplished by propagating weighted anisotropic L2-based Sobolev norms. In the case of the massless electron system, we also carry out an analysis of the Poincare-Poisson system. This is a companion paper to the author's previous work with Yan Guo.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10618v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Viscosity solutions to the eikonal equation |Du|g = 1, known to be exactly distance-like functions, on a non-compact complete Riemannian manifold (M,g) are crucial for understanding the underlying geometric and topological properties. In this work, we explore metric viscosity solutions, distance-like functions and their relationship on a metric space, especially on the Wasserstein space Pp(X) where X is a complete, separable, locally compact and non-compact geodesic space. Meanwhile, we provide two distinct ways to construct (strong) metric viscosity solutions on Pp(X) and study their properties.</description>

Abstract: We consider the two dimensional gravity water waves with nonzero constant vorticity in infinite depth. We show that for $s\geq \frac{3}{4}$, the water waves system is locally well-posed in $\mathcal{H}^{s}$, which is the nonzero constant vorticity counterpart of the breakthrough work of Ai-Ifrim-Tataru in [4]. It is also a $\frac{1}{4}$ improvement in Sobolev regularity compared to the previous result of Ifrim-Tataru in [17].</description>

      <title>Quantitative Hydrodynamic Stability for Couette Flow on Unbounded Domains with Navier Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a stability threshold theorem for 2D Navier-Stokes on three unbounded domains: the whole plane $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$, the half plane $\mathbb{R} \times [0,\infty)$ with Navier boundary conditions, and the infinite channel $\mathbb{R} \times [-1, 1]$ with Navier boundary conditions. Starting with the Couette shear flow, we consider initial perturbations $\omega_{in}$ which are of size $\nu^{1/2}(1+\ln(1/\nu)^{1/2})^{-1}$ in an anisotropic Sobolev space with an additional low frequency control condition for the planar cases. We then demonstrate that such perturbations exhibit inviscid damping of the velocity, as well as enhanced dissipation at $x$-frequencies $|k| \gg \nu$ with decay time-scale $O(\nu^{-1/3}|k|^{-2/3})$. On the plane and half-plane, we show Taylor dispersion for $x$-frequencies $|k| \ll \nu$ with decay time-scale $O(\nu |k|^{-2})$, while on the channel we show low frequency dispersion for $|k| \ll \nu$ with decay time-scale $O(\nu^{-1})$. Generalizing the work of arXiv:2311.00141 done on $\mathbb{T} \times [-1,1]$, the key contribution of this paper is to perform new nonlinear computations at low frequencies with wave number $|k| \lesssim \nu$ and at intermediate frequencies with wave number $\nu \lesssim |k| \leq 1$, and to provide the first enhanced dissipation result for a fully-nonlinear shear flow on an unbounded $x$-domain. Additionally, we demonstrate that the results of this paper apply equally to solutions of the perturbed $\beta$-plane equations from atmospheric dynamics.</description>

      <title>Knudsen boundary layer equations for full ranges of cutoff collision kernels: Maxwell reflection boundary with all accommodation coefficients in [0,1]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the Knudsen layer equation imposed on Maxwell reflection boundary condition with full ranges of cutoff collision kernels and accommodation coefficients (i.e., $- 3 &lt; \gamma \leq 1$ and $0 \leq \alpha_* \leq 1$, respectively) in the $L^\infty_{x,v}$ framework. Moreover, the solution enjoys the exponential decay $\exp \{- c x^\frac{2}{3 - \gamma} - c |v|^2 \}$ for some $c &gt; 0$. In order to study the general angular cutoff collision kernel $-3 &lt; \gamma \leq 1$, we should introduce a $(x,v)$-mixed weight $\sigma$. The biggest difficulty in this paper is the nondissipative boundary condition, hence, the boundary temperature and velocity $(T_w, u_w)$ on $\{ x = 0 \}$ and $(T, \mathfrak{u})$ on $\{ x = + \infty \}$ do not guarantee the nonnegativity of the $L^2$ boundary energy. We also do not assume that $(T_w, u_w)$ and $(T, \mathfrak{u})$ are very closed to each other. We first derive the Nondissipative boundary lemma to pull the boundary energy to the interior weighted $L^2$ norms with higher power of $x$-polynomial weights. Then a so-called spatial-velocity indices iteration approach is developed to shift the higher power $x$-polynomial weights to $|v|$-polynomial weights. Finally, we construct an interleaved iteration process such that the boundary energy is successfully dominated.</description>

      <title>On global dynamics of $3$-D irrotational compressible fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13649v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider global-in-time evolution of irrotational, isentropic, compressible Euler flow in $3$-D, for a broad class of $H^4$ classical Cauchy data without assuming symmetry, prescribed on an annulus surrounded by a constant state in the exterior. By giving a sufficient expansion condition on the initial data and using the nonlinear structure of the compressible Euler equations, we show that the decay rate of the first order transversal derivative of the normalized density is better than that of the same derivative of a free wave, provided that the perturbation arising from the tangential derivatives can be properly controlled for all $t$ by using a bootstrap argument. Building on this critical analysis, we construct global exterior solutions in $H^4$ for the broad class of data, with a rather general subclass forming rarefaction at null infinity. Our result does not require smallness on the transversal derivatives of classical data, thus applies to data with a total energy of any size.</description>

      <title>Long-time Asymptotics for the Ablowitz-Ladik system with present of solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the soliton resolution and Painlev\'e asymptotics for the focusing Ablowitz-Ladik system with the initial data in a discrete weighted $\ell^2$ space. First, we establish the global well-posedness of this initial-value problem, which is further reformulated as a Riemann-Hilbert problem with higher-order poles. Using Fredholm theory, the Riemann-Hilbert problem with the jump contour consisting of three circles centered around the origin is uniquely solved. Then, by performing a $\bar\partial$-nonlinear steepest descent method to the Riemann-Hilbert problem, we obtain the asymptotic approximation to the solution of the focusing Ablowitz-Ladik system for large time in different space-time regions of the $(n,t)$-half plane. In the sectors $\{(n,t): n /(2t) &lt;-M_0 \}$ and $\{(n,t): n /(2t) &gt;M_0 \}$, where $M_0$ is a positive constant, the leading order asymptotics is dominated by the solitons; while in the sector $\{(n,t): |n /(2t) -1 &lt;M_0^{-1} \}$, the long-time asymptotics is influenced by both the solitons and the oscillations; In the two transition zones $\{(n,t): |n /(2t)+1|t^{2/3} &lt;C \}$ and $\{(n,t): |n /(2t)-1|t^{2/3} &lt;C \}$ with $C$ being a positive constant, we find the Painlev\'e-type asymptotics which can be expressed in terms of the solution of the second Painlev\'e transcendents.</description>

The solution is governed by an adiabatic modulation of a Dirac operator with a variable mass. We determine the evolution of the semiclassical measure of the solution with a two-scale Wigner measure method by reducing the Dirac operator to a normal form.</description>

  Departing from an energy with a bulk term depending on the deformation gradient and its derivatives, as well as a perimeter term, the functional in question corresponds to the relaxation of this energy with respect to a pair $(\chi,u)$, where $\chi$ is the characteristic function of a set of finite perimeter and $u$ is a function of bounded hessian.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the orbital stability of smooth solitary wave solutions to the modified Camassa-Holm equation with cubic nonlinearity. These solutions, which exist on a nonzero constant background $k$, are unique up to translation for each permissible value of $k$ and wave speed. By leveraging the Hamiltonian nature of the modified Camassa-Holm equation and employing three conserved functionals-comprising an energy and two Casimirs, we establish orbital stability through an analysis of the Vakhitov-Kolokolov condition. This stability pertains to perturbations of the momentum variable in $H^1(\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish an infinite hierarchy of finite-time gradient catastrophes for smooth solutions of the 1D Euler equations of gas dynamics with non-constant entropy. Specifically, for all integers $n\geq 1$, we prove that there exist classical solutions, emanating from smooth, compressive, and non-vacuous initial data, which form a cusp-type gradient singularity in finite time, in which the gradient of the solution has precisely $C^{0,\frac{1}{2n+1}}$ H\"older-regularity. We show that such Euler solutions are codimension-$(2n-2)$ stable in the Sobolev space $W^{2n+2,\infty}$.</description>

We develop a comprehensive solution theory that includes strong existence, path-by-path uniqueness, existence of a solution flow of diffeomorphisms, Malliavin differentiability and $\rho$-irregularity. As a consequence, we can also treat McKean-Vlasov, transport and continuity equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the smooth action of a connected compact Lie group $G$, we establish the chain isomorphism between the $G$-invariant Witten instanton complex and the $G$-invariant Thom-Smale complex, both of which are associated to a specific Morse-Bott function on a closed oriented $G$-manifold. This result includes the influence from the horizontal direction around the critical set, generalizing the strict Morse case.</description>

      <title>Pauli Hamiltonians with an Aharonov-Bohm Flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11971v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a two-dimensional Pauli operator describing a charged quantum particle with spin $1/2$ moving on a plane in presence of an orthogonal Aharonov-Bohm magnetic flux. We classify all the admissible self-adjont realizations and give a complete picture of their spectral and scattering properties. Symmetries of the resulting Hamiltonians are also discussed, as well as their connection with the Dirac operator perturbed by an Aharonov-Bohm singularity.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations of the $\Phi^4_3$ Measure via Stochastic Quantisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\Phi^4_3$ measure is one of the easiest non-trivial examples of a Euclidean quantum field theory (EQFT) whose rigorous construction in the 1970's has been one of the celebrated achievements of constructive quantum field theory. In recent years, progress in the field of singular stochastic PDEs, initiated by the theory of regularity structures, has allowed for a new construction of the $\Phi^4_3$ EQFT as the invariant measure of a previously ill-posed Langevin dynamics, a strategy originally proposed by Parisi and Wu ('81) under the name stochastic quantisation. We apply the same methodology to obtain a large deviation principle (LDP) for the family of periodic $\Phi^4_3$ measures at varying temperature. In addition, we show that the rate functional of the LDP and the $\Phi^4_3$ action functional coincide up to a constant. We wish to highlight that while our main result had previously been obtained by Barashkov (2022), the main focus of this work is on the approach through the stochastic quantisation equation.</description>

      <title>Critical axis of Ruelle resonances for Anosov flow with a potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04948v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine methods from microlocal analysis and dimension theory to study resonances with largest real part for an Anosov flow with smooth real valued potential. We show that the resonant states are closely related to special systems of measures supported on the stable manifolds introduced by Climenhaga. As a result, we relate the presence of the resonances on the critical axis to mixing properties of the flow with respect to certain equilibrium measures and show that these equilibrium measures can be reconstructed from the spectral theory of the Anosov flow.</description>

      <title>Dimension-independent functional inequalities by tensorization and projection arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study stability under tensorization and projection-type operations of gradient-type estimates and other functional inequalities for Markov semigroups on metric spaces. Using transportation-type inequalities obtained by F. Baudoin and N. Eldredge in 2021, we prove that constants in the gradient estimates can be chosen to be independent of the dimension. Our results are applicable to hypoelliptic diffusions on sub-Riemannian manifolds and some hypocoercive diffusions. As a byproduct, we obtain dimension-independent reverse Poincar\'{e}, reverse logarithmic Sobolev, and gradient bounds for Lie groups with a transverse symmetry and for non-isotropic Heisenberg groups.</description>

      <title>An H-theorem for a conditional McKean-Vlasov process related to interacting diffusions on regular trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of the $\kappa$-Markov local-field equation ($\kappa$-MLFE), which is a conditional McKean-Vlasov equation associated with interacting diffusions on the $\kappa$-regular tree. Under suitable assumptions on the coefficients, we prove well-posedness of the $\kappa$-MLFE. We also establish an H-theorem by identifying an energy functional, referred to as the sparse free energy, whose derivative along the measure flow of the $\kappa$-MLFE is given by a nonnegative functional that can be viewed as a modified Fisher information. Moreover, we show that the zeros of the latter functional coincide with the set of stationary distributions of the $\kappa$-MLFE and are also marginals of splitting Gibbs measures on the $\kappa$-regular tree. Furthermore, we show that for a natural class of initial conditions, the corresponding measure flow converges to one of the stationary distributions, thus demonstrating that the sparse free energy acts as a global Lyapunov function. Under mild additional conditions, in the case $\kappa = 2$ we prove that the sparse free energy arises naturally as the renormalized limit of certain relative entropies. We exploit this characterization to prove a modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality and establish an exponential rate of convergence of the $2$-MLFE measure flow to its unique stationary distribution.</description>

      <title>Quantum tunneling and its absence in deep wells and strong magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new results on quantum tunneling between deep potential wells, in the presence of a strong constant magnetic field. We construct a family of double well potentials containing examples for which the low-energy eigenvalue splitting vanishes, and hence quantum tunneling is eliminated. Further, by deforming within this family, the magnetic ground state can be made to transition from symmetric to anti-symmetric. However, for typical double wells in a certain regime, tunneling is not suppressed, and we provide a lower bound for the eigenvalue splitting.</description>
