      <title>Improving the communication in decentralized manifold optimization through single-step consensus and compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with decentralized optimization over a compact submanifold, where the loss functions of local datasets are defined by their respective local datasets. A key challenge in decentralized optimization is mitigating the communication bottleneck, which primarily involves two strategies: achieving consensus and applying communication compression. Existing projection/retraction-type algorithms rely on multi-step consensus to attain both consensus and optimality. Due to the nonconvex nature of the manifold constraint, it remains an open question whether the requirement for multi-step consensus can be reduced to single-step consensus. We address this question by carefully elaborating on the smoothness structure and the asymptotic 1-Lipschitz continuity associated with the manifold constraint. Furthermore, we integrate these insights with a communication compression strategy to propose a communication-efficient gradient algorithm for decentralized manifold optimization problems, significantly reducing per-iteration communication costs. Additionally, we establish an iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ to find an $\epsilon$-stationary point, which matches the complexity in the Euclidean setting. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Zeroth-Order Katyusha: An Accelerated Derivative-Free Method for Composite Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate accelerated zeroth-order algorithms for smooth composite convex optimization problems. While for unconstrained optimization, existing methods that merge 2-point zeroth-order gradient estimators with first-order frameworks usually lead to satisfactory performance, for constrained/composite problems, there is still a gap in the complexity bound that is related to the non-vanishing variance of the 2-point gradient estimator near an optimal point. To bridge this gap, we propose the Zeroth-Order Loopless Katyusha (ZO-L-Katyusha) algorithm, leveraging the variance reduction as well as acceleration techniques from the first-order loopless Katyusha algorithm. We show that ZO-L-Katyusha is able to achieve accelerated linear convergence for compositve smooth and strongly convex problems, and has the same oracle complexity as the unconstrained case. Moreover, the number of function queries to construct a zeroth-order gradient estimator in ZO-L-Katyusha can be made to be O(1) on average. These results suggest that ZO-L-Katyusha provides a promising approach towards bridging the gap in the complexity bound for zeroth-order composite optimization.</description>

      <title>Projection onto hyperbolicity cones and beyond: a dual Frank-Wolfe approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the problem of projecting a point onto an arbitrary hyperbolicity cone from both theoretical and numerical perspectives. While hyperbolicity cones are furnished with a generalization of the notion of eigenvalues, obtaining closed form expressions for the projection operator as in the case of semidefinite matrices is an elusive endeavour. To address that we propose a Frank-Wolfe method to handle this task and, more generally, strongly convex optimization over closed convex cones. One of our innovations is that the Frank-Wolfe method is actually applied to the dual problem and, by doing so, subproblems can be solved in closed-form using minimum eigenvalue functions and conjugate vectors. To test the validity of our proposed approach, we present numerical experiments where we check the performance of alternative approaches including interior point methods and an earlier accelerated gradient method proposed by Renegar. We also show numerical examples where the hyperbolic polynomial has millions of monomials. Finally, we also discuss the problem of projecting onto p-cones which, although not hyperbolicity cones in general, are still amenable to our techniques.</description>

      <title>A multiscale Consensus-Based algorithm for multi-level optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel multiscale consensus-based optimization (CBO) algorithm for solving bi- and tri-level optimization problems is introduced. Existing CBO techniques are generalized by the proposed method through the employment of multiple interacting populations of particles, each of which is used to optimize one level of the problem. These particle populations are evolved through multiscale-in-time dynamics, which are formulated as a singularly perturbed system of stochastic differential equations. Theoretical convergence analysis for the multiscale CBO model to an averaged effective dynamics as the time-scale separation parameter approaches zero is provided. The resulting algorithm is presented for both bi-level and tri-level optimization problems. The effectiveness of the approach in tackling complex multi-level optimization tasks is demonstrated through numerical experiments on various benchmark functions. Additionally, it is shown that the proposed method performs well on min-max optimization problems, comparing favorably with existing CBO algorithms for saddle point problems.</description>

      <title>CAACS: A Carbon Aware Ant Colony System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an era where sustainability is becoming increasingly crucial, we introduce a new Carbon-Aware Ant Colony System (CAACS) Algorithm that addresses the Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (GTSP) while minimizing carbon emissions. This novel approach leverages the natural efficiency of ant colony pheromone trails to find optimal routes, balancing both environmental and economic objectives. By integrating sustainability into transportation models, CAACS provides a powerful tool for real-world applications, including network design, delivery route planning, and commercial aircraft logistics. Our algorithm's unique bi-objective optimization advances the study of sustainable transportation solutions.</description>

      <title>A new approach to principal-agent problems with volatility control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent work by Cvitani\'c, Possama\"i, and Touzi (2018) [9] presents a general approach for continuous-time principal-agent problems, through dynamic programming and second-order backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). In this paper, we provide an alternative formulation of the principal-agent problem, which can be solved simply by relying on the theory of BSDEs. This reformulation is strongly inspired by an important remark in [9], namely that if the principal observes the output process in continuous-time, she can compute its quadratic variation pathwise. While in [9], this information is used in the contract, our reformulation consists in assuming that the principal could directly control this process, in a `first-best' fashion. The resolution approach for this alternative problem actually follows the line of the so-called `Sannikov's trick' in the literature on continuous-time principal-agent problems, as originally introduced by Sannikov (2008) [28]. We then show that the solution to this `first-best' formulation is identical to the solution of the original problem. More precisely, using the contract form introduced in [9] as `penalisation contracts', we highlight that this `first-best' scenario can be achieved even if the principal cannot directly control the quadratic variation. Nevertheless, we do not have to rely on the theory of 2BSDEs to prove that such contracts are optimal, as their optimality is ensured by showing that the `first-best' scenario is achieved. We believe that this more straightforward approach to solve continuous-time principal-agent problems with volatility control will facilitate the dissemination of these problems across many fields, and its extension to even more intricate problems.</description>

      <title>PID Accelerated Temporal Difference Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-horizon tasks, which have a large discount factor, pose a challenge for most conventional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Algorithms such as Value Iteration and Temporal Difference (TD) learning have a slow convergence rate and become inefficient in these tasks. When the transition distributions are given, PID VI was recently introduced to accelerate the convergence of Value Iteration using ideas from control theory. Inspired by this, we introduce PID TD Learning and PID Q-Learning algorithms for the RL setting in which only samples from the environment are available. We give theoretical analysis of their convergence and acceleration compared to their traditional counterparts. We also introduce a method for adapting PID gains in the presence of noise and empirically verify its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>From MIDI to Rich Tablatures: an Automatic Generative System incorporating Lead Guitarists' Fingering and Stylistic choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the automatic identification of the optimal fingering for the performance of melodies on fretted string instruments has already been addressed (at least partially) in the literature, the specific case regarding lead electric guitar requires a dedicated approach. We propose a system that can generate, from simple MIDI melodies, tablatures enriched by fingerings, articulations, and expressive techniques. The basic fingering is derived by solving a constrained and multi-attribute optimization problem, which derives the best position of the fretting hand, not just the finger used at each moment.Then, by analyzing statistical data from the mySongBook corpus, the most common clich{\'e}s and biomechanical feasibility, articulations, and expressive techniques are introduced. Finally, the obtained output is converted into MusicXML format, which allows for easy visualization and use. The quality of the tablatures derived and the high configurability of the proposed approach can have several impacts, in particular in the fields of instrumental teaching, assisted composition and arranging, and computational expressive music performance models.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Selection in Replicator Equations Using Adaptive-Gain Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the equilibrium selection problem, which amounts to steering a population of individuals engaged in strategic game-theoretic interactions to a desired collective behavior. In the literature, this problem has been typically tackled by means of open-loop strategies, whose applicability is however limited by the need of accurate a priori information on the game and scarce robustness to uncertainty and noise. Here, we overcome these limitations by adopting a closed-loop approach using an adaptive-gain control scheme within a replicator equation -a nonlinear ordinary differential equation that models the evolution of the collective behavior of the population. For most classes of 2-action matrix games we establish sufficient conditions to design a controller that guarantees convergence of the replicator equation to the desired equilibrium, requiring limited a-priori information on the game. Numerical simulations corroborate and expand our theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes LCFL, a novel clustering metric for evaluating clients' data distributions in federated learning. LCFL aligns with federated learning requirements, accurately assessing client-to-client variations in data distribution. It offers advantages over existing clustered federated learning methods, addressing privacy concerns, improving applicability to non-convex models, and providing more accurate classification results. LCFL does not require prior knowledge of clients' data distributions. We provide a rigorous mathematical analysis, demonstrating the correctness and feasibility of our framework. Numerical experiments with neural network instances highlight the superior performance of LCFL over baselines on several clustered federated learning benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Integer programs with nearly totally unimodular matrices: the cographic case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a notorious open question whether integer programs (IPs), with an integer coefficient matrix $M$ whose subdeterminants are all bounded by a constant $\Delta$ in absolute value, can be solved in polynomial time. We answer this question in the affirmative if we further require that, by removing a constant number of rows and columns from $M$, one obtains a submatrix $A$ that is the transpose of a network matrix.
  Our approach focuses on the case where $A$ arises from $M$ after removing $k$ rows only, where $k$ is a constant. We achieve our result in two main steps, the first related to the theory of IPs and the second related to graph minor theory.
  First, we derive a strong proximity result for the case where $A$ is a general totally unimodular matrix: Given an optimal solution of the linear programming relaxation, an optimal solution to the IP can be obtained by finding a constant number of augmentations by circuits of $[A\; I]$.
  Second, for the case where $A$ is transpose of a network matrix, we reformulate the problem as a maximum constrained integer potential problem on a graph $G$. We observe that if $G$ is $2$-connected, then it has no rooted $K_{2,t}$-minor for $t = \Omega(k \Delta)$. We leverage this to obtain a tree-decomposition of $G$ into highly structured graphs for which we can solve the problem locally. This allows us to solve the global problem via dynamic programming.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01554v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops methods for proving Lyapunov stability of dynamical systems subject to disturbances with an unknown distribution. We assume only a finite set of disturbance samples is available and that the true online disturbance realization may be drawn from a different distribution than the given samples. We formulate an optimization problem to search for a sum-of-squares (SOS) Lyapunov function and introduce a distributionally robust version of the Lyapunov function derivative constraint. We show that this constraint may be reformulated as several SOS constraints, ensuring that the search for a Lyapunov function remains in the class of SOS polynomial optimization problems. For general systems, we provide a distributionally robust chance-constrained formulation for neural network Lyapunov function search. Simulations demonstrate the validity and efficiency of either formulation on non-linear uncertain dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Homotopy methods are attractive due to their capability of solving difficult optimisation and optimal control problems. The underlying idea is to construct a homotopy, which may be considered as a continuous (zero) curve between the difficult original problem and a related, comparatively easy one. Then, the solution of the easier one is continuously perturbed along the zero curve towards the sought-after solution of the original problem. We propose a methodology for the systematic construction of such zero curves for discrete-time optimal control problems drawing upon the theory of globally convergent homotopies for nonlinear programs. The proposed framework ensures that for almost every initial guess at a solution there exists a suitable homotopy path that is, in addition, numerically convenient to track. We demonstrate the results by solving difficult optimal path planning problems for a linear system and the nonlinear nonholonomic car (Dubins' vehicle).</description>

      <title>Cardinality Constrained Mean-Variance Portfolios: A Penalty Decomposition Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16004v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cardinality-constrained mean-variance portfolio problem has garnered significant attention within contemporary finance due to its potential for achieving low risk while effectively managing risks and transaction costs. Instead of solving this problem directly, many existing methods rely on regularization and approximation techniques, which hinder investors' ability to precisely specify a portfolio's desired cardinality level. Moreover, these approaches typically include more hyper-parameters and increase the problem's dimensionality. To address these challenges, we propose a customized penalty decomposition algorithm. We demonstrate that this algorithm not only does it converge to a local minimizer of the cardinality-constrained mean-variance portfolio problem, but is also computationally efficient. Our approach leverages a sequence of penalty subproblems, each tackled using Block Coordinate Descent (BCD). Specifically, we show that the steps within BCD yield closed-form solutions, allowing us to identify a saddle point of the penalty subproblems. Finally, by applying our penalty decomposition algorithm to real-world datasets, we highlight its efficiency and its superiority over state-of-the-art methods across several performance metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10827v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces Deep Policy Iteration (DPI), a novel approach that integrates the strengths of Neural Networks with the stability and convergence advantages of Policy Iteration (PI) to address high-dimensional stochastic Mean Field Games (MFG). DPI overcomes the limitations of PI, which is constrained by the curse of dimensionality to low-dimensional problems, by iteratively training three neural networks to solve PI equations and satisfy forward-backwards conditions. Our findings indicate that DPI achieves comparable convergence levels to the Mean Field Deep Galerkin Method (MFDGM), with additional advantages. Furthermore, deep learning techniques show promise in handling separable Hamiltonian cases where PI alone is less effective. DPI effectively manages high-dimensional problems, extending the applicability of PI to both separable and non-separable Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Stopper vs. singular-controller games with degenerate diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study zero-sum stochastic games between a singular controller and a stopper when the (state-dependent) diffusion matrix of the underlying controlled diffusion process is degenerate. In particular, we show the existence of a value for the game and determine an optimal strategy for the stopper. The degeneracy of the dynamics prevents the use of analytical methods based on solution in Sobolev spaces of suitable variational problems. Therefore we adopt a probabilistic approach based on a perturbation of the underlying diffusion modulated by a parameter $\gamma&gt;0$. For each $\gamma&gt;0$ the approximating game is non-degenerate and admits a value $u^\gamma$ and an optimal strategy $\tau^\gamma_*$ for the stopper. Letting $\gamma\to 0$ we prove convergence of $u^\gamma$ to a function $v$, which identifies the value of the original game. We also construct explicitly optimal stopping times $\theta^\gamma_*$ for $u^\gamma$, related but not equal to $\tau^\gamma_*$, which converge almost surely to an optimal stopping time $\theta_*$ for the game with degenerate dynamics.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Infinite-horizon Control: from a pool of samples to the design of dependable controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study control of constrained linear systems with only partial statistical information about the uncertainty affecting the system dynamics and the sensor measurements. Specifically, given a finite collection of disturbance realizations drawn from a generic distribution, we consider the problem of designing a stabilizing control policy with provable safety and performance guarantees despite the mismatch between the empirical and true distributions. We capture this discrepancy using Wasserstein ambiguity sets, and we formulate a distributionally robust (DR) optimal control problem, which provides guarantees on the expected cost, safety, and stability of the system. To solve this problem, we first present new results for DR optimization of quadratic objectives using convex programming, showing that strong duality holds under mild conditions. Then, by combining our results with the system-level parametrization of linear feedback policies, we show that the design problem can be reduced to a semidefinite program. We present numerical simulations to validate the effectiveness of our approach and to highlight the value of empirical distributions for control design.</description>

Abstract: We study the basic properties of resolvent equipped with degenerate metric based on restricted maximal monotonicity, and further propose several conditions for the well-definedness and weak convergence of the fixed point iterations. The results help to understand the behaviours of many operator splitting algorithms in the kernel space of degenerate metric.</description>

      <title>ANFIS and metaheuristics for green supply chain with inspection and rework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09154v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The focus of present article is to investigate a supply chain inventory model of deteriorated items along with inspection and stock dependent demand using green technology to reduce carbon emissions. Products that are decaying have a high sensitivity to the environment in terms of temperature, carbon emission, humidity, waste disposal, etc. This study develops a profit maximization model in the presence of deterioration, preservation, imperfect production, inspection error, rework, stock and price-dependent demand. Three carbon emission strategies are proposed to reduce the expenses in different carbon emissions scenarios. The suggested approach may be used to determine the optimal production period, preservation investment, and level of green investment. The solution of the proposed non-linear constraint optimization is provided by using a penalty method in metaheuristic approaches. In order to conduct a sensitivity analysis for the essential model parameters, a numerical example is presented. The results produced by DE and PSO are compared with the results obtained by Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) technique.</description>

      <title>Traffic signal optimization in large-scale urban road networks: an adaptive-predictive controller using Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realizing smooth traffic flow is important for achieving carbon neutrality. Adaptive traffic signal control, which considers traffic conditions, has thus attracted attention. However, it is difficult to ensure optimal vehicle flow throughout a large city using existing control methods because of their heavy computational load. Here, we propose a control method called AMPIC (Adaptive Model Predictive Ising Controller) that guarantees both scalability and optimality. The proposed method employs model predictive control to solve an optimal control problem at each control interval with explicit consideration of a predictive model of vehicle flow. This optimal control problem is transformed into a combinatorial optimization problem with binary variables that is equivalent to the so-called Ising problem. This transformation allows us to use an Ising solver, which has been widely studied and is expected to have fast and efficient optimization performance. We performed numerical experiments using a microscopic traffic simulator for a realistic city road network. The results show that AMPIC enables faster vehicle cruising speed with less waiting time than that achieved by classical control methods, resulting in lower CO2 emissions. The model predictive approach with a long prediction horizon thus effectively improves control performance. Systematic parametric studies on model cities indicate that the proposed method realizes smoother traffic flows for large city road networks. Among Ising solvers, D-Wave's quantum annealing is shown to find near-optimal solutions at a reasonable computational cost.</description>

      <title>Small-Time Local Controllability of the multi-input bilinear Schr\"odinger equation thanks to a quadratic term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this article is to contribute to a better understanding of the relations between the exact controllability of nonlinear PDEs and the control theory for ODEs based on Lie brackets, through a study of the Schr\"odinger PDE with bilinear control. We focus on the small-time local controllability (STLC) around an equilibrium, when the linearized system is not controllable. We study the second order order term in the Taylor expansion of the state, with respect to the control. For scalar input ODEs, quadratic terms never recover controllability: they induce signed drifts in the dynamics. Thus proving STLC requires to go at least to the third order. Similar results were proved for the bilinear Schr\"odinger PDE with scalar input controls. In this article, we study the case of multi-input systems. We clarify among the quadratic Lie brackets, those that allow to recover STLC: they are bilinear with respect to 2 different controls. For ODEs, our result is a consequence of Sussman's sufficient condition $S(\theta)$ (when focused on quadratic terms), but we propose a new proof, designed to prepare an easier transfer to PDEs. This proof relies on a representation formula of the state inspired by the Magnus formula. By adapting it, we prove a new STLC result for the bilinear Schr\"odinger PDE.</description>

      <title>Controllability problems of a neutral integro-differential equation with memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current study addresses the control problems posed by a semilinear neutral integro-differential equation with memory. The primary objectives of this study are to investigate the existence of a mild solution and approximate controllability of both linear and semilinear control systems in Banach spaces. To accomplish this, we begin by introducing the concept of a resolvent family associated with the homogeneous neutral integro-differential equation without memory. In the process, we establish some important properties of the resolvent family. Subsequently, we develop approximate controllability results for a linear control problem by constructing a linear-quadratic regulator problem. This involves establishing the existence of an optimal pair and determining the expression of the optimal control that produces the approximate controllability of the linear system. Furthermore, we deduce sufficient conditions for the existence of a mild solution and approximate controllability of a semilinear system in a reflexive Banach space with a uniformly convex dual. Additionally, we delve into the discussion of approximate controllability for a semilinear problem in general Banach space, assuming a Lipschitz type condition on the nonlinear term. Finally, we implement our findings to examine the approximate controllability of certain partial differential equations, demonstrating their practical relevance.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider a two-parameter family {dGWp,q}p,q of Gromov- Wasserstein distances between metric measure spaces. By exploiting a suitable interaction between specific values of the parameters p and q and the metric of the underlying spaces, we determine the exact value of the distance dGW4,2 between all pairs of unit spheres of different dimension endowed with their Euclidean distance and their uniform measure.</description>

      <title>Convex Relaxations of ReLU Neural Networks Approximate Global Optima in Polynomial Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the optimality gap between two-layer ReLU networks regularized with weight decay and their convex relaxations. We show that when the training data is random, the relative optimality gap between the original problem and its relaxation can be bounded by a factor of O(log n^0.5), where n is the number of training samples. A simple application leads to a tractable polynomial-time algorithm that is guaranteed to solve the original non-convex problem up to a logarithmic factor. Moreover, under mild assumptions, we show that local gradient methods converge to a point with low training loss with high probability. Our result is an exponential improvement compared to existing results and sheds new light on understanding why local gradient methods work well.</description>

      <title>Heavy-Tailed Class Imbalance and Why Adam Outperforms Gradient Descent on Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adam has been shown to outperform gradient descent on large language models by a larger margin than on other tasks, but it is unclear why. We show that a key factor in this performance gap is the heavy-tailed class imbalance found in language tasks. When trained with gradient descent, the loss of infrequent words decreases more slowly than the loss of frequent ones. This leads to a slow decrease on the average loss as most samples come from infrequent words. On the other hand, Adam and sign-based methods are less sensitive to this problem. To establish that this behavior is caused by class imbalance, we show empirically that it can be reproduced across architectures and data types, on language transformers, vision CNNs, and linear models. On a linear model with cross-entropy loss, we show that class imbalance leads to imbalanced, correlated gradients and Hessians that have been hypothesized to benefit Adam. We also prove that, in continuous time, gradient descent converges slowly on low-frequency classes while sign descent does not.</description>

      <title>McKean-Vlasov forward-backward doubly stochastic differential equations and applications to stochastic control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates first the existence and uniqueness of solutions for McKean-Vlasov forward-backward doubly stochastic differential equations (MV-FBDSDEs) in infinite-dimensional real separable Hilbert spaces. These equations combine the features of forward-backward doubly stochastic differential equations with the mean-field approach, allowing the coefficients to depend on the solution distribution. We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions for MV-FBDSDEs using the method of continuation and provide an example and a counterexample to illustrate our findings. Moreover, we extend the practical applicability of our results by employing them within the context of the stochastic maximum principle for a control problem governed by MV-FBDSDEs. This study contributes to the field of stochastic control problems and presents the first analysis of MV-FBDSDEs in infinite-dimensional spaces.</description>
