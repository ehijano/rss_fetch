      <title>Reply to the "Comment on The Tully-Fisher law and dark matter effects derived via modified symmetries by I. Arraut"</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been claimed in \cite{1}, that the idea proposed in \cite{2} has certain mistakes based on arguments of energy conditions and others. Additionally, some of the key arguments of the paper are criticized. Here we demonstrate that the results obtained in \cite{2} are correct and that there is no violation of any energy condition. The statements claimed in \cite{1} are based on three things: 1). Misinterpretation of the metric solution. 2). Language issues related to the physical quantities obtained in \cite{1}, where the authors make wrong interpretations about certain results over the geometry proposed in \cite{2}. 3). Non-rigorous evaluations of the vacuum condition defined via the result over the Ricci tensor $R_{\mu\nu}=0$</description>

      <title>Can the second time-derivative of the orbital frequency of binary pulsars be used for testing general relativity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With precision pulsar timing, measured values of a large set of pulsar parameters are obtainable. For some of those parameters, such as the time-derivatives of spin or orbital periods (in the case of binary pulsars), the measured values are not the intrinsic values of the parameters as they contain contributions from the dynamical effects. In the case of orbital period derivatives, the intrinsic values are essentially the general relativistic results. Pulsar timing solution also provides measurement of higher time-derivatives of orbital frequency for some pulsars. We specifically focus on the second time-derivative of the orbital frequency to explore its application in testing general relativity. In this work, we have provided a formalism to estimate the general relativistic contribution to the second derivative of the orbital frequency. We have calculated the dynamical effect contributions as well as the general relativistic contributions to the second time-derivative of the orbital period for real as well as synthetic pulsars. We find that the general relativistic contribution to the second time-derivative of the orbital period is negligibly small compared to the observed values of the real pulsars.</description>

      <title>Expanding Microscopic Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two interesting hypotheses about black holes have been proposed. The older one states that microscopic black holes can be accountable for the observed dark matter density. The newer one states that black holes are coupled to the expansion of the universe. Here, we combine those ideas and investigate the behaviour of expanding microscopic black holes. We observe two temperatures at which the radiation balances the expansion. While one of the balance points might be important in the analysis of primordial scenarios, the other would lead to a strong diffuse gamma radiation background, which is contradicted by the lack of observations. This establishes another indirect evidence disfavouring the hypothesis of cosmological coupling of black holes.</description>

      <title>On optical appearance of Einstein-Maxwell-{\AE}ther black holes surrounded by various accretions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effects of the {\ae}ther field and the electric charge on the observed shadow of two types of charged black holes in the Einstein-Maxwell-{\AE}ther theory. By considering that the Einstein-Maxwell-{\AE}ther black holes surrounded by the static/infalling spherical accretion flows, as well as an optically and geometrically thin disk accretion flow, we study the shadow luminosities and the observed specific intensity of the image for these various profiles of accretion flows. We find that in the thin disk accretion model the location and the emitted model of the accretion gas affect on the optical appearance of charged Einstein-{\AE}ther black holes in contrast to the spherical accretion flows. For a thin disk profile, we show that the observer will receive more intensity for an emitted model as Gaussian function when the innermost radiation radius lies in the innermost stable circular orbit. Finally, comparing the results of the charged Einstein-{\AE}ther black holes with neutral Einstein-{\AE}ther black holes, we show that the charged Einstein-{\AE}ther black holes have smaller dark area, whereas wider lensed ring and photon ring. Comparing the charged Einstein-{\AE}ther black holes with Reissner-Nordstrom black hole gives a reverse effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the thermodynamics of a relativistic ideal within the context of $\kappa$-deformed space-time and Rainbow gravity background. To achieve this, we construct a modified partition function by considering a deformed Hamiltonian and incorporating corrections based on the time-invariant phase-space volume. We explore the implications of our model on the modified black body radiation spectrum and the modified Debye theory of specific heat in $\kappa$-deformed space-time and Rainbow gravity background.</description>

      <title>Atom falling into a quantum corrected charged black hole and HBAR entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an earlier analysis \href{https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.085007}{Phys. Rev. D 105 (2022) 085007}, we have explored the event of acceleration radiation for an atom freely falling into the event horizon of a quantum corrected Schwarzschild black hole. We want to explore the acceleration-radiation when the atom is freely falling into the event horizon of a charged quantum corrected black hole. We consider quantum effects of the electromagnetic field along with the gravitational field in asymptotic safety regime. Introducing the quantum improved Reisner-Nordstr\"{o}m metric, we have calculated the excitation probability of a two-level atom freely falling into the event horizon of quantum improved charged black hole. Recently, in case of the braneworld black hole (where the tidal charge has the same dimension as the square of the charge of a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole in natural units), we have observed from the form of the transition probability that the temperature will have no contribution in the first order of the tidal charge. We observe that for a quantum corrected Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole, there is a second order contribution in the charge parameter in the temperature that can be read off from the transition probability. Next, we calculate the HBAR entropy in this thought experiment and show that this entropy has a leading order Bekenstein-Hawking entropy term along with some higher order correction terms involving logarithmic as well as fractional terms of the black hole area due to infalling photons. We have finally investigated the validity of the Wien's displacement law and compared the critical value of the field wavelength with the general Schwarzschild black hole and its corresponding quantum corrected case.</description>

      <title>Ghost Dark Energy in Tsallis and Barrow Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the thermodynamics-gravity conjecture, any modification to the entropy expression leads to the modified cosmological field equations. Based on this, we investigate the cosmological consequences of the modified Friedmann equations when the entropy associated with the horizon is in the form of Tsallis/Barrow entropy and the dark energy (DE) component is in the form of ghost dark energy (GDE). We perform a dynamical system analysis and see that the Tsallis GDE(TGDE) and Barrow GDE(BGDE) can exhibit a correct phase space evolution for suitable range of the free parameters($0&lt;\Delta&lt;1$ for BGDE and $\beta&lt;3/2$ for TGDE). We find that in BGDE and TGDE (with $Q=3b^2 H(\rho_D+\rho_m)$), there exist an early radiation dominated phase of expansion which is absent for GDE model in standard cosmology. It is worth mentioning that seeking an unstable phase of matter dominated in TGDE leads to a new constraint on $\beta$($&lt;3/2$). Using the resulting range of free parameters from latter step we find that both models are capable to explain the cosmic evolution from deceleration to an accelerated phase. We observe that increasing $\Delta$ ($\beta$) parameters leads to a delay in the cosmic phase transition. We conclude that BGDE and TGDE are viable cosmological models which predict a consistent phase transition of the cosmic expansion for suitable ranges of the parameters. We also calculate the squared sound speed for both models and find out that they are unstable against perturbations...</description>

      <title>LISA double white dwarf binaries as Galactic accelerometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic double white dwarf (DWD) binaries are among the guaranteed sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), an upcoming space-based gravitational wave (GW) detector. Most DWDs in the LISA band are far from merging and emit quasimonochromatic GWs. As these sources are distributed throughout the Milky Way, they experience different accelerations in the Galactic gravitational potential, and therefore each DWD exhibits an apparent GW frequency chirp due to differential acceleration between the source and LISA. We examine how Galactic acceleration influences parameter estimation for these sources; and investigate how LISA observations could provide insight into the distribution of matter in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Generalisation of Conformal-Disformal Transformations of the Metric in Scalar-Tensor Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study new classes of metric transformations in the context of scalar-tensor theories, which involve both higher derivatives of the scalar field and derivatives of the metric itself. In general, such transformations are not invertible as they involve derivatives of the metric, which typically leads to instability due to Ostrogradsky ghosts. We show, however, that a certain class of this type of transformations is invertible: we construct new examples of invertible conformal (and also disformal) transformations with higher derivatives. Finally, we make use of these new transformations to construct extended mimetic theories of gravity, and we study their properties in the context of cosmology.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity Corrections to the inflationary spectrum in a Bohmian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A precise interpretation of the Universe wave function is forbidden in the spirit of the Copenhagen School since a precise notion of measure operation cannot be satisfactorily defined. Here we propose a Bohmian interpretation of the isotropic Universe quantum dynamics, in which the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is restated by including quantum corrections, which lead to a classical trajectory containing effects of order $\hbar^2$. This solution is then used to determine the spectrum of gauge-invariant quantum fluctuations living on the obtained background model. The analysis is performed adopting the wave function approach to describe the fluctuation dynamics, which gives a time-dependent harmonic oscillator for each Fourier mode and whose frequency is affected by the $\hbar^2$ corrections. The properties of the emerging spectrum are discussed, outlining the modification induced with respect to the scale-invariant result and the hierarchy of the spectral index running is discussed.</description>

      <title>Backreaction from quantum fluxes at the Kerr inner horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes modeled by the Kerr metric are not semiclassically self-consistent at or below the inner horizon. The renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) of a scalar quantum field in the Unruh state has been found to diverge at the Kerr inner horizon, causing the geometry to backreact in a non-trivial way. In an effort to understand this backreaction, here the inner-horizon RSET is computed for the full physically relevant parameter space of black hole spins $a$ and polar angles $\theta$. Then, the backreaction is analyzed using a framework for the dynamical behavior of mass inflation from continued accretion. It is shown that the initial backreaction from the RSET does not evolve the spacetime toward any known regular or extremal configuration, but instead it brings the local interior geometry toward a chaotic, spacelike singularity, classically stable over astrophysical timescales.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Einstein-dilation-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity and electric charge of black hole from GW230529</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the implications of GW230529 on gravity theories and the charge of black holes. The GW230529, which was initially released in O4a, is most likely neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers. We reanalyze the data from the GW230529 event to obtain bounds on the Einstein-dilation-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) gravity parameter $\sqrt{\alpha_{\rm EdGB}}$ and the electric charge of black holes. The event places a $90\%$ credible upper bounds on $\sqrt{\alpha_{\rm EdGB}}$ of $\lesssim 0.298$ km. After including high order corrections of EdGB gravity, the bounds improve to $\sqrt{\alpha_{\rm EdGB}} \lesssim 0.260$ km. Analyses of GW230529 also yield a $90\%$ credible upper bounds on charge-to-mass ratio $\zeta \lesssim 0.024$. The constraints are more stringent than those derived from previously observed single gravitational wave merger event.</description>

      <title>Some Classes of Interacting Two-Fluid Model of the Expanding Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider interacting dark matter-dark energy models arising out of a general interaction term $Q=f(\rho_{m},\rho_{d},\dot{\rho}_{m},\dot{\rho}_{d}).$ Here $f$ is a functional relation connecting the energy densities $\rho_{m}$ and $\rho_{d}$ and their derivatives w.r.t. time $t.$ In our model we consider two interacting barotropic fluid with constant equation of state $\omega_{m}$ and $\omega_{d}.$ By considering a dynamical interaction between them we trace out the cosmological evolution dynamics of the universe. We analytically solve the model by considering a constant ratio between the two fluids and then track the corresponding analytical results using observational data from the baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, Type Ia supernovae measurements and the local Hubble constant measurements. From this general setting we introduce three different models and nine different interaction function. Our final aim is to set up a comparative analysis of the various class of models under the different interaction function using common theoretical and numerical analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic spacetimes have been known to offer analogue models for black hole physics and cosmology. Within this context, aspects of analogue quantum field theories in curved spacetime are studied. In particular some new comments have been made on the analogue Hawking temperature including a quick derivation of the result. Further, analogue cosmology is explored, within which, an acoustic version of the Parker-Toms model is proposed and the corresponding quantities have been calculated. The limits of the acoustic analogue are emphasised.</description>

      <title>No Drama in 2D Black Hole Evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically calculate the spacetime describing the formation and evaporation of a regular black hole in 2D dilaton gravity. The apparent horizons evaporate smoothly in finite time to form a compact trapped region. The spacetime is asymptotically flat at future null infinity and is free of singularities and global horizons. We nevertheless see rich dynamics; an anti-trapped region forms alongside the black hole, and additional compact trapped/anti-trapped regions are formed by backreaction effects as the mass radiates away. These results suggest that the evaporation of regular 2D black holes is unitary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends previous findings on the modified Schr\"odinger evolution inspired by quantum gravity phenomenology. By establishing a connection between this approach and fractional quantum mechanics, we provide insights into a potential deep infrared regime of quantum gravity, characterized by the emergence of fractal dimensions, similar to behaviors observed in the deep ultraviolet regime. Additionally, we briefly explore the requirements for experimental investigations of this regime using Bose-Einstein condensates. Notably, our analysis reveals a direct implication of this analogy: experiments probing fractional quantum mechanics may serve as equivalent models of quantum gravity. We identify instances of nonlocal behavior in such systems, suggesting an analogous phenomenon of nonlocality in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravitational corrections to the Schwarzschild spacetime and quasinormal frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum gravitational corrections to the entropy of the Schwarzschild black hole, derived using the Wald entropy formula within an effective field theory framework, were presented in [X. Calmet, F. Kuipers Phys.Rev.D 104 (2021) 6, 066012]. These corrections result in a Schwarzschild spacetime that is deformed by the quantum correction. However, it is observed that the proposed quantum-corrected metric describes not a black hole but a wormhole. Nevertheless, further expansion of the metric function in terms of the quantum correction parameter yields a well-defined black hole metric whose geometry closely resembles that of a wormhole. We also explore methods for distinguishing between these quantum-corrected spacetimes based on the quasinormal frequencies they emit.</description>

      <title>A short introduction on Angular momentum of Kerr Blackhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General relativity (GR) predicts the existence of black hole (BH). The rotating BH called as a Kerr Black hole and GR implies that there is an upper limit on the angular momentum per mass squared of black holes $\leq 1$, above which the event horizon of the Kerr BH is not exist. We find the radial equation for equatorial motion for Kerr BH in terms of the effective potential. We have shown the effective potential profile for different rotation parameter ($a$). We find the solution of the radial equation of the Kerr metric and found the expression of the angular momentum per unit mass squared, $\tilde a = \frac{a}{M}$. We showed the profile of $\tilde a$ as a function of $\frac{r}{M}$. The solution also leads the energy per unit rest mass ($e$) and we showed its behavior as a function of $\frac{r}{M}$. We enumerated the maximum values of radius of innermost stable circular orbit ($r_{ISCO}$) for $\tilde a=1$.</description>

      <title>Cosmological models based on an asymmetric scalar doublet with kinetic coupling of components. I. General properties of the cosmological model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mathematical model of the Universe evolution, based on asymmetric doublet of classical and phantom dcalar Higgs fields with a kinetic connection between the components, has been constructed and studied. A detailed qualitative analysis was carried out, the properties of the model's symmetry and invarience with respect to the similariry transformations of fundamental constants were proven. The principles of numerical modeling are formulated and an example of numerical modeling of the evolution of the model for a specific set of fundamental constants and initial conditions is given. the asymptotic behavior of the model near cosmological singularities is studied. It is shown that cosmological model near singularities manifests itself as an ideal fluid with an extremelly ripid equation of state. Keywords: cosmological model, phantom and classical scalar fields, kinetic interection, quality analysis, asymptotic behavior, numerrical modeling.</description>

      <title>Discrete Orbit Effect Lengthens Merger Times for Inspiraling Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inspiral merger time for two black holes captured into a nonrelativistic bound orbit by gravitational radiation emission has been often calculated by a formula of Peters that assumes the adiabatic approximation that the changes per orbit are small. However, initially this is not true for the semimajor axis and period of most of the initially highly eccentric orbits, which change significantly during closest approach and much less elsewhere along the orbit. This effect can make the merger time much longer (using other formulas from Peters that do not assume the adiabatic approximation) than that calculated by the adiabatic formula of Peters.</description>

      <title>Massive scalar clouds and black hole spacetimes in Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study static black holes in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) gravity with a massive scalar field as an example of higher curvature gravity. The scalar mass introduces an additional scale and leads to a strong suppression of the scalar field beyond its Compton wavelength. We numerically compute sGB black hole spacetimes and scalar configurations and also compare with perturbative results for small couplings, where we focus on a dilatonic coupling function. We analyze the constraints on the parameters from requiring the curvature singularity to be located inside the black hole horizon $r_h$ and the relation to the regularity condition for the scalar field. For scalar field masses $m r_h \gtrsim 10^{-1}$, this leads to a new and currently most stringent bound on sGB coupling constant $\alpha$ of $\alpha/r_h^2 \sim 10^{-1}$ in the context of stellar mass black holes. Lastly, we look at several properties of the black hole configurations relevant for further work on observational consequences, including the scalar monopole charge, Arnowitt Deser Misner mass, curvature invariants and the frequencies of the innermost stable circular orbit and light ring.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the dynamics of a charged spinning body in curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the motion of the spinning body (in the pole-dipole approximation) in the gravitational and electromagnetic fields described by the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon-Souriau equations. First, we define a novel spin supplementary condition for the electromagnetic interactions which generalizes the one proposed by Ohashi-Kyrian-Semer\'ak for gravity. As a result, we get the whole family of charged spinning particle models in the curved spacetime with remarkably simple dynamics (momentum and velocity are parallel). Applying the reparametrization procedure, for a specific dipole moment, we obtain equations of motion with constant mass and gyromagnetic factor. Next, we show that these equations follows from an effective Hamiltonian formalism, previously interpreted as a classical model of the charged Dirac particle.</description>

      <title>Constraining photon trajectories in black hole shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the shadow cast by a Kerr black hole, focusing on constraints on photons corresponding to different shadow boundaries. The photons are related to different orbital ranges and impact parameter values, creating a map of the shadow boundaries. Our analysis fixes also the conditions under which it is possible to observe an "imprint" of the black hole (outer) ergosurface and (outer) ergoregion on the Kerr black hole shadow boundary. The counter-rotating case resulted strongly constrained with respect to the co-rotating case, constituting a remarkable and significant difference where the counter-rotating component associated with the shadow boundary is strongly distinct from the co-rotating one. However, in this framework, even the co-rotating photons imply restrictions on conditions on the spins and planes, which are bounded by limiting values. We believe the results found here, being a tracer for the central black hole, can constitute new templates for the ongoing observations.</description>

      <title>Causal Energy-Momentum Tensors and Relativistic Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a theory defined by an energy-momentum tensor depending on a set of general fields, including the space-time metric. We prove that if the theory is causal, bounded and transforms appropriately under diffeomorphism, it will depend only on the local values of the independent fields and their covariant derivatives up to a finite order. The implications are that the energy-momentum tensor of a causal relativistic fluid can only depend on covariant derivatives only up to a finite order.</description>

      <title>Causal Sets and an Emerging Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal set theory offers a simple and elegant picture of discrete physics. But the vast majority of causal sets look nothing at all like continuum spacetimes, and must be excluded in some way to obtain a realistic theory. I describe recent results showing that almost all non-manifoldlike causal sets are, in fact, very strongly suppressed in the gravitational path integral. This does not quite demonstrate the emergence of a continuum -- we do not yet understand the remaining unsuppressed causal sets well enough -- but it is a significant step in that direction.</description>

      <title>Revisiting linear stability of black hole odd-parity perturbations in Einstein-Aether gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Einstein-Aether gravity, we revisit the issue of linear stabilities of black holes against odd-parity perturbations on a static and spherically symmetric background. In this theory, superluminal propagation is allowed and there is a preferred timelike direction along the unit Aether vector field. If we choose the usual spherically symmetric background coordinates with respect to the Killing time $t$ and the areal radius $r$, it may not be appropriate for unambiguously determining the black hole stability because the constant $t$ hypersurfaces are not necessarily always spacelike. Unlike past related works of black hole perturbations, we choose an Aether-orthogonal frame in which the timelike Aether field is orthogonal to spacelike hypersurfaces over the whole background spacetime. In the short wavelength limit, we show that no-ghost conditions as well as radial and angular propagation speeds coincide with those of vector and tensor perturbations on the Minkowski background. Thus, the odd-parity linear stability of black holes for large radial and angular momentum modes is solely determined by constant coefficients of the Aether derivative couplings.</description>

      <title>Degrees of Freedom in modified Teleparallel Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I discuss the issue of degrees of freedom in modified teleparallel gravity. These theories do have an extra structure on top of the usual (pseudo)Riemannian manifold, that of a flat parallel transport. This structure is absolutely abstract and unpredictable (pure gauge) in GR-equivalent models, however it becomes physical upon modifications. The problem is that, in the most popular models, this local symmetry is broken but not stably so, hence the infamous strong coupling issues. The Hamiltonian analyses become complicated and with contradictory results. A funny point is that what we see in available linear perturbation treatments of $f(T)$ gravity is much closer to the analysis with less dynamical degrees of freedom which has got a well-known mistake in it, while the more accurate work predicts much more of dynamics than what has ever been seen up to now. I discuss possible reasons behind this puzzle, and also argue in favour of studying the most general New GR models which are commonly ignored due to suspicion of ghosts.</description>

      <title>Window and inpainting: dealing with data gaps for TianQin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-borne gravitational wave detectors like TianQin might encounter data gaps due to factors like micro-meteoroid collisions or hardware failures. Such glitches will cause discontinuity in the data and have been observed in the LISA Pathfinder. The existence of such data gaps presents challenges to the data analysis for TianQin, especially for massive black hole binary mergers, since its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) accumulates in a non-linear way, a gap near the merger could lead to significant loss of SNR. It could introduce bias in the estimate of noise properties, and furthermore the results of the parameter estimation. In this work, using simulated TianQin data with injected a massive black hole binary merger, we study the window function method, and for the first time, the inpainting method to cope with the data gap, and an iterative estimate scheme is designed to properly estimate the noise spectrum. We find that both methods can properly estimate noise and signal parameters. The easy-to-implement window function method can already perform well, except that it will sacrifice some SNR due to the adoption of the window. The inpainting method is slower, but it can minimize the impact of the data gap.</description>

      <title>Charged Particles Orbiting a Weakly Magnetized Black Hole Immersed in Quintessential Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new exact magnetized solution describing a Kiselev black hole immersed in a magnetic field is used for studying the dynamics of charged particles. For a weak magnetic induction, we employ a first-order perturbative approach to analyze the perturbed circular orbits near the minimum of the effective potential. We obtain an approximate solution for the bounded equatorial trajectory subjected to small radial and latitudinal oscillations. The shape of the trajectory localized near the stable circular orbit depends on the relation between the attractive gravitational force and the repulsive quintessence contribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The last few decades have provided abundant evidence for physics beyond the two standard models of particle physics and cosmology. As is now known, the by far largest part of our universe's matter/energy content lies in the `dark' and consists of dark energy and dark matter. Despite intensive efforts on the experimental as well as the theoretical side, the origins of both are still completely unknown. Screened scalar fields have been hypothesized as potential candidates for dark energy or dark matter. Among these, some of the most prominent models are the chameleon, symmetron, and environment-dependent dilaton. In this article, we present a summary containing the most recent experimental constraints on the parameters of these three models. For this, experimental results have been employed from the qBOUNCE collaboration, neutron interferometry, and Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR), among others. In addition, constraints are forecast for the Casimir And Non Newtonian force EXperiment (CANNEX). Combining these results with previous ones, this article collects the most up-to-date constraints on the three considered screened scalar field models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the possibility that inflation is driven by a scalar field together with a vector field minimally coupled to gravity. By assuming an effective potential that incorporates both fields into the action, we explore two distinct scenarios: one where the fields interact and another where they do not. In this context, we find different analytical solutions to the background scalar-vector fields dynamics during the inflationary scenario considering the slow-roll approximation. Besides, general conditions required for these models of two fields to be realizable are determined and discussed. From the cosmological perturbations, we consider a local field rotation, and then we determine these perturbations (scalar and tensor) during inflation, and we also utilize recent cosmological observations for constraining the parameter-space in these scalar-vector inflationary models.</description>

      <title>Necessity of Quantizable Geometry for Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, Dirac Quantization of $3D$ gravity in the first-order formalism is attempted where instead of quantizing the connection and triad fields, the connection and the triad 1-forms themselves are quantized. The exterior derivative operator on the space of differential forms is treated as the `time' derivative to compute the momenta conjugate to these 1-forms. This manner of quantization allows one to compute the transition amplitude in $3D$ gravity which has a close, but not exact, match with the transition amplitude computed via LQG techniques. This inconsistency is interpreted as being due to the non-quantizable nature of differential geometry.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the potential of Kaniadakis entropy to describe black hole entropy, proposing a modified version accounting for black hole thermodynamics. Additionally, we discuss the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) theory, a modification of Newton's second law aimed at explaining galaxy rotation curves without resorting to dark matter. Furthermore, we consider the Bekenstein bound conjecture, which imposes an upper limit on the entropy of confined quantum systems. We analyze this conjecture in the context of a modified Kaniadakis entropy and find that it holds for typical values of $\kappa$, as evidenced by our numerical investigation and displaying a figure. Our exploration underscores the potential of modified Kaniadakis statistics in understanding diverse physical phenomena, from gravitational systems to quantum mechanics, offering a promising direction for future research at the intersection of statistical mechanics and other important areas of physics as well.</description>

      <title>Internal symmetries in Kaluza-Klein models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01049v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The usual approach to Kaluza-Klein considers a spacetime of the form $M_4 \times K$ and identifies the isometry group of the internal vacuum metric, $g_K^0$, with the gauge group in four dimensions. In these notes we discuss a variant approach where part of the gauge group does not come from full isometries of $g_K^0$, but instead comes from weaker internal symmetries that only preserve the Einstein-Hilbert action on $K$. Then the weaker symmetries are spontaneously broken by the choice of vacuum metric and generate massive gauge bosons within the Kaluza-Klein framework, with no need to introduce ad hoc Higgs fields. Using the language of Riemannian submersions, the classical mass of a gauge boson is calculated in terms of the Lie derivatives of $g_K^0$. These massive bosons can be arbitrarily light and seem able to evade the standard no-go arguments against chiral fermionic interactions in Kaluza-Klein. As a second main theme, we also question the traditional assumption of a Kaluza-Klein vacuum represented by a product Einstein metric. This should not be true when that metric is unstable. In fact, we argue that the unravelling of the Einstein metric along certain instabilities is a desirable feature of the model, since it generates inflation and allows some metric components to change length scale. In the case of the Lie group $K = SU(3)$, the unravelling of the bi-invariant metric along an unstable perturbation also breaks the isometry group from $( SU(3) \times SU(3)) / Z_3$ down to $( SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1) )/ Z_6$, the gauge group of the Standard Model. We briefly discuss possible ways to stabilize the internal metric after that first symmetry breaking and produce an electroweak symmetry breaking at a different mass scale.</description>

      <title>Nucleation regions in the Large-Scale Structure I. A catalogue of cores in nearby rich superclusters</title>

Abstract: We applied a Density-Based Clustering algorithm on samples of galaxies and galaxy systems belonging to 53 rich superclusters from the \textit{Main SuperCluster Catalogue} (MSCC) to identify the presence of ``central regions'', or \emph{cores}, in these large-scale structures. \emph{Cores} are defined here as large gravitationally bound galaxy structures, comprised of two or more clusters and groups, with sufficient matter density to survive cosmic expansion and virialize in the future. We identified a total of 105 galaxy structures classified as \emph{cores}, which exhibit a high density contrast of mass and galaxies. The Density-based \textit{Core} Catalogue (DCC), presented here, includes \emph{cores} that were previously reported in well-known superclusters of the Local Universe, and also several newly identified ones. We found that 83\% of the rich superclusters in our sample have at least one \emph{core}. While more than three \emph{cores} with different dynamical state are possible, the presence of a single \emph{core} in the superclusters is more common. Our work confirms the existence of nucleation regions in the internal structure of most rich superclusters and points to the fact that these \emph{cores} are the densest and most massive features that can be identified in the cosmic web with high probability for future virialization.</description>

      <title>Accelerating universe at early and late times in extended Jordan-Brans-Dicke gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scenario that can explain the early-time inflation and the late-time dark energy within a unified framework. A scalar potential combining power-law and exponential type in a context of extended Jordan-Brans-Dicke gravity is critically important for this realization. A realistic scenario can be achieved in a two-field model in which one directional motion in field space realizes the slow-roll inflation. The inflaton ends up with oscillatory period and turns its direction to another direction that is identified as the quintessence field, giving rise to the dark energy at late times. The inflaton oscillation is expected to realize efficient heating if parametric amplification works. Along the quintessence direction, the present universe is on the way to reach the asymptotic fixed point. We search for successful parameter region, taking potential function in the form of low-order field powers times decreasing exponential in two dimensional field space.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity and control of a 6-axis fused-silica seismometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a pair of seismometers capable of measurement in all six axes of rigid motion. The vacuum-compatible devices implement compact interferometric displacement sensors to surpass the sensitivity of typical electrical readout schemes. Together with the capability to subtract the sensitivity-limiting coupling of ground tilt into horizontal motion, our seismometers can widen the sensing band towards mHz frequencies. This has notable applications across a range of fields requiring access to low-frequency signals, such as seismology and climate research. We particularly highlight their potential application in gravitational-wave observatories (LIGO) for observation of intermediate-mass black holes ($\sim 1000\,M_\odot$). The sensors are based on a near-monolithic fused-silica design consisting of a fused-silica mass and fibre, showing improved stability and robustness to tilt drifts, alignment, and control compared to all-metal or mixed metal-silica designs. We demonstrate tilt sensitivity that surpasses the best commercial alternatives in a significantly reduced footprint compared to our previous iterations of these sensors.</description>

      <title>Covariant approach to relativistic large-eddy simulations: Lagrangian filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a proof-of-principle implementation of the first fully covariant filtering scheme applied to relativistic fluid turbulence. The filtering is performed with respect to special observers, identified dynamically as moving with the "bulk of the flow". This means that filtering does not depend on foliations of spacetime but rather on the intrinsic fibration traced out by the observers. The covariance of the approach means that the results may be lifted into an arbitrary, curved spacetime. This practical step follows theoretical work showing that the residuals introduced by filtering a fine-scale ideal fluid can be represented by a non-ideal fluid prescription at the coarse scale. We interpret such non-ideal terms using a simple first-order gradient model, which allows us to extract effective turbulent viscosities and conductivity. A statistical regression on these terms shows that the majority of their variation may be explained by the thermodynamic properties of the filtered fluid and invariants of its flow, such as the shear and vorticity. This serves as a validation of the method and enables us to fit a functional, power-law form for the non-ideal coefficients -- an approach that may be used practically to give a sub-grid closure model in large-eddy simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we realise the charged Nariai black hole on a braneworld from a nucleated bubble in AdS$_5$, known as the dark bubble model. Geometrically, the black hole takes the form of a cylindrical spacetime pulling on the dark bubble. This is realised by a brane embedding in an AdS$_5$ black string background. Identifying the brane with a D3-brane in string theory allows us to determine a relation between the fine structure constant and the string coupling, $\alpha_\text{EM} = \frac{3}{2} g_s$, which was previously obtained for a microscopic black hole. We also speculate on the consequences for the Festina Lente bound and neutrino masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of spin on equal and unequal mass binary neutron star mergers using finite-temperature, composition-dependent Hempel-Schaffner-Bielich (SFHo) equation of state, via 3+1 general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations which take into account neutrino emission and absorption. Equal mass cases that have a mass of $M_{1,2}$ =$1.27$, $1.52$ and $2.05M_{\odot}$, result in a supramassive neutron star, a delayed, and a prompt collapse to a black hole, respectively. For all cases, we analyse the effect of initial spin on dynamics, on the structure of the final remnant, its spin evolution, the amount and composition of the ejected matter, gravitational waves, neutrino energy and luminosities. We show that in equal mass binary neutron star mergers, the ejected mass could reach $\sim0.085M_{\odot}$ for highly aligned-spins ($\chi=0.67$). The black hole which results from such highly spinning, high-mass binary neutron star merger reaches a dimensionless spin of $0.92$; this is the highest spin reached in binary neutron star mergers, to date.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the binary dynamics of two Kerr black holes with arbitrary spin vectors in the presence of parity-even and parity-odd cubic deformations of gravity. We first derive the tree-level Compton amplitudes for a Kerr black hole in cubic gravity, which we then use to compute the two-to-two amplitudes of the massive bodies to leading order in the deformation and the post-Minkowskian expansion. The required one-loop computations are performed using the leading singularity approach as well as the heavy-mass effective field theory (HEFT) approach. These amplitudes are then used to compute the leading-order momentum and spin kick in cubic gravity in the KMOC formalism. Our results are valid for generic masses and spin vectors, and include all the independent parity-even and parity-odd cubic deformations of Einstein-Hilbert gravity. We also present spin-expanded expressions for the momentum and spin kicks, and the all-order in spin deflection angle in the case of aligned spins.</description>

      <title>One loop effective actions in Kerr-(A)dS Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute new exact analytic expressions for one-loop scalar effective actions in Kerr (A)dS black hole (BH) backgrounds in four and five dimensions. These are computed by the connection coefficients of the Heun equation via a generalization of the Gelfand-Yaglom formalism to second-order linear ODEs with regular singularities. The expressions we find are in terms of Nekrasov-Shatashvili special functions, making explicit the analytic properties of the one-loop effective actions with respect to the gravitational parameters and the precise contributions of the quasi-normal modes. The latter arise via an associated integrable system. In particular, we prove asymptotic formulae for large angular momenta in terms of hypergeometric functions and give a precise mathematical meaning to Rindler-like region contributions. Moreover we identify the leading terms in the large distance expansion as the point particle approximation of the BH and their finite size corrections as encoding the BH tidal response. We also discuss exact properties of the thermal version of the BH effective actions. Although we focus on the real scalar field in dS-Kerr and (A)dS-Schwarzschild in four and five dimensions, similar formulae can be given for higher spin matter and radiation fields in more general gravitational backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Natural Inflation with Exponentially Small Tensor-To-Scalar Ratio</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that "natural inflation", also known as "axion inflation", can be compatible with Planck 2018 measurements of the cosmic microwave background, while predicting an exponentially small tensor-to-scalar ratio, e.g., $r\sim 10^{-15}$. The strong suppression of $r$ arises from dynamics of the radial component of the complex scalar field, whose phase is the axion. Such tiny values of $r$ remain well below the threshold for detection by CMB-S4 or Simons Observatory B-mode searches. The model is testable with the running $\alpha_s$ of the spectral index, which is within reach of next-generation CMB and large-scale structure experiments, motivating the running as a primary science goal for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reference Frames from Top-Down Crossed Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All physical observations are made relative to a reference frame, which is a system in its own right. If the system of interest admits a group symmetry, the reference frame observing it must transform commensurately under the group to ensure the covariance of the combined system. We point out that the crossed product is a way to realize quantum reference frames from the bottom-up; adjoining a quantum reference frame and imposing constraints generates a crossed product algebra. We provide a top-down specification of crossed product algebras and show that one cannot obtain inequivalent quantum reference frames using this approach. As a remedy, we define an abstract algebra associated to the system and symmetry group built out of relational crossed product algebras associated with different choices of quantum reference frames. We term this object the G-framed algebra, and show how potentially inequivalent frames are realized within this object. We comment on this algebra's analog of the classical Gribov problem in gauge theory, its importance in gravity where we show that it is relevant for semiclassical de Sitter and potentially beyond the semiclassical limit, and its utility for understanding the frame-dependence of physical notions like observables, density states, and entropies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct CFT states dual to local excitations in the three-dimensional de Sitter space (dS), called the bulk local states. We find that the conjugation operation in dS$_3/$CFT$_2$ is notably different from that in AdS$_3/$CFT$_2$. This requires us to combine two bulk local states constructed out of different primary states in a CPT-invariant way. This analysis explains why Green's functions in the dS Euclidean vacuum cannot simply be obtained from the Wick rotation of those in AdS. We also argue that this characteristic feature explains the emergence of time coordinate from the dual Euclidean CFT. We show that the information metric for the quantum estimation of bulk coordinate values replicates the de Sitter space metric.</description>

Abstract: We apply a formulation of Einstein's general relativity with only cubic interactions for deriving the metric of a Schwarzschild black hole to all orders in perturbation theory. This cubic interactions formulation coupled to effective worldline action of a massive point particle allows to derive a recursion relation for the form factors of the off-shell graviton emission current. The unique solution to the recursion relation leads to the Schwarzschild black-hole solution in four dimensions. This provides the first derivation of the black hole metric from a matter source to all orders in perturbation theory from an amplitude approach.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave dark siren cosmology systematics from galaxy weighting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of GW170817 provided the first direct gravitational-wave measurement of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, demonstrating the potential power of standard-siren cosmology. The dark siren approach can be utilized for gravitational-wave sources in the absence of an electromagnetic counterpart: one considers all galaxies contained within the localization volume as potential hosts. When statistically averaging over the potential host galaxies, one can weight them by their luminosities to account for physically-motivated prescriptions (e.g., tracing star formation or stellar mass). Using mock galaxy catalogs, we explore the impact of these weightings on the measurement of $H_0$, focusing on the bias in $H_0$ inference that results from incorrectly-weighted prescriptions. We find that assuming an incorrect galaxy host probability can lead to significant biases in $H_0$, up to about five times off from typical values inferred by current experiments. These biases are due to inconsistent galaxy weighted redshift distributions as well as preferentially selecting the incorrect host during inference. The magnitudes of these biases are influenced by the galaxy number density along each line of sight, the uncertainty in the measurement of the gravitational-wave luminosity distance, and correlations in the parameter space of galaxies. These biases may be overcome with future GW detectors that contain better GW localization, using a strategic choice of weighting prescription, or with increasing the SNR cut. We propose using hierarchical inference as a diagnosis of incorrectly-weighted prescriptions, which can further be used to simultaneously infer the correct weighting scheme and cosmological parameters.</description>

We give a self-contained global picture of how to model accretion onto MBHBs, analyzing different aspects of the system such as the dynamics of the circumbinary disk, mini-disks, outflows, the role of magnetic fields, and electromagnetic signatures. We discuss important questions and open problems related to these systems, what are the advantages and disadvantages of the different numerical approaches, and what robust knowledge we have built from simulations.</description>

      <title>Replica Wormholes and Entanglement Islands in the Karch-Randall Braneworld</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Karch-Randall braneworld provides a natural set-up to study the Hawking radiation from a black hole using holographic tools. Such a black hole lives on a brane and is highly quantum yet has a holographic dual as a higher dimensional classical theory that lives in the ambient space. Moreover, such a black hole is coupled to a nongravitational bath which is absorbing its Hawking radiation. This allows us to compute the entropy of the Hawking radiation by studying the bath using the quantum extremal surface prescription. The quantum extremal surface geometrizes into a Ryu-Takayanagi surface in the ambient space. The topological phase transition of the Ryu-Takayanagi surface in time from connecting different portions of the bath to the one connecting the bath and the brane gives the Page curve of the Hawking radiation that is consistent with unitarity. Nevertheless, there doesn't exit a derivation of the quantum extremal surface prescription and its geometrization in the Karch-Randall braneworld. In this paper, we fill this gap. We mainly focus on the case that the ambient space is (2+1)-dimensional for which explicit computations can be done in each description of the set-up. We show that the topological phase transition of the Ryu-Takayanagi surface corresponds to the formation of the replica wormhole on the Karch-Randall brane as the dominate contribution to the replica path integral. We comment on higher dimensional cases for which we argue that in generic situations the replica wormhole configuration is off-shell due to the Witten-Yau theorem. This necessitates the inclusion of smooth constrained saddles into the gravitational path integral for appropriate questions.</description>

Abstract: Certain physical quantities that characterize neutron stars and quark stars (e.g. their mass, spin angular momentum and quadrupole moment) are interrelated in a way that is approximately insensitive to their internal structure. Such approximately universal relations are useful to break degeneracies in data analysis for future radio, X-ray and gravitational wave observations. Although the pressure inside compact stars is most likely nearly isotropic, certain scenarios have been put forth that suggest otherwise, for example due to phase transitions. We here investigate whether pressure anisotropy affects the approximate universal relations and whether it prevents their use in future observations. We achieve this by numerically constructing slowly-rotating and tidally-deformed, anisotropic, compact stars in General Relativity to third order in spin. We find that anisotropy affects the universal relations only weakly; the relations become less universal by a factor of 1.5-3 relative to the isotropic case, but remain approximately universal to 10%. We succeed in explaining this increase in variability as an increase in the eccentricity variation of isodensity contours, which provides further support for the emergent approximate symmetry explanation of universality. Anisotropy does not affect the universal relations to a sufficient level to prevent their use in gravitational wave astrophysics or in experimental relativity. We provide an explicit example of the latter in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. The increase in variability of the universal relations due to pressure anisotropy could affect their use in future X-ray observations. Given expected observational uncertainties, however, the relations remain sufficiently universal for use in such observations if the anisotropic modifications to the moment of inertia and the quadrupole moment are less than 10% of their isotropic values.</description>

      <title>Spin Tetrad Formalism Of Circular Polarization States In Relativistic Jets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.11650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been of peak interest in the high-energy astrophysics community for their uniquely dynamic nature and incredible radiative power; emanating from supermassive black holes and similarly accreting compact dense objects. An overall consensus on relativistic jet formation states that accelerated outflow at high Lorentz factors are generated by a complex relationship between the accretion disk of the system and the frame-dragging effects of the rotating massive central object. This paper will provide a basis for which circular polarization states, defined using a spin tetrad formalism, contribute to a description for the angular momentum flux in the jet emanating from the central engine. A representation of the Kerr spacetime with positive cosmological constant background is used in formulating the spin tetrad forms. A discussion on unresolved problems in jet formation and how we can use multi-method observations with polarimetry of AGN to direct future theoretical descriptions will also be given.</description>

      <title>Periastron precession effect of $f$-mode dynamical tides on gravitational waves from eccentric double white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07009v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamical tide can play an important role in the orbital motion of close eccentric double white dwarf binaries. As the launching of the space-based gravitational-wave detector, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), is just around the corner, detection of gravitational wave signals from such systems is anticipated. In this paper, we discuss the influence of the dynamical tide on eccentric orbits, focusing on the effect on orbital precession. We show that in orbits with a high eccentricity, resonance can cause a large precession when a harmonic of the orbital frequency matches the natural frequencies of the normal modes of the star. In contrast to the case with circular orbits, each mode can encounter multiple resonances with different harmonics and these resonant regions can cover about 10% of the frequency space for orbits with close separations. In this case, the tidal precession effect is distinct from the other contributions and can be identified with LISA if the signal-to-noise ratio is high enough. However, within the highly eccentric-small separation region, the dynamical tide causes chaotic motion and the gravitational wave signal becomes unpredictable. Even not at resonance, the dynamical tide can contribute up to 20% of the precession for orbits close to Roche-lobe filling separation with low eccentricities and LISA can resolve these off-resonant dynamical tide effects within the low eccentricity-small orbital separation region of the parameter space. For lower mass systems, the dynamical tide effect can degenerate with the uncertainties of the eccentricity, making it unmeasurable from the precession rate alone. For higher mass systems, the radiation reaction effect becomes significant enough to constrain the eccentricity, allowing the measurement of the dynamical tide.</description>

      <title>The shadow and gamma-ray bursts of a Schwarzschild black hole in asymptotic safety</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01154v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We research on the neutrino pair annihilation $\nu+\overline{\nu}\longrightarrow e^{-}+e^{+}$ around a massive source in asymptotic safety. Since neutrinos and photons have the same geodesic equation around black holes, we can estimate the radius where the neutrinos will be released by obtaining a series of trajectory curves with various correction values $\xi$. The black hole shadow radius is influenced by the correction parameter $\xi$. The black hole shadow radius decreases with increasing the $\xi$. The ratio $\dfrac{\dot{Q}}{\dot{Q}_{Newt}}$ corresponding to the energy deposition per unit time over that in the Newtonian case is derived and calculated. We find that the quantum corrections to the black hole spacetime affect the emitted energy rate ratio for the annihilation. It is interesting that the more considerable quantum effect reduces the ratio value slightly. Although the energy conversion is damped because of the quantum correction, the energy deposition rate is enough during the neutrino-antineutrino annihilation. The corrected annihilation process can become a source of gamma ray burst. We also investigate the derivative $\dfrac{\mathrm{d}\dot{Q}}{\mathrm{d}r}$ relating to the star's radius $r$ to show that the quantum effect for the black hole will drop the ratio. The more manifest quantum gravity influence leads the weaker neutrino pair annihilation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13593v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) is an excellent early universe laboratory for testing the fundamental properties of gravity. In this letter, we elucidate on the full potential of pulsar timing array (PTA) by utilizing cosmic variance-limited, or rather experimental noise-free, correlation measurements to understand the SGWB and by extension gravity. We show that measurements of the angular power spectrum play a pivotal role in the PTA precision era for scientific inferencing. In particular, we illustrate that cosmic variance-limited measurements of the first few power spectrum multipoles enable us to clearly set apart general relativity from alternative theories of gravity. This ultimately conveys that PTAs can be most ambitious for testing gravity in the nanohertz GW regime by zeroing in on the power spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been discussed whether viscous processes in neutron star matter during a binary inspiral can damp out the tidal energy induced by the companion and heat up the star. Earlier investigations concluded that this tidal heating is negligible for normal neutron star matter. In this work, we suggest a novel effect of tidal heating involving strange matter in the neutron star interior, that can significantly heat up the star, and is potentially observable by current and future gravitational wave detectors. We propose that this could serve as a direct probe of strangeness in neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complexity will be more and more essential in high-energy physics. It is naturally extended into the very early universe. Considering the universe as a quantum chaotic system, the curvature perturbation of the scalar field is identified with the two-mode squeezed state. By solving the Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger equation, one can obtain the numerical solutions of the angle parameter and squeezing parameter. The solution of the squeezing parameter mainly determines the evolution of complexity. Our numeric indicates that the complexity of the modified dispersion relation will have a non-linear pattern after the horizon exits. Meanwhile, its corresponding Lyapunov index is also larger compared with the standard case. During the inflationary period, the complexity will irregularly oscillate and its scrambling time is also shorter compared with the standard case. Since the modified dispersion relation can be dubbed as the consequences of various frameworks of quantum gravity, it could be applicable to these frameworks. Finally, one can expect the framework of quantum gravity will lead to the fruitful evolution of complexity, which guides us in distinguishing various inflationary models.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Radiation from Eccentric Binary Black Hole System in Dynamical Chern-Simons Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical Chern-Simons (DCS) gravity, a typical parity-violating gravitational theory, modifies both the generation and propagation of gravitational waves from general relativity (GR). In this work, we derive the gravitational waveform radiated from a binary black hole system with eccentric orbits under the spin-aligned assumption in the DCS theory. Compared with GR, DCS modification enters the second-order post-Newtonian (2PN) approximation, affecting the spin-spin coupling and monopole-quadrupole coupling of binary motion. This modification produces an extra precession rate of periastron. This effect modulates the scalar and gravitational waveform through a quite low frequency. Additionally, the dissipation of conserved quantities results in the secular evolution of the semimajor axis and the eccentricity of binary orbits. Finally, the frequency-domain waveform is given in the post-circular scheme, requiring the initial eccentricity to be $\lesssim0.3$. This ready-to-use template will benefit the signal searches and improve the future constraint on DCS theory.</description>

Abstract: Infrared divergence is a common feature of spinfoam models with a vanishing cosmological constant but is expected to disappear in presence of a non-vanishing cosmological constant. In this paper, we investigate the spinfoam amplitude with cosmological constant introduced in arXiv:2109.00034 on the melon graph, which is known as the melonic radiative correction. The amplitude closely relates to the state-integral model of complex Chern-Simons theory. We prove that the melonic radiative correction is finite in presence of a non-vanishing cosmological constant, in contrast to the infrared divergence of spinfoam models with a vanishing cosmological constant. In addition, we also analyze the scaling behavior of the radiative correction in the limit of small cosmological constant.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the impact of post-adiabatic (1PA) terms on parameter estimation for extreme and intermediate mass-ratio inspirals using state-of-the-art waveform models. Our analysis is the first to employ Bayesian inference to assess systematic errors for 1PA waveforms. We find that neglecting 1PA terms introduces significant biases for the (small) mass ratio $\epsilon \gtrsim 10^{-5}$ for quasi circular orbits in Schwarzschild spacetime, which can be mitigated with resummed 3PN expressions at 1PA order. Moreover, we show that the secondary spin is strongly correlated with the other intrinsic parameters, and it can not be constrained for $\epsilon \lesssim 10^{-5}$. Finally, we highlight the need for addressing eccentric waveform systematics in the small-mass-ratio regime, as they yield stronger biases than the circular limit in both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.</description>

      <title>Astronomical Image Blurring from Transversely Correlated Quantum Gravity Fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06757v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations in spacetime can, in some cases, lead to distortion in astronomical images of faraway objects. In particular, a stochastic model of quantum gravity predicts an accumulated fluctuation in the path length $\Delta L$ with variance $\langle \Delta L^2\rangle\sim l_pL$ over a distance $L$, similar to a random walk, and assuming no spatial correlation above length $l_p$; it has been argued that such an effect is ruled out by observation of sharp images from distant stars. However, in other theories, such as the pixellon (modeled on the Verlinde-Zurek (VZ) effect), quantum fluctuations can still accumulate as in the random walk model while simultaneously having large distance correlations in the fluctuations. Using renormalization by analytic continuation, we derive the correlation transverse to the light propagation, and show that image distortion effects in the pixellon model are strongly suppressed in comparison to the random walk model, thus evading all existing and future constraints. We also find that the diffraction of light rays does not lead to qualitative changes in the blurring effect.</description>

Abstract: We consider a specific Hamiltonian formulation of the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity, where the canonical variables are expressed by means of differential forms. We show that some ``position'' variables of this formulation can be always gauge-transformed to zero. In this gauge the constraints of the theory become simpler, and the other ``position'' variables acquire a nice geometric interpretation that allows for an alternative, clearer form of the constraints. Based on these results we derive some exact solutions to the constraints.</description>

      <title>Limiting the Number of Extra Dimensions with Shortcuts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In higher-dimensional theories, a graviton propagating in the bulk can follow a shorter path, known as a shortcut, compared to a photon propagating in a four-dimensional spacetime. Thus by combining the observations of gravitational waves and their electromagnetic counterparts, one can gain insights into the structure and number of extra dimensions. In this paper, we construct a braneworld model that allows the existence of shortcuts in a $D(=4+d)$-dimensional spacetime. It has been proven that the equations for modeling brane cosmology recover the standard Friedmann equations for the late universe. We derive analytically the graviton and photon horizon radii on the brane under the low-energy limit. With the event GW170817/GRB 170817A, we find that the number of extra dimensions has an upper limit of $d\leq9$. Because of the errors in the source redshift and time delay, this upper limit can be shifted to $d\leq4$ and $d\leq12$. Although with the joint constraint on the $\text{AdS}_{D}^{~}$ radius from torsion balance measurements, theories with large $d$ are not yet ruled out, our work provides a new way to limit the number of extra dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the status of the gravitational arrow of time in the case of a spherical collapse of a fluid that conducts heat and radiates energy. In particular, we examine the results obtained by W. B. Bonnor in his 1985 paper where he found that the gravitational arrow of time was opposite to the thermodynamic arrow of time. The measure of gravitational epoch function $P$ used by Bonnor was given by the ratio of the Weyl square to the Ricci square. In this paper, we have assumed the measure of gravitational entropy $P_{1}$ to be given by the ratio of the Weyl scalar to the Kretschmann scalar. Our analysis indicates that Bonnor's result seems to be validated, i.e., the gravitational arrow and the thermodynamic arrow of time point in opposite directions. This strengthens the opinion that the Weyl proposal of gravitational entropy applies only to the universe as a whole (provided that we exclude the white holes).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately modeling the tidal response of neutron stars is crucial to connecting gravitational wave observations of binaries to ultra-dense nuclear physics. Most current models of the tidal response of relativistic stars either assume a static response model, or use phenomenological models inspired by Newtonian gravity. In this work, we present a general formalism for computing the linear dynamical tidal response function of relativistic, spherically symmetric stars. Our formalism incorporates stratification due to thermal and chemical imbalances, allowing one to study the effects of g modes on the tidal response function. We also describe how to incorporate sources of dissipation due to shear and bulk viscosity. To showcase the utility of our approach, we present several applications for polytropic stars in general relativity. We show how our formalism can capture the dynamical tidal resonance due to the f and g modes of inviscid stars and explore the sensitivity of the dynamical tidal response to the compactness of the star. We also compute the dissipative tidal deformability due to bulk and shear viscous dissipation assuming a simple viscous profile for the bulk and shear viscosity.</description>

Abstract: If two initially unbound black holes of masses M_1 and M_2, total mass M = M_1 + M_2, reduced mass mu = M_1 M_2/(M_1+M_2), and initial relative velocity v &lt;&lt; c(4 mu/M) in otherwise empty space are captured into a bound orbit by emitting gravitational radiation, the inspiral time to coalescence increases monotonically to infinity as the impact parameter b approaches from below the critical impact parameter b_c = [340 pi G^7 M^6 mu/(3 c^5 v^9)]^{1/7} = [(85 pi/384)(4 mu/M)]^{1/7}(2GM/c^2)(v/c)^{-9/7} for capture. Assuming a uniform flux of impinging black holes with b &lt; b_c, the cumulative probability for impact parameters smaller than some value $b$, conditional upon the impact parameter being smaller than $b_c$, is $P = (b/b_c)^2$. Then it is shown that the inspiral time for [Mv^2/(4 mu c^2)]^{2/7} &lt;&lt; P &lt; 1 is T = (2 pi GM/v^3) P^{21/4} zeta(3/2,1-P^{7/2}), and closed-form approximate expressions for the inverse function P(T/T_0) with T_0 = 2 pi GM/v^3 are also given.</description>

      <title>Impact of Star Pressure on $\gamma$ in Modified Gravity beyond Post-Newtonian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a concrete example exhibiting marked deviation from the PPN approximation in a modified theory of gravity. Specifically, we derive the exact formula for the Robertson parameter $\gamma$ in Brans-Dicke gravity for compact mass sources, explicitly incorporating the pressure content of these sources. We achieve this by exploiting the $\textit integrability$ of the 00-component of the Brans-Dicke field equation. In place of the conventional PPN result $\gamma_{PPN}=\frac{\omega+1}{\omega+2}$, we obtain the analytical expression $\gamma_{\,exact}=\frac{\omega+1+(\omega+2)\varTheta}{\omega+2+(\omega+1)\varTheta}$ where $\varTheta$ is the ratio of the total pressure $P_\parallel^*+2P_\perp^*$ and total energy $E^*$ contained within the mass source. Our $\textit non\text{-}perturbative$ formula is valid for all field strengths and types of matter comprising the mass source. We draw four key conclusions: (1) The usual $\gamma_{PPN}$ formula is violated in the presence of pressure, viz. when $\varTheta\neq0$, revealing a limitation of the PPN approximation in Brans-Dicke gravity. (2) The PPN result mainly stems from the assumption of pressureless matter. Even in the weak-field star case, non-zero pressure leads to a violation of the PPN $\gamma$ formula. Conversely, the PPN result is a good approximation for low-pressure matter, i.e. when $\varTheta\approx0$, for all field strengths. (3) Observational constraints on $\gamma$ set $\textit joint$ bounds on $\omega$ and $\varTheta$, with the latter representing a global characteristic of a mass source. If the equation of state of matter in the mass source approaches the ultra-relativistic form, entailing $\varTheta\simeq1$, $\gamma_{\,exact}$ converges to 1 $\textit irrespective$ of $\omega$. (4) In a broader context, our findings indicate the latent significance of considering the interior structure of stars in observational astronomy.</description>

      <title>Critical Analysis of Replacing Dark Matter and Dark Energy with a Model of Stochastic Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13037v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze consequences of trying to replace dark matter and dark energy with models of stochastic spacetime. In particular, we analyze the model put forth by Ref. [1], in which it is claimed that ``post-quantum classical gravity" (PQCG), a stochastic theory of gravity, leads to modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) behavior on galactic scales that reproduces galactic rotation curves. We show that this analysis has three basic problems: (i) the equations of PQCG do not lead to a new large scale force of the form claimed in the paper, (ii) the form claimed is not of the MONDian form anyhow and so does not correspond to observed galactic dynamics, and (iii) the spectrum of fluctuations is very different from observations.</description>

Abstract: We study the axial gravitational perturbations of slowly-rotating compact objects which are assumed to be supported by anisotropic fluids. We find that the gravitational perturbations decouple from the matter perturbations for axial sectors. We obtain a master wave equation whose potential is fully determined by the metric functions. This equation makes the calculations of gravitational QNMs for rotating compact objects extremely easy in specific background configurations.</description>

      <title>Well-defined $f(Q)$ Gravity, Reconstruction of FLRW Spacetime and Unification of Inflation with Dark Energy Epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate the convenient and mimetic $f(Q)$ gravities in terms of the metric and four scalar fields with the $Q$ being the non-metricity scalar. As a result, it is shown that the obtained field equations are well-defined. By using the field equations, we show how the $f(Q)$ models which realise any given FLRW spacetime may be reconstructed. We construct convenient $f(Q)$ gravity and mimetic $f(Q)$ gravity, which describe the inflation and dark energy epochs and even unify the inflation and dark energy. Moreover, a radiation-dominated epoch and early dark energy may be easily included in the above theories as is explicitly shown. It is shown that the inflationary spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ are consistent with Planck data for some models of $f(Q)$ gravity. Corresponding asymptotic forms of $f(Q)$ and mimetic $f(Q)$ are given. Finally, some remarks on possible reconstruction for spherically symmetric spacetime are given.</description>

      <title>Gravitational collapse and gravitational wave in Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet theory with two scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the gravitational collapse to form the black hole in the acceleratingly expanding universe in the frame of Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet theory having two scalar fields and we study the propagation of the gravitational wave (GW). The collapsing spacetime can be obtained by using the formulation of the ``reconstruction'', that is, we find a model that realises the desired or given geometry. In the reconstructed models, ghosts often appear, which could be eliminated by imposing constraints. We show that the standard cosmological solutions or self-gravitating objects such as a planet, the Sun, various types of stars, etc., in Einstein's gravity, are also solutions in this model. Using the dynamical value of Gauss-Bonnet coupling, the propagation of the high-frequency GW is investigated. The propagating speed changes due to the coupling during the period of the black hole formation. The speed at which the GW propagates The speed at which the GW propagates going into the black hole is different from that of the wave going out.</description>

      <title>Scalar Perturbations in Nonsingular Universes from Interacting Vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we examine the stability of scalar perturbations in nonsingular models which emerge from an interacting vacuum component. The analysis developed in this paper relies on two phenomenological choices for the energy exchange between a nonrelativistic fluid and a vacuum component. In both scenarios it can be shown that closed models may furnish nonsingular orbits of physical interest in phase space once a decelerated past era is connected to a graceful exit to late-time acceleration. Regarding such configurations as background spacetimes we introduce scalar perturbations in order to examine the stability of these models in a high energy domain. We explicitly show that the vacuum perturbation is not an independent variable and diverges as dynamics approaches the bounce. This feature assigns a rather unstable signature to the dynamics making the choices for the energy transfer ill defined at least for nonsingular configurations at the bounce scale.</description>

      <title>A Black-Hole Excision Scheme for General Relativistic Core-Collapse Supernova Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12939v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fallback supernovae and the collapsar scenario for long-gamma ray burst and hypernovae have received considerable interest as pathways to black-hole formation and extreme transient events. Consistent simulations of these scenarios require a general relativistic treatment and need to deal appropriately with the formation of a singularity. Free evolution schemes for the Einstein equations can handle the formation of black holes by means of excision or puncture schemes. However, in constrained schemes, which offer distinct advantages in long-term numerical stability in stellar collapse simulations over well above $10^{4}$ light-crossing time scales, the dynamical treatment of black-hole spacetimes is more challenging. Building on previous work on excision in conformally flat spacetimes, we here present the implementation of a black-hole excision scheme for supernova simulations with the CoCoNuT-FMT neutrino transport code. We describe in detail a choice of boundary conditions that ensures long-time numerical stability, and also address upgrades to the hydrodynamics solver that are required to stably evolve the relativistic accretion flow onto the black hole. The scheme is currently limited to a spherically symmetric metric, but the hydrodynamics can be treated multi-dimensionally. For demonstration, we present a spherically symmetric simulation of black-hole formation in an $85 M_\odot$ star, as well as a two-dimensional simulation of the fallback explosion of the same progenitor. These extend past 9s and 0.3s after black-hole formation, respectively.</description>

      <title>On the running and the UV limit of Wilsonian renormalization group flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03740v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In nonperturbative formulation of quantum field theory (QFT), the vacuum state is characterized by the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) flow of Feynman type field correlators. Such a flow is a parametric family of ultraviolet (UV) regularized field correlators, the parameter being the strength of the UV regularization, and the instances with different strength of UV regularizations are linked by the renormalization group equation (RGE). Important RG flows are those which reach out to any UV regularization strengths. In this paper it is shown that for these flows a natural, mathematically rigorous generally covariant definition can be given, and that they form a topological vector space which is Hausdorff, locally convex, complete, nuclear, semi-Montel, Schwartz. That is, they form a generalized function space having favorable properties, similar to multivariate distributions. The other theorem proved in the paper is that for Wilsonian RG flows reaching out to all UV regularization strengths, a simple factorization formula holds in case of bosonic fields over flat (affine) spacetime: the flow always originates from a regularization-independent distributional correlator, and its running satisfies an algebraic ansatz. The conjecture is that this factorization theorem should generically hold, which is worth future investigations.</description>

      <title>Viscous hydrodynamic evolution of neutron star merger accretion disks: a code comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accretion disk formed after a neutron star merger is an important contributor to the total ejecta from the merger, and hence to the kilonova and the $r$-process yields of each event. Axisymmetric viscous hydrodynamic simulations of these disks can capture thermal mass ejection due to neutrino absorption and in the advective phase -- after neutrino cooling has subsided -- and are thus likely to provide a lower-limit to the total disk ejecta relative to MHD evolution. Here we present a comparison between two viscous hydrodynamic codes that have been used extensively on this problem over the past decade: ALCAR and FLASH. We choose a representative setup with a black hole at the center, and vary the treatment of viscosity and neutrino transport. We find good overall agreement ($\sim 10\%$ level) in most quantities. The average outflow velocity is sensitive to the treatment of the nuclear binding energy of heavy nuclei, showing a larger variation than other quantities. We post-process trajectories from both codes with the same nuclear network, and explore the effects of code differences on nucleosynthesis yields, heating rates, and kilonova light curves. For the latter, we also assess the effect of varying the number of tracer particles in reconstructing the spatial abundance distribution for kilonova light curve production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sensitivity forecasts inform the design of experiments and the direction of theoretical efforts. To arrive at representative results, Bayesian forecasts should marginalize their conclusions over uncertain parameters and noise realizations rather than picking fiducial values. However, this is typically computationally infeasible with current methods for forecasts of an experiment's ability to distinguish between competing models. We thus propose a novel simulation-based methodology capable of providing expedient and rigorous Bayesian model comparison forecasts without relying on restrictive assumptions.</description>

      <title>What exactly does Bekenstein bound?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bekenstein bound posits a maximum entropy for matter with finite energy confined to a spatial region. It is often interpreted as a fundamental limit on the information that can be stored by physical objects. In this work, we test this interpretation by asking whether the Bekenstein bound imposes constraints on a channel's communication capacity, a context in which information can be given a mathematically rigorous and operationally meaningful definition. We study specifically the \emph{Unruh channel} that describes a stationary Alice exciting different species of free scalar fields to send information to an accelerating Bob, who is confined to a Rindler wedge and exposed to the noise of Unruh radiation. We show that the classical and quantum capacities of the Unruh channel obey the Bekenstein bound that pertains to the decoder Bob. In contrast, even at high temperatures, the Unruh channel can transmit a significant number of \emph{zero-bits}, which are quantum communication resources that can be used for quantum identification and many other primitive protocols. Therefore, unlike classical bits and qubits, zero-bits and their associated information processing capability are generally not constrained by the Bekenstein bound. However, we further show that when both the encoder and the decoder are restricted, the Bekenstein bound does constrain the channel capacities, including the zero-bit capacity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most high-energy constructions that realise a phase of cosmic inflation contain many degrees of freedom. Yet, cosmological observations are all consistent with single-field embeddings. We show how volume selection effects explain this apparent paradox. Because of quantum diffusion, different regions of space inflate by different amounts. In regions that inflate most, and eventually dominate the volume of the universe, a generic mechanism is unveiled that diverts the inflationary dynamics towards single-field attractors. The formalism of constrained stochastic inflation is developed to this end.</description>

      <title>Dynamical friction in dark matter superfluids: The evolution of black hole binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of superfluid dark matter is characterized by self-interacting sub-eV particles that thermalize and condense to form a superfluid core in galaxies. Massive black holes at the center of galaxies, however, modify the dark matter distribution and result in a density enhancement in their vicinity known as dark matter spikes. The presence of these spikes affects the evolution of binary systems by modifying their gravitational wave emission and inducing dynamical friction effects on the orbiting bodies. In this work, we assess the role of dynamical friction for bodies moving through a superfluid core enhanced by a central massive black hole. As a first step, we compute the dynamical friction force experienced by bodies moving in a circular orbit. Then, we estimate the gravitational wave dephasing of the binary, showing that the effect of the superfluid drag force is beyond the reach of space-based experiments like LISA, contrarily to collisionless dark matter, therefore providing an opportunity to distinguish these dark matter models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Throughout the cosmic history, primordial black holes may experience an efficient phase of baryonic mass accretion from the surrounding medium. While the realm of accretion physics is marked by numerous uncertainties, and a comprehensive understanding remains elusive, recent investigations have delved into this area, exploring its implications for the cosmological evolution of these compact objects. Notably, primordial black holes could experience characteristic growths of their masses and spins, accompanied by the emission of radiation, ultimately responsible for feedback effects that could weaken the efficiency of the process. In this chapter we review the basic formalism to describe the accretion rate, luminosity function and feedback effects, in order to provide distinctive predictions for the evolution of the primordial black hole mass and spin parameters.</description>

      <title>Thin-Wall Monopoles in a False Vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study numerically the existence in a false vacuum, of magnetic monopoles which are ``thin-walled'', \ie, which correspond to a spherical region of radius $R$ that is essentially trivial surrounded by a wall of thickness $\Delta\ll R$, hence the name thin wall, and finally an exterior region that essentially corresponds to a pure Abelian magnetic monopole. Such monopoles were dubbed false monopoles and can occur in non-abelian gauge theories where the symmetry-broken vacuum is actually the false vacuum. This idea was first proposed in \cite{Kumar:2010mv}, however, {the proof of the existence of thin-wall, false monopoles given there }was incorrect. Here we fill this lacuna and demonstrate numerically{, for an appropriately modifed potential,} the existence of thin-wall false monopoles. The decay via quantum tunnelling of the false monopoles could be of importance to cosmological scenarios which entertain epochs in which the universe is trapped in a symmetry broken false vacuum.</description>

      <title>From Cavitation to Astrophysics: Explicit Solution of the Spherical Collapse Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05445v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential equations of the form $\ddot R=-kR^\gamma$, with a positive constant $k$ and real parameter $\gamma$, are fundamental in describing phenomena such as the spherical gravitational collapse ($\gamma=-2$), the implosion of cavitation bubbles ($\gamma=-4$) and the orbital decay in binary black holes ($\gamma=-7$). While explicit elemental solutions exist for select integer values of $\gamma$, more comprehensive solutions encompassing larger subsets of $\gamma$ have been independently developed in hydrostatics (see Lane-Emden equation) and hydrodynamics (see Rayleigh-Plesset equation). I here present a universal explicit solution for all real $\gamma$, invoking the beta distribution. Although standard numerical ODE solvers can readily evaluate more general second order differential equations, this explicit solution reveals a hidden connection between collapse motions and probability theory that enables further analytical manipulations, it conceptually unifies distinct fields, and it offers insights into symmetry properties, thereby enhancing our understanding of these pervasive differential equations.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Krylov complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09307v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have systematically investigated the Krylov complexity of curvature perturbation for the modified dispersion relation in inflation, using the algorithm in closed system and open system. Our analysis could be applied to the most inflationary models. Following the Lanczos algorithm, we find the very early universe is an infinite, many-body, and maximal chaotic system. Our numerics shows that the Lanczos coefficient and Lyapunov index of the standard dispersion relation are mainly determined by the scale factor. As for the modified case, it is nearly determined by the momentum. In a method of the closed system, we discover that the Krylov complexity will show irregular oscillation before the horizon exits. The modified case will present faster growth after the horizon exists. Since the whole universe is an open system, the approach of an open system is more realistic and reliable. Then, we construct the exact wave function which is very robust only requiring the Lanczos coefficient proportional to $n$ (main quantum number). Based on it, we find the Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy could nicely recover in the case of a closed system under the weak dissipative approximation, in which our analysis shows that the evolution of Krylov complexity will not be the same with the original situation. We also find the inflationary period is a strong dissipative system. Meanwhile, our numerics clearly shows the Krylov complexity will grow during the whole inflationary period. But for the small scales, there will be a peak after the horizon exits. Our analysis reveals that the dramatic change in background (inflation) will significantly impact the evolution of Krylov complexity. Since the curvature perturbation will transit from the quantum level to the classical level.</description>

      <title>Probing orbits of stellar mass objects deep in galactic nuclei with quasi-periodic eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11190v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are intense repeating soft X-ray bursts with recurrence times about a few to ten hours from nearby galactic nuclei. The origin of QPEs is still unclear. In this work, we investigated the extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) + accretion disk model, where the disk is formed from a previous tidal disruption event (TDE). In this EMRI+TDE disk model, the QPEs are the result of collisions between a TDE disk and a stellar mass object (a stellar mass black hole or a main sequence star) orbiting around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. If this interpretation is correct, QPEs will be invaluable in probing the orbits of stellar mass objects in the vicinity of SMBHs, and further inferring the formation of EMRIs which are one of the primary targets of spaceborne gravitational wave missions. Taking GSN 069 as an example, we find the EMRI wherein is of low eccentricity ($e&lt;0.1$ at 3-$\sigma$ confidence level) and semi-major axis about $O(10^2)$ gravitational radii of the central SMBH, which is consistent with the prediction of the wet EMRI formation channel, while incompatible with alternatives.</description>

      <title>Improved model of large-field inflation with primordial black hole production in Starobinsky-like supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A viable model of large-field (chaotic) inflation with efficient production of primordial black holes is proposed in Starobinsky-like (modified) supergravity leading to the "no-scale-type" K\"ahler potential and the Wess-Zumino-type ("renormalizable") superpotential. The cosmological tilts are in good (within $1\sigma$) agreement with Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation. In addition, the power spectrum of scalar perturbations has a large peak at smaller scales, which leads to a production of primordial black holes from gravitational collapse of large perturbations with the masses about $10^{17}$ g. The masses are beyond the Hawking (black hole) evaporation limit of $10^{15}$ g, so that those primordial black holes may be viewed as viable candidates for part or the whole of the current dark matter. The parameters of the superpotential were fine-tuned for those purposes, while the cubic term in the superpotential is essential whereas the quadratic term should vanish. The vacuum after inflation (relevant to reheating) is Minkowskian. The energy density fraction of the gravitational waves induced by the production of primordial black holes and their frequency were also calculated in the second order with respect to perturbations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational index of the heterotic string</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fundamental heterotic string has a tower of BPS states whose supersymmetric index has an exponential growth in the charges. We construct the saddle-point of the gravitational path integral corresponding to this index. The saddle-point configuration is a supersymmetric rotating non-extremal Euclidean black hole. This configuration is singular in the two-derivative theory. We show that the addition of higher-derivative terms in four-dimensional $N=2$ supergravity resolves the singularity. In doing so, we extend the recently-developed "new attractor mechanism" to include the effect of higher-derivative terms. Remarkably, the one-loop, four-derivative F-term contribution to the prepotential leads to a precise match of the gravitational and microscopic index. We also comment, using the effective theory near the horizon, on the possibility of a string-size near-extremal black hole. Our results clarify the meaning of different descriptions of this system in the literature. The thermal state transitions to a winding condensate and a gas of strings without ever reaching a small black hole, while the index is captured by the rotating Euclidean black hole solution and is constant and thus smoothly connected to the microscopic ensemble.</description>

      <title>Stairway to equilibrium entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the time evolution of the non-equilibrium entropy in the homogeneous isotropization dynamics of the 1RCBH model, which has a critical point in its conformal phase diagram defined at finite temperature and R-charge density. We also evaluate the time evolution of the pressure anisotropy and the scalar condensate of the medium. We disclose a new feature (not present in the Bjorken flow dynamics analyzed in previous works), which is observed for all the analyzed initial data: the formation of a periodic sequence of several close plateaus in the form of a stairway for the entropy density near thermodynamic equilibrium. We find that the period of plateau formation in the stairway is half the period of oscillations of the slowest quasinormal mode of the system, which is therefore strongly tied to the late time dissipative dynamics of the system associated to the irreversibility of entropy production. For the particular case of the purely thermal SYM plasma at zero density and vanishing scalar condensate, we find that the period of the stairway is half the period of oscillations of the slowest quasinormal mode associated to the late time equilibration of the pressure anisotropy of the fluid, while at finite chemical potential the slowest quasinormal mode of the system is associated to the late time equilibration of the scalar condensate.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian Multipoles from the Next-to-Leading Post-Minkowskian Gravitational Waveform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06361v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the frequency-domain LO and NLO post-Minkowskian (PM) waveforms obtained from the tree-level and one-loop amplitudes describing the scattering of two massive scalar objects and the emission of one graviton. We explicitly calculate their post-Newtonian (PN) limit obtaining an expansion up to the third subleading PN order in all ingredients: the tree-level amplitude, the odd and even parts of the real one-loop kernel, and the Compton or "rescattering" cuts, thus reaching 3PN precision for the latter. We provide explicit expressions for the multipole decomposition of these results in the center-of-mass frame and compare them with the results obtained from the classical Multipolar post-Minkowskian (MPM) method. We find perfect agreement between the two, once the BMS supertranslation frame is properly adjusted and the infrared divergences due to rescattering are suitably subtracted in dimensional regularization. This shows that the approach proposed in arXiv:2312.07452 can be applied beyond the soft-regime ensuring the agreement between amplitude-based and MPM results for generic frequencies.</description>

      <title>Quantum diffusion and large primordial perturbations from inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum diffusion describes the inflow of vacuum quantum fluctuations as they get amplified by gravitational instability, and stretched to large distances during inflation. In this picture, the dynamics of the universe's expansion becomes stochastic, and the statistics of the curvature perturbation is encoded in the distribution of the duration of inflation. This provides a non-perturbative framework to study cosmological fluctuations during inflation, which is well-suited to the case of primordial black holes since they originate from large fluctuations. We show that standard, perturbative expectations for the primordial black hole abundance can be significantly modified by quantum-diffusion effects, and we identify a few open challenges.</description>

      <title>Tamed loops: A try for non-renormalizable Einstein gravity in UV-free scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How to describe loop corrections is a fundamental challenge in the quantization of Einstein gravity. In this paper, we give it a try in UV-free scheme, and the result seems to be effective for graviton loops. This indicates that both loops of the renormalizable Standard Model and the non-renormalizable Einstein gravity can be described by the method of UV-free scheme.</description>

      <title>Non-Relativistic Limits of Bosonic and Heterotic Double Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The known stringy non-relativistic (NR) limit of the universal NS-NS sector of supergravity has a finite Lagrangian due to non-trivial cancellations of divergent parts coming from the metric and the $B$-field. We demonstrate that in Double Field Theory (DFT) and generalised geometry these cancellations already happen at the level of the generalised metric, which is convergent in the limit $c \rightarrow \infty$, implying that the NR limit can be imposed before solving the strong constraint. We present the $c$-expansion of the generalised metric, which reproduces the Non-Riemannian formulation of DFT at the (finite) leading order, and the $c$-expansion of the generalised frame, which contains divergences. We also extend this approach to the non-Abelian gauge field of Heterotic DFT assuming a convergent expansion for the O$(D,D+n)$ generalised metric. From this proposal, we derive a novel $c$-expansion for the bosonic part of the heterotic supergravity which is, by construction, compatible with O$(D,D)$-symmetry.</description>
