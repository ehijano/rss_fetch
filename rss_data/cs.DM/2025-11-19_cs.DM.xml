      <title>Geometry of the Reformulation-Linearization-Technique: Domination of Disjunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reformulation-linearization-technique (RLT) is a well-known strengthening technique for binary mixed-integer optimization. It is well known to dominate lift-and-project strengthening, which is based on disjunctive programming (DP) for single-variable disjunctions. In contrast to the latter, the geometry of RLT is not understood completely. We provide some insights by characterizing the points in the corresponding RLT closure geometrically. We exploit this insight to show that RLT even dominates DP approaches based on cardinality equations with right-hand side 1. This is in contrast to cardinality inequalities with right-hand side 1, whose DPs are not dominated. Our results have applications in the strength comparison for the quadratic assignment problem.</description>

      <title>Empirical Quantum Advantage in Constrained Optimization from Encoded Unitary Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Constraint-Enhanced Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (CE-QAOA), a shallow, constraint-aware ansatz that operates inside the one-hot product space of size [n]^m, where m is the number of blocks and each block is initialized with an n-qubit W_n state. We give an ancilla-free, depth-optimal encoder that prepares a W_n state using n-1 two-qubit rotations per block, and a two-local XY mixer restricted to the same block of n qubits with a constant spectral gap. Algorithmically, we wrap constant-depth sampling with a deterministic classical checker to obtain a polynomial-time hybrid quantum-classical solver (PHQC) that returns the best observed feasible solution in O(S n^2) time, where S is the number of shots. We obtain two advantages. First, when CE-QAOA fixes r &gt;= 1 locations different from the start city, we achieve a Theta(n^r) reduction in shot complexity even against a classical sampler that draws uniformly from the feasible set. Second, against a classical baseline restricted to raw bitstring sampling, we show an exp(Theta(n^2)) separation in the minimax sense. In noiseless circuit simulations of TSP instances ranging from 4 to 10 locations from the QOPTLib benchmark library, we recover the global optimum at depth p = 1 using polynomial shot budgets and coarse parameter grids defined by the problem sizes.</description>

      <title>Graph Irregularity via Edge Deletions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We pursue the study of edge-irregulators of graphs, which were recently introduced in [Fioravantes et al. Parametrised Distance to Local Irregularity. IPEC, 2024]. That is, we are interested in the parameter Ie(G), which, for a given graph G, denotes the smallest k &gt;= 0 such that G can be made locally irregular (i.e., with no two adjacent vertices having the same degree) by deleting k edges. We exhibit notable properties of interest of the parameter Ie, in general and for particular classes of graphs, together with parameterized algorithms for several natural graph parameters.
  Despite the computational hardness previously exhibited by this problem (NP-hard, W[1]-hard w.r.t. feedback vertex number, W[1]-hard w.r.t. solution size), we present two FPT algorithms, the first w.r.t. the solution size plus Delta and the second w.r.t. the vertex cover number of the input graph.
  Finally, we take important steps towards better understanding the behaviour of this problem in dense graphs. This is crucial when considering some of the parameters whose behaviour is still uncharted in regards to this problem (e.g., neighbourhood diversity, distance to clique). In particular, we identify a subfamily of complete graphs for which we are able to provide the exact value of Ie(G). These investigations lead us to propose a conjecture that Ie(G) should always be at most m/3 + c, where $m$ is the number of edges of the graph $G$ and $c$ is some constant. This conjecture is verified for various families of graphs, including trees.</description>

      <title>A note on embracing exchange sequences in oriented matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An open problem in convex geometry asks whether two simplices $A,B\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$, both containing the origin in their convex hulls, admit a polynomial-length sequence of vertex exchanges transforming $A$ into $B$ while maintaining the origin in the convex hull throughout. We propose a matroidal generalization of the problem to oriented matroids, concerning exchange sequences between bases under sign constraints on elements appearing in certain fundamental circuits. We formulate a conjecture on the minimum length of such a sequence, and prove it for oriented graphic matroids of directed graphs. We also study connections between our conjecture and several long-standing open problems on exchange sequences between pairs of bases in unoriented matroids.</description>

      <title>The random $k$-SAT Gibbs uniqueness threshold revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for any $k\geq3$ for clause/variable ratios up to the Gibbs uniqueness threshold of the corresponding Galton-Watson tree, the number of satisfying assignments of random $k$-SAT formulas is given by the `replica symmetric solution' predicted by physics methods [Monasson, Zecchina: Phys. Rev. Lett. (1996)]. Furthermore, while the Gibbs uniqueness threshold is still not known precisely for any $k\geq3$, we derive new lower bounds on this threshold that improve over prior work [Montanari and Shah: SODA (2007)].The improvement is significant particularly for small $k$.</description>

      <title>A Computer-Assisted Proof of the Optimal Density Bound for Pinwheel Covering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the covering version of the pinwheel scheduling problem, a daily task must be assigned to agents under the constraint that agent $i$ can perform the task at most once in any $a_i$-day interval. In this paper, we determine the optimal constant $\alpha^* = 1.264\ldots {}$ such that every instance with $\sum_{i} \frac{1}{a_i} \ge \alpha^*$ is schedulable. This resolves an open problem posed by Soejima and Kawamura (2020). Our proof combines Kawamura's (2024) techniques for the packing version with new mathematical insights, along with an exhaustive computer-aided search that draws on some ideas from G\k{a}sieniec, Smith, and Wild (2022).</description>

      <title>Maximizing the number of integer pairs summing to powers of 2 via graph labeling and solving restricted systems of linear (in)equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of finding sets of integers of a given size with a maximum number of pairs summing to powers of $2$. By fixing particular pairs, this problem reduces to finding a labeling of the vertices of a given graph with pairwise distinct integers such that the endpoint labels for each edge sum up to a power of $2$. We propose an efficient algorithm for this problem, which at its core relies on another algorithm that, given two sets of linear homogeneous polynomials with integer coefficients, computes all variable assignments to powers of $2$ that nullify polynomials from the first set but not from the second. With the proposed algorithms, we determine the maximum size of graphs of order $n$ that admit such a labeling for all $n\leq 21$, and construct the maximum admissible graphs for $n\leq 20$. We also identify the minimal forbidden subgraphs of order $\leq 11$, whose presence prevents the graphs from having such a labeling.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the integer solutions of Diophantine equations related to Lehmer's totient conjecture.

      <title>Balanced Fibonacci word rectangles, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25994v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following a recent paper of Anselmo et al., we consider $m \times n$ rectangular matrices formed from the Fibonacci word, and we show that their balance properties can be solved with a finite automaton. We also generalize the result to every Sturmian characteristic word corresponding to a quadratic irrational. Finally, we also examine the analogous question for the Tribonacci word and the Thue-Morse word.</description>
