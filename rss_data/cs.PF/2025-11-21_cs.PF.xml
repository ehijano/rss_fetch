      <title>Efficient Chromosome Parallelization for Precision Medicine Genomic Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale genomic workflows used in precision medicine can process datasets spanning tens to hundreds of gigabytes per sample, leading to high memory spikes, intensive disk I/O, and task failures due to out-of-memory errors. Simple static resource allocation methods struggle to handle the variability in per-chromosome RAM demands, resulting in poor resource utilization and long runtimes. In this work, we propose multiple mechanisms for adaptive, RAM-efficient parallelization of chromosome-level bioinformatics workflows. First, we develop a symbolic regression model that estimates per-chromosome memory consumption for a given task and introduces an interpolating bias to conservatively minimize over-allocation. Second, we present a dynamic scheduler that adaptively predicts RAM usage with a polynomial regression model, treating task packing as a Knapsack problem to optimally batch jobs based on predicted memory requirements. Additionally, we present a static scheduler that optimizes chromosome processing order to minimize peak memory while preserving throughput. Our proposed methods, evaluated on simulations and real-world genomic pipelines, provide new mechanisms to reduce memory overruns and balance load across threads. We thereby achieve faster end-to-end execution, showcasing the potential to optimize large-scale genomic workflows.</description>

      <title>Can Asymmetric Tile Buffering Be Beneficial?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General matrix multiplication (GEMM) is the computational backbone of modern AI workloads, and its efficiency is critically dependent on effective tiling strategies. Conventional approaches employ symmetric tile buffering, where the buffered tile size of the input $A$ along the dimension $M$ matches the output tile size of $C$.
  In this paper, we introduce asymmetric tile buffering (ATB), a simple but powerful technique that decouples the buffered tile dimensions of the input and output operands. We show, for the first time, that ATB is both practical and highly beneficial. To explain this effect, we develop a performance model that incorporates both the benefits of ATB (higher arithmetic intensity) and its overheads (higher kernel switching costs), providing insight into how to select effective ATB tiling factors. As a case study, we apply ATB to AMD's latest XDNA2 AI Engine (AIE), achieving up to a 4.54x speedup, from 4.8 to 24.6 TFLOPS on mixed-precision BFP16--BF16 GEMM, establishing a new performance record for XDNA2 AIE.</description>

      <title>Algorithms and optimizations for global non-linear hybrid fluid-kinetic finite element stellarator simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive modeling of stellarator plasmas is crucial for advancing nuclear fusion energy, yet it faces unique computational difficulties. One of the main challenges is accurately simulating the dynamics of specific particle species that are not well captured by fluid models, which necessitates the use of hybrid fluid-kinetic models. The non-axisymmetric geometry of stellarators fundamentally couples the toroidal Fourier modes, in contrast to what happens in tokamaks, requiring different numerical and computational treatment.
  This work presents a novel, globally coupled projection scheme inside the JOREK finite element framework. The approach ensures a self-consistent and physically accurate transfer of kinetic markers to the fluid grid, effectively handling the complex 3D mesh by constructing and solving a unified linear system that encompasses all toroidal harmonics simultaneously. To manage the computational complexity of this coupling, the construction of the system's matrix is significantly accelerated using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The efficient localization of millions of particles is made possible by implementing a 3D R-Tree spatial index, which supports this projection and ensures computational tractability at scale.
  On realistic Wendelstein 7-X stellarator geometries, the fidelity of the framework is rigorously shown. In sharp contrast to the uncoupled approaches' poor performance, quantitative convergence tests verify that the coupled scheme attains the theoretically anticipated spectral convergence.
  This study offers a crucial capability for the predictive analysis and optimization of next-generation stellarator designs by developing a validated, high-fidelity computational tool.</description>

      <title>KWT-Tiny: RISC-V Accelerated, Embedded Keyword Spotting Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16026v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the adaptation of Transformerbased models for edge devices through the quantisation and hardware acceleration of the ARM Keyword Transformer (KWT) model on a RISC-V platform. The model was targeted to run on 64kB RAM in bare-metal C using a custom-developed edge AI library. KWT-1 was retrained to be 369 times smaller, with only a 10% loss in accuracy through reducing output classes from 35 to 2. The retraining and quantisation reduced model size from 2.42 MB to 1.65 kB. The integration of custom RISC-V instructions that accelerated GELU and SoftMax operations enabled a 5x speedup and thus ~5x power reduction in inference, with inference clock cycle counts decreasing from 26 million to 5.5 million clock cycles while incurring a small area overhead of approximately 29%. The results demonstrate a viable method for porting and accelerating Transformer-based models in low-power IoT devices.</description>
