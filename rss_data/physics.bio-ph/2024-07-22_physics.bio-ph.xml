      <title>Encoding spatiotemporal asymmetry in artificial cilia with a ctenophore-inspired soft-robotic platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A remarkable variety of organisms use metachronal coordination (i.e., numerous neighboring appendages beating sequentially with a fixed phase lag) to swim or pump fluid. This coordination strategy is used by microorganisms to break symmetry at small scales where viscous effects dominate and flow is time-reversible. Some larger organisms use this swimming strategy at intermediate scales, where viscosity and inertia both play important roles. However, the role of individual propulsor kinematics - especially across hydrodynamic scales - is not well-understood, though the details of propulsor motion can be crucial for the efficient generation of flow. To investigate this behavior, we developed a new soft robotic platform using magnetoactive silicone elastomers to mimic the metachronally coordinated propulsors found in swimming organisms. Furthermore, we present a method to passively encode spatially asymmetric beating patterns in our artificial propulsors. We investigated the kinematics and hydrodynamics of three propulsor types, with varying degrees of asymmetry, using Particle Image Velocimetry and high-speed videography. We find that asymmetric beating patterns can move considerably more fluid relative to symmetric beating at the same frequency and phase lag, and that asymmetry can be passively encoded into propulsors via the interplay between elastic and magnetic torques. Our results demonstrate that nuanced differences in propulsor kinematics can substantially impact fluid pumping performance. Our soft robotic platform also provides an avenue to explore metachronal coordination at the meso-scale, which in turn can inform the design of future bioinspired pumping devices and swimming robots.</description>

      <title>Effect of environmental noise on charge diffusion in DNA: Towards modeling its potential epigenetic impact in live processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge diffusion through desoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a physico-chemical phenomenon that on the one hand is being explored for technological purposes, on the other hand is applied by nature for various informational processes in life. With regard to the latter, increasing experimental and theoretical evidence indicates that charge diffusion through DNA is involved in basic steps of DNA replication and repair, as well as regulation of gene expression via epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation or DNA binding of proteins. From the physics point of view, DNA supports a metallic-like behavior with long-range charge mobility. Nevertheless, particularly considering a living environment, charge mobility in DNA needs to take into account omnipresent noise and disorder. Here, we analyze quantum diffusion of single charges along DNA-inspired two-dimensional tight-binding lattices in presence of different sources of intrinsic and environmental fluctuations. It is shown that double-strand lattices, parametrized according to atomistic calculations of DNA sequences, offer a complex network of pathways between sites and may give rise to long-distance coherence phenomena. These effects strongly depend on carrier type (electrons, holes), the energetic profile of the lattice (composition) as well as the type of noise and disorder. Of particular interest are spatially correlated low-frequency fluctuations which may support coherent charge transfer over distances of a few sites. Our results may trigger further experimental activities aiming at investigating charge mobility in DNA both in the native in-vivo context as well as on artificial platforms.</description>

      <title>Hair cells in the cochlea must tune resonant modes to the edge of instability without destabilizing collective modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sound produces surface waves along the cochlea's basilar membrane. To achieve the ear's astonishing frequency resolution and sensitivity to faint sounds, dissipation in the cochlea must be canceled via active processes in hair cells, effectively bringing the cochlea to the edge of instability. But how can the cochlea be globally tuned to the edge of instability with only local feedback? To address this question, we use a discretized version of a standard model of basilar membrane dynamics, but with an explicit contribution from active processes in hair cells. Surprisingly, we find the basilar membrane supports two qualitatively distinct sets of modes: a continuum of localized modes and a small number of collective extended modes. Localized modes sharply peak at their resonant position and are largely uncoupled. As a result, they can be amplified almost independently from each other by local hair cells via feedback reminiscent of self-organized criticality. However, this amplification can destabilize the collective extended modes; avoiding such instabilities places limits on possible molecular mechanisms for active feedback in hair cells. Our work illuminates how and under what conditions individual hair cells can collectively create a critical cochlea.</description>

      <title>Statistical Survey of Chemical and Geometric Patterns on Protein Surfaces as a Blueprint for Protein-mimicking Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recent breakthroughs in understanding how protein sequence relates to structure and function, considerably less attention has been paid to the general features of protein surfaces beyond those regions involved in binding and catalysis. This paper provides a systematic survey of the universe of protein surfaces and quantifies the sizes, shapes, and curvatures of the positively/negatively charged and hydrophobic/hydrophilic surface patches as well as correlations between such patches. It then compares these statistics with the metrics characterizing nanoparticles functionalized with ligands terminated with positively and negatively charged ligands. These particles are of particular interest because they are also surface-patchy and have been shown to exhibit both antibiotic and anticancer activities - via selective interactions against various cellular structures - prompting loose analogies to proteins. Our analyses support such analogies in several respects (e.g., patterns of charged protrusions and hydrophobic niches similar to those observed in proteins), although there are also significant differences. Looking forward, this work provides a blueprint for the rational design of synthetic nanoobjects with further enhanced mimicry of proteins' surface properties.</description>

      <title>Natural convection in the cytoplasm: Theoretical predictions of buoyancy-driven flows inside a cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of temperature gradients within eukaryotic cells has been postulated as a source of natural convection in the cytoplasm, i.e. bulk fluid motion as a result of temperature-difference-induced density gradients. Recent computations have predicted that a temperature differential of $\Delta T \approx 1$ K between the cell nucleus and the cell membrane could be strong enough to drive significant intracellular material transport. We use numerical computations and theoretical calculations to revisit this problem in order to further understand the impact of temperature gradients on flow generation and advective transport within cells. Surprisingly, our computations yield flows that are an order of magnitude weaker than those obtained previously for the same relative size and position of the nucleus with respect to the cell membrane. To understand this discrepancy, we develop a semi-analytical solution of the convective flow inside a model cell using a bi-spherical coordinate framework, for the case of an axisymmetric cell geometry (i.e. when the displacement of the nucleus from the cell centre is aligned with gravity). We also calculate exact solutions for the flow when the nucleus is located concentrically inside the cell. The results from both theoretical analyses agree with our numerical results, thus providing a robust estimate of the strength of cytoplasmic natural convection and demonstrating that these are much weaker than previously predicted. Finally, we investigate the ability of the aforementioned flows to redistribute solute within a cell. Our calculations reveal that, in all but unrealistic cases, cytoplasmic convection has a negligible contribution toward enhancing the diffusion-dominated mass transfer of cellular material.</description>

      <title>Bacterial stress granule protects mRNA through ribonucleases exclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Membraneless droplets formed through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) play a crucial role in mRNA storage, enabling organisms to swiftly respond to environmental changes. However, the mechanisms underlying mRNA integration and protection within droplets remain unclear. Here, we unravel the role of bacterial aggresomes as stress granules (SGs) in safeguarding mRNA during stress. We discovered that upon stress onset, mobile mRNA molecules selectively incorporate into individual proteinaceous SGs based on length-dependent enthalpic gain over entropic loss. As stress prolongs, SGs undergo compaction facilitated by stronger non-specific RNA-protein interactions, thereby promoting recruitment of shorter RNA chains. Remarkably, mRNA ribonucleases are repelled from bacterial SGs, due to the influence of protein surface charge. This exclusion mechanism ensures the integrity and preservation of mRNA within SGs during stress conditions, explaining how mRNA can be stored and protected from degradation. Following stress removal, SGs facilitate mRNA translation, thereby enhancing cell fitness in changing environments. These droplets maintain mRNA physiological activity during storage, making them an intriguing new candidate for mRNA therapeutics manufacturing.</description>

      <title>AI-predicted protein deformation encodes energy landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI algorithms have proven to be excellent predictors of protein structure, but whether and how much these algorithms can capture the underlying physics remains an open question. Here, we aim to test this question using the Alphafold2 (AF) algorithm: We use AF to predict the subtle structural deformation induced by single mutations, quantified by strain, and compare with experimental datasets of corresponding perturbations in folding free energy $\Delta\Delta G$. Unexpectedly, we find that physical strain alone -- without any additional data or computation -- correlates almost as well with $\Delta\Delta G$ as state-of-the-art energy-based and machine-learning predictors. This indicates that the AF-predicted structures alone encode fine details about the energy landscape. In particular, the structures encode significant information on stability, enough to estimate (de-)stabilizing effects of mutations, thus paving the way for the development of novel, structure-based stability predictors for protein design and evolution.</description>

      <title>Data-driven quasiconformal morphodynamic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal imaging of biological epithelial structures yields shape data at discrete time points, leading to a natural question: how can we reconstruct the most likely path of growth patterns consistent with these discrete observations? We present a physically plausible framework to solve this inverse problem by creating a framework that generalises quasiconformal maps to quasiconformal flows. By allowing for the spatio-temporal variation of the shear and dilatation fields during the growth process, subject to regulatory mechanisms, we are led to a type of generalised Ricci flow. When guided by observational data associated with surface shape as a function of time, this leads to a constrained optimization problem. Deploying our data-driven algorithmic approach to the shape of insect wings, leaves and even sculpted faces, we show how optimal quasiconformal flows allow us to characterise the morphogenesis of a range of surfaces.</description>
