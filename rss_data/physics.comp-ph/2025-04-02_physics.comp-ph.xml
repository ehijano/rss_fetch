      <title>Plane-Wave Decomposition and Randomised Training; a Novel Path to Generalised PINNs for SHM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00249v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a formulation of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), based on learning the form of the Fourier decomposition, and a training methodology based on a spread of randomly chosen boundary conditions. By training in this way we produce a PINN that generalises; after training it can be used to correctly predict the solution for an arbitrary set of boundary conditions and interpolate this solution between the samples that spanned the training domain. We demonstrate for a toy system of two coupled oscillators that this gives the PINN formulation genuine predictive capability owing to an effective reduction of the training to evaluation times ratio due to this decoupling of the solution from specific boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Principal Component Stochastic Subspace Identification for Output-Only Modal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic Subspace Identification (SSI) is widely used in modal analysis of engineering structures, known for its numerical stability and high accuracy in modal parameter identification. SSI methods are generally classified into two types: Data-Driven (SSI-Data) and Covariance-Driven (SSI-Cov), which have been considered to originate from different theoretical foundations and computational principles. In contrast, this study demonstrates that SSI-Cov and SSI-Data converge to the same solution under the condition of infinite observations, by establishing a unified framework incorporating instrumental variable analysis. Further, a novel modal identification approach, Principal Component Stochastic Subspace Identification (PCSSI), is proposed based on this framework. This method employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract key components of the signal subspace and project the observed data onto this space, enhancing modal identification stability while significantly reducing computational complexity. Through 5000 Monte Carlo numerical simulations, the statistical analysis shows that PCSSI consistently outperforms traditional SSI methods in terms of numerical stability and noise reduction, demonstrating clear advantages over both SSI-Cov and SSI-Data. Its effectiveness is further validated using experimental data from a scaled bridge model. Compared to conventional SSI approaches, PCSSI demonstrates superior robustness under complex engineering conditions, especially when dealing with limited data or high noise levels, underscoring its strong potential for practical applications.</description>

      <title>An improved update rule for probabilistic computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many hard combinatorial problems can be mapped onto Ising models, which replicate the behavior of classical spins. Recent advances in probabilistic computers are characterized by parallelization and the introduction of novel hardware platforms. An interesting application of probabilistic computers is to operate them in `reverse' mode, where the network self-organizes its behavior to find the input bits that result in an output state. This can be used, for example, as a factorizer of semiprimes. One issue with simulating probabilistic computers on standard logic devices, such as field-programmable gate arrays, is that the update rules for each spin involve many multiplications, evaluation of a hyperbolic tangent, and a high-resolution numerical comparison. We simplify these rules, which improves the spatial and temporal circuit complexity when simulating a probabilistic computer on a field-programmable gate array. Applying our method to factorizing semiprimes, we achieve at least an order-of-magnitude reduction in the on-chip resources and the time-to-solution compared to recently reported methods. For a 32-bit semiprime, we achieve an average factorization in $\sim$100 s. Our approach will inspire new physical realizations of probabilistic computers because we relax some of their update-rule requirements.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Entropy Stable Collocation High-Order DG Methods for Compressible Turbulent Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-order methods are well-suited for the numerical simulation of complex compressible turbulent flows, but require additional stabilization techniques to capture instabilities arising from the underlying non-linear hyperbolic equations. This paper provides a detailed comparison of the effectiveness of entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin methods for the stabilization of compressible (wall-bounded) turbulent flows. For this investigation, an entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method is applied on Gauss-Legendre and Gauss-Lobatto nodes. In the compressible regime, an additional stabilization technique for shock capturing based on a convex blending of a low-order finite volume with the high-order discontinuous Galerkin operator is utilized. The present investigation provides a systematic study from convergence tests, to the Taylor-Green vortex and finally to a more intricate turbulent wall-bounded 3D diffuser flow, encompassing both weakly compressible and compressible regimes. The comparison demonstrates that the DGSEM on Gauss-Lobatto nodes is less accurate due to the lower integration accuracy. Conversely, it is faster than the DGSEM on Gauss-Legendre nodes due to a less severe time step restriction and simpler numerical operator. To the author's knowledge, this is the first time for which a comparison of entropy stable DGSEM on Gauss-Lobatto and Gauss-Legendre has been performed for compressible, wall-bounded turbulent flows with separation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article describes the Wave Kinetic Solver \WavKinSns, a software developed in the Julia language for solving different types of wave kinetic equations in an efficient and modular manner. \WavKinS already solves the wave kinetic equation describing the interaction of waves in several physical systems, such as acoustic waves, Bose-Einstein condensates, internal gravity waves and many others. Thanks to the structures and routines already implemented in \WavKinSns, we expect that developing a new solver for a specific physical system to be straightforward. \WavKinS is an Open Source project distributed with EUPL-1.2 license agreement.</description>

      <title>Tailor-Made Metasurface Camouflage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducing electromagnetic scattering from an object has always been a task, inspiring efforts across disciplines such as materials science and electromagnetic theory. The pursuit of electromagnetic cloaking significantly advanced the field of metamaterials, yet achieving broadband, conformal cloaking for complex, non-trivial objects remains an unresolved challenge. Here, we introduce the concept of 'tailor-made metasurfaces' - machine-designed aperiodic structures optimized to suppress scattering from arbitrary objects by accounting for their layout, including resonant or large-scale features. Specifically, we demonstrated a wideband ~20% fractional bandwidth scattering suppression of more than 20-30 dB for various generic test objects, including randomly distributed wire meshes, spheres, and polygons. The demonstrated evolutionary optimization marks a leap forward in electromagnetic design, enabling the development of high-performance structures to meet complex technological demands.</description>

      <title>Bridging-induced Aggregation in Neutral Polymers: Dynamics and Morphologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the aggregation behavior of neutral stiff (rod-like) and flexible polymer chains mediated by attractive crowders. Attractive crowders serve as bridging agents, inducing aggregation through effective intra-polymer attractions. The critical monomer-crowder attraction strength ($\epsilon_{mc}^*$) required for aggregation differs notably between rigid rods and flexible polymers. Interestingly, this aggregation threshold closely matches the critical attraction required for the extended-to-collapsed (coil-globule) transition of a single flexible polymer chain, suggesting a fundamental connection between single-chain collapse and multi-chain aggregation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $\epsilon_{mc}^*$ decreases with increasing system density and larger crowder sizes, highlighting the synergistic roles of crowding effects and crowder dimensions. Aggregate morphologies exhibit strong dependence on polymer flexibility: rigid rods predominantly form elongated cylindrical bundles, whereas flexible polymers aggregate into compact spherical clusters. These findings provide comprehensive insights into how bridging interactions driven by attractive crowders regulate polymer aggregation dynamics and morphologies, emphasizing the importance of polymer rigidity, crowder size, and system density.</description>

      <title>Efficient spin filtering through Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$-based van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing ab initio simulations, we study the spin-dependent electronic transport characteristics within Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$-based van der Waals heterostructures. The electronic density of states for both free-standing and device-configured Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ (F4GT) confirms its ferromagnetic metallic nature and reveals a weak interface interaction between F4GT and PtTe$_2$ electrodes, enabling efficient spin filtering. We observe a decrease in the magnetic anisotropy energy of F4GT in the device configuration, indicating reduced stability of magnetic moments and heightened sensitivity to external conditions. The transmission eigenstates of PtTe$_2$/ monolayer F4GT/PtTe$_2$ heterostructures demonstrate interference patterns affected by relative phases and localization, notably different in the spin-up and spin-down channels. The ballistic transport through a double-layer F4GT with a ferromagnetic configuration sandwiched between two PtTe$_2$ electrodes is predicted to exhibit an impressive spin polarization of 97$\%$ with spin-up electrons exhibiting higher transmission probability than spin-down electrons. Moreover, we investigate the spin transport properties of Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$/GaTe/Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructures sandwiched between PtTe$_2$ electrodes to explore their potential as magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in spintronic devices. The inclusion of GaTe as a 2D semiconducting spacer between F4GT layers results in a tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) of 487$\%$ at low bias and decreases with increasing bias voltage. In general, our findings underscore the potential of F4GT / GaTe / F4GT heterostructures to advance spintronic devices based on van der Waals materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.14586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cryo-computing - both classical and quantum, is severely limited by the absence of a suitable cryo-memory. The challenge both in terms of energy efficiency and speed have been known for decades, but so far conventional technologies have not been able to deliver adequate performance. Here we present a novel non-volatile memory device which incorporates a superconducting nanowire and an all-electronic charge configuration memristor (CCM) based on switching between charge-ordered states in a layered dichalcogenide material. We investigate the time-dynamics and current-voltage characteristics of such a device fabricated using a NbTiN nanowire and a 1T-TaS2 CCM. The observed dynamical response of the device is faithfully reproduced by modelling of the superconducting order parameter showing versatility of application. The inherent ultrahigh energy efficiency and speed of the device, which is compatible with single flux quantum logic, leads to a promising new memory concept for use in cryo-computing and quantum computing peripheral devices.</description>

      <title>Neurons for Neutrons: A Transformer Model for Computation Load Estimation on Domain-Decomposed Neutron Transport Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03389v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain decomposition is a technique used to reduce memory overhead on large neutron transport problems. Currently, the optimal load-balanced processor allocation for these domains is typically determined through small-scale simulations of the problem, which can be time-consuming for researchers and must be repeated anytime a problem input is changed. We propose a Transformer model with a unique 3D input embedding, and input representations designed for domain-decomposed neutron transport problems, which can predict the subdomain computation loads generated by small-scale simulations. We demonstrate that such a model trained on domain-decomposed Small Modular Reactor (SMR) simulations achieves 98.2% accuracy while being able to skip the small-scale simulation step entirely. Tests of the model's robustness on variant fuel assemblies, other problem geometries, and changes in simulation parameters are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct minimization method on the complex Stiefel manifold in Kohn-Sham density functional theory is formulated to treat both finite and extended systems in a unified manner. This formulation is well-suited for scenarios where straightforward iterative diagonalization becomes challenging, especially when the Aufbau principle is not applicable. We present the theoretical foundation and numerical implementation of the Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) within a localized non-orthogonal basis set. Riemannian Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (RBFGS) method is tentatively implemented. Extensive testing compares the performance of the proposed methods and highlights that the quasi-Newton method is more efficient. However, for extended systems, the computational time required grows rapidly with respect to the number of $\mathbf{k}$-points.</description>

      <title>Entropic learning enables skilful forecasts of ENSO phase at up to two years lead time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends previous work (Groom et al., \emph{Artif. Intell. Earth Syst.}, 2024) in applying the entropy-optimal Sparse Probabilistic Approximation (eSPA) algorithm to predict ENSO phase, defined by thresholding the Ni\~no3.4 index. Only satellite-era observational datasets are used for training and validation, while retrospective forecasts from 2012 to 2022 are used to assess out-of-sample skill at lead times up to 24 months. Rather than train a single eSPA model per lead, we introduce an ensemble approach in which multiple eSPA models are aggregated via a novel meta-learning strategy. The features used include the leading principal components from a delay-embedded EOF analysis of global sea surface temperature, vertical temperature gradient (a thermocline proxy), and tropical Pacific wind stresses. Crucially, the data is processed to prevent any form of information leakage from the future, ensuring realistic real-time forecasting conditions. Despite the limited number of training instances, eSPA avoids overfitting and produces probabilistic forecasts with skill comparable to the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) ENSO prediction plume. Beyond the IRI's lead times, eSPA maintains skill out to 22 months for the ranked probability skill score and 24 months for accuracy and area under the ROC curve, all at a fraction of the computational cost of a fully-coupled dynamical model. Furthermore, eSPA successfully forecasts the 2015/16 and 2018/19 El Ni\~no events at 24 months lead, the 2016/17, 2017/18 and 2020/21 La Ni\~na events at 24 months lead and the 2021/22 and 2022/23 La Ni\~na events at 12 and 8 months lead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces JAX-BTE, a GPU-accelerated, differentiable solver for the phonon Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) based on differentiable programming. JAX-BTE enables accurate, efficient and differentiable multiscale thermal modeling by leveraging high-performance GPU computing and automatic differentiation. The solver efficiently addresses the high-dimensional and complex integro-differential nature of the phonon BTE, facilitating both forward simulations and data-augmented inverse simulations through end-to-end optimization. Validation is performed across a range of 1D to 3D simulations, including complex FinFET structures, in both forward and inverse settings, demonstrating excellent performance and reliability. JAX-BTE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art BTE solvers in forward simulations and uniquely enables inverse simulations, making it a powerful tool for multiscale thermal analysis and design for semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>A predictive machine learning force field framework for liquid electrolyte development</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07181v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the widespread applications of machine learning force fields (MLFF) in solids and small molecules, there is a notable gap in applying MLFF to simulate liquid electrolyte, a critical component of the current commercial lithium-ion battery. In this work, we introduce BAMBOO (\textbf{B}yteDance \textbf{A}I \textbf{M}olecular Simulation \textbf{Boo}ster), a predictive framework for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with a demonstration of its capability in the context of liquid electrolyte for lithium batteries. We design a physics-inspired graph equivariant transformer architecture as the backbone of BAMBOO to learn from quantum mechanical simulations. Additionally, we introduce an ensemble knowledge distillation approach and apply it to MLFFs to reduce the fluctuation of observations from MD simulations. Finally, we propose a density alignment algorithm to align BAMBOO with experimental measurements. BAMBOO demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting key electrolyte properties such as density, viscosity, and ionic conductivity across various solvents and salt combinations. The current model, trained on more than 15 chemical species, achieves the average density error of 0.01 g/cm$^3$ on various compositions compared with experiment.</description>

      <title>Thermal disorder and phonon softening in the ferroelectric phase transition of lead titanate</title>

Abstract: We report a molecular dynamics study of ab initio quality of the ferroelectric phase transition in crystalline PbTiO3. We model anharmonicity accurately in terms of potential energy and polarization surfaces trained on density functional theory data with modern machine learning techniques. Our simulations demonstrate that the transition has a strong order-disorder character, in agreement with diffraction experiments, and provide fresh insight into the approach to equilibrium across the phase transition. We find that the emergence and disappearance of the macroscopic polarization is driven by dipolar switching at the nanometer scale. We also computed the infrared optical absorption spectra in both the ferroelectric and the paraelectric phases, finding good agreement with the experimental Raman frequencies. Often, the almost ideal displacive character of the soft mode detected by Raman scattering in the paraelectric phase has been contrasted with the order-disorder character of the transition suggested by diffraction experiments. We settle this issue by showing that the soft mode coexists with a strong Debye relaxation associated with thermal disordering of the dipoles. The Debye relaxation feature is centered at zero frequency and appears near the transition temperature in both the ferroelectric and the paraelectric phases.</description>

      <title>Projection-based Reduced Order Modelling for Unsteady Parametrized Optimal Control Problems in 3D Cardiovascular Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a projection-based reduced order modelling (ROM) framework for unsteady parametrized optimal control problems (OCP$_{(\mu)}$s) arising from cardiovascular (CV) applications. In real-life scenarios, accurately defining outflow boundary conditions in patient-specific models poses significant challenges due to complex vascular morphologies, physiological conditions, and high computational demands. These challenges make it difficult to compute realistic and reliable CV hemodynamics by incorporating clinical data such as 4D magnetic resonance imaging. To address these challenges, we focus on controlling the outflow boundary conditions to optimize CV flow dynamics and minimize the discrepancy between target and computed flow velocity profiles. The fluid flow is governed by unsteady Navier--Stokes equations with physical parametric dependence, i.e. the Reynolds number. Numerical solutions of OCP$_{(\mu)}$s require substantial computational resources, highlighting the need for robust and efficient ROMs to perform real-time and many-query simulations. Here, we aim at investigating the performance of a projection-based reduction technique that relies on the offline-online paradigm, enabling significant computational cost savings. The Galerkin finite element method is used to compute the high-fidelity solutions in the offline phase. We implemented a nested-proper orthogonal decomposition (nested-POD) for fast simulation of OCP$_{(\mu)}$s that encompasses two stages: temporal compression for reducing dimensionality in time, followed by parametric-space compression on the precomputed POD modes. We tested the efficacy of the methodology on vascular models, namely an idealized bifurcation geometry and a patient-specific coronary artery bypass graft, incorporating stress control at the outflow boundary, observing consistent speed-up with respect to high-fidelity strategies.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Framework for the Electronic Structure of Water: Towards a Universal Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately modeling the electronic structure of water across scales, from individual molecules to bulk liquid, remains a grand challenge. Traditional computational methods face a critical trade-off between computational cost and efficiency. We present an enhanced machine-learning Deep Kohn-Sham (DeePKS) method for improved electronic structure, DeePKS-ES, that overcomes this dilemma. By incorporating the Hamiltonian matrix and their eigenvalues and eigenvectors into the loss function, we establish a universal model for water systems, which can reproduce high-level hybrid functional (HSE06) electronic properties from inexpensive generalized gradient approximation (PBE) calculations. Validated across molecular clusters and liquid-phase simulations, our approach reliably predicts key electronic structure properties such as band gaps and density of states, as well as total energy and atomic forces. This work bridges quantum-mechanical precision with scalable computation, offering transformative opportunities for modeling aqueous systems in catalysis, climate science, and energy storage.</description>
