      <title>Backcasting biodiversity at high spatiotemporal resolution using flexible site-occupancy models for opportunistically sampled citizen science data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many taxonomic groups, online biodiversity portals used by naturalists and citizen scientists constitute the primary source of distributional information. Over the last decade, site-occupancy models have been advanced as a promising framework to analyse such loosely structured, opportunistically collected datasets. Current approaches often ignore important aspects of the detection process and do not fully capitalise on the information present in these datasets, leaving opportunities for fine-grained spatiotemporal backcasting untouched. We propose a flexible Bayesian spatiotemporal site-occupancy model that aims to mimic the data-generating process that underlies common citizen science datasets sourced from public biodiversity portals, and yields rich biological output. We illustrate the use of the model to a dataset containing over 3M butterfly records in Belgium, collected through the citizen science data portal Observations.be. We show that the proposed approach enables retrospective predictions on the occupancy of species through time and space at high resolution, as well as inference on inter-annual distributional trends, range dynamics, habitat preferences, phenological patterns, detection patterns and observer heterogeneity. The proposed model can be used to increase the value of opportunistically collected data by naturalists and citizen scientists, and can aid the understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics of species for which rigorously collected data are absent or too costly to collect.</description>

      <title>Generalisable prediction model of surgical case duration: multicentre development and temporal validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Accurate prediction of surgical case duration underpins operating room (OR) scheduling, yet existing models often depend on site- or surgeon-specific inputs and rarely undergo external validation, limiting generalisability.
  Methods: We undertook a retrospective multicentre study using routinely collected perioperative data from two general hospitals in Japan (development: 1 January 2021-31 December 2023; temporal test: 1 January-31 December 2024). Elective weekday procedures with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status 1-4 were included. Pre-specified preoperative predictors comprised surgical context (year, month, weekday, scheduled duration, general anaesthesia indicator, body position) and patient factors (sex, age, body mass index, allergy, infection, comorbidity, ASA). Missing data were addressed by multiple imputation by chained equations. Four learners (elastic-net, generalised additive models, random forest, gradient-boosted trees) were tuned within internal-external cross-validation (IECV; leave-one-cluster-out by centre-year) and combined by stacked generalisation to predict log-transformed duration.
  Results: We analysed 63,206 procedures (development 45,647; temporal test 17,559). Cluster-specific and pooled errors and calibrations from IECV are provided with consistent performance across centres and years. In the 2024 temporal test cohort, calibration was good (intercept 0.423, 95%CI 0.372 to 0.474; slope 0.921, 95%CI 0.911 to 0.932).
  Conclusions: A stacked machine-learning model using only widely available preoperative variables achieved accurate, well-calibrated predictions in temporal external validation, supporting transportability across sites and over time. Such general-purpose tools may improve OR scheduling without relying on idiosyncratic inputs.</description>

      <title>Second-order spatial analysis of shapes of tumor cell nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intra-tumor heterogeneity driving disease progression is characterized by distinct growth and spatial proliferation patterns of cells and their nuclei within tumor and non-tumor tissues. A widely accepted hypothesis is that these spatial patterns are correlated with morphology of the cells and their nuclei. Nevertheless, tools to quantify the correlation, with uncertainty, are scarce, and the state-of-the-art is based on low-dimensional numerical summaries of the shapes that are inadequate to fully encode shape information. To this end, we propose a marked point process framework to assess spatial correlation among shapes of planar closed curves, which represent cell or nuclei outlines. With shapes of curves as marks, the framework is based on a mark-weighted $K$ function, a second-order spatial statistic that accounts for the marks' variation by using test functions that capture only the shapes of cells and their nuclei. We then develop local and global hypothesis tests for spatial dependence between the marks using the $K$ function. The framework is brought to bear on the cell nuclei extracted from histopathology images of breast cancer, where we uncover distinct correlation patterns that are consistent with clinical expectations.</description>

      <title>Scaling behavioral incentives for low-carbon mobility through digital platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meeting global carbon reduction targets requires large-scale behavioral shifts in everyday travel. Yet, real-world evidence on how to motivate such large-scale behavioral change remains scarce. We evaluate a carbon incentive program embedded in a MaaS platform in Beijing, China, using data from 3.9 million participants and 4.8 billion multimodal trips over 395 days. The program increased reported public transport and bike travel by 20.3% per month and reduced gasoline car use by 1.8% per day, yielding an annual carbon reduction of ~94,000 tons, or 5.7% of certified reductions in Beijing's carbon market. Although effects diminished over time, participants still made 12.8% more green trips per month after eight months, indicating persistence. These results provide the first large-scale empirical evidence of carbon incentives in MaaS and highlight their potential to inform targeted, city-specific interventions that can scale to support global low-carbon mobility transitions.</description>

      <title>The trade-off between model flexibility and accuracy of the Expected Threat model in football</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With an average football (soccer) match recording over 3,000 on-ball events, effective use of this event data is essential for practitioners at football clubs to obtain meaningful insights. Models can extract more information from this data, and explainable methods can make them more accessible to practitioners. The Expected Threat model has been praised for its explainability and offers an accessible option. However, selecting the grid size is a challenging key design choice that has to be made when applying the Expected Threat model. Using a finer grid leads to a more flexible model that can better distinguish between different situations, but the accuracy of the estimates deteriorates with a more flexible model. Consequently, practitioners face challenges in balancing the trade-off between model flexibility and model accuracy. In this study, the Expected Threat model is analyzed from a theoretical perspective and simulations are performed based on the Markov chain of the model to examine its behavior in practice. Our theoretical results establish an upper bound on the error of the Expected Threat model for different flexibilities. Based on the simulations, a more accurate characterization of the model's error is provided, improving over the theoretical bound. Finally, these insights are converted into a practical rule of thumb to help practitioners choose the right balance between the model flexibility and the desired accuracy of the Expected Threat model.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Spatial Treatment Effects and Network Fragility: Theory and Evidence from the 2008 Financial Crisis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 2008 financial crisis exposed fundamental vulnerabilities in interconnected banking systems, yet existing frameworks fail to integrate spatial propagation with network contagion mechanisms. This paper develops a unified spatial-network framework to analyze systemic risk dynamics, revealing three critical findings that challenge conventional wisdom. First, banking consolidation paradoxically increased systemic fragility: while bank numbers declined 47.3% from 2007 to 2023, network fragility measured by algebraic connectivity rose 315.8%, demonstrating that interconnectedness intensity dominates institutional count. Second, financial contagion propagates globally with negligible spatial decay (boundary d* = 47,474 km), contrasting sharply with localized technology diffusion (d* = 69 km)--a scale difference of 688 times. Third, traditional difference-in-differences methods overestimate crisis impacts by 73.2% when ignoring network structure, producing severely biased policy assessments. Using bilateral exposure data from 156 institutions across 28 countries (2007-2023) and employing spectral analysis of network Laplacian operators combined with spatial difference-in-differences identification, we document that crisis effects amplified over time rather than dissipating, increasing fragility 68.4% above pre-crisis levels with persistent effects through 2023. The consolidation paradox exhibits near-perfect correlation (R = 0.97) between coupling strength and systemic vulnerability, validating theoretical predictions from continuous spatial dynamics. Policy simulations demonstrate network-targeted capital requirements achieve 11.3x amplification effects versus uniform regulations. These findings establish that accurate systemic risk assessment and macroprudential policy design require explicit incorporation of both spatial propagation and network topology.</description>

      <title>Practical considerations when designing an online learning algorithm for an app-based mHealth intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ubiquitous nature of mobile health (mHealth) technology has expanded opportunities for the integration of reinforcement learning into traditional clinical trial designs, allowing researchers to learn individualized treatment policies during the study. LowSalt4Life 2 (LS4L2) is a recent trial aimed at reducing sodium intake among hypertensive individuals through an app-based intervention. A reinforcement learning algorithm, which was deployed in one of the trial arms, was designed to send reminder notifications to promote app engagement in contexts where the notification would be effective, i.e., when a participant is likely to open the app in the next 30-minute and not when prior data suggested reduced effectiveness. Such an algorithm can improve app-based mHealth interventions by reducing participant burden and more effectively promoting behavior change. We encountered various challenges during the implementation of the learning algorithm, which we present as a template to solving challenges in future trials that deploy reinforcement learning algorithms. We provide template solutions based on LS4L2 for solving the key challenges of (i) defining a relevant reward, (ii) determining a meaningful timescale for optimization, (iii) specifying a robust statistical model that allows for automation, (iv) balancing model flexibility with computational cost, and (v) addressing missing values in gradually collected data.</description>

      <title>Modeling multi-agent motion dynamics in immersive rooms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Immersive rooms are increasingly popular augmented reality systems that support multi-agent interactions within a virtual world. However, despite extensive content creation and technological developments, insights about perceptually-driven social dynamics, such as the complex movement patterns during virtual world navigation, remain largely underexplored. Computational models of motion dynamics can help us understand the underlying mechanism of human interaction in immersive rooms and develop applications that better support spatially distributed interaction. In this work, we propose a new agent-based model of emergent human motion dynamics. The model represents human agents as simple spatial geometries in the room that relocate and reorient themselves based on the salient virtual spatial objects they approach. Agent motion is modeled as an interactive process combining external diffusion-driven influences from the environment with internal self-propelling interactions among agents. Further, we leverage simulation-based inference (SBI) to show that the governing parameters of motion patterns can be estimated from simple observables. Our results indicate that the model successfully captures action-related agent properties but exposes local non-identifiability linked to environmental awareness. We argue that our simulation-based approach paves the way for creating adaptive, responsive immersive rooms -- spaces that adjust their interfaces and interactions based on human collective movement patterns and spatial attention.</description>

      <title>ForeSWE: Forecasting Snow-Water Equivalent with an Uncertainty-Aware Attention Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various complex water management decisions are made in snow-dominant watersheds with the knowledge of Snow-Water Equivalent (SWE) -- a key measure widely used to estimate the water content of a snowpack. However, forecasting SWE is challenging because SWE is influenced by various factors including topography and an array of environmental conditions, and has therefore been observed to be spatio-temporally variable. Classical approaches to SWE forecasting have not adequately utilized these spatial/temporal correlations, nor do they provide uncertainty estimates -- which can be of significant value to the decision maker. In this paper, we present ForeSWE, a new probabilistic spatio-temporal forecasting model that integrates deep learning and classical probabilistic techniques. The resulting model features a combination of an attention mechanism to integrate spatiotemporal features and interactions, alongside a Gaussian process module that provides principled quantification of prediction uncertainty. We evaluate the model on data from 512 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the Western US. The results show significant improvements in both forecasting accuracy and prediction interval compared to existing approaches. The results also serve to highlight the efficacy in uncertainty estimates between different approaches. Collectively, these findings have provided a platform for deployment and feedback by the water management community.</description>

      <title>Data reuse enables cost-efficient randomized trials of medical AI models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are indispensable for establishing the clinical value of medical artificial-intelligence (AI) tools, yet their high cost and long timelines hinder timely validation as new models emerge rapidly. Here, we propose BRIDGE, a data-reuse RCT design for AI-based risk models. AI risk models support a broad range of interventions, including screening, treatment selection, and clinical alerts. BRIDGE trials recycle participant-level data from completed trials of AI models when legacy and updated models make concordant predictions, thereby reducing the enrollment requirement for subsequent trials. We provide a practical checklist for investigators to assess whether reusing data from previous trials allows for valid causal inference and preserves type I error. Using real-world datasets across breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and sepsis, we demonstrate concordance between successive AI models, with up to 64.8% overlap in top 5% high-risk cohorts. We then simulate a series of breast cancer screening studies, where our design reduced required enrollment by 46.6%--saving over US$2.8 million--while maintaining 80% power. By transforming trials into adaptive, modular studies, our proposed design makes Level I evidence generation feasible for every model iteration, thereby accelerating cost-effective translation of AI into routine care.</description>

      <title>Designing Efficient Hybrid and Single-Arm Trials: External Control Borrowing and Sample Size Calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: External controls (ECs) from historical clinical trials or real-world data have gained increasing attention as a way to augment hybrid and single-arm trials, especially when balanced randomization is infeasible. While most existing work has focused on post-trial inference using ECs, their role in prospective trial design remains less explored. We propose a unified experimental design framework that encompasses standard randomized controlled trials (RCTs), hybrid trials, and single-arm trials, focusing on sample size determination and power analysis. Building on estimators derived from the efficient influence function, we develop hybrid and single-arm design strategies that leverage comparable EC data to reduce the required sample size of the current study. We derive asymptotic variance expressions for these estimators in terms of interpretable, population-level quantities and introduce a pre-experimental variance estimation procedure to guide sample size calculation, ensuring prespecified type I error and power for the relevant hypothesis test. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed hybrid and single-arm designs maintain valid type I error and achieve target power across diverse scenarios while requiring substantially fewer subjects in the current study than RCT designs. A real data application further illustrates the practical utility and advantages of the proposed hybrid and single-arm designs.</description>

      <title>Density ratio model for multiple types of survival data with empirical likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The density ratio model (DRM) is a semiparametric model that relates the distributions from multiple samples to a nonparametrically defined reference distribution via exponential tilting, with finite-dimensional parameters governing their differences in shape. When multiple types of partially observed (censored/truncated) failure time data are collected in an observational study, the DRM can be utilized to conduct a single unified analysis of the combined data. In this paper, we extend the methodology for censored length-biased/truncated data to the DRM framework and formulate the inference using empirical likelihood. We develop an EM algorithm to compute the DRM-based maximum empirical likelihood estimators of the model parameters and survival function, and assess its performance through extensive simulations under correct model specification, overspecification, and misspecification, across a range of failure-time distributions and censoring proportions. We also illustrate the efficacy of our method by analyzing the duration of time spent from admission to discharge in a Montreal-area hospital in Canada. The R code that implements our method is available on GitHub at \href{https://github.com/gozhang/DRM-combined-survival}{DRM-combined-survival}.</description>

      <title>A thermoinformational framework for the description of neuropsychological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a statistical thermodynamics-inspired framework that summarizes multichannel EEG and behavior using macroscopic state variables (entropy, internal energy, temperature, Helmholtz free energy) to quantify stability and reconfiguration in neuropsychological systems. Applied to mother-infant EEG dyads performing the A-not-B task, these variables dissociate neural reconfiguration from behavioral success across a large set of model and feature configurations. Informational heat increases during environmental switches and decision errors, consistent with increased information exchange with the task context. In contrast, correct choices are preceded by lower temperature and higher free energy in the window, and are followed by free-energy declines as the system re-stabilizes. In an independent optogenetic dam-pup paradigm, the same variables separate stimulation conditions and trace coherent trajectories in thermodynamic state space. Together, these findings show that the thermoinformational framework yields compact, physically grounded descriptors that hold in both human and mouse datasets studied here.</description>

Abstract: Electricity price forecasting approaches generally fall into two categories: data-driven models, which learn from historical patterns, or fundamental models, which simulate market mechanisms. We propose a novel and highly efficient data-driven merit order model that integrates both paradigms. The model embeds the classical expert-based merit order as a nested special case, allowing all key parameters, such as plant efficiencies, bidding behavior, and available capacities, to be estimated directly from historical data, rather than assumed. We further enhance the model with critical embedded extensions such as hydro power, cross-border flows and corrections for underreported capacities, which considerably improve forecasting accuracy. Applied to the German day-ahead market, our model outperforms both classic fundamental and state-of-the-art machine learning models. It retains the interpretability of fundamental models, offering insights into marginal technologies, fuel switches, and dispatch patterns, elements which are typically inaccessible to black-box machine learning approaches. This transparency and high computational efficiency make it a promising new direction for electricity price modeling.</description>

      <title>Testing and Improving the Robustness of Amortized Bayesian Inference for Cognitive Models</title>

Abstract: Contaminant observations and outliers often cause problems when estimating the parameters of cognitive models, which are statistical models representing cognitive processes. In this study, we test and improve the robustness of parameter estimation using amortized Bayesian inference (ABI) with neural networks. To this end, we conduct systematic analyses on a toy example and analyze both synthetic and real data using a popular cognitive model, the Drift Diffusion Models (DDM). First, we study the sensitivity of ABI to contaminants with tools from robust statistics: the empirical influence function and the breakdown point. Next, we propose a data augmentation or noise injection approach that incorporates a contamination distribution into the data-generating process during training. We examine several candidate distributions and evaluate their performance and cost in terms of accuracy and efficiency loss relative to a standard estimator. Introducing contaminants from a Cauchy distribution during training considerably increases the robustness of the neural density estimator as measured by bounded influence functions and a much higher breakdown point. Overall, the proposed method is straightforward and practical to implement and has a broad applicability in fields where outlier detection or removal is challenging.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Hype: Embeddings vs. Prompting for Multiclass Classification Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04277v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Are traditional classification approaches irrelevant in this era of AI hype? We show that there are multiclass classification problems where predictive models holistically outperform LLM prompt-based frameworks. Given text and images from home-service project descriptions provided by Thumbtack customers, we build embeddings-based softmax models that predict the professional category (e.g., handyman, bathroom remodeling) associated with each problem description. We then compare against prompts that ask state-of-the-art LLM models to solve the same problem. We find that the embeddings approach outperforms the best LLM prompts in terms of accuracy, calibration, latency, and financial cost. In particular, the embeddings approach has 49.5\% higher accuracy than the prompting approach, and its superiority is consistent across text-only, image-only, and text-image problem descriptions. Furthermore, it yields well-calibrated probabilities, which we later use as confidence signals to provide contextualized user experience during deployment. On the contrary, prompting scores are overly uninformative. Finally, the embeddings approach is 14 and 81 times faster than prompting in processing images and text respectively, while under realistic deployment assumptions, it can be up to 10 times cheaper. Based on these results, we deployed a variation of the embeddings approach, and through A/B testing we observed performance consistent with our offline analysis. Our study shows that for multiclass classification problems that can leverage proprietary datasets, an embeddings-based approach may yield unequivocally better results. Hence, scientists, practitioners, engineers, and business leaders can use our study to go beyond the hype and consider appropriate predictive models for their classification use cases.</description>
