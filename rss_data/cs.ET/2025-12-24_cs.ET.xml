      <title>Developing an NTN Architecture for End-to-End Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) are emerging as critical enablers of global connectivity, particularly in remote, unserved, underserved, or maritime regions lacking traditional infrastructure. While much of the existing work on NTN focuses on theoretical or simulated evaluations, practical implementations remain limited. In this paper, we present SpaceNET, a transparent NTN testbed that leverages the Starlink Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellation in conjunction with Mininet-based emulation to perform end-to-end performance assessments across real-world maritime and terrestrial endpoints that can also be applied to 5th generation (5G). Specifically, we establish a bidirectional link between a ground terminal located in Blacksburg, Virginia, and a maritime terminal aboard a cruise ship near Key West, Florida. We report detailed transmission control protocol (TCP) throughput, user datagram protocol (UDP) throughput, and latency measurements using two different user terminals - a) Smartphone, and b) very small aperture terminal (VSAT), emphasizing the transparent nature of the NTN payload, where the satellite acts solely as a relay node. Our results provide new insights into the performance limits and reliability of commercial LEO-based NTN applications. The SpaceNET testbed offers a reproducible and extensible platform for future research in NTN routing, mobility support, and cross-layer optimization.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric FET-based Logic-in-Memory Encoder for Hyperdimensional Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperdimensional (HD) computing involves encoding of baseline information into large hypervectors and repeated Boolean operations to generate the output class hypervectors which are stored in an associative memory. The classification task is then performed through similarity search operation. While prior studies have focused mostly on accelerating HD search operation using TCAMs based on emerging non-volatile memories, considering the dominant contribution of the encoder module to the energy and latency landscape specifically for complex datasets such as language recognition, DNA sequencing, etc., in this work, we propose energy- and area-efficient single FDSOI ferroelectric (Fe)FET-based logic-in-memory implementations of XOR and 3-input majority gates for N-gram HD encoders. We utilize the proposed FeFET-based encoder in a HD spam filtering accelerator and show that it outperforms the prior emerging non-volatile memory-based implementations in terms of area and energy-efficiency while exhibiting a high classification accuracy of 91.38% on the SMS Spam Collection dataset.</description>

      <title>Validation of Quantum Computing for Transition Metal Oxide-based Automotive Catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing presents a promising alternative to classical computational methods for modeling strongly correlated materials with partially filled d orbitals. In this study, we perform a comprehensive quantum resource estimation using quantum phase estimation (QPE) and qubitization techniques for transition metal oxide molecules and a Pd zeolite catalyst fragment. Using the binary oxide molecules TiO, MnO, and FeO, we validate our active space selection and benchmarking methodology, employing classical multireference methods such as complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and N-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2). We then apply these methods to estimate the quantum resources required for a full-scale quantum simulation of a $Z_2Pd$ ($Z=Al_2Si_{22}O_{48}$) fragment taken from the $Pd/2(Al_xSi_{(1-x)})$ catalyst family where x=Si/Al. Our analysis demonstrates that for large Pd zeolite systems, simulations achieving chemical accuracy would require ~$10^6-10^7$ physical qubits, and range that is consistent with the projected capabilities of future fault-tolerant quantum devices. We further explore the impact of active space size, basis set quality, and phase estimation error on the required qubit and gate counts. These findings provide a roadmap for near-term and future quantum simulations of industrially relevant catalytic materials, offering insights into the feasibility and scaling of quantum chemistry applications in materials science.</description>

      <title>Towards a point-to-point CV-QKD system: Implementation challenges and perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents an analysis of the practical challenges and implementation perspectives of point-to-point continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) systems over optical fiber. The study addresses the physical layer, including the design of transmitters, quantum channels, and receivers, with emphasis on impairments such as attenuation, chromatic dispersion, polarization fluctuations, and coexistence with classical channels. We further examine the role of digital signal processing (DSP) as the bridge between quantum state transmission and classical post-processing, highlighting its impact on excess noise mitigation, covariance matrix estimation, and reconciliation efficiency. The post-processing pipeline is detailed with a focus on parameter estimation in the finite-size regime, information reconciliation using LDPC-based codes optimized for low-SNR conditions, and privacy amplification employing large-block universal hashing. From a hardware perspective, we discuss modular digital architectures that integrate dedicated accelerators with programmable processors, supported by a reference software framework (CV-QKD-ModSim) for algorithm validation and hardware co-design. Finally, we outline perspectives for the deployment of CV-QKD in Brazil, starting from metropolitan testbeds and extending toward hybrid fiber/FSO and space-based infrastructures. The work establishes the foundations for the first point-to-point CV-QKD system in Brazil, while providing a roadmap for scalable and interoperable quantum communication networks.</description>

      <title>All-optical 3-input OR and 2-input AND/NIMPLY logic gates in a linear planar three-core optical fiber coupler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most all-optical logic processing devices reported in the literature rely on nonlinear effects, which increase implementation complexity and hinder scalability in larger optical circuits. In this work, we present the numerical modeling of two all-optical logic gates based on a fully linear, dispersion-free planar symmetric three-core optical fiber coupler. The devices operate with low-power amplitude-modulated pulses and require no nonlinear materials or mechanisms. By exploiting only the fiber geometry and coupled-mode theory, we demonstrate two logic processing functionalities: a 3-input OR gate and a configurable logic gate that performs either the AND or the NIMPLY operation, selected by a control signal. The proposed devices exhibit clear logical discrimination according to a contrast-based performance metric and feature simple structures that favor compact implementations and integration into larger linear photonic architectures.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Goal-Oriented Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Goal-oriented communications offer an attractive alternative to the Shannon-based communication paradigm, where the data is never reconstructed at the Receiver (RX) side. Rather, focusing on the case of edge inference, the Transmitter (TX) and the RX cooperate to exchange features of the input data that will be used to predict an unseen attribute of them, leveraging information from collected data sets. This chapter demonstrates that the wireless channel can be used to perform computations over the data, when equipped with programmable metasurfaces. The end-to-end system of the TX, RX, and MS-based channel is treated as a single deep neural network which is trained through backpropagation to perform inference on unseen data. Using Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM), it is shown that this Metasurfaces-Integrated Neural Network (MINN) can achieve performance comparable to fully digital neural networks under various system parameters and data sets. By offloading computations onto the channel itself, important benefits may be achieved in terms of energy consumption, arising from reduced computations at the transceivers and smaller transmission power required for successful inference.</description>

      <title>LLM-enhanced Air Quality Monitoring Interface via Model Context Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Air quality monitoring is central to environmental sustainability and public health, yet traditional systems remain difficult for non-expert users to interpret due to complex visualizations, limited interactivity, and high deployment costs. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to make sensor data more accessible, but their tendency to produce hallucinations limits reliability in safety-critical domains. To address these challenges, we present an LLM-enhanced Air Monitoring Interface (AMI) that integrates real-time sensor data with a conversational interface via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Our system grounds LLM outputs in live environmental data, enabling accurate, context-aware responses while reducing hallucination risk. The architecture combines a Django-based backend, a responsive user dashboard, and a secure MCP server that exposes system functions as discoverable tools, allowing the LLM to act as an active operator rather than a passive responder. Expert evaluation demonstrated high factual accuracy (4.78), completeness (4.82), and minimal hallucinations (4.84), on a scale of 5, supported by inter-rater reliability analysis. These results highlight the potential of combining LLMs with standardized tool protocols to create reliable, secure, and user-friendly interfaces for real-time environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>Edge-of-chaos enhanced quantum-inspired algorithm for combinatorial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17655v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables. Numerical simulations of them are also useful as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a quantum-inspired algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve surprisingly high performance, namely, almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle intractable combinatorial optimization problems by physics-inspired approaches.</description>
