      <title>Bridging AI and Science: Implications from a Large-Scale Literature Analysis of AI4Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has proven to be a transformative tool for advancing scientific research across a wide range of disciplines. However, a significant gap still exists between AI and scientific communities, limiting the full potential of AI methods in driving broad scientific discovery. Existing efforts in bridging this gap have often relied on qualitative examination of small samples of literature, offering a limited perspective on the broader AI4Science landscape. In this work, we present a large-scale analysis of the AI4Science literature, starting by using large language models to identify scientific problems and AI methods in publications from top science and AI venues. Leveraging this new dataset, we quantitatively highlight key disparities between AI methods and scientific problems in this integrated space, revealing substantial opportunities for deeper AI integration across scientific disciplines. Furthermore, we explore the potential and challenges of facilitating collaboration between AI and scientific communities through the lens of link prediction. Our findings and tools aim to promote more impactful interdisciplinary collaborations and accelerate scientific discovery through deeper and broader AI integration.</description>

      <title>Using Felis to Represent the Semantics and Metadata of Astronomical Data Catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Data Management team of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory has developed a data description language and toolset, Felis, for defining the semantics and metadata of its public-facing data catalogs. Felis uses a rich Pydantic data model for describing and validating catalog metadata, expressed as a human-readable and editable YAML format. Felis also provides a Python library and command line interface for working with these data models. The metadata is used to populate the TAP_SCHEMA tables for the IVOA TAP services utilized by the Rubin Science Platform (RSP). Felis's current capabilities will be discussed along with some future plans.</description>

      <title>Citation Amnesia: On The Recency Bias of NLP and Other Academic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the tendency to cite older work across 20 fields of study over 43 years (1980--2023). We put NLP's propensity to cite older work in the context of these 20 other fields to analyze whether NLP shows similar temporal citation patterns to these other fields over time or whether differences can be observed. Our analysis, based on a dataset of approximately 240 million papers, reveals a broader scientific trend: many fields have markedly declined in citing older works (e.g., psychology, computer science). We term this decline a 'citation age recession', analogous to how economists define periods of reduced economic activity. The trend is strongest in NLP and ML research (-12.8% and -5.5% in citation age from previous peaks). Our results suggest that citing more recent works is not directly driven by the growth in publication rates (-3.4% across fields; -5.2% in humanities; -5.5% in formal sciences) -- even when controlling for an increase in the volume of papers. Our findings raise questions about the scientific community's engagement with past literature, particularly for NLP, and the potential consequences of neglecting older but relevant research. The data and a demo showcasing our results are publicly available.</description>
