      <title>Phase separation and rheology of segregating binary fluid under shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ molecular dynamics simulation to study the phase separation and rheological properties of a three-dimensional binary liquid mixture with hydrodynamics undergoing simple shear deformation. The impact of shear intensity on domain growth is investigated, with a focus on how shear primarily distorts the domains, leading to the formation of anisotropic structures. The structural anisotropy is quantified by evaluating domain sizes along the flow and shear direction. The rheological properties of the system is studied in terms of shear stress and excess viscosity. At low shear rates, the system behaves like a Newtonian fluid. However, the strong-shear case is marked by a transition characterized by non-Newtonian behavior.</description>

      <title>Active phase separation: new phenomenology from non-equilibrium physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In active systems, whose constituents have non-equilibrium dynamics at local level, fluid-fluid phase separation is widely observed. Examples include the formation of membraneless organelles within cells; the clustering of self-propelled colloidal particles in the absence of attractive forces, and some types of ecological segregation. A schematic understanding of such active phase separation was initially borrowed from what is known for the equilibrium case, in which detailed balance holds at microscopic level. However it has recently become clear that in active systems the absence of detailed balance, although it leave phase separation qualitatively unchanged in some regimes (e.g. domain growth driven by interfacial tension via Ostwald ripening), can in other regimes radically alter its phenomenology at mechanistic level. For example, microphase separation can be caused by reverse Ostwald ripening, a process that is hard to imagine from an equilibrium perspective. This and other new phenomena arise because, instead of having a single, positive interfacial tension like their equilibrium counterparts, the fluid-fluid interfaces created by active phase separation can have several distinct interfacial tensions governing different properties, some of which can be negative. These phenomena can be broadly understood by studying continuum field theories for a single conserved scalar order parameter (the fluid density), supplemented with a velocity field if momentum conservation is also present. More complex regimes arise in systems described by multiple scalar order parameters (especially with nonreciprocal interactions between these); or when an order parameter undergoes both conserved and non-conserved dynamics (such that the combination breaks detailed balance); or in systems that support orientational long-range order in one or more of the coexisting phases.

      <title>String-like Rearrangements Induce Mobility in Supercooled Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical heterogeneity is a signature phenomenon of deeply supercooled liquids and glasses. Here, we demonstrate that the spatiotemporal correlations between local relaxation events that underpin it are the result of local relaxation events raising the likelihood that other relaxation events subsequently occur nearby, confirming a widely held, but until now unsubstantiated, belief that dynamical facilitation is responsible for dynamical heterogeneity. We find that mobility is propagated through the entrainment of particles into elementary string-like rearrangements, known as microstrings, and not through perturbing the structure surrounding these rearrangements.</description>

      <title>The bcc coating of Lennard-Jones crystal nuclei vanishes with a change of local structure detection algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the influential work of ten Wolde, Ruiz-Montero, and Frenkel [Phys. Rev. Lett. 75, 2714 (1995)], crystal nucleation from a Lennard-Jones fluid has been regarded as a paradigmatic example of metastable crystal ordering at the surface of a critical nucleus. We apply seven commonly used local structure detection algorithms to characterize crystal nuclei obtained from transition path sampling simulations. The polymorph composition of these nuclei varies significantly depending on the algorithm used. Our results indicate that one should be very careful when characterizing the local structure near solid-solid and solid-fluid interfaces. Particles near such interfaces exhibit a local structure distinct from that of bulk fluid or bulk crystal phases. We argue that incorporating outlier detection into the local structure detection method is beneficial, leading to greater confidence in the classification results. Interestingly, the bcc coating nearly disappears when adopting a machine learning method with outlier detection.</description>

      <title>Fingering instability in dewetting capillary nanosuspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the fingering instability that forms when a capillary nanosuspension liquid bridge is stretched. The dewetting process is observed using a transparent lifted Hele-Shaw cell. The liquid bridge is stretched under constant acceleration, and the resulting instability patterns are recorded using two high-speed cameras. Finger-like structures, characteristic of the Saffman-Taylor instability are observed. The total length of the dendrites and the overlapped number of branches are quantified. We reveal the roles of microparticles, nanoparticles, and the secondary liquid during the fingering instability. Addition of microparticles to pure liquid enhanced finger length due to increased particle interactions and nucleation sites for bubbles. Addition of secondary fluid reduces fingering length by forming a strong interparticle network. Incorporation of Nanoparticles induces an early onset of cavitation and enhanced fingering instability. However, nanoparticles make the capillary suspensions' overall micro-structure more homogeneous, reduce the sample variation in fingering patterns, and promote the even distribution of gel on both slides during splitting. These findings highlight the complex interactions governing dewetting in capillary (nano)suspensions. This knowledge has potential applications in microfluidics, 3D printing, and thin-film coatings, where controlling dewetting is crucial.</description>

      <title>Sliding or Rolling? Characterizing single-particle contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contacts between particles in dense, sheared suspensions are believed to underpin much of their rheology. Roughness and adhesion are known to constrain the relative motion of particles, and thus globally affect the shear response, but an experimental description of how they microscopically influence the transmission of forces and relative displacements within contacts is lacking. Here we show that an innovative colloidal-probe atomic force microscopy technique allows the simultaneous measurement of normal and tangential forces exchanged between tailored surfaces and microparticles while tracking their relative sliding and rolling, unlocking the direct measurement of coefficients of rolling friction, as well as of sliding friction. We demonstrate that, in the presence of sufficient traction, particles spontaneously roll, reducing dissipation and promoting longer-lasting contacts. Conversely, when rolling is prevented, friction is greatly enhanced for rough and adhesive surfaces, while smooth particles coated by polymer brushes maintain well-lubricated contacts. We find that surface roughness induces rolling due to load-dependent asperity interlocking, leading to large off-axis particle rotations. In contrast, smooth, adhesive surfaces promote rolling along the principal axis of motion. Our results offer direct values of friction coefficients for numerical studies and an interpretation of the onset of discontinuous shear thickening based on them, opening up new ways to tailor rheology via contact engineering.</description>

      <title>Liquid Crystal Ground States on Cones with Anti-Twist Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometry and topology play a fundamental role in determining pattern formation on 2D surfaces in condensed matter physics. For example, local positive Gaussian curvature of a 2D surface attracts positive topological defects in a liquid crystal phase confined to the curved surface while repelling negative topological defects. Although the cone geometry is flat on the flanks, the concentrated Gaussian curvature at the cone apex geometrically frustrates liquid crystal orientational fields arbitrarily far away. The apex acts as an unquantized pseudo-defect interacting with the topological defects on the flank. By exploiting the conformal mapping methods of F. Vafa et al., we explore a simple theoretical framework to understand the ground states of liquid crystals with $p$-fold rotational symmetry on cones, and uncover important finite size effects for the ground states with boundary conditions that confine both plus and minus defects to the cone flanks. By combining the theory and simulations, we present new results for liquid crystal ground states on cones with anti-twist boundary conditions at the cone base, which enforce a total topological charge of $-1$. We find that additional quantized negative defects are created on the flank as the cone apex becomes sharper via a defect unbinding process, such that an equivalent number of quantized positive defects become trapped at the apex, thus partially screening the apex charge, whose magnitude is a continuous function of cone angle.</description>

      <title>Consequences of the failure of equipartition for the p-V behavior of liquid water and the hydration free energy components of a small protein</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earlier we showed that in the molecular dynamics simulation of a rigid model of water it is necessary to use an integration time-step $\delta t \leq 0.5$ fs to ensure equipartition between translational and rotational modes. Here we extend that study in the $NVT$ ensemble to $NpT$ conditions and to an aqueous protein. We study neat liquid water with the rigid, SPC/E model and the protein BBA (PDB ID: 1FME) solvated in the rigid, TIP3P model. We examine integration time-steps ranging from $0.5$ fs to $4.0$ fs for various thermostat plus barostat combinations. We find that a small $\delta t$ is necessary to ensure consistent prediction of the simulation volume. Hydrogen mass repartitioning alleviates the problem somewhat, but is ineffective for the typical time-step used with this approach. The compressibility, a measure of volume fluctuations, and the dielectric constant, a measure of dipole moment fluctuations, are also seen to be sensitive to $\delta t$. Using the mean volume estimated from the $NpT$ simulation, we examine the electrostatic and van der Waals contribution to the hydration free energy of the protein in the $NVT$ ensemble. These contributions are also sensitive to $\delta t$. In going from $\delta t = 2$ fs to $\delta t = 0.5$ fs, the change in the net electrostatic plus van der Waals contribution to the hydration of BBA is already in excess of the folding free energy reported for this protein.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Critical Micelle Concentration of Nonionic and Ionic Surfactants by Self-Consistent Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the critical micelle concentration (CMC) and understanding its relationship with both the intrinsic molecular structures and environmental conditions are crucial for the rational design of surfactants. Here, we develop a self-consistent field theory which unifies the study of CMC, micellar structure and kinetic pathway of micellization in one framework. The long-range electrostatic interactions are accurately treated, which not only makes the theory applicable to both nonionic and ionic surfactants but also enables us to capture a variety of salt effects. The effectiveness and versatility of the theory is verified by applying it to three types of commonly used surfactants. For polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers (C$_m$E$_n$) surfactants, we predict a wide span of CMC from $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-2}$M as the composition parameters $m$ and $n$ are adjusted. For the ionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactant, we show the decrease of CMC as salt concentration increases, and capture both the specific cation effect and the specific anion effect. Furthermore, for sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES) surfactants, we find a non-monotonic dependence of both the CMC and micelle size on the number of oxyethylene groups. Our theoretical predictions of CMC are in quantitative agreement with experimental data reported in literature for all the three types of surfactants.</description>

      <title>Specific heat at low temperatures in quasiplanar molecular crystals: Where do glassy anomalies in minimally disordered crystals come from?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present low-temperature specific heat (Cp) measurements of a monoclinic P2_{1}/c crystal formed by quasiplanar molecules of tetrachloro-m-xylene. The dynamic disorder frozen at low-temperature of the asymmetric unit (formed by a half molecule) consists of reorientation around a three-fold-like axis perpendicular to the benzene ring. Such a minimal disorder gives rise to typical glassy anomalies, as a linear in contribution in Cp ascribed to two-level systems and a broad maximum around 6.6 K in Cp/T^3 (the boson peak). We discuss these results in the framework of other quasiplanar molecular crystals with different accountable number of in-plane molecular orientations We find that the density of two-level systems does not correlate with the degree of orientational disorder. Rather, it is the molecular asymmetry that seems to play a relevant role in the thermal anomalies. Furthermore, we discuss the suggested correlation between the boson peak and Debye temperatures. We find that a linear correlation between the boson peak and Debye temperatures holds for many -- but not all -- structural glasses and strikingly holds even better for some disordered crystals, including our studied quasiplanar molecular crystals.</description>

      <title>Stagnation points at grain contacts generate an elastic flow instability in 3D porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many environmental, energy, and industrial processes involve the flow of polymer solutions in three-dimensional (3D) porous media where fluid is confined to navigate through complex pore space geometries. As polymers are transported through the tortuous pore space, elastic stresses accumulate, leading to the onset of unsteady flow fluctuations above a threshold flow rate. How does pore space geometry influence the development and features of this elastic instability? Here, we address this question by directly imaging polymer solution flow in microfabricated 3D ordered porous media with precisely controlled geometries consisting of simple-cubic (SC) or body-centered cuboid (BC) arrays of spherical grains. In both cases, we find that the flow instability is generated at stagnation points arising at the contacts between grains rather than at the polar upstream/downstream grain surfaces, as is the case for flow around a single grain. The characteristics of the flow instability are strongly dependent on the unit cell geometry: in SC packings, the instability manifests through the formation of time-dependent, fluctuating 3D eddies, whereas in BC packings, it manifests as continual fluctuating 'wobbles' and crossing in the flow pathlines. Despite this difference, we find that characteristics of the transition from steady to unsteady flow with increasing flow rate have commonalities across geometries. Moreover, for both packing geometries, our data indicate that extensional flow-induced polymeric stresses generated by contact-associated stagnation points are the primary contributor to the macroscopic resistance to flow across the entire medium. Altogether, our work highlights the pivotal role of inter-grain contacts -- which are typically idealized as discrete points and therefore overlooked, but are inherent in most natural and engineered media -- in shaping elastic instabilities in porous media.</description>

      <title>Testing the Heterogeneous-Elasticity Theory for low-energy excitations in structural glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the statistical mechanics of low-energy excitations in structural glasses has been the focus of extensive research efforts in the past decades due to their key roles in determining the low-temperature mechanical and transport properties of these intrinsically nonequilibrium materials. While it is established that glasses feature low-energy nonphononic excitations that follow a nonDebye vibrational density of states, we currently lack a well-founded theory of these fundamental objects and their vibrational spectra. A recent theory -- that builds on the so-called Heterogeneous-Elasticity Theory (HET) and its extensions -- provides explicit predictions for the scaling of the low-frequency tail of the nonphononic spectrum of glasses, the localization properties of the vibrational modes that populate this tail, and its connections to glass formation history and to the form of the distribution of weak microscopic (interatomic) stresses. Here, we employ computer models of structural glasses to quantitatively test these predictions. Our findings do not support the HET's predictions regarding the nature and statistics of low-energy excitations in glasses, highlighting the need for additional theoretical developments.</description>

      <title>Beyond Dipolar Activity: Quadrupolar Stress Drives Collapse of Nematic Order on Frictional Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of active nematics has traditionally employed descriptions based on dipolar activity, with interactions that align along a single axis. However, it has been theoretically predicted that interactions with a substrate, prevalent in most biological systems, would require novel forms of activity, such as quadrupolar activity, that are governed by hydrodynamic screening. Here, by combining experiments and numerical simulations, we show that upon light-induced solidification of the underlying medium, microtubule-kinesin mixtures undergo a transformation that leads to a biphasic active suspension. Using an active lyotropic model, we prove that the transition is governed by screening effects that alter the dominant form of active stress. Specifically, the combined effect of friction and quadrupolar activity leads to a hierarchical folding that follows the intrinsic bend instability of the active nematic layer. Our results demonstrate the dynamics of the collapse of orientational order in active nematics and present a new route for controlling active matter by modifying the activity through changing the surrounding environment.</description>

      <title>Glass Transition in Monolayers of Rough Colloidal Ellipsoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structure-dynamics correlation is one of the major ongoing debates in the glass transition, although a number of structural features have been found connected to the dynamic heterogeneity in different glass-forming colloidal systems. Here using colloidal experiments combined with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the glass transition in monolayers of rough colloidal ellipsoids. Compared with smooth colloidal ellipsoids, the surface roughness of ellipsoids is found to significantly change the nature of glass transition. In particular, we find that the surface roughness induced by coating only a few small hemispheres on the ellipsoids can eliminate the existence of orientational glass and the two-step glass transition found in monolayers of smooth ellipsoids. This is due to the surface roughness-induced coupling between the translational and rotational degrees of freedom in colloidal ellipsoids, which also destroys the structure-dynamics correlation found in glass-forming suspensions of colloidal ellipsoids. Our results not only suggest a new way of using surface roughness to manipulate the glass transition in colloidal systems, but also highlight the importance of detailed particle shape on the glass transition and structure-dynamics correlation in suspensions of anisotropic colloids.</description>

      <title>Displacement correlations in a two-dimensional colloidal liquid and their relationship with shear strain correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlations of the displacement field in a two-dimensional model colloidal liquid is studied numerically and analytically. By calculating the displacement correlations and the shear strain correlations from the numerical data of particle simulations, the displacement field is shown to have nontrivial correlations, even in liquids that are only slightly glassy with the area fraction as low as 0.5. It is suggested analytically and demonstrated numerically that the displacement correlations are more informative than the shear correlations: the former behaves logarithmically with regard to the spatial distance at shorter scales, while the corresponding information is missing from the shear correlations. The logarithmic behavior of the displacement correlations is interpreted as manifesting a long-lived aspect of the cage effect.</description>

      <title>Characterising the slow dynamics of the swap Monte Carlo algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The swap Monte Carlo algorithm introduces non-physical dynamic rules to accelerate the exploration of the configuration space of supercooled liquids. Its success raises deep questions regarding the nature and physical origin of the slow dynamics of dense liquids, and how it is affected by swap moves. We provide a detailed analysis of the slow dynamics generated by the swap Monte Carlo algorithm at very low temperatures in two glass-forming models. We find that the slowing down of the swap dynamics is qualitatively distinct from its local Monte Carlo counterpart, with considerably suppressed dynamic heterogeneity both at single-particle and collective levels. Our results suggest that local kinetic constraints are drastically reduced by swap moves, leading to nearly Gaussian and diffusive dynamics and weakly growing dynamic correlation lengthscales. The comparison between static and dynamic fluctuations shows that swap Monte Carlo is a nearly optimal local equilibrium algorithm, suggesting that further progress should necessarily involve collective or driven algorithms.</description>

      <title>Diffusion of impurities in a moderately dense confined granular gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mass transport of impurities immersed in a confined quasi-two-dimensional moderately dense granular gas of inelastic hard spheres is studied. The effect of the confinement on granular particles is modeled through a collisional model (the so-called $\Delta$-model) that includes an effective mechanism to transfer the kinetic energy injected by vibration in the vertical direction to the horizontal degrees of freedom of grains. The impurity can differ in mass, diameter, inelasticity, or the energy injection at collisions, compared to the gas particles. The Enskog--Lorentz kinetic equation for the impurities is solved via the Chapman--Enskog method to first order in spatial gradients for states close to the homogeneous steady state. As usual, the three diffusion transport coefficients for tracer particles in a mixture are given in terms of the solutions of a set of coupled linear integral equations which are solved by considering the lowest Sonine approximation. The theoretical predictions for the tracer diffusion coefficient (relating the mass flux with the gradient of the number density of tracer particles) are compared with both direct simulation Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations. The agreement is in general good, except for strong inelasticity and/or large contrast of energy injection at tracer-gas collisions compared to gas-gas collisions. Finally, as an application of our results, the segregation problem induced by both a thermal gradient and gravity is exhaustively analyzed.</description>

      <title>The origin of strings and rings in the atomic dynamics of disordered systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has long been believed that the atomic dynamics in disordered structures, such as undercooled liquids and pre-melted interfaces, are characterized by collective atomic rearrangements in the form of quasi-one-dimensional chains of atomic displacements (strings) and their closed forms (rings). Here, we show by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that strings do not form by a single collective event. Instead, they are simply MD trajectories of propagating local density perturbations, which we call densitons. The atoms on this trajectory are physically indistinguishable from their environments except for the moving head of the string (densiton). A densiton migrates by either single-atom jumps or a concerted rearrangement of 2-3 atoms. The simulations reveal a remarkable similarity between the strings in disordered and crystalline structures, in which the densitons localize into point defects. This work calls for a significant reinterpretation of the string concept and instead proposes a densiton model of the atomic dynamics.</description>

      <title>More ATP Does Not Equal More Contractility: Power And Remodelling In Reconstituted Actomyosin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.00764v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cytoskeletal component actomyosin is a canonical example of active matter since the powerstroke cycle locally converts chemical energy in the form of adenoside triphosphate (ATP) into mechanical work for remodelling. Observing myosin II minifilaments as they remodel actin {\it in vitro}, we now report that: at high concentrations of ATP, myosin minifilaments form metastable swirling patterns that are characterised by recurrent vortex and spiral-like motifs, whereas; at low concentrations of ATP, such structures give way to aster-like patterns. To explain this, we construct the (quasi-)steady states of a polar active hydrodynamic theory of actomyosin whose ATP-scaling is obtained from a microscopic, stochastic description for the ATP-dependent binding of the heads of single myosin II minifilaments. The latter codifies the heuristic that, since the powerstroke cycle involves the unbinding of myosin II heads from actin, increases in the concentration of ATP reduce the likelihood that a given myosin II minifilament has more than one head bound simultaneously, reducing its ability to generate contractile forces and increasing the relative likelihood of processive motion. This reproduces several qualitative and some quantitative aspects of experiments, providing evidence for the central phenomenon of the theory: an ATP-dependent active contractile instability. ATP therefore controls not only the rate at which work is done -- \textit{i.e.,} the power -- but also the mode by which this occurs.</description>

      <title>A Physics Preserving Neural Network Based Approach for Constitutive Modeling of Isotropic Fibrous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13357v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new neural network architecture that strictly enforces constitutive constraints such as polyconvexity, frame-indifference, and the symmetry of the stress and material stiffness. Additionally, we show that the accuracy of the stress and material stiffness predictions is significantly improved for this neural network by using a Sobolev minimization strategy that includes derivative terms. Using our neural network, we model the constitutive behavior of fibrous-type discrete network material. With Sobolev minimization, we obtain a normalized mean square error of 0.15% for the strain energy density, 0.815% averaged across the components of the stress, and 5.4% averaged across the components of the stiffness tensor. This machine-learned constitutive model was deployed in a finite element simulation of a facet capsular ligament. The displacement fields and stress-strain curves were compared to a multiscale simulation that required running on a GPU-based supercomputer. The new approach maintained upward of 85% accuracy in stress up to 70% strain while reducing the computation cost by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Quantum Delocalization Enables Water Dissociation on Ru(0001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the long-standing question of whether water molecules dissociate on the Ru(0001) surface through nanosecond-scale path-integral molecular dynamics simulations on a sizable supercell. This is made possible through the development of an efficient and reliable machine-learning potential with near first-principles accuracy, overcoming the limitations of previous ab initio studies. We show that the quantum delocalization associated with nuclear quantum effects enables rapid and frequent proton transfers between water molecules, thereby facilitating the water dissociation on Ru(0001). This work provides the direct theoretical evidence of water dissociation on Ru(0001), resolving the enduring issue in surface sciences and offering crucial atomistic insights into water-metal interfaces.</description>
