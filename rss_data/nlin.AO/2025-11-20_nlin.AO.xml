      <title>Structural transitions induced by adaptive rewiring in networks with fixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate structural transitions in adaptive networks where node states remain fixed and only the connections evolve via state-dependent rewiring. Using a general framework characterized by probabilistic rules for disconnection and reconnection based on node similarity, we systematically explore how homophilic and heterophilic interactions influence network topology. A mean-field approximation for the stationary density of active links-those connecting nodes in different states-is developed to determine the conditions under which fragmentation occurs. Analytical results closely agree with numerical simulations. To distinguish community formation from fragmentation, we introduce order parameters that integrate modularity and connectivity. This enables the characterization of three distinct network phases on the rewiring parameter space: i) random connectivity, ii) community structure, and iii) fragmentation. Community structure emerges only under moderate homophily, while extreme homophily or heterophily lead to fragmentation or random networks, respectively. These findings demonstrate that adaptive rewiring alone, independent of node dynamics, can drive complex structural self-organization, with implications for social, technological, and ecological systems where node attributes are intrinsically stable.</description>

      <title>Quantum spin van der Pol oscillator -- a spin-based limit-cycle oscillator exhibiting quantum synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum spin van der Pol (vdP) oscillator as a prototypical model of quantum spinbased limit-cycle oscillators, which coincides with the quantum optical vdP oscillator in the high-spin limit. The system is described as a noisy limit-cycle oscillator in the semiclassical regime at large spin numbers, exhibiting frequency entrainment to a periodic drive. Even in the smallest spin-1 case, mutual synchronization, Arnold tongues, and entanglement tongues in two dissipatively coupled oscillators, and collective synchronization in all-to-all coupled oscillators are clearly observed. The proposed quantum spin vdP oscillator will provide a useful platform for analyzing quantum spin synchronization.</description>

      <title>Designing topological cluster synchronization patterns with the Dirac operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing stable cluster synchronization patterns is a fundamental challenge in nonlinear dynamics of networks with great relevance to understanding neuronal and brain dynamics. So far, cluster synchronization has been studied exclusively in a node-based dynamical approach, according to which oscillators are associated only with the nodes of the network. Here, we propose a topological synchronization dynamics model based on the use of the Topological Dirac operator, which allows us to design cluster synchronization patterns for topological oscillators associated with both nodes and edges of a network. In particular, by modulating the ground state of the free energy associated with the dynamical model, we construct topological cluster synchronization patterns. These are aligned with the eigenstates of the Topological Dirac Equation that provide a very useful decomposition of the dynamical state of node and edge signals associated with the network. We use linear stability analysis to predict the stability of the topological cluster synchronization patterns and provide numerical evidence of the ability to design several stable topological cluster synchronization states on real connectome data, random graphs, and on stochastic block models.</description>

      <title>Guided rewiring of social networks reduces polarization and accelerates collective action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global social and ecological challenges represent collective action problems requiring rapid and sufficient cooperation with pro-mitigation norms. Sociopolitical polarization hinders such cooperation. Prior agent-based models showed polarization emerges naturally in structured social networks and polarized cluster dissolution rate limits consensus formation rate. Here we study how guided link rewiring affects depolarization dynamics across synthetic and empirical (Facebook, Twitter) network topologies. We compare heuristic rewiring algorithms representing random meetings, mutual acquaintance introductions, and community bridging, alongside topology-based link recommender algorithms (Who to Follow and node2vec). Our heuristic algorithms all outperform Who to Follow in generating cooperative consensus. Homophilic rewiring generates cooperative consensus when agents can easily change opinions. However, heterophilic rewiring achieves this over broader conditions and can accelerate cooperative consensus formation by ~20%, including where up to 33% of the population experiences backfiring interactions. Heterophilic rewiring also vastly outperforms topology-based recommender algorithms. Random rewiring performed consistently well, achieving higher steady-state cooperation than seven out of eight more complex algorithms. Large disparities in steady-state cooperation for topology-based recommender systems highlight their volatility across network structures. Overall, our work reveals a subtle interplay between topology, rewiring algorithm and social depolarization, suggesting strong potential for carefully redesigning social networking technologies for social good.</description>

      <title>A Complex Topological Phase in C-Spin Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a new theoretical model for active matter ("complementary-spins" or c-spins), exploring the interplay of positional and orientational order in mobile agents with rotational freedom, divided into two populations with contrasting interactions. The system's behavior depends on its size and a control parameter (circular anisotropy) that splits the agents' natural rotational frequencies. Key findings include distinct phases based on anisotropy: Small Anisotropy: Stable, regular equilibrium patterns emerge. Moderate Anisotropy: Formation of complex, non-equilibrium topological point defects (vortex states), which are bistable with uniform patterns. These robust, self-repairing defects exhibit counter-rotating c-spin loop trains, spin-momentum locking, and dissipationless flow, classified by a two-valued topological charge. High Anisotropy: Transition to active turbulence and loss of order. Statistical analysis reveals a double phase transition at a critical value: a standard symmetry-breaking transition and a novel topological phase transition activating the vortex complexes. Increasing system size enhances organizational complexity and the development of spin-momentum locked transport networks. This model provides a new framework for understanding robustness and morphogenesis in living systems.</description>
