      <title>Jet Quenching in Heavy-Ion Collisions at RHIC and the LHC experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jet quenching serves as a key probes of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions. This proceedings presents recent results from RHIC and LHC on jet energy loss, acoplanarity, and the flavour and path-length dependence of Parton energy loss, providing critical constraints on QGP properties and theoretical models. Upcoming data taking campaigns at RHIC and the LHC will offer enhanced precision and extended kinematic reach to further advance our understanding of jet-medium interactions.</description>

      <title>EXFOR utility codes (ForEXy) and their application to neutron fission cross section evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a set of EXFOR utility codes (ForEXy) to process the information of the experimental nuclear reaction data stored in the EXFOR library. We designed a new JSON format (J4) for the EXFOR library, and developed a code converting the information in an EXFOR file to a J4 file (X4TOJ4) and another code converting it to an EXFOR file (J4TOX4) as a core part of this new code package. We also developed some other codes for managements of the EXFOR storage, bibliography and dictionary. As an application of the new code package, we constructed covariance matrices for the fast neutron induced fission cross sections of neptunium-237 in the EXFOR library by using the new codes, and applied them to evaluation of the cross section between 100 keV and 200 MeV.</description>

      <title>X-ray induced quenching of the 229Th clock isomer in CaF2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thorium-229 has the lowest nuclear-excited state (an isomer state) at approximately 8.356 eV, making it excitable with tabletop vacuum-ultraviolet lasers. Despite the recent success of laser excitation, the isomer quenching inside the solid-state environment remains unresolved. In this letter, we present experiments investigating X-ray-induced isomer quenching in the CaF$_2$ host, focusing on the effects of X-ray flux and temperature on the lifetime and yield of the isomer state. Our studies reveal a correlation between isomer production, isomer lifetime during irradiation, and post-irradiation afterglow of the target crystal across different temperatures, highlighting a strong relationship between isomer quenching and color-center dynamics. We developed a model to interpret the isomer quenching and the crystal's luminescence.</description>

      <title>Parameterizations of Electron Scattering Form Factors for Elastic Scattering and Electro-Excitation of Nuclear States for $\rm ^{27}Al$ and $\rm ^{40}Ca$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on empirical parameterizations of longitudinal (${\cal R}_L$) and transverse (${\cal R}_T$) nuclear electromagnetic form factors for elastic scattering and the excitations of nuclear states in ${\rm ^{27}Al}$ and ${\rm ^{40}Ca}$. The parameterizations are needed for the calculations of radiative corrections in measurements of electron scattering cross sections on ${\rm ^{27}Al}$ and ${\rm ^{40}Ca}$ in the quasi-elastic, resonance and inelastic continuum regions, provide the contribution of nuclear excitations in investigations of the Coulomb Sum Rule, and test theoretical model predictions for excitation of nuclear states in electron and neutrino interactions on nuclear targets at low energies.</description>

      <title>Orders-of-magnitude improved precision spectroscopy of an inner-shell orbital clock transition in neutral ytterbium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An inner-shell orbital clock transition $^1S_0 \leftrightarrow 4f^{13}5d6s^2 \: (J=2)$ in neutral ytterbium atoms has attracted much attention as a new optical frequency standard as well as a highly sensitive probe to several new physics phenomena, such as ultra-light dark matter, violation of local Lorentz invariance, and a new Yukawa potential between electrons and neutrons. Here, we demonstrate almost two-orders-of-magnitude improved precision spectroscopy over the previous reports by trapping atoms in a three-dimensional magic-wavelength optical lattice. In particular, we successfully observe the coherent Rabi oscillation, the relaxation dynamics of the excited state, and the interorbital Feshbach resonance. To highlight the high precision of our spectroscopy, we carry out precise isotope shift measurements between five stable bosonic isotopes well below 10 Hz uncertainties, successfully setting bounds for a hypothetical boson mediating a force between electrons and neutrons. These results open up the way for various new physics search experiments and a wide range of applications to quantum science with this clock transition.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg Uncertainty Inequality and Breaking of Isospin Symmetry in Atomic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Heisenberg uncertainty inequality is used to derive a rigorous lower bound to the amount of isospin impurities, caused by the violation of isospin symmetry in $N=Z$ atomic nuclei, in terms of the difference between the neutron and proton radii and the sum of the charge exchange monopole strengths. We show that the inequality reduces to an identity if one employs a simplified mean field expression for the isovector component of the Coulomb force in first order perturbation theory. The uncertainty inequality is also employed to derive an upper bound to the isovector dipole moment in terms of the amount of isospin impurities, thereby providing an insightful connection between the violation of parity and isospin symmetries.</description>

      <title>Semi-inclusive direct photon+jet and $\pi^{0}$+jet correlations measured in $p+p$ and central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 200$ GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00145v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The STAR experiment at RHIC reports new measurements of jet quenching based on the semi-inclusive distribution of charged-particle jets recoiling from direct photon ($\gamma_{\rm dir}$) and neutral pion ($\pi^{0}$) triggers in pp and central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV, for triggers in the range $9&lt;E_{\rm T}^{\rm trig}&lt;20$ GeV. The datasets have integrated luminosities of 3.9$ {\rm nb}^{-1}$ for Au+Au and 23$ {\rm pb}^{-1}$ for pp collisions. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-$k_{\rm T}$ algorithm with resolution parameters $R$=0.2 and 0.5. The large uncorrelated jet background in central Au+Au collisions is corrected using a mixed-event approach, which enables precise charged-particle jet measurements at low transverse momentum $p_{\rm T,jet}^{\rm ch}$ and large $R$. Recoil-jet distributions are reported in the range $p_{\rm T,jet}^{\rm ch}&lt;25$ \gev. Comparison of the distributions measured in pp and Au+Au collisions reveals strong medium-induced jet yield suppression for $R=0.2$, with markedly less suppression for $R=0.5$. Comparison is also made to theoretical models incorporating jet quenching. These data provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying jet quenching and the angular dependence of medium-induced jet-energy transport, and provide new constraints on modelling such effects.</description>

      <title>In-situ high voltage generation with Cockcroft-Walton multiplier for xenon gas time projection chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08554v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have newly developed a Cockcroft-Walton (CW) multiplier that can be used in a gas time projection chamber (TPC). A TPC requires a high voltage to form an electric field that drifts ionization electrons. Supplying the high voltage from outside the pressure vessel requires a dedicated high-voltage feedthrough. An alternative approach is to generate the high voltage inside the pressure vessel with a relatively low voltage introduced from outside. A CW multiplier can convert a low AC voltage input to a high DC voltage output, making it suitable for this purpose.
  We have integrated a CW multiplier into the AXEL (A Xenon ElectroLuminescence detector), a high pressure xenon gas TPC to search for neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{136}$Xe. It uses silicon photomultipliers to detect the ionization electrons through elecrtoluminescence, making it strong against electronic noise. Operation of the CW multiplier was successfully demonstrated; the TPC was operated for 40 days at 6.8 bar, and an energy resolution as high as (0.67 $\pm$ 0.08) % (FWHM) at 2615 keV was obtained.</description>
