      <title>Magnetic nonreciprocity in a hybrid device of asymmetric artificial spin-ice-superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the size and distribution of potential barriers within a medium of interacting particles can unveil unique collective behaviors and innovative functionalities. In this study, we introduce a unique superconducting hybrid device using a novel artificial spin ice structure composed of asymmetric nanomagnets. This structure forms a distinctive superconducting pinning potential that steers unconventional motion of superconducting vortices, thereby inducing a magnetic nonreciprocal effect, in contrast to the electric nonreciprocal effect commonly observed in superconducting diodes. Furthermore, the polarity of the magnetic nonreciprocity is in-situ reversible through the tunable magnetic patterns of artificial spin ice. Our findings demonstrate that artificial spin ice not only precisely modulates superconducting characteristics but also opens the door to novel functionalities, offering a groundbreaking paradigm for superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Correlated Electronic Structure and Density-Wave Gap in Trilayer Nickelate La4Ni3O10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of pressurized superconductivity at 80 K in La3Ni2O7 officially brings nickelates into the family of high-temperature superconductors, which gives rise to not only new insights but also mysteries in the strongly correlated superconductivity. More recently, the sibling compound La4Ni3O10 was also shown to be superconducting below about 25 K under pressure, further boosting the popularity of nickelates in the Ruddlesden-Popper phase. In this study, combining high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ab initio calculation, we systematically investigate the electronic structures of La4Ni3O10 at ambient pressure. We reveal a high resemblance of La4Ni3O10 with La3Ni2O7 in the orbital-dependent fermiology and electronic structure, suggesting a similar electronic correlation between the two compounds. The temperature-dependent measurements imply an orbital-dependent energy gap related to the density-wave transition in La4Ni3O10. By comparing the theoretical pressure-dependent electronic structure, clues about the superconducting high-pressure phase can be deduced from the ambient measurements, providing crucial information for deciphering the unconventional superconductivity in nickelates.</description>

      <title>Pressure-induced superconductivity in La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10+\delta}$ ($\delta$ = 0.04 and -0.01)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting transition temperatures, $T_{\mathrm{c}}$, of La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10+\delta}$($\delta$ = 0.04 and -0.01) were determined under various pressures up to 124.9 GPa by electrical resistance measurements with a diamond anvil cell. $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ exhibits a strong dependence on oxygen content within the pressure range of approximately 20 GPa and 80 GPa. At 48.0 GPa, $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10.04}$ peaks at 36 K, marking the highest $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ reported thus far.</description>

      <title>Fermi-Level Pinning of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov States in Weak Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As is well known, magnetic impurities adsorbed on superconductors, e.g. of the s-wave type, can introduce a bound gap-state (Yu-Shiba-Rusinov resonance). We here investigate within a minimal model how the impurity moment arranges with respect to a weak homogeneous external magnetic field employing a fully self-consistent mean-field treatment. Our investigation reveals a critical window of impurity-to-substrate coupling constants, $J$. The width of the critical region, $\delta J$, scales like $\delta J \sim B/\Delta$, where $B$ is the magnitude of the external field and $\Delta$ is the bulk order parameter. While tuning $J$ through the window, the energy of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) resonance is pinned to the Fermi energy $\varepsilon_\text{F}$ and the impurity moment rotates in a continuous fashion. We emphasize the pivotal role of self-consistency: In treatments ignoring self-consistency, the critical window adopts zero width, $\delta J=0$; consequently, there is no pinning of the YSR-resonance to $\varepsilon_\text{F}$, the impurity orientation jumps and therefore this orientation cannot be controlled continuously by fine-tuning the coupling $J$. In this sense, our study highlights the significance of self-consistency for understanding intricate magnetic interactions between superconductive materials and Shiba chains.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional charge orders induced by oxygen vacancies on SrTiO$_3$(001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas and low carrier density superconductivity in multiple SrTiO$_3$-based heterostructures has stimulated intense interest in the surface properties of SrTiO$_3$. The recent discovery of high-T$_c$ superconductivity in the monolayer FeSe/SrTiO$_3$ aroused the upsurge and underscored the atomic precision probe of the surface structure. By performing atomically resolved cryogenic scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy characterization on dual-TiO$_{2}$-${\delta}$-terminated SrTiO$_3$(001) surfaces with ($\sqrt{13}$ $\times$ $\sqrt{13}$), c(4 $\times$ 2), mixed (2 $\times$ 1), and (2 $\times$ 2) reconstructions, we disclosed universally broken rotational symmetry and contrasting bias- and temperature-dependent electronic states for apical and equatorial oxygen sites. With the sequentially evolved surface reconstructions and simultaneously increasing equatorial oxygen vacancies, the surface anisotropy reduces, and the work function lowers. Intriguingly, unidirectional stripe orders appear on the c(4 $\times$ 2) surface, whereas local (4 $\times$ 4) order emerges and eventually forms long-range unidirectional c(4 $\times$ 4) charge order on the (2 $\times$ 2) surface. This work reveals robust unidirectional charge orders induced by oxygen vacancies due to strong and delicate electronic-lattice interaction under broken rotational symmetry, providing insights into understanding the complex behaviors in perovskite oxide-based heterostructures.</description>

      <title>High-order Van Hove singularities and their connection to flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The flattening of single-particle band structures plays an important role in the quest for novel quantum states of matter due to the crucial role of interactions. Recent advances in theory and experiment made it possible to construct and tune systems with nearly flat bands, ranging from graphene multilayers and moire' materials to kagome' metals and ruthenates. While theoretical models predict exactly flat bands under certain ideal conditions, evidence was provided that these systems host high-order Van Hove points, i.e., points of high local band flatness and power-law divergence in energy of the density of states. In this review, we examine recent developments in engineering and realising such weakly dispersive bands. We focus on high-order Van Hove singularities and explore their connection to exactly flat bands. We provide classification schemes and discuss interaction effects. We also review experimental evidence for high-order Van Hove singularities and point out future research directions.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity at KTaO$_3$ heterointerfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01549v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism is a long-standing issue in superconductivity due to the antagonistic nature of these two ordered states. Experimentally identifying and characterizing novel heterointerface superconductors that coexist with magnetism presents significant challenges. Here, we report the experimental observation of two-dimensional long-range ferromagnetic order in the KTaO$_3$ heterointerface superconductor, showing the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism. Remarkably, our direct current superconducting quantum interference device measurements reveal an in-plane magnetization hysteresis loop persisting above room temperature. Moreover, the first-principles calculations and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements provide decisive insights into the origin of the observed robust ferromagnetism, attributing it to oxygen vacancies that localize electrons in nearby Ta 5$d$ states. Our findings not only suggest KTaO$_3$ heterointerfaces as time-reversal symmetry breaking superconductors, but also inject fresh momentum into the exploration of the intricate interplay between superconductivity and magnetism, enhanced by the strong spin-orbit coupling inherent to the heavy Ta in 5$d$ orbitals of KTaO$_3$ heterointerfaces.</description>

      <title>Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking Superconductivity in CaSb$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12457v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CaSb$_2$ is a bulk superconductor and a topological semimetal, making it a great platform for realizing topological superconductivity. In this work, we investigate the superconducting upper and lower critical field anisotropy using magnetic susceptibility, and study the superconducting state using muon spin-relaxation. The temperature dependence of transverse-field relaxation rate can be fitted with a single-gap model or two-gap model. Zero-field relaxation shows little temperature dependence when the muon-spin is parallel to the $c*$-axis, while an increase in relaxation appears below 1 K when the muon-spin is parallel to the $ab$-plane. We conclude an $s+is$ order parameter considering the breaking of time-reversal symmetry (TRS), which originates from competing interband interactions between the three bands of CaSb$_2$. To explain the direction-dependent breaking of TRS we suggest loop currents developing in the plane of distorted square-net of Sb atoms.</description>
