      <title>Cluster-Based Bayesian SIRD Modeling of Chickenpox Epidemiology in India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a cluster-based Bayesian SIRD model to analyze the epidemiology of chickenpox (varicella) in India, utilizing data from 1990 to 2021. We employed an age-structured approach, dividing the population into juvenile, adult, and elderly groups, to capture the disease's transmission dynamics across diverse demographic groups. The model incorporates a Holling-type incidence function, which accounts for the saturation effect of transmission at high prevalence levels, and applies Bayesian inference to estimate key epidemiological parameters, including transmission rates, recovery rates, and mortality rates. The study further explores cluster analysis to identify regional clusters within India based on the similarities in chickenpox transmission dynamics, using criteria like incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates. We perform K-means clustering to uncover three distinct epidemiological regimes, which vary in terms of outbreak potential and age-specific dynamics. The findings highlight juveniles as the primary drivers of transmission, while the elderly face a disproportionately high mortality burden. Our results underscore the importance of age-targeted interventions and suggest that regional heterogeneity should be considered in public health strategies for disease control. The model offers a transparent, reproducible framework for understanding long-term transmission dynamics and supports evidence-based planning for chickenpox control in India. The practical utility of the model is further validated through a simulation study.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Maximum Likelihood Classification Before and After Applying Weierstrass Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to use Maximum Likelihood (ML) Classification on multispectral data by means of qualitative and quantitative approaches. Maximum Likelihood is a supervised classification algorithm which is based on the Classical Bayes theorem. It makes use of a discriminant function to assign pixel to the class with the highest likelihood. Class means vector and covariance matrix are the key inputs to the function and can be estimated from training pixels of a particular class. As Maximum Likelihood need some assumptions before it has to be applied on the data. In this paper we will compare the results of Maximum Likelihood Classification (ML) before apply the Weierstrass Transform and apply Weierstrass Transform and will see the difference between the accuracy on training pixels of high resolution Quickbird satellite image. Principle Component analysis (PCA) is also used for dimension reduction and also used to check the variation in bands. The results shows that the separation between mean of the classes in the decision space is to be the main factor that leads to the high classification accuracy of Maximum Likelihood (ML) after using Weierstrass Transform than without using it.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Multi-State Data Integration Approach for Estimating County-level Prevalence of Opioid Misuse in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drug overdose deaths, including from opioids, remain a significant public health threat to the United States (US). To abate the harms of opioid misuse, understanding its prevalence at the local level is crucial for stakeholders in communities to develop response strategies that effectively use limited resources. Although there exist several state-specific studies that provide county-level prevalence estimates, such estimates are not widely available across the country, as the datasets used in these studies are not always readily available in other states, which, therefore, has limited the wider applications of existing models. To fill this gap, we propose a Bayesian multi-state data integration approach that fully utilizes publicly available data sources to estimate county-level opioid misuse prevalence for all counties in the US. The hierarchical structure jointly models opioid misuse prevalence and overdose death outcomes, leverages existing county-level prevalence estimates in limited states and state-level estimates from national surveys, and accounts for heterogeneity across counties and states with counties' covariates and mixed effects. Furthermore, our parsimonious and generalizable modeling framework employs horseshoe+ prior to flexibly shrink coefficients and prevent overfitting, ensuring adaptability as new county-level prevalence data in additional states become available. Using real-world data, our model shows high estimation accuracy through cross-validation and provides nationwide county-level estimates of opioid misuse for the first time.</description>

      <title>Estimating Consensus Ideal Points Using Multi-Source Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the advent of big data and machine learning, researchers now have a wealth of congressional candidate ideal point estimates at their disposal for theory testing. Weak relationships raise questions about the extent to which they capture a shared quantity -- rather than idiosyncratic, domain-specific factors -- yet different measures are used interchangeably in most substantive analyses. Moreover, questions central to the study of American politics implicate relationships between candidate ideal points and other variables derived from the same data sources, introducing endogeneity. We propose a method, consensus multidimensional scaling (CoMDS), which better aligns with how applied scholars use ideal points in practice. CoMDS captures the shared, stable associations of a set of underlying ideal point estimates and can be interpreted as their common spatial representation. We illustrate the utility of our approach for assessing relationships within domains of existing measures and provide a suite of diagnostic tools to aid in practical usage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of generative AI (GAI) has sparked diverse opinions regarding its appropriate use across various domains, including education. This pilot study investigates university students' perceptions of GAI in higher education classrooms, aiming to lay the groundwork for understanding these attitudes. With a participation rate of approximately 4.4%, the study highlights the challenges of engaging students in GAI-related research and underscores the need for larger sample sizes in future studies. By gaining insights into student perspectives, instructors can better prepare to integrate discussions of GAI into their classrooms, fostering informed and critical engagement with this transformative technology.</description>

      <title>A new method for augmenting short time series, with application to pain events in sickle cell disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Researchers across different fields, including but not limited to ecology, biology, and healthcare, often face the challenge of sparse data. Such sparsity can lead to uncertainties, estimation difficulties, and potential biases in modeling. Here we introduce a novel data augmentation method that combines multiple sparse time series datasets when they share similar statistical properties, thereby improving parameter estimation and model selection reliability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through validation studies comparing Hawkes and Poisson processes, followed by application to subjective pain dynamics in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), a condition affecting millions worldwide, particularly those of African, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Indian descent.</description>

      <title>Bayesian nonparametric modeling of dynamic pollution clusters through an autoregressive logistic-beta Stirling-gamma process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine suspended particulates (FSP), commonly known as PM2.5, are among the most harmful air pollutants, posing serious risks to population health and environmental integrity. As such, accurately identifying latent clusters of FSP is essential for effective air quality and public health management. This task, however, is notably nontrivial as FSP clusters may depend on various regional and temporal factors, which should be incorporated in the modeling process. Thus, we capitalize on Bayesian nonparametric dynamic clustering ideas, in which clustering structures may be influenced by complex dependencies. Existing implementations of dynamic clustering, however, rely on copula-based dependent Dirichlet processes (DPs), presenting considerable computational challenges for real-world deployment. With this in mind, we propose a more efficient alternative for dynamic clustering by incorporating the novel ideas of logistic-beta dependent DPs. We also adopt a Stirling-gamma prior, a novel distribution family, on the concentration parameter of our underlying DP, easing the process of incorporating prior knowledge into the model. Efficient computational strategies for posterior inference are also presented. We apply our proposed method to identify dynamic FSP clusters across Chile and demonstrate its superior performance over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Intraday Limit Order Price Change Transition Dynamics Across Market Capitalizations Through Markov Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative understanding of stochastic dynamics in limit order price changes is essential for execution strategy design. We analyze intraday transition dynamics of ask and bid orders across market capitalization tiers using high-frequency NASDAQ100 tick data. Employing a discrete-time Markov chain framework, we categorize consecutive price changes into nine states and estimate transition probability matrices (TPMs) for six intraday intervals across High ($\mathtt{HMC}$), Medium ($\mathtt{MMC}$), and Low ($\mathtt{LMC}$) market cap stocks. Element-wise TPM comparison reveals systematic patterns: price inertia peaks during opening and closing hours, stabilizing midday. A capitalization gradient is observed: $\mathtt{HMC}$ stocks exhibit the strongest inertia, while $\mathtt{LMC}$ stocks show lower stability and wider spreads. Markov metrics, including spectral gap, entropy rate, and mean recurrence times, quantify these dynamics. Clustering analysis identifies three distinct temporal phases on the bid side -- Opening, Midday, and Closing, and four phases on the ask side by distinguishing Opening, Midday, Pre-Close, and Close. This indicates that sellers initiate end-of-day positioning earlier than buyers. Stationary distributions show limit order dynamics are dominated by neutral and mild price changes. Jensen-Shannon divergence confirms the closing hour as the most distinct phase, with capitalization modulating temporal contrasts and bid-ask asymmetry. These findings support capitalization-aware and time-adaptive execution algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Racial disproportionality in Stop and Search practices elicits substantial concerns about its societal and behavioral impacts. This paper aims to investigate the effect of disproportionality, particularly on the black community, on expressive crimes in London using data from January 2019 to December 2023. We focus on a semi-parametric partially linear structural regression method and introduce a scalable Bayesian empirical likelihood procedure combined with double machine learning techniques to control for high-dimensional confounding and to accommodate strong prior assumptions. In addition, we show that the proposed procedure yields a valid posterior in terms of coverage. Applying this approach to the Stop and Search dataset, we find that racial disproportionality aimed at the Black community may be alleviated by taking into account the proportion of the Black population when focusing on expressive crimes.</description>

      <title>On the relationship between the Wasserstein distance and differences in life expectancy at birth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wasserstein distance is a metric for assessing distributional differences. The measure originates in optimal transport theory and can be interpreted as the minimal cost of transforming one distribution into another. In this paper, the Wasserstein distance is applied to life table age-at-death distributions. The main finding is that, under certain conditions, the Wasserstein distance between two age-at-death distributions equals the corresponding gap in life expectancy at birth ($e_0$). More specifically, the paper shows mathematically and empirically that this equivalence holds whenever the survivorship functions do not cross. For example, this applies when comparing mortality between women and men from 1990 to 2020 using data from the Human Mortality Database. In such cases, the gap in $e_0$ reflects not only a difference in mean ages at death but can also be interpreted directly as a measure of distributional difference.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Mediation Pathways of Depression in Asian Students and Workers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Depression is a major global mental health issue shaped by cultural, demographic, and occupational factors. This study compares predictors of depression across student and worker populations using datasets from India, Malaysia, and China. The India dataset was split into student and worker groups, while the Malaysia dataset includes only students and the China (CHARLS) dataset includes only workers. After harmonizing variables, we applied logistic regression, random forest, and causal forest models to identify key predictors and subgroup-specific effects, and conducted causal mediation analysis (CMA) to assess whether variables operate through intermediaries such as perceived pressure. Among students, pressure, age, workload, financial stress, mental health history, and satisfaction were significant predictors; similar factors emerged for workers. Notably, age showed opposite effects across groups: younger students were more likely to experience depression, whereas older workers showed higher risk. Model performance showed moderate internal accuracy but weaker external generalizability across countries, with random forest outperforming logistic regression. Causal forest results indicated limited heterogeneity in the effect of pressure, while CMA showed that pressure does not mediate the effect of age but operates more directly, and satisfaction influences depression partly through pressure. Overall, pressure consistently emerged as the strongest predictor, suggesting that interventions targeting academic and occupational stress may help reduce depressive symptoms.</description>

      <title>Human-in-the-Loop Feature Selection Using Interpretable Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-based Double Deep Q-Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feature selection is critical for improving the performance and interpretability of machine learning models, particularly in high-dimensional spaces where complex feature interactions can reduce accuracy and increase computational demands. Existing approaches often rely on static feature subsets or manual intervention, limiting adaptability and scalability. However, dynamic, per-instance feature selection methods and model-specific interpretability in reinforcement learning remain underexplored. This study proposes a human-in-the-loop (HITL) feature selection framework integrated into a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) using a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). Our novel approach leverages simulated human feedback and stochastic distribution-based sampling, specifically Beta, to iteratively refine feature subsets per data instance, improving flexibility in feature selection. The KAN-DDQN achieved notable test accuracies of 93% on MNIST and 83% on FashionMNIST, outperforming conventional MLP-DDQN models by up to 9%. The KAN-based model provided high interpretability via symbolic representation while using 4 times fewer neurons in the hidden layer than MLPs did. Comparatively, the models without feature selection achieved test accuracies of only 58% on MNIST and 64% on FashionMNIST, highlighting significant gains with our framework. We further validate scalability on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, achieving up to 30% relative macro F1 improvement on MNIST and 5% on CIFAR-10, while reducing calibration error by 25%. Complexity analysis confirms real-time feasibility with latency below 1 ms and parameter counts under 0.02M. Pruning and visualization further enhanced model transparency by elucidating decision pathways. These findings present a scalable, interpretable solution for feature selection that is suitable for applications requiring real-time, adaptive decision-making with minimal human oversight.</description>

      <title>Per-sender neural network classifiers for email authorship validation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Business email compromise and lateral spear phishing attacks are among modern organizations' most costly and damaging threats. While inbound phishing defenses have improved significantly, most organizations still trust internal emails by default, leaving themselves vulnerable to attacks from compromised employee accounts. In this work, we define and explore the problem of authorship validation: verifying whether a claimed sender actually authored a given email. Authorship validation is a lightweight, real-time defense that complements traditional detection methods by modeling per-sender writing style. Further, the paper presents a collection of new datasets based on the Enron corpus. These simulate inauthentic messages using both human-written and large language model-generated emails. The paper also evaluates two classifiers -- a Naive Bayes model and a character-level convolutional neural network (Char-CNN) -- for the authorship validation task. Our experiments show that the Char-CNN model achieves high accuracy and F1 scores under various circumstances. Finally, we discuss deployment considerations and show that per-sender authorship classifiers are practical for integrating into existing commercial email security systems with low overhead.</description>

      <title>Structured Matching via Cost-Regularized Unbalanced Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) provides a flexible way to match or compare nonnegative finite Radon measures. However, UOT requires a predefined ground transport cost, which may misrepresent the data's underlying geometry. Choosing such a cost is particularly challenging when datasets live in heterogeneous spaces, often motivating practitioners to adopt Gromov-Wasserstein formulations. To address this challenge, we introduce cost-regularized unbalanced optimal transport (CR-UOT), a framework that allows the ground cost to vary while allowing mass creation and removal. We show that CR-UOT incorporates unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein type problems through families of inner-product costs parameterized by linear transformations, enabling the matching of measures or point clouds across Euclidean spaces. We develop algorithms for such CR-UOT problems using entropic regularization and demonstrate that this approach improves the alignment of heterogeneous single-cell omics profiles, especially when many cells lack direct matches.</description>
