      <title>Photoionization in KTN deflectors by light in the near-infrared imaging window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electro-optical deflectors (EODs) offer unparalleled scanning speed for laser-scanning microscopy and other applications, but suffer from limited deflection range. EODs based on potassium tantalate niobate (KTN) crystals feature some of the highest number of resolvable spots. These deflectors rely on internal electric fields generated by trapped electrons to enable beam scanning. However, visible light induces rapid photoionization of trapped charges, thus KTN-based deflectors are typically continuously recharged with a bias voltage that effectively limits the range of the deflector. Recent work has proposed the use of KTN-based EODs for biological imaging with infrared excitation light, but quantitative data on near-infrared photoionization is lacking. Here, we present quantitative measurements of photoionization in KTN deflectors across the NIR-I and NIR-IIa biological imaging windows (700 - 1300 nm), a range that is particularly important for deep tissue imaging and nonlinear microscopy. Using a two-beam polarization interferometer, we measured trapped charge density as a function of photon fluence. We observed that the photoionization rate decreases dramatically with increasing wavelength. The charge density decay curves exhibit multi-exponential behavior that cannot be explained by a single-trap model without recapture, indicating the presence of multiple trap species or substantial recapture. These measurements provide critical quantitative guidance for selecting operating wavelengths and charge-scan duty cycles for KTN-based EODs in near-infrared imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Wavelength-selective nonlinear wavefront control in resonant thin-film lithium niobate metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear metasurfaces offer compact control over frequency conversion and wavefront shaping. However, existing approaches, often based on geometric phase, lack wavelength selectivity, resulting in static nonlinear responses. Here, we demonstrate a thin-film lithium niobate metasurface that enables spectrally selective shaping of second-harmonic generation through resonance-engineered phase control. The structure consists of two regions with distinct phase responses, realized via spectral tuning of Mie-type resonances. This design enables simultaneous frequency conversion and spatial mode shaping, transforming a Gaussian pump near 1100 nm into a first-order Hermite-Gaussian mode at 550 nm, while maintaining the pump profile. The demonstrated approach offers a pathway toward ultracompact and tunable components for nonlinear holography and related applications.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Barium Titanate Waveguide Designs For Efficient Nonlinear Frequency Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barium titanate (BaTiO$_3$) is emerging as a powerful integrated photonic material, combining strong $X^{(2)}$ and electro-optic nonlinearities with rapidly improving thin-film waveguide quality. Recent demonstrations of low-loss BaTiO$_3$ waveguides and high-Q resonators have established BaTiO$_3$-on-insulator as a promising platform for next-generation frequency-conversion and quantum photonic technologies. However, while BaTiO$_3$ electro-optic modulators are now well developed, nonlinear BaTiO$_3$ waveguide engineering remains comparatively immature. Techniques widely used in lithium niobate, such as periodic poling for quasi-phase-matching, are poorly suited to BaTiO$_3$ because epitaxial thin films exhibit high coercive fields, strong strain-clamping effects, multivariant domain structures, and slow, complex switching dynamics. These factors make accurate periodic poling challenging and hinder the development of efficient $X^{(2)}$ frequency converters. Here, we introduce a fabrication-robust alternative based on linear-nonlinear hybrid waveguides, where TiO$_2$ is selectively incorporated into BaTiO$_3$ ridge waveguides to enhance nonlinear mode overlap while relying solely on modal phase-matching. Using coupled-mode-theory simulations, we identify phase-matched geometries and show that the hybrid design achieves a 2.75x increase in normalized second harmonic generation efficiency over monolithic BaTiO$_3$ waveguides. The uniform, lithographically defined cross-section makes the approach highly scalable. These results position hybrid BaTiO$_3$-TiO$_2$ waveguides as a practical route to CMOS-compatible, high-efficiency $X^{(2)}$ devices for integrated quantum photonics.</description>

      <title>Optically reconfigurable canalization of exciton-polaritons in a non-hyperbolic perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to steer polariton flow on-demand holds significant promise towards nanophotonic applications and photonic circuitry. Polariton canalization, exhibiting intrinsic collimation and diffractionless transport, emerges as a promising solution without guiding structures. However, earlier demonstrations have been restricted to certain crystal surfaces with intrinsic hyperbolic responses and operated in the linear regime. Here, we experimentally demonstrate canalization of nonlinear exciton polariton condensates with optical reconfigurability in a birefringent CsPbBr3 perovskite crystal without intrinsic hyperbolic response. By embedding the birefringent perovskite crystal into a planar microcavity, the interplay between cavity transverse-electric-transverse-magnetic splitting and crystalline birefringence produces an anisotropic band geometry with a hyperbolic-flat-parabolic evolution of polaritonic isofrequency contours (IFCs). Nonresonant pumping drives exciton polariton condensation onto flat far-field contours with nonlinear emission amplification, leading to coherent canalized flows with over twentyfold collimation with respect to arc-shaped contours. Reconfiguring the optical pumping-spot size allows switching the nonlinear polariton condensates into hyperbolic and parabolic IFC regimes, leading to divergent propagation behaviour with collimating reconfiguration. Our study reveals a distinct canalization framework for shaping the nonlinear exciton-polariton condensate flows, opening opportunities for all-optical polaritonic logic circuits based on stabilized nonlinear quantum interconnects.</description>

      <title>Measurement of stray light in the LISA instrument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement of stray light in a complex optical system can be a complex task. We developed a method to measure coherent stray light inside an assembled device, determining all stray light sources and their relative contribution. The method is based on the insertion of a laser with a scanned frequency and the detection of all the electrical and optical signals obtained from the instrument. The spectra calculated from these signals show fringes due to interference between each stray light contribution and the nominal beam. The frequency of these interference peaks indicates the difference in path length between the stray light path and the nominal path.  To have a description of the measured data we realized optical simulations, which link the measured path length to a possible path throughout the system. In the following, we will show some measurements made on a test bench realized to simulate the performance of LISA interferometers and describe how accurate simulations are in predicting and explaining the measured results.</description>

      <title>Non-secular polariton leakage and dark-state protection in hybrid plasmonic cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major issue in exploiting plasmonic cavities as key components in nanotechnology is the effect of radiative and absorption losses on their electrodynamic behavior. Treating them as open-systems, we derive a time-local, completely positive master equation that retains non-secular interference between decay pathways and reduces to the standard secular description when the environment resolves polariton splitting. When it does not, the theory predicts order-one deviations from secular leakage dynamics, including bath-induced coherences and stabilization of dark polaritons, and provides a simple design criterion based on the ratio of polariton splitting to reservoir linewidth. A time-resolved leakage measurement, such as transmission, reflectivity, or photoluminescence, can be used to observe these effects.</description>

      <title>Reverse Energy Flows in Two-Dimensional Photonic Crystals and Analogies with Vortex Formation and Analogous Flows in Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the connection between photonic band-gap formation in two types of two-dimensional photonic crystals and the emergence of reverse electromagnetic energy flows generated by linearly polarized plane waves incident on a photonic-crystal slab. We show that these reverse energy flows, observed in both transmitted and reflected fields, originate from vortex structures in the Poynting vector. The resulting energy-flow patterns exhibit striking analogies to vortex formation in fluid motion past obstacles. The geometry and dynamics of the Poynting-vector vortices determine whether the incident electromagnetic energy is impeded, leading to the formation of photonic band gaps, or instead guided through the structure, enabling transmission.</description>

      <title>Mode Switching Through Exceptional Points Induced by Lasing-Inversion Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gain-loss coupling in optical cavities induces exceptional points (EPs), where two optical modes coalesce. The large modal overlap near an EP intensifies gain competition, favoring single-mode lasing. Recent studies further revealed self-modulation closer to the EP that transforms the lasing mode into a frequency comb. Such EP-enabled comb formation suggests a previously unaccounted-for mechanism that overcomes the strong gain competition and drives a second mode to threshold. Here, using a Bloch coupled-mode theory derived from first principles, we show that the second threshold arises from dynamical couplings among the population inversion, the lasing field, and a dark cavity mode. The lasing-inversion coupling produces extra EPs, whose spectral structure governs switching among single-mode lasing and frequency combs with different repetition rates. This above-threshold mode-switching mechanism enables new opportunities for tunable photonic systems, including adaptive optical communication links and dual-comb spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Broadband Second Harmonic Generation using Fixed-Period Periodically Poled Lithium Niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) is a widely used nonlinear optical device for second harmonic generation (SHG). Despite its wide adoption in commercial systems, its bandwidth for SHG is fundamentally limited by the quasi-phase matching condition. This can be overcome by aperiodic or chirped PPLN structures; however, such devices are typically custom-fabricated and not readily available commercially. In this study, we investigate an alternative approach to achieving broadband SHG by using a standard PPLN crystal containing multiple fixed poling periods. Broadband operation is realized by angle tuning the crystal relative to input beam in free-space. The effect of angle tuning is examined over a range of incident angles, and an 1.6x enhancement in SHG bandwidth is demonstrated. These results suggest a practical and efficient strategy for broadband SHG using standard PPLN devices.</description>

      <title>A levitated nano-accelerometer sensitized by quantum quench</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We realize a nanoscale accelerometer exploiting the nonequilibrium dynamics of a nanoparticle near the quantum ground state. We explore the dynamics after quenching the trapping potential and find that rapid quenching provides an instance at which the sensitivity is enhanced due to the minimized uncertainty in the position. With rapid quenching, the observed sensitivity is in good agreement with a numerical simulation based on the quantum Langevin equation and approaches to the limit given by the quantum Fisher information. Our results open up a pathway to quantum inertial sensing sensitized by exploiting quench dynamics.</description>

      <title>A matter-wave Fabry-P\'erot cavity in the ultrastrong driving regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the length of an optical cavity is modulated, theory predicts exponential concentration of energy around particular space-time trajectories. Viewed stroboscopically, photons in such a driven cavity propagate as if in a curved spacetime, with black hole and white hole event horizons corresponding to unstable and stable fixed points of the evolution. Such phenomena have resisted direct experimental realization due to the difficulty of relativistically accelerating massive cavity mirrors. We report results of an experiment which overcomes this limitation by exchanging the roles of light and matter. A matter wave endowed with quasi-relativistic dispersion is confined between two barriers made of light, one of which is periodically translated at speeds comparable to the matter wave group velocity. In this strongly-modulated cavity we observe the emergence of the predicted bright and dark fixed point trajectories, and demonstrate that changing the modulation waveform can vary the number of fixed points and exchange their stability character. We observe signatures of nontrivial dynamics beyond those predicted for photons, and attribute them to residual curvature in the dispersion relation. In addition to experimentally realizing and characterizing cavity dynamics in the ultra-strong driving regime, these results point the way to implementations of related dynamics in electro-optic materials, with potential applications in pulse generation and signal compression.</description>

      <title>3D imaging of the biphoton spatiotemporal wave packet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photons are among the most important carriers of quantum information owing to their rich degrees of freedom (DoFs), including various spatiotemporal structures. The ability to characterize these DoFs, as well as the hidden correlations among them, directly determines whether they can be exploited for quantum tasks. While various methods have been developed for measuring the spatiotemporal structure of classical light fields, owing to the technical challenges posed by weak photon flux, there have so far been no reports of observing such structures in their quantum counterparts, except for a few studies limited to correlations within individual DoFs. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a self-referenced, high-efficiency, and all-optical method, termed 3D imaging of photonic wave packets, for comprehensive characterization of the spatiotemporal structure of a quantum light field, i.e., the biphoton spatiotemporal wave packet. Benefiting from this developed method, we successfully observe the spatial-spatial, spectral-spectral, and spatiotemporal correlations of biphotons generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion, revealing rich local and nonlocal spatiotemporal structure in quantum light fields. This method will further advance the understanding of the dynamics in nonlinear quantum optics and expand the potential of photons for applications in quantum communication and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Efficient high-harmonic generation in van der Waals ferroelectric NbOI$_2$ crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered NbOX$_2$ ($X=\mathrm{Cl,\,Br,\,I}$), a member of the van der Waals ferroelectric family, exhibits intrinsic ferroelectricity and pronounced nonlinear optical responses, making it a promising candidate for integrated nanophotonics applications. While previous studies have emphasized the material's strong second-order nonlinear responses, higher-order nonlinear responses are still mostly unexplored. This work systematically investigates NbOI$_2$ using high harmonic generation (HHG) spectroscopy. Driven by an intense mid-infrared laser field centered at $\sim4~\mu\mathrm{m}$ wavelength, highly anisotropic odd- and even-order harmonics up to the 16th order are generated at a low peak intensity of $0.4~\mathrm{TW\,cm^{-2}}$, extending beyond the material's bandgap. Both bulk and flake forms of NbOI$_2$ display pronounced harmonic emission from the near-infrared to the deep-ultraviolet spectral region, with a notably high overall conversion efficiency compared to other known materials. Polarization-resolved measurements reveal that even-order harmonics remain aligned with the crystal polar axis regardless of the driving-field orientation, whereas odd-order harmonics are dynamically affected. First-principles calculations suggest that the flat valence band associated with Peierls dimerization enhances HHG efficiency through electron correlation. These findings provide fresh perspectives on HHG in van der Waals ferroelectric materials and facilitate the development of compact and tunable quantum light sources.</description>

      <title>A general framework for interactions between electron beams and quantum optical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a theoretical framework to describe the dynamics of a free-electron beam interacting with quantized bound systems in arbitrary electromagnetic environments. This expands the quantum optics toolbox to incorporate free-electron beams for applications in highly tunable quantum control, imaging, and spectroscopy at the nanoscale. The framework recovers previously studied results and shows that electromagnetic environments can amplify the intrinsically weak coupling between a free-electron and a bound electron to reach previously inaccessible interaction regimes. We leverage this enhanced coupling for experimentally feasible protocols in coherent qubit control and towards the nondestructive readout and projective control of the electron beam's quantum-number statistics. Our framework is broadly applicable to microwave-frequency qubits, optical nanophotonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics, and emerging platforms at the interface of electron microscopy and quantum information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Each cycle of a quantum computation requires a quantum state initialisation. For semiconductor-based quantum platforms, initialisation is typically performed via slow microwave processes and usually requires cooling to temperatures where only the lowest quantum level is occupied. In silicon, boron atoms are the most common impurities. They bind holes in orbitals including an effective spin-3/2 ground state as well as excited states analogous to the Rydberg series for hydrogen. Here we show that initialisation temperature demands may be relaxed and speeds increased over a thousand-fold by importing, from atomic physics, the procedure of optical pumping via excited orbital states to preferentially occupy a target ground state spin. Spin relaxation within the orbital ground state of unstrained silicon is too fast to measure for conventional pulsed microwave technology, except at temperatures below 2 K, implying a need not only for fast state preparation but also fast state readout. Circularly polarised ~10 THz photon pulses from a free electron laser meet both needs at temperatures above 3 K: a 9 ps pulse enhances the population of one spin eigenstate for the "1s"-like ground state orbital, and the second interrogates this imbalance in spin population. Using parameters given by our data, we calculate that it should be possible to initialise 99% of spins for boron in strained silicon within 250 ps at 3 K. The speedup of both state preparation and measurement gained for THz rather than microwave photons should be explored for the many other solid state quantum systems hosting THz excitations potentially useful as intermediate states.</description>

      <title>OmniLens: Towards Universal Lens Aberration Correction via LensLib-to-Specific Domain Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Emerging universal Computational Aberration Correction (CAC) paradigms provide an inspiring solution to light-weight and high-quality imaging with a universal model trained on a lens library (LensLib) to address arbitrary lens optical aberrations blindly. However, the limited coverage of existing LensLibs leads to poor generalization of the trained models to unseen lenses, whose fine-tuning pipeline is also confined to the lens-descriptions-known case. In this work, we introduce OmniLens, a flexible solution to universal CAC via (i) establishing a convincing LensLib with comprehensive coverage for pre-training a robust base model, and (ii) adapting the model to any specific lens designs with unknown lens descriptions via fast LensLib-to-specific domain adaptation. To achieve these, an Evolution-based Automatic Optical Design (EAOD) pipeline is proposed to generate a rich variety of lens samples with realistic aberration behaviors. Then, we design an unsupervised regularization term for efficient domain adaptation on a few easily accessible real-captured images based on the statistical observation of dark channel priors in degradation induced by lens aberrations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the LensLib generated by EAOD effectively develops a universal CAC model with strong generalization capabilities, which can also improve the non-blind lens-specific methods by 0.35~1.81dB in PSNR. Additionally, the proposed domain adaptation method significantly improves the base model, especially in severe aberration cases (at most 2.59dB in PSNR). The code and data will be available at https://github.com/zju-jiangqi/OmniLens.</description>

      <title>A Second-Order Optical Butterworth Fabry-P\'erot Filter</title>

Abstract: Filters with flat-top pass-bands are a key enabling technology for signal processing. From communication to sensing, the ability to choose a pass \emph{band}, rather than a single pass \emph{frequency}, while still efficiently suppressing backgrounds at other frequencies, is a critical capability for ensuring both detection sensitivity and power efficiency. Efficient transmission of a single frequency can be achieved by a single-pole resonator -- which in optics is a Fabry-P\'erot cavity offering linewidths from kHz to GHz and beyond. Coupling multiple resonators allows for the construction of flat-top multi-pole filters. These, although straightforward from RF to THz where resonators are macroscopic and tunable, are more difficult to control in the optical band and typically realized with dielectric stacks, whose passband widths exceed 100 GHz. Here, we bridge the gap to narrower bandwidth flat-top filters by proposing and implementing a second-order Butterworth-type optical filter in a single two-mirror Fabry-P\'erot cavity, by coupling the two polarization modes. We demonstrate a pass-band width of 2.68(1)~GHz, a maximum stopband suppression of 43~dB, and a passband insertion loss of 2.2(1)~dB, with out-of-band power suppression falling as the fourth power of detuning. This approach is viable down to much narrower filters, and has the potential to improve high-frequency phase noise performance of lasers, enhance the sensitivity of LIDARs, and provide higher quality narrowband filtering, for example, for Raman spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Single-exposure holographic 3D printing via inverse-designed phase masks</title>

Abstract: Additive manufacturing using light is commonly constrained by serial voxel-by-voxel or layer-by-layer processing, which fundamentally limits fabrication speed and scalability. Here, we introduce a single-exposure holographic three-dimensional (3D) printing approach that synthesizes an entire volumetric dose distribution optically in one step. The method combines inverse-designed microstructured phase masks with photopolymer resins engineered for controlled optical absorption. By precisely tailoring the phase-mask topography, we generate arbitrary 3D light-intensity distributions within the resin, including intentionally encoded dark regions that define hollow internal features. Simultaneously, the resin formulation is designed to balance optical penetration with sufficient local energy deposition to achieve high-fidelity polymerization throughout the volume. Using this approach, millimeter-scale architectures comprising more than $10^{6}$ addressable voxels are fabricated in a single 7.5~s exposure, corresponding to a volumetric throughput of $\sim$1~mm$^{3}$/s ($&gt;10^{5}$~voxels/s). The demonstrated performance is presently limited by resin kinetics and illumination geometry rather than by the phase-mask framework itself. Because the volumetric information capacity scales with the space--bandwidth product of the phase mask, this approach provides a clear pathway toward substantially higher throughput, enabling scalable fabrication of micro-optical components, biomedical scaffolds, and other precision-engineered mesoscale systems.</description>

      <title>Photon triplets from integrated microrings: A path towards deterministic non-Gaussianity on a chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose cascaded spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) in microring resonators as a scalable and efficient approach for directly generating non-Gaussian states of light. Focusing on the well-understood "low-gain" regime, we demonstrate that triplet generation through cascaded SFWM can be achieved with high efficiency and favorable spectral characteristics using realistic microring sources in AlGaAs. The ability to achieve the generation of light in a single set of supermodes -- and the predicted accessibility of the "high-gain" regime at realistic pump powers -- makes this source a promising candidate as a direct and deterministic source of non-Gaussian light for photonic quantum information processing.</description>
