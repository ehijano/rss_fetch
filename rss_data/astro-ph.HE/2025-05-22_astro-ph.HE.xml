      <title>Discovery of the Spin-down Glitch in PSR J1835$-$1106</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of a spin-down glitch with a fractional frequency change of $\Delta\nu/\nu=-3.46(6)\times10^{-9}$ in the rotation-powered pulsar PSR J1835$-$1106 at MJD 55813, based on timing observations collected with the Nanshan 26-m and Parkes 64-m radio telescopes from January 2000 to July 2022. A comparison of the average pulse profiles within $\pm300$ d of the event reveals no significant morphological changes. We also estimate the angular velocity lag between the normal and superfluid components at the time of the glitch, demonstrating that one of the spin-down glitch models proposed by Kantor &amp; Gusakov (2014) is not applicable to PSR J1835$-$1106.</description>

      <title>Lomb-Scargle periodograms struggle with non-sinusoidal supermassive BH binary signatures in quasar lightcurves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) systems are expected to form as a consequence of galaxy mergers. At sub-parsec separations, SMBHBs are difficult to resolve, but can be identified as quasars with periodic variability. Previous periodicity searches have identified statistically significant candidates, but focused primarily on sinusoidal signals. However, theoretical models and hydrodynamical simulations predict that binaries produce more complex non-sinusoidal pulse shapes. Here we examine the efficacy of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP; one of the most popular tools for periodicity searches in unevenly sampled lightcurves) to detect periodicities with a saw-tooth shape mimicking results of hydrodynamical simulations. We simulate quasar lightcurves with damped random walk (DRW) variability and inject periodic signals. Our mock sample of 12,400 quasars consists either of idealised well-sampled lightcurves, or mimics the data in the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) analyzed in Charisi et al, 2016. We assess the statistical significance of recovering two types of periodic signals, i.e. with sinusoidal and sawtooth pulse shapes. We find that the LSP detects 39.1% and 28.1% of the sinusoidal signals, in the PTF-like and idealised lightcurves, respectively. The fraction is significantly reduced for sawtooth periodicity, with only 7.5% and 1.1% detected in PTF-like and idealised lightcurves, respectively. These low recovery rates imply that previous searches have missed the large majority of binaries. Therefore, significant improvements are required beyond simple LSPs to successfully uncover SMBHBs in upcoming time-domain surveys.</description>

      <title>Model-Independent Determination of the Tidal Deformability of a 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ Neutron Star from Gravitational-Wave Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal deformability of a 1.4 $M_\odot$ neutron star provides a pivotal window into the physics of dense nuclear matter, bridging gravitational-wave(GW), electromagnetic observations and nuclear physics. In this work, we present a novel, data-driven approach to constrain $\Lambda_{1.4}$ without invoking specific equation-of-state(EOS) models. By interpolating directly over the mass--tidal-deformability posteriors from GW170817, we obtain an EOS-independent constraint of $ \Lambda_{1.4} \;=\; 222.89_{-98.85}^{+420.33}. $ We further combine these GW-based results with the X-ray EOS-independent constraint from \cite{Huang_2025}, deriving a multimessenger limit of $ \Lambda_{1.4} \;=\; 265.18_{-104.38}^{+237.88}, $ which remains largely EOS agnostic. This framework demonstrates that higher-order terms neglected in linear expansion methods do not significantly affect $\Lambda_{1.4}$ estimates under current observational uncertainties. As gravitational-wave detectors improve in sensitivity and more binary neutron-star mergers are discovered, our purely data-driven strategy can serve as a robust standard baseline for extracting neutron-star interior properties without relying on unverified EOS models.</description>

      <title>The Long Road to Alignment: Measuring Black Hole Spin Orientation with Expanding Gravitational-Wave Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the distribution of spin tilts-the angles between the spin vectors and the binary orbital angular momentum-in stellar-mass binary black holes detected by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA would provide valuable insight into their astrophysical origins. Analyses of the 69 binary black holes detected through LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's third observing run yielded model-dependent conclusions, particularly regarding whether the spin tilt distribution exhibits a peak near alignment, as expected for binaries formed in galactic fields. In this work, we simulate populations of up to 1500 binary black hole systems with parameters consistent with the default GWTC-3 analysis, while introducing a correlation that favors small spin tilts for binaries with mass ratios near unity. We find that: (a) spurious peaks away from perfect alignment are possible even with catalogs of up to 300 sources; (b) establishing a definitive peak at alignment remains difficult even with 1500 detections; (c) integrated measurements -- such as the fraction of events with tilt angles smaller than $10^\circ$ or greater than $90^\circ$ -- are more robust and should be preferred, achieving relative 90\% credible uncertainties of $\sim20\%-80\%$ with 1500 sources; and (d) even with the largest simulated catalogs, evidence for a mass ratio-tilt correlation remains inconclusive. Our results suggest that identifying the formation channels of merging black holes using spin tilts will remain challenging, but that model-independent measurements may yield more informative insights over model parameters themselves.</description>

      <title>Implementation of CR Energy SPectrum (CRESP) algorithm in PIERNIK MHD code. II. Propagation of Primary and Secondary nuclei in a magneto-hydrodynamical environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a new model for the production and propagation of spectrally resolved primary and secondary Cosmic Ray (CR) nuclei elements within the framework of the Cosmic Ray Energy Spectrum (CRESP) module of the PIERNIK MHD code. We extend the algorithm to several CR nuclei and demonstrate our code's capability to model primary and secondary CR species simultaneously. Primary C, N, and O are accelerated in supernova (SN) remnants. In contrast, the spallation collisions of the primary nuclei against the thermal ISM protons lead to secondary Li, Be, and B products. All the CR species evolve according to the momentum-dependent Fokker-Planck equations that are dynamically coupled to the MHD system of equations governing the evolution of the ISM. We demonstrate the operation of this system in the gravity-stratified box, reproducing the Milky Way conditions in the Sun's local environment. We perform a parameter study by investigating the impact of the SN rate, CR parallel diffusion coefficient $D_\parallel$, and the rigidity-dependent diffusion coefficient power index $\delta$. A novel result of our investigation is that the Secondary to Primary flux ratio \BtoC grows when the diffusion coefficient grows, due to the weaker vertical magnetic field resulting from CR buoyancy effects. Moreover, a higher SN rate leads to lower values of \BtoC because of stronger winds and the shorter residence of primary CR particles in dense disk regions.</description>

      <title>AstroSat/UVIT far and near UV deep field around IC 4329A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-resolution near-ultraviolet (NUV) and far-ultraviolet (FUV) deep imaging of the field around the Seyfert galaxy IC~4329A based on five observations performed with the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT), onboard AstroSat. The long exposures of 82.9 ks in NUV (N245M; $\lambda_{mean}=2447$\r{A} ; $\Delta\lambda = 270$\r{A}) and 92.2~ks in FUV (F154W; $\lambda_{mean} = 1541$\r{A}; $\Delta\lambda=380$\r{A}) bands constitute the deepest observations with $5\sigma$ detection limits of AB magnitudes $m_{NUV}= 26.2$ and $m_{FUV} = 25.7$. Leveraging UVIT's excellent angular resolution (FWHM $\sim 1.2-1.8^{\prime \prime}$), we performed a detailed analysis of the IC~4329A field and detected (above 5$\sigma$ significance level) a total of 4437 and 456 sources in the NUV and FUV bands, respectively. A large number of these detected sources were unknown previously. We performed astrometry and photometry on all detected sources. By cross-matching our catalogue with Gaia-DR3 and XMM-Newton DR12 catalogues, we found 651 optical and 97 X-ray counterparts of our sources. Additionally, we explored UV variability of point sources, identifying 28 NUV sources as variable with a significance above the $2.5\sigma$ level. Of these, only three sources exhibited variability in the FUV band. Utilising the NUV and Gaia fluxes, we determined that two previously catalogued white dwarf candidates are misclassified. Furthermore, we highlight galaxies with atypical morphology, including ring-like structures, multiple compact central sources, bifurcating spiral arms, etc. Follow-up optical spectroscopy and multi-wavelength observations are imperative to further investigate the nature of the sources within this field.</description>

      <title>X-ray properties of compact elliptical galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the X-ray analysis of seven local compact elliptical galaxies (cEGs), selected for their morphological resemblance to high-redshift red nuggets. As likely descendants of the red nugget population, cEGs offer a unique window into the early Universe, enabling the study of early galaxy evolution and the interplay between black holes, stellar bulges, and dark matter halos. Using data from Chandra and XMM-Newton, we investigate the properties of the hot gaseous halos in cEGs. Two galaxies - MRK 1216 and PGC 32873 - host luminous, spatially extended X-ray atmospheres, allowing us to derive radial thermodynamic profiles. For MRK 1216, we performed high-resolution spectral modeling with RGS data, which hints at super-solar $\alpha/\rm{Fe}$ abundance ratios. The remaining galaxies show either faint or undetected X-ray halos, though several display AGN-like (active galactic nucleus) power-law emission. In the context of local scaling relations, cEGs show only mild deviations from the general galaxy population, exhibiting a slightly steeper $M_{\star}-L_{X}$ relation and occupying the lower boundary of the $M_{\star}$-$M_{\rm vir}$ relation. These trends suggest that high-redshift red nuggets may also host a diverse range of X-ray atmospheres. We speculate that the compactness of cEGs may trace back to the population of `little red dots' (LRDs), hinting at a potential link between LRDs, red nuggets, and compact relic galaxies in the local Universe.</description>

      <title>Are magnetic fields in cosmic voids primordial?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of magnetic fields in the voids of the large-scale structure of the Universe has been a multifaceted open puzzle for decades. On one hand, their origin is not clear with most of the magnetogenesis models using physics beyond the standard model in the early Universe, and on the other hand, their existence and potential role in explaining the spectra of TeV blazars have been intensely debated in the past decade. Here, we show that void fields must exist and can be generated using classical electrodynamics in the late Universe. Specifically, we use the dipole component of the galactic fields, decaying as $r^{-3}$, and show that this generates space-filling magnetic fields in voids with sufficient amplitude to explain the blazar spectra and the lack of GeV halos observed by Fermi-LAT. Our results also show that the void fields might be too strong even for Cherenkov Telescope Array to observe the GeV halos. While primordial magnetic fields could still have been generated through some non-standard physics in the early Universe, our results show that the need for primordial magnetic fields is not strengthened by the presence of void magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Laboratory Benchmark of K-shell Dielectronic Satellites of Fe XXV-XXI Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on comprehensive laboratory studies of the K-shell dielectronic recombination (DR) resonances of Fe XXV - XXI ions that prominently contribute to the hard X-ray spectrum of hot astrophysical plasmas. By scanning a monoenergetic electron beam to resonantly excite trapped Fe ions in an electron beam ion trap, and achieving a high electron-ion collision energy resolution of ~7 eV, we resolve their respective KL$n$ satellites up to n'=11. By normalization to known radiative recombination cross sections we also determine their excitation cross sections and that of the continuum with uncertainties below 15%, and verify our results with an independent normalization based on previous measurements. Our experimental data excellently confirm the accuracy and suitability of distorted-wave calculations obtained with the Flexible Atomic Code (FAC) for modeling astrophysical and fusion plasmas.</description>

      <title>An Overview of the MUSES Calculation Engine and How It Can Be Used to Describe Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For densities beyond nuclear saturation, there is still a large uncertainty in the equations of state (EoS) of dense matter that translate into uncertainties in the internal structure of neutron stars. The MUSES Calculation Engine provides a free and open-source composable workflow management system, which allows users to calculate the EoS of dense and hot matter that can be used, e.g. to describe neutron stars. For this work, we make use of two MUSES EoS modules, Crust Density Functional Theory and Chiral Mean Field model, with beta-equilibrium with leptons enforced in the Lepton module, then connected by the Synthesis module using different functions: hyperbolic tangent, Gaussian, bump, and smoothstep. We then calculate stellar structure using the QLIMR module and discuss how the different interpolating functions affect our results.</description>

      <title>Numerical modeling the mass feeding rates onto accretion-modified stars embedded within AGN disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion disks surrounding supermassive black holes can potentially form stars within the self-gravitating region. These stars undergo high accretion rates because of the dense environment of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disk. The vorticity of the AGN disk may influence the ultimate mass feeding rate toward the star. In our study, we simulate mass feeding rates onto stars at different AGN disk thicknesses through 3D numerical models to explore the relationship between feeding rates and the thermal mass of the star ($q_{\rm th}$), defined as the ratio of the star's Bondi radius to the AGN disk thickness. Our findings indicate that disk shearing with angular momentum can notably decrease the feeding rate, and we provide an approximate formula that links the feeding rate based on the angular momentum of the surrounding gas and the thermal mass $q_{\rm th}$. Lastly, we examine the potential feedback of the rapidly accreting stars on the AGN disk and their subsequent evolution.</description>

      <title>Evolution of broad emission lines from double-peaked to single-peaked to support a central tidal disruption event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, considering evolution of fallback accreting debris in a central Tidal Disruption Event (TDE), the outer boundary increased with time of the disk-like broad emission line regions (BLRs) lying into central accretion disk will lead expected broad emission lines changed from double-peaked to single-peaked. Considering common elliptical orbitals for the accreting fallback TDEs debris, based on simulated results through the preferred standard elliptical accretion disk model, a probability about 3.95\% can be estimated for cases with double-peaked profile changed to single-peaked profile in multi-epoch broad emission lines, indicating such unique profile variability could be indicator for BLRs related to TDE debris. Meanwhile, among the reported optical TDE candidates with apparent broad lines, such profile changes in broad H$\alpha$ can be found in the AT 2018hyz. After accepted the outer boundaries of the disk-like BLRs increased with time, the observed multi-epoch broad H$\alpha$ can be described in AT 2018hyz. Moreover, the elliptical accretion disk model determined time dependent ratios of the outer boundaries of the disk-like BLRs are well consistent with the TDE model expected ratios of the outer boundaries of the fallback TDE debris. Furthermore, the evolution properties of disk-like BLRs can be applied to estimate the locations of the disk-like BLRs of which outer boundary could be about one sixth of the outer boundary of the fallback TDE debris in AT 2018hyz. Such unique profile changes from double-peaked to single-peaked could be applied as further clues to support a central TDE.</description>

      <title>Designing a Potential NASA Fermi Orbit Change</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fermi Gamma ray Space Telescope, launched in 2008, has over 16 years of operations providing gamma ray (8 keV to 300 Gev) spectra science observations of cosmic phenomena. It continues to provide invaluable research for the astrophysics community which include the study of pulsars, cosmic rays, gamma ray bursts, and coordination with gravity wave observations for neutron star mergers. The Fermi Earth orbit at a 500 x 512 km altitude is subject to collision warnings due to new constellations deployed near Fermi: currently over 7,000 satellites and growing. This paper presents analysis concerning changing Fermi's orbit and associated operational flight dynamics considerations.

      <title>Current constraints on the minimally extended varying speed of light model through the cosmic distance duality relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most crucial tests of the standard cosmological model consists on testing possible variations on fundamental physical constants. In frameworks such as the minimally extended varying speed of light model (meVSL), the relationship between the luminosity distance ($D_{\text{L}}$) and the angular diameter distance ($D_{\text{A}}$), namely the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR), is expected to deviate from $\eta(z) \equiv D_{\text{L}}(z)/D_{\text{A}}(z) = (1+z)^{2}$, making it a powerful probe of a potential variation of such a fundamental constant. Hence, we test the viability of the meVSL model through the CDDR by comparing $D_{\text{A}}$ measurements, provided by the transverse (2D) and anisotropic (3D) baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) observations from different surveys, like SDSS, DES and DESI, in combination with $D_{\text{L}}$ measurements from Pantheon+ type Ia Supernova (SNe) compilation. The Gaussian Process reconstruction is employed on the SN data to match $D_{\text{A}}$ with $D_{\text{L}}$ at the same redshift. We find no deviation of the standard CDDR relation within 1-2$\sigma$ confidence level when considering SNe with 2D and 3D BAO samples combined together, as well as when considering SNe with 3D BAO only. However, when SNe and 2D BAO only are considered, the standard CDDR is only recovered at $\sim 4\sigma$ confidence level. However, such a result might be due to some recently discussed tensions between SN and BAO datasets, especially at low redshifts, in addition to possible inconsistencies between the BAO datasets individually. Therefore, our results show no significant evidence in favour of the meVSL model, once these potential systematics are taken into account.</description>

      <title>A New Determination of the Millisecond Pulsar Gamma-Ray Luminosity Function and Implications for the Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been suggested that the Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess (GCE) could be produced by a large number of centrally-located millisecond pulsars. The fact that no such pulsar population has been detected implies that these sources must be very faint and very numerous. In this study, we use the contents of Fermi's recently released Third Pulsar Catalog (3PC) to measure the luminosity function of the millisecond pulsars in the Milky Way's Disk. We find that this source population exhibits a luminosity function with a mean gamma-ray luminosity of $\langle L_\gamma \rangle \sim 6 \times 10^{32} \, \mathrm{erg/s}$ (integrated above 0.1 GeV). If the GCE were generated by millisecond pulsars with the same luminosity function, we find that $\sim 20$ such sources from the Inner Galaxy population should have already been detected by Fermi and included in the 3PC. Given the lack of such observed sources, we exclude the hypothesis that the GCE is generated by pulsars with the same luminosity function as those in the Galactic Disk with a significance of $3.4\sigma$. We conclude that either less than 39\% of the GCE is generated by pulsars, or that the millisecond pulsars in the Inner Galaxy are at least 5 times less luminous on average than those found in the Galactic Disk.</description>

      <title>Shadow of quadrupole-deformed compact objects in a local dark matter shell</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates observational properties, namely the shadow and photon ring structure, of emission profiles originating near compact objects. In particular, we consider a distorted and deformed compact object characterised by two quadrupole parameters and surrounded by an optically thin and geometrically thin accretion disk with different emission profiles modelled by Johnson's Standard-Unbound (SU) distribution in the reference frame of the emitter. Under these assumptions, we produce the observed intensity profiles and shadow images for a face-on observer. Our results indicate that, due to the fact that modifications of the quadrupole parameters affect the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and the unstable photon orbits on the equatorial plane, the observed shadow images and their properties are significantly influenced by the quadrupole parameters and emission profiles. Furthermore, we analyse the impact of the presence of a dark matter halo in the observational imprints considered and verify that both the increase in the matter contained in the halo or the decrease in the length-scale of the halo lead to an increase in the size of the observed shadow. Our results indicate potential degeneracies between the observational features of distorted and deformed compact objects with those of spherically symmetric blackholes, which could be assessed by a comparison with the current and future generation of optical experiments in gravitational physics.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Messenger Search for Exotic Field Emission with a Global Magnetometer Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum sensor networks in combination with traditional astronomical observations are emerging as a novel modality for multi-messenger astronomy. Here we develop a generic analysis framework that uses a data-driven approach to model the sensitivity of a quantum sensor network to astrophysical signals as a consequence of beyond-the-Standard Model (BSM) physics. The analysis method evaluates correlations between sensors to search for BSM signals coincident with astrophysical triggers such as black hole mergers, supernovae, or fast radio bursts. Complementary to astroparticle approaches that search for particlelike signals (e.g. WIMPs), quantum sensors are sensitive to wavelike signals from exotic quantum fields. This analysis method can be applied to networks of different types of quantum sensors, such as atomic clocks, matter-wave interferometers, and nuclear clocks, which can probe many types of interactions between BSM fields and standard model particles.
  We use this analysis method to carry out the first direct search utilizing a terrestrial network of precision quantum sensors for BSM fields emitted during a black hole merger. Specifically we use the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics (GNOME) to perform a search for exotic low-mass field (ELF) bursts generated in coincidence with a gravitational wave signal from a binary black hole merger (GW200311 115853) detected by LIGO/Virgo on the 11th of March 2020. The associated gravitational wave heralds the arrival of the ELF burst that interacts with the spins of fermions in the magnetometers. This enables GNOME to serve as a tool for multi-messenger astronomy. Our search found no significant events, and consequently we place the first lab-based limits on combinations of ELF production and coupling parameters.</description>

      <title>The 3D pulsar magnetosphere with machine learning: first results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10716v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All numerical solutions of the pulsar magnetosphere over the past 25 years show closed-line regions that end a significant distance inside the light cylinder, and manifest thick strongly dissipative separatrix surfaces instead of thin current sheets, with a tip that has a distinct pointed Y shape instead of a T shape. We need to understand the origin of these results which were not predicted by our early theories of the pulsar magnetosphere. In order to gain new intuition on this problem, we set out to obtain the theoretical steady-state solution of the 3D ideal force-free magnetosphere with zero dissipation along the separatrix and equatorial current sheets. In order to achieve our goal, we needed to develop a novel numerical method. We solve two independent magnetospheric problems without current sheet discontinuities in the domains of open and closed field lines, and adjust the shape of their interface (the separatrix) to satisfy pressure balance between the two regions. The solution is obtained with meshless Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). In this paper we present our first results for an inclined dipole rotator using the new methodology. We are able to zoom-in around the Y-point and inside the closed-line region, and we observe new interesting features. This is the first time the steady-state 3D problem is addressed directly, and not through a time-dependent simulation that eventually relaxes to a steady-state. We have trained a Neural Network that instantaneously yields the three components of the magnetic field and their spatial derivatives at any given point. {Our results demonstrate the potential of the new method to generate new solutions of the ideal pulsar magnetosphere.</description>

      <title>On the use of galaxy catalogs in gravitational-wave parameter estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major challenge in gravitational-wave multi-messenger astrophysics is the imprecise localization of gravitational-wave compact binary mergers. We investigate the use of a method to include galaxy catalog information in performing parameter estimation of these events. We test its effectiveness with the gravitational-wave events GW170817, GW190425, and GW190814, as well as with simulated binary neutron star mergers. For GW170817, we recover the true host galaxy as the most probable galaxy after a straightforward mass reweighting, with significantly decreased localization area and volume. On the simulated sample, however, we do not find improvement compared to performing a simple galaxy catalog crossmatch with a regular gravitational wave localization. Future investigations into sampling methods may yield improvements that increase the viability of this method.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diffusion: A Causality-Preserving Model for Cosmic Ray Propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a brand-new formalism for the propagation of relativistic cosmic ray (CR) particles. The propagation of CRs has often been described using the diffusion approximation, which has the drawback that the propagation speed of CRs near the source exceeds the speed of light. By applying the analytic solution of the time-dependent distribution function of photons propagating while undergoing scattering, which we recently proposed, we have succeeded in formulating the propagation of relativistic CRs while preserving causality. The obtained formulae give correct expressions both in the diffusion regime and the ballistic regime, as well as the transition between them. They can be applied to the propagation of PeV CRs around their sources (PeVatrons), the propagation of ultra-high energy CRs, and the description of TeV gamma-ray halos around pulsars.</description>

      <title>Detection of Intermediate-Mass Ratio Inspirals in Globular Clusters: Revealing the Brownian Motion with Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intermediate-mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs) formed by stellar-mass compact objects orbiting intermediate-mass black holes will be detected by future gravitational wave (GW) observatories like TianQin, LISA, and AION. We study a set of 100 IMRI systems in globular clusters obtained from MOCCA simulations to estimate their detectability. Furthermore, we model the Brownian motion of the IMRIs induced by weak interactions with the surrounding field of stars and include its effect on the GW's phase through Doppler and aberrational phase shift. We find that a small fraction of IMRIs ($&lt;10\,\%$) will have signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) high enough to be detected by TianQin, LISA, and AION. However, for all sources detected, the SNR is high enough to discern the Brownian motion of the IMRI. More precisely, we find that the match between the signal containing the effect of the Brownian motion and a waveform model without this effect is mostly low ($&lt;0.8$). These results highlight the importance of including the interaction of IMRIs with the surrounding field of stars to obtain proper detection, but also show the possibility of studying the environment of the source using GWs.</description>

      <title>A novel approach of optimizing the image cleaning performance of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes: Application to a time-based cleaning for H.E.S.S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a time-based cleaning method for H.E.S.S. using CT5 in monoscopic mode and presents an optimization workflow for image-cleaning algorithms to enhance telescope sensitivity while minimizing systematic biases. We evaluate three methods - tail-cut cleaning and two flavours of time-based cleaning TIME3D and TIME4D - and find best-cut configurations for two cases: optimal overall sensitivity and minimal energy threshold. TIME3D achieves a $\sim 15\%$ improvement with regard to the standard tail-cut cleaning for $E &lt; 300$ GeV, with a $\sim 200\%$ improvement for the first energy bin (36.5 GeV &lt; E &lt; 64.9 GeV), providing a more stable performance across a wider energy range by preserving more signal. TIME4D achieves a $\sim 20\%$ improvement at low energies due to superior NSB noise suppression, allowing for an enhanced capability of detecting sources at the lowest energies. We demonstrate that using first-order estimations of the performance of a cleaning, such as image size retaining or NSB pixel reduction, cannot provide a full picture of the expected result in the final sensitivity. Beyond expanding the effective area at low energies, sensitivity improvement requires precise event reconstruction, including improved energy and directional accuracy. Enhanced gamma-hadron separation and optimized pre-selection cuts further boost sensitivity. The proposed pipeline fully explores this, providing a fair and robust comparison between different cleaning methods. The method is general and can be applied to other IACT systems like VERITAS, MAGIC. By advancing data-driven image cleaning, this work lays the groundwork for detecting faint astrophysical sources and deepening our understanding of high-energy cosmic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Beyond Buchdahl's limit: bilayered stars and thin-shell configurations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the theoretical motivations behind the belief that black holes as described by general relativity exist in nature is that it is hard to find matter configurations that mimic their properties, especially their compactness. One of the classic results that goes in this direction is the socalled Buchdahl limit: a bound for the maximum compactness that spherically symmetric isotropic fluid spheres in hydrostatic equilibrium can possibly achieve with an outward-decreasing energy density. However, physically realistic situations could violate both isotropy and the monotonicity of the density profile. Notably, Bondi already showed that if the density profile is allowed to be arbitrary (but remains non-negative), a less restrictive compactness bound emerges. Furthermore, if negative energy densities are permitted, configurations can approach the black hole compactness limit arbitrarily closely. In this work we introduce a set of simple bilayered and thin-shell toy models designed to illustrate the effect of relaxing separately the assumptions of Buchdahl's theorem. Within these models we highlight the existence of two special examples that we have called AdS stars and Einstein Static stars. We also discuss how these toy models may represent some of the main features of realistic systems, and how they could be extended to find more refined models.</description>

      <title>Turbulence Induced Non-Gaussian Spectral Distortion in the Microwave Sky from Photon-Axion Conversion in Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conversion of CMB photons to axions (or axion-like particles (ALPs)) can lead to a unique spectral distortion in the temperature and polarization sky which can be explored in upcoming CMB experiments. In this work we have developed a numerical simulation-based technique of photons to ALPs conversion in the galaxy clusters and show for the first time that this physical process can lead to large non-Gaussian signal in the temperature and polarization field, which is impacted by the presence of inhomogeneities and turbulence in the electron density and magnetic field. Our simulation-based technique can simulate the theoretical signal for different scenarios of cluster electron density and magnetic field turbulence and provides testable predictions to discover ALPs from galaxy clusters using spatially non-Gaussian and anisotropic spectral distortion of the microwave sky. We show that the presence of turbulence in the magnetic field and electron density can impact the Gaussian part of the signal captured in terms of the angular power spectra of the signal by more than an order of magnitude. Also, the presence of turbulence in different clusters will lead the temperature and polarization fluctuations around the cluster region to have varying non-Gaussian distribution, with peaks and tails different from the Gaussian statistics of the CMB anisotropy. This new numerical technique has made it possible to calculate also the non-Gaussian signals and can be used in future CMB analysis in synergy with X-ray and radio observations to unveil ALPs coupling with photons in the currently unexplored ranges, for the masses between about $10^{-14}$ eV--$10^{-11}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Measuring spin precession from massive black hole binaries with gravitational waves: insights from time-domain signal morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robustly measuring binary black hole spins via gravitational waves is key to understanding these systems' astrophysical origins, but remains challenging -- especially for high-mass systems, whose signals are short and dominated by the merger. Nonetheless, events like GW190521 show that strong spin precession can indeed be gleaned from high-mass systems. In this work, we track how spin precession imprints on simulated high-mass binary black hole signals cycle-by-cycle using time-domain inference. We investigate a suite of signals, all with the same spins and (near-unity) mass ratio but different signal-to-noise ratios, total masses, and extrinsic angles, which affect the observed waveform morphology. We truncate each signal at various times and infer source parameters using only the data before or after each cutoff. The resultant posterior allows us to identify which time segments of each signal inform its spin precession constraints. We find that at a sufficiently high post-peak signal-to-noise ratio (SNR, $\rho\sim 20$), spin precession can be constrained by the NRSur7dq4 waveform model when just the post-peak data (i.e., ringdown) is visible. Similarly, at a large enough pre-cutoff SNR ($\rho\sim 10$), spin precession can be constrained using only pre-peak data (i.e., inspiral); this occurs for signals with detector-frame total mass $\lesssim 100 M_{\odot}$ at GW190521's SNR. Finally, we vary the inclination, polarization, and phase angles, finding that their configuration need not be fine-tuned to measure spin precession, even for very high-mass and short signals with 2-3 observable cycles. We do not find that the same morphological features consistently drive precession constraints: in some signals, precession inference hinges on the relationship between a loud merger and quiet pre-merger cycle, as was the case for GW190521, but this is not generically true.</description>
