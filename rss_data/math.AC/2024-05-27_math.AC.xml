      <title>Irreducible integer-valued polynomials with prescribed minimal power that factors non-uniquely</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the question up to which power an irreducible integer-valued polynomial that is not absolutely irreducible can factor uniquely. For example, for integer-valued polynomials over principal ideal domains with square-free denominator, already the third power has to factor non-uniquely or the element is absolutely irreducible. Recently, it has been shown that for any $N\in\mathbb{N}$, there exists a discrete valuation domain $D$ and a polynomial $F\in\operatorname{Int}(D)$ such that the minimal $k$ for which $F^k$ factors non-uniquely is greater than $N$.
  In this paper, we show that, over principal ideal domains with infinitely many maximal ideals of finite index, the minimal power for which an irreducible but not absolutely irreducible element has to factor non-uniquely depends on the $p$-adic valuations of the denominator and cannot be bounded by a constant.</description>

      <title>Gr\"obner bases and final polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [4] Sturmfels linked the Hilbert Nullstellensatz to Gr\"obner bases through final polynomials. In (loc. cit.) it was claimed that final polynomials always appear in a lexicographic Gr\"obner basis of a certain ideal. In this paper, we give a counterexample to this claim. We also show how the introduction of an extra variable restores the claim in a deformed setup, which we call extended final polynomials.</description>

      <title>Invertibility in nonassociative ordered rings and in weak-quasi-topological nonassociative rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Invertibility is important in ring theory because it enables division and facilitates solving equations. Moreover, rings can be endowed with extra ''structure'' such as order and topology that add new properties. The two main theorems of this article are contributions to invertibility in the context of ordered and weak-quasi-topological rings. Specifically, the first theorem asserts that the interval $]0,1]$ in any suitable partially ordered ring consists entirely of invertible elements. The second theorem asserts that if $f$ is a norm from a ring to a partially ordered ring endowed with interval topology, then under certain conditions, the subset of elements such that $f(1-a) &lt; 1$ consists entirely of invertible elements. The second theorem relies on the assumption of sequential Cauchy completeness of the topology induced by the norm $f$, which as we recall, takes values in an ordered ring endowed with the interval topology (an example of a coarse topology). The fact that a ring endowed with the topology associated with a seminorm into an ordered ring endowed with the interval topology is a locally convex quasi-topological group with an additional continuity property of the product is dealt with in a separate section. A brief application to frame theory is also included.</description>

      <title>The $\text{v}$-function of powers of sums of ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field, $I\subset R=K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ and $J\subset T=K[y_1,\dots,y_m]$ be graded ideals. Set $S=R\otimes_KT$ and let $L=IS+JS$. The behaviour of the $\text{v}$-function $\text{v}(L^k)$ in terms of the $\text{v}$-functions $\text{v}(I^k)$ and $\text{v}(J^k)$ is investigated. When $I$ and $J$ are monomial ideals, we describe $\text{v}(L^k)$, giving an explicit formula involving $\text{v}(I^k)$ and $\text{v}(J^k)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a Rees-like algebra of dimension $d$ and $N$ a commutative partially cancellative torsion-free seminormal monoid. We prove the following results. \begin{enumerate}
  \item Let $P$ be a finitely generated projective $A$-module of $\rank\geq d$. Then $(i)$ $P$ has a unimodular element; $(ii)$ The action of $\EL(A\oplus P)$ on $\Um(A\oplus P)$ is transitive.
  \item Let $P$ be a finitely generated projective $A[N]$-module of $\rank~r$. Then $(i)$ $P$ has a unimodular element for $r\geq\max\{3,d\}$; $(ii)$ The action of $\EL(A[N]\oplus P)$ on $\Um(A[N]\oplus P)$ is transitive for $r\geq\max\{2,d\}$. \end{enumerate} These improve the classical results of Serre \cite{Se58} and Bass \cite{Ba64}.</description>

      <title>On the path ideals of chordal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we give combinatorial formulas for the regularity and the projective dimension of $3$-path ideals of chordal graphs, extending the well-known formulas for the edge ideals of chordal graphs given in terms of the induced matching number and the big height, respectively. As a consequence, we get that the $3$-path ideal of a chordal graph is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if it is unmixed. Additionally, we show that the Alexander dual of the $3$-path ideal of a tree is vertex splittable, thereby resolving the $t=3$ case of a recent conjecture in [Internat. J. Algebra Comput., 33(3):481--498, 2023]. Also, we give examples of chordal graphs where the duals of their $t$-path ideals are not vertex splittable for $t\ge 3$. Furthermore, we extend the formula of the regularity of $3$-path ideals of chordal graphs to all $t$-path ideals of caterpillar graphs. We then provide some families of graphs to show that these formulas for the regularity and the projective dimension cannot be extended to higher $t$-path ideals of chordal graphs (even in the case of trees).</description>

      <title>The stable category of monomorphisms between (Gorenstein) projective modules with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let (S; n) be a commutative noetherian local ring and let w in n be non-zero divisor. This paper is concerned with the two categories of monomorphisms between finitely generated (Gorenstein) projective S-modules, such that their cokernels are annihilated by w. It is shown that these categories, which will be denoted by Mon(w;P) and Mon(w; G), are both Frobenius categories with the same projective objects. It is also proved that the stable category Mon(w;P) is triangle equivalent to the category of D-branes of type B, DB(w), which has been introduced by Kontsevich and studied by Orlov. Moreover, it will be observed that the stable categories Mon(w;P) and Mon(w; G) are closely related to the singularity category of the factor ring R = S=(w). Precisely, there is a fully faithful triangle functor from the stable category Mon(w; G) to Dsg(R), which is dense if and only if R (and so S) are Gorenstein rings. Particularly, it is proved that the density of the restriction of this functor to Mon(w;P), guarantees the regularity of the ring S.</description>

      <title>Delta-modular ILP Problems of Bounded Co-dimension, Discrepancy, and Convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $k, n \geq 0$, and $c \in Z^n$, we consider ILP problems \begin{gather*}
  \max\bigl\{ c^\top x \colon A x = b,\, x \in Z^n_{\geq 0} \bigr\}\text{ with $A \in Z^{k \times n}$, $rank(A) = k$, $b \in Z^{k}$ and}
  \max\bigl\{ c^\top x \colon A x \leq b,\, x \in Z^n \bigr\} \text{ with $A \in Z^{(n+k) \times n}$, $rank(A) = n$, $b \in Z^{n+k}$.} \end{gather*} The first problem is called an \emph{ILP problem in the standard form of the codimension $k$}, and the second problem is called an \emph{ILP problem in the canonical form with $n+k$ constraints.} We show that, for any sufficiently large $\Delta$, both problems can be solved with $$ 2^{O(k)} \cdot (f_{k,d} \cdot \Delta)^2 / 2^{\Omega\bigl(\sqrt{\log(f_{k,d} \cdot \Delta)}\bigr)} $$ operations, where $
  f_{k,d} = \min \Bigl\{ k^{k/2},
  \bigl(\log k \cdot \log (d + k)\bigr)^{k/2}
  \Bigr\} $, $d$ is the dimension of a corresponding polyhedron and $\Delta$ is the maximum absolute value of $rank(A) \times rank(A)$ sub-determinants of $A$.
  As our second main result, we show that the feasibility variants of both problems can be solved with $$ 2^{O(k)} \cdot f_{k,d} \cdot \Delta \cdot \log^3(f_{k,d} \cdot \Delta) $$ operations. The constant $f_{k,d}$ can be replaced by other constant $g_{k,\Delta} = \bigl(\log k \cdot \log (k \Delta)\bigr)^{k/2}$ that depends only on $k$ and $\Delta$. Additionally, we consider different partial cases with $k=0$ and $k=1$, which have interesting applications.
  As a result of independent interest, we propose an $n^2/2^{\Omega\bigl(\sqrt{\log n}\bigr)}$-time algorithm for the tropical convolution problem on sequences, indexed by elements of a finite Abelian group of the order $n$. This result is obtained, reducing the above problem to the matrix multiplication problem on a tropical semiring and using seminal algorithm by R. Williams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For projective Reed--Muller-type codes we give a global duality criterion in terms of the v-number and the Hilbert function of a vanishing ideal. As an application, we provide a global duality theorem for projective Reed--Muller-type codes over Gorenstein vanishing ideals, generalizing the known case where the vanishing ideal is a complete intersection. We classify self dual Reed-Muller-type codes over Gorenstein ideals using the regularity and a parity check matrix. For projective evaluation codes, we give a duality theorem inspired by that of affine evaluation codes. We show how to compute the regularity index of the $r$-th generalized Hamming weight function in terms of the standard indicator functions of the set of evaluation points.</description>

      <title>On schemes evinced by generalized additive decompositions and their regularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define and explicitly construct schemes evinced by generalized additive decompositions (GADs) of a given $d$-homogeneous polynomial $F$. We employ GADs to investigate the regularity of $0$-dimensional schemes apolar to $F$, focusing on those satisfying some minimality conditions. We show that irredundant schemes to $F$ need not be $d$-regular, unless they are evinced by special GADs of $F$. Instead, we prove that tangential decompositions of minimal length are always $d$-regular, as well as irredundant apolar schemes of length at most $2d+1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The set $S(n)$ of all elementary symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables is a minimal generating set for the algebra of symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables, but over a finite field ${\mathbb F}_q$ the set $S(n)$ is not a minimal separating set for symmetric polynomials in general. We determined when $S(n)$ is a minimal separating set for the algebra of symmetric polynomials having the least possible number of elements.</description>

      <title>Maximal Ideals in Commutative Rings and the Axiom of Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that within Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF), the Axiom of Choice (AC) implies the Maximal Ideal Theorem (MIT), namely that every nontrivial commutative ring has a maximal ideal. The converse implication MIT $\Rightarrow$ AC was first proved by Hodges, with subsequent proofs given by Banaschewski and Ern\'e.
  Here we give another derivation of MIT $\Rightarrow$ AC, aiming to make the exposition self-contained and accessible to non-experts with only introductory familiarity with commutative ring theory and naive set theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to provide formulas for the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of fiber products and idealization rings. We calculate the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of a fiber product $R \times_T S$, with $R$, $S$ and $T$ being Noetherian local rings with common characteristic and residue field. Inspired by a work of Strazzanti and Armengou we calculate the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of an idealization ring $R \ltimes M$, where $M$ is a finite $R$-module. We explore certain examples and structural consequences and obtain some bounds for the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity.</description>

      <title>Proyective Cohen-Macaulay monomial curves and their affine charts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore when the Betti numbers of the coordinate rings of a projective monomial curve and one of its affine charts are identical. Given an infinite field $k$ and a sequence of relatively prime integers $a_0 = 0 &lt; a_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; a_n = d$, we consider the projective monomial curve $\mathcal{C}\subset\mathbb{P}_k^{\,n}$ of degree $d$ parametrically defined by $x_i = u^{a_i}v^{d-a_i}$ for all $i \in \{0,\ldots,n\}$ and its coordinate ring $k[\mathcal{C}]$. The curve $\mathcal{C}_1 \subset \mathbb A_k^n$ with parametric equations $x_i = t^{a_i}$ for $i \in \{1,\ldots,n\}$ is an affine chart of $\mathcal{C}$ and we denote by $k[\mathcal{C}_1]$ its coordinate ring. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a novel (Gr\"obner-free) combinatorial criterion that provides a sufficient condition for the equality of the Betti numbers of $k[\mathcal{C}]$ and $k[\mathcal{C}_1]$. Leveraging this criterion, we identify infinite families of projective curves satisfying this property. Also, we use our results to study the so-called shifted family of monomial curves, i.e., the family of curves associated to the sequences $j+a_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; j+a_n$ for different values of $j \in \mathbb N$. In this context, Vu proved that for large enough values of $j$, one has an equality between the Betti numbers of the corresponding affine and projective curves. Using our results, we improve Vu's upper bound for the least value of $j$ such that this occurs.</description>

      <title>Toric Sylvester forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11281v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the structure of the saturation of ideals generated by sparse homogeneous polynomials over a projective toric variety $X$ with respect to the irrelevant ideal of $X$. As our main results, we establish a duality property and make it explicit by introducing toric Sylvester forms, under a certain positivity assumption on $X$. In particular, we prove that toric Sylvester forms yield bases of some graded components of $I^{\text{sat}}/I$, where $I$ denotes an ideal generated by $n+1$ generic forms, $n$ is the dimension of $X$ and $I^{\text{sat}}$ the saturation of $I$ with respect to the irrelevant ideal of the Cox ring of $X$. Then, to illustrate the relevance of toric Sylvester forms we provide three consequences in elimination theory over smooth toric varieties: (1) we introduce a new family of elimination matrices that can be used to solve sparse polynomial systems by means of linear algebra methods, including overdetermined polynomial systems; (2) by incorporating toric Sylvester forms to the classical Koszul complex associated to a polynomial system, we obtain new expressions of the sparse resultant as a determinant of a complex; (3) we explote a new formula for computing toric residues of the product of two forms.</description>

      <title>Algebraization Techniques and Rigid-Analytic Artin-Grothendieck Vanishing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First, we prove an algebraization result for rig-smooth algebras over a general noetherian ring; this positively answers the question raised in [Sta24, Tag 0GAX]. Then we prove a general partial algebraization result in non-archimedean geometry. The result says that we can always algebraize a geometrically reduced affinoid rigid-analytic space in "one direction" in an appropriate sense. As an application of this result, we show the remaining cases of the Artin-Grothendieck Vanishing for affinoid algebras, which were previously conjectured in [BM21, {\S}7]. This allows us to deduce a stronger version of the rigid-analytic Artin-Grothendieck Vanishing Conjecture (see [Han20, Conj. 1.2]) over a field of characteristic 0. Using a completely different set of ideas, we also obtain a weaker version of this conjecture over a field of characteristic p&gt;0.</description>
