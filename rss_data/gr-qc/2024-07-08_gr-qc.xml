      <title>Loop Quantum Gravity and CMB Anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent satellite observations have revealed significant anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, a phenomenon that had previously been detected but received limited attention due to its subtlety. With the advent of more precise measurements from satellites, the extent of this anisotropy has become increasingly apparent. This paper examines the CMB radiation by reviewing past research on the causes of CMB anisotropy and presents a new model to explain the observed temperature anisotropy and the anisotropy in the correlation function between temperature and E-mode polarization in the CMB radiation. The proposed model is based on a modified-generalized Compton scattering approach incorporating Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). We begin by describing the generalized Compton scattering and then discuss the CMB radiation in the context of processes occurring at the last scattering surface. Our findings are derived from the latest observational data from the Planck satellite (2018). In our model, besides the parameters available in the Planck data for the standard model ($\Lambda$CDM), we introduce two novel parameters: $\delta_{L}$, the density of cosmic electrons, and $M^2$, a parameter related to the modified-generalized Compton scattering effects. The results indicate that, based on the 2018 Planck data, small values were obtained for $\delta_{L}$ and $M^{2}$, $\delta_{L}=1.63\pm0.08(10^{-13})$ and $M^2=2.28\pm0.34(10^{-4})$), showing no significant deviation from the standard model. Moreover, increasing the values of $\delta_{L}$ and $M^{2}$ leads to an increase in the range of fluctuations in the CMB temperature anisotropy power spectrum and the correlation function between temperature and E-mode polarization for multipoles $l&lt;500$ until the first peak.</description>

      <title>Extended Gravity and Black Hole Shadows: Rotation Accounting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain black hole rotating solutions for Horndesky theory (specific partial case), bumblebee model and Gauss-Bonnet scalar gravity using the specially improved Newman-Janis algorithm. The shadow profiles for these metrics were calculated. Applying the limitations from the Event Horizon Telescope we find the opportunity to constrain model parameters from considered extended gravity theories. We show that for three considered models two of them (Horndesky theory and Gauss-Bonnet scalar gravity) weaken the effect of rotation and bumblebee model enhances it. This conclusion matches the previously obtained one that extended gravity theories by themselves correct the effect of rotation in both directions.</description>

      <title>Violation of Causality in $f(Q)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is ongoing interest in the nonmetricity formulation of gravity. The nonlinear extension of the theory, called $f(Q)$ gravity, has recently been proposed and offers a promising avenue for addressing some of the long-standing challenges in cosmology and fundamental physics. A number of solutions have already been found that have confirmed the usefulness of the theory for astrophysics and cosmology. Motivated by earlier work on G\"odel-type spacetimes, we investigate whether $f(Q)$ gravity admits cosmological solutions that violate causality. We find that G\"odel-type metrics do not appear to be compatible with this modified gravity theory unless it reduces to the trivial case of symmetric teleparallel gravity, corresponding to $f(Q)=AQ+B$, which is equivalent to general relativity. For $f(Q)$ more general than linear, the theory seems endowed with some chronology protection mechanism that shields it from G\"odel-like causality violations.</description>

      <title>Effective-one-body waveform model for noncircularized, planar, coalescing black hole binaries II: high accuracy by improving logarithmic terms in resummations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective-one-body (EOB) models are based on analytical building blocks that, mathematically, are truncated Taylor series with logarithms. These polynomials are usually resummed using Pad\'e approximants obtained first assuming that the logarithms are constant, and then replacing them back into the resulting rational functions. A recent study pointed out that this procedure introduces spurious logarithmic terms when the resummed functions are reexpanded. We therefore explore analytically more consistent resummation schemes. Here we update the TEOBResumS-Dali waveform model for spin-aligned, noncircularized, coalescing black hole binaries by systematically implementing new (still Pad\'e based) resummations for all EOB functions. Once the model is informed by 51 Numerical Relativity simulations this new approach proves key in lowering the maximum EOB/NR unfaithfulness $\bar{F}_{\rm EOBNR}^{\rm max}$ for the $\ell=m=2$ mode (with the Advanced LIGO noise in the total mass range $10-200M_{\odot}$) over the whole Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes catalog of 534 waveforms. A median mismatch of $3.418\times 10^{-4}$ is achieved, which is a marked improvement on the previous value, $1.06\times 10^{-3}$. The largest value, $\bar{\cal F}^{\rm max}_{\rm EOBNR}\sim 10^{-2}$, is found for an equal-mass, equal-spin simulation with dimensionless spins $\sim +0.994$; only six configurations (all equal-mass, and with equal spins larger than $+0.97$) are above $5\times 10^{-3}$. Results for eccentric binaries are similarly excellent (well below $10^{-2}$ and mostly around $10^{-3}$). For scattering configurations, we find an unprecedented EOB/NR agreement ($&lt;1\%$) for relatively small values of the scattering angle, though differences progressively increase as the threshold of immediate capture is approached.</description>

      <title>Structural Implications of the Chameleon Mechanism on White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of the chameleon mechanism on the structure of white dwarfs. Using a shooting method of our design, we solve the corresponding scalar-tensor equilibrium equations for a Chandrasekhar equation of state, exploring various energy scales and couplings of the chameleon field to matter. We find the chameleon field to be in a thick-shell configuration, identifying for the first time in the literature a similarity relation for the radially normalised scalar field gradient. Our analysis reveals that the chameleon mechanism significantly alters the internal pressure of white dwarfs, leading to a notable reduction in the stellar radii and masses and shifting the mass-radius curves below those predicted by Newtonian gravity. Finally, we derive parametric expressions from our results to expedite future analyses of white dwarfs in scalar-tensor theories.</description>

      <title>The two-body problem in 2+1 spacetime dimensions with negative cosmological constant: two point particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We work towards the general solution of the two-body problem in 2+1-dimensional general relativity with a negative cosmological constant. The BTZ solutions corresponding to black holes, point particles and overspinning particles can be considered either as objects in their own right, or as the exterior solution of compact objects with a given mass $M$ and spin $J$, such as rotating fluid stars. We compare and contrast the metric approach to the group-theoretical one of characterising the BTZ solutions as identifications of 2+1-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime under an isometry. We then move on to the two-body problem. In this paper, we restrict the two objects to the point particle range $|J|-1\le M&lt;-|J|$, or their massless equivalents, obtained by an infinite boost. (Both anti-de Sitter space and massless particles have $M=-1$, $J=0$). We derive analytic expressions for the total mass $M_\text{tot}$ and spin $J_\text{tot}$ of the system in terms of the six gauge-invariant parameters of the two-particle system: the rest mass and spin of each object, and the impact parameter and energy of the orbit. Based on work of Holst and Matschull on the case of two massless, nonspinning particles, we conjecture that the black hole formation threshold is $M_\text{tot}=|J_\text{tot}|$. The threshold solutions are then extremal black holes. We determine when the global geometry is a black hole, an eternal binary system, or a closed universe.</description>

      <title>Lunar Time in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the general-relativistic definition of Lunar Coordinate Time (TCL) based on the IAU 2000 resolutions that provide a framework of relativistic reference systems. From this foundation, we derive a transformation equation that describes the relative rate of TCL with respect to Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG). This equation serves as the cornerstone for constructing a relativistic TCL--TCG time conversion algorithm. Using this algorithm, we can compute both secular and periodic variations in the rate of an atomic clock placed on the Moon, relative to an identical clock on Earth. The algorithm accounts for various effects, including time dilation caused by the Moon's orbital motion around Earth, gravitational potentials of both Earth and Moon, and direct and indirect time dilation effects due to tidal perturbations caused by the Sun. Our approach provides exquisite details of the TCL--TCG transformation, accurate to a precision of 1 nanosecond. To validate our methodology for lunar coordinate time, we compare it with the formalism of local inertial frames applied to the Earth-Moon system and confirm their equivalence.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints in symmetric teleparallel gravity with bulk viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the accelerated expansion of the universe within the framework of modified $f(Q)$ gravity. The investigation focus on the role of bulk viscosity in understanding the universe's accelerated expansion. Specifically, a bulk viscous matter-dominated cosmological model is considered, with the bulk viscosity coefficient expressed as $\zeta= \zeta_0 \rho H^{-1} + \zeta_1 H $. We consider the power law $f(Q)$ function $f(Q)=\alpha Q^n $, where $\alpha$ and $n$ are arbitrary constants and derive the analytical solutions for the field equations corresponding to a flat FLRW metric. Subsequently, we used the combined Cosmic Chronometers (CC)+Pantheon+SH0ES sample to estimate the free parameters of the obtained analytic solution. We conduct Bayesian statistical analysis to estimate the posterior probability by employing the likelihood function and the MCMC random sampling technique, along with the AIC and BIC statistical assessment criteria. In addition, we explore the evolutionary behavior of significant cosmological parameters. The effective equation of state (EOS) parameter predicts the accelerating behavior of the cosmic expansion phase. Further, by the statefinder and $Om(z)$ diagnostic test, we found that our viscous model favors quintessence-type behavior and can successfully describe the late-time scenario.</description>

      <title>You shall not pass! -- explicit diffeomorphism violation "no-go" results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper collects several results in the study of the explicit symmetry-breaking limit of the effective-field theory (EFT) description of diffeomorphism and local Lorentz-symmetry breaking, where we generalize a subset of the EFT framework (the "minimal" sector). It is well known that no-go constraints may arise in cases of explicit symmetry-breaking in curved spacetime as a consequence of the Bianchi identities; we show in this work that certain terms in the action can be countenanced and used to cancel would-be no-go constraints, at least in the linearized gravity limit. Nonetheless, we go on to find more potential no-go issues, and we show that one particular explicit breaking subset of the EFT, while evading direct no-go constraints, results in unsuppressed additional polarizations for gravitational waves. In a general treatment of the explicit breaking EFT, but confined to linearized gravity, we explicitly show the existence of an extra degree of freedom, independent of coordinates. We find extra polarizations of gravitational waves in the solutions, with a scalar mode unsuppressed by any coefficient, which could render these cases as no-go as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To model magnetic fields of compact objects we solve the Maxwell equations in the background of the exterior static Schwarzschild and slowly rotating Kerr space-times. We impose the boundary condition that the electromagnetic fields are to vanish at infinity. A full set of solutions is obtained, describing axially symmetric magnetic fields, supplemented by axial electric fields in the case of non-vanishing rotation of the gravitational background. We study the motion of charged test particles in these combined gravitational and electromagnetic fields, in particular considering the conditions for circular equatorial orbits. Such orbits always exist in odd-multipole magnetic fields, and they can exist for particular radii in a combination of two or more even-multipole magnetic fields. Combinations of several odd-multipole fields can give rise to radial variation in the field orientation and the direction of motion of charged particles. Deviations from circularity are described using a perturbative approach. This also allows to study the stability of the parent circular orbits.</description>

Abstract: We consider cosmological models with an arbitrary number of scalar fields nonminimally coupled to gravity and construct new integrable cosmological models. In the constructed models, the Ricci scalar is an integral of motion irrespectively of the type of metric.

      <title>Chameleon Mechanism in Scalar Nonmetricity Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics and the phase-space evolution for the scalar nonmetricity cosmology with a Chameleon mechanism. In particular, we consider a spatially flat Friedmann--Lema\^{\i}tre--Robertson--Walker geometry and within the framework of scalar nonmetricity theory, we consider a generalization of the Brans-Dicke theory in nonmetricity gravity. Introducing a pressureless gas as the matter source, we also incorporate a coupling function responsible for the interaction. Our findings reveal that the choice of connection in nonmetricity gravity significantly impacts the interaction between the scalar field and the matter source. For one particular connection, we discover the absence of asymptotic solutions with a nontrivial interacting component. More precisely, in this scenario, the matter source does not directly interact with the scalar field; however, there is an interaction with the dynamical degrees of freedom provided by the connection.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative wormhole in de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley like massive gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wormhole solution in dRGT massive gravity is examined in this paper in the background of non-commutative geometry. In order to derive the wormhole model, along with the zero tidal force, we assume that the matter distribution is given by the Gaussian and Lorentzian distributions. The shape function in both models involves the massive gravity parameters m2c1 and m2c2. But the spacetime loses its asymptotic flatness due to the action of the massive gravity parameter. It is noticed that the asymptotic flatness is affected by the repulsive effect induced in the massive gravitons that push the spacetime geometry very strongly. We observed that each model violates the null energy criteria, indicating the presence of exotic matter which is necessary to sustain the wormholes. The exotic matter is measured using the volume integral quantifier. Moreover, it is discovered that the model is stable under the hydrostatic equilibrium condition by utilizing the TOV equation. Finally, our research encompassed an exploration of the repulsive influence exerted by gravity. Our findings demonstrated that the presence of repulsive gravity results in a negative deflection angle for photons following null geodesics. Remarkably, we consistently observed negative values for the deflection angle across all values of r0 in the two scenarios examined. This consistent negativity unequivocally signifies the manifestation of the repulsive gravity effect.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work deals with a FLRW cosmological model with spatial curvature and minimally coupled scalar field as the matter content. The curvature term behaves as a perfect fluid with the equation of state parameter w_K = -1/3 Using suitable transformation of variables, the evolution equations are reduced to an autonomous system for both power law and exponential form of the scalar potential. The critical points are analyzed with center manifold theory and stability has been discussed. Also, critical points at infinity have been studied using the notion of Poincare sphere. Finally, the cosmological implications of the critical points and cosmological bouncing scenarios are discussed. It is found that the cosmological bounce takes place near the points at infinity when the non-isolated critical points on the equator of the Poincare sphere are saddle or saddle-node in nature.</description>

      <title>Gravitational field and lensing of a circular chiral vorton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the metric of a circular chiral vorton in the weak field limit. The object is self-supporting by means of its chiral current. A conical singularity with deficit angle, identical to that of straight string with the same linear mass density, is present at the vorton's core. We find that the metric is akin to the electromagnetic $4$-potential of a circular current wire loop, illustrating the concept of gravito-electromagnetism. Surprisingly we find that the solution asymptotically mimics a Kerr-like naked singularity with mass $M_v=4\pi R\mu$ and spin parameter $a=R/2$. Finally, we also simulate the gravitational lensing images by solving the corresponding null geodesic equations. This reveals interesting properties of the images, such as the simultaneous creation of a minimally distorted source image and its Einstein ring, as well as the formation of double images of the back side of the ring.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and greybody factor of Schwarzschild Black Hole in the Cold Dark Matter Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we firstly studied wave function in static spherically symmetric spacetime and obtained effective potential of perturbed fields with spin. Then we applied $6^{\rm{th}}$ order WKB approximation to analyze quasinormal modes of Schwarzschild black hole in the Cold Dark Matter halo in perturbed fields with different spins and derived quasinormal frequencies. Further, to study the relation between quasinormal frequencies and optics, we compare the results of WKB method with eikonal limit formula. At last, we discussed greybody factor in different perturbed fields under this spacetime.</description>

      <title>Scattering effects of bumblebee gravity in metric affine formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore a Schwarzschild-like black hole within the framework of metric--affine bumblebee gravity. First, we investigate the behavior of the Kretschmann scalar and singularities in this modified gravity approach. Next, we introduce a newly defined time coordinate related to a stationary asymptotically flat spacetime. We also analyze the scattering effects and numerically calculate and comprehensively examine the partial and total absorption cross sections. At the high--frequency approximation, we find that the absorption cross section tends to the geodesic capture cross section. The continued fraction method is applied to investigate the quasinormal modes, and we explore the deviations of both the real and imaginary terms of the quasinormal modes from the Schwarzschild case in detail. We verify the relation between the shadow radius and the real part of the quasinormal frequencies at the eikonal limit within this modified gravity framework. Finally, we examine the energy emission rate.</description>

      <title>Revisiting light propagation over (loop) quantum Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the principal aspects through which the effects of quantum gravity are hoped to manifest is the possible modification of the dispersion relation for electromagnetic (e-m) waves. By combining (i) the symmetry reduced approaches to spacetime quantization, including loop quantum cosmology or geometrodynamics framework, and (ii) the (extension of the) Born-Oppenheimer approximation of interacting fields, one can build a reliable though still quasi-phenomenological model for a description of propagation of the e-m radiation over a cosmological spacetime. The past works employing such approach indicated a pathological behavior - superluminal propagation at low energies. We reexamine the approach via systematic studies (using indicated method) of e-m wave propagation over a flat quantum Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker Universe using a synthesis of analytical and numerical methods. It turns out, that (i) the e-m wave propagation agrees with the one predicted by general relativity in the low energy limit, and (ii) loop quantum effects actually suppress the modifications to the dispersion relation in comparison with those predicted, where the geometry is quantized via geometrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Can the induced increase in the angular velocity prevent the overspinning of BTZ black holes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previously we showed that nearly extremal Ba\~{n}ados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black holes can be overspun by test bodies and fields, following the work of Rocha and Cardoso for the extremal case. The naked singularities in AdS space-times correspond to states rotating faster than light in the Ads/CFT correspondence. Therefore, overspinning turns out to be a drastic problem in a (2+1) dimensional AdS space-time, where one cannot invoke backreaction effects. Here, we consider the induced increase in the angular velocity of the event horizon which modifies the condition to allow the absorption of the perturbations satisfying the null energy condition. We show that its magnitude is sufficiently large to prevent the absorption of the challenging modes both for test bodies and scalar fields. We bring a solution to the notorious overspinning problem which does not involve any reference to self-energy or gravitational radiation.</description>

      <title>Primordial acoustic turbulence: three-dimensional simulations and gravitational wave predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) generated by a first-order phase transition at the electroweak scale are detectable by future space-based detectors like LISA. The lifetime of the resulting shock waves plays an important role in determining the intensity of the generated GWs. We have simulated decaying primordial acoustic turbulence in three dimensions and make a prediction for the universal shape of the energy spectrum by using its self-similar decay properties and the shape of individual shock waves. The shape for the spectrum is used to determine the time dependence of the fluid kinetic energy and the energy containing length scale at late times. The inertial range power law is found to be close to the classically predicted $k^{-2}$ and approaches it with increasing Reynolds number. The resulting model for the velocity spectrum and its decay in time is combined with the sound shell model assumptions about the correlations of the velocity field to compute the GW power spectrum for flows that decay in less than the Hubble time. The decay is found to bring about a convergence in the spectral amplitude and the peak power law that leads to a power law shallower than the $k^9$ of the stationary case.</description>

      <title>Primordial gravitational waves in horizon cosmology and constraints on entropic parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hallmark of the 4-parameter generalized entropy is that it can represent various known entropies proposed so far for suitable limits of the parameters, and thus the 4-parameter generalized entropy can be applied on additive as well as on non-additive systems. Thereafter the proposal of the generalized entropy, it becomes important to constrain the corresponding parameters. In the present work, we intend to do this from the perspective of primordial gravitational waves (GWs) generated during inflation. In the background level, the generalized entropy successfully drives a viable and smooth evolution of the universe, particularly from inflation to reheating followed by a radiation era, for certain ranges of the entropic parameters. Consequently we investigate whether such viable ranges of the entropic parameters (coming from the background level) allow the primordial GWs spectrum to pass through the sensitivity curves of various GWs observatories. Therefore, if the future observatories can detect the signal of primordial GWs, then our theoretical expectation carried in the present work may provide a possible tool for the measurement of the generalized entropic parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass of a black hole can dynamically evolve due to various physical processes, such as for instance accretion, Hawking radiation, absorption of gravitational/electromagnetic waves, superradiance, etc. This evolution can have an impact on astrophysical observables, like the ringdown gravitational signal. An effective description of a spherically symmetric black hole with evolving mass is provided by the Vaidya metric. In our investigation, we explore the dynamics of linear perturbations on this background, assuming a constant rate of change for the mass. Despite the time-dependent background, a judicious change of coordinates allows us to treat the perturbations in the frequency domain, and to compute explicitly the quasi-normal modes and the tidal Love numbers.</description>

Abstract: We study the recent gravitational analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm effect for a classical system, namely a complex scalar field. We use this example to demonstrate that the Aharonov-Bohm effect in principle has nothing to do with quantum-mechanics. We then discuss how this classical field description can be connected to the standard one particle quantum description of the Aharonov-Bohm effect.</description>

      <title>Stellar structure in $f(R,T)$ gravity: some exact solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find some exact solutions for constant-density and quark matter equations of state in stellar structure models framed within the $f(R,T)=R+\lambda \kappa^2 T$ theory of gravity, where $R$ is the curvature scalar, $T$ the trace of the stress-energy tensor, and $\lambda$ some constant. These solutions correspond to specific values of the constant $\lambda$, and represent different compactness states of the corresponding stars, though only those made of quark matter can be regarded as physical. The latter modify the compactness (Buchdahl) limit of neutron stars upwards for $\lambda&gt;0$ until saturating the one of black holes. Our results show that it is possible to find useful insights on stellar structure in this class of theories, a fact that could be used for obtaining constraints on limiting masses such as the minimum hydrogen burning mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings that are attached to rapidly spinning black holes can extract significant amounts of rotational energy and angular momentum. Here we study the effect on primordial black holes, which are expected to form with one or more cosmic strings attached. Although large primordial black holes are predicted to rapidly spin up due to accretion soon after forming, we argue that cosmic strings will spin them down again. As a result, the spins of primordial black holes should consequently be observed to be near zero. We also investigate the effect on a supermassive black hole of capturing a cosmic string and the possibility of observing the subsequent spin down by its effect on a pulsar orbiting the black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend a previously successful discussion of the constrained Schr\"{o}dinger system through the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm to the case of the Dirac field. In order to follow the analogy, first we discuss the classical Dirac field as a spinorial variable, by introducing properly defined momenta and a suitably modified, factor ordered Poisson bracket. According to the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm two second class Hamiltonian constraints emerge, leading to a factor ordered Dirac bracket on the full phase space. This becomes the Poisson bracket on the reduced phase space in the canonical chart adapted to the shell. The Dirac equation is recovered both as consistency condition on the full phase space and as canonical equation on the reduced phase space. Alternatively, considering the Dirac field as odd Grassmann variable, we present the details of the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm (with either left and righ derivatives acting on Grassmann valued superfunctions and involving a different type of generalized Poisson and Dirac brackets). We propose a recipe for the canonical second quantization of all three versions of the generalized Dirac brackets, yielding the correct fundamental anticommutator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The double-cone geometry is a saddle of the gravitational path integral, which explains the chaotic statistics of the spectrum of black hole microstates. This geometry is the usual AdS-Schwarzschild black hole, but with a periodic identification of the time coordinate; the resulting singularity at the black hole horizon is regulated by making the geometry slightly complex. Here, we consider generalizations of the double-cone geometry which include the Lorentzian cosmology that sits between the event horizon and the black hole singularity. We analyze this in two and three dimensions, where the cosmology has compact spatial sections and big bang/crunch singularities. These singularities are regulated in the same way by slightly complexifying the metric. We show that this is possible while satisfying the Kontsevich-Segal criterion, implying that these geometries can be interpreted as perturbatively stable saddle points in general relativity. This procedure leads to a novel description of the cosmology in terms of standard observables in the dual boundary CFT. In three dimensions, the cosmological solution gives a new contribution to the two-point function of the density of states in the boundary CFT. Unlike the usual double cone, it describes correlations between black hole microstates with different masses, and in a limit describes correlations between the statistics of heavy states and states near the BTZ threshold.</description>

      <title>Physically Accessible and Inaccessible Quantum Correlations of Dirac Fields in Schwarzschild Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the influence of Hawking decoherence on the quantum correlations of Dirac fields between \textit{Alice} and \textit{Bob}. Initially, they share a \textit{Gisin} state near the Schwarzschild black hole (SBH) in an asymptotically flat region. Then, \textit{Alice} remains stationary in this region, while \textit{Bob} hovers near the event horizon (EH) of the SBH. We expect that \textit{Bob}, using his excited detector, will detect a thermal Fermi-Dirac particle distribution. We assess the quantum correlations in the evolved \textit{Gisin} state using quantum consonance and uncertainty-induced non-locality across physically accessible, physically inaccessible, and spacetime regions. Our investigation examines how these measures vary with Hawking temperature, Dirac particle frequency, and the parameters of the initial \textit{Gisin} state. Additionally, we analyze the distribution of these quantum correlation measures across all possible regions, noting a redistribution towards the physically inaccessible region. Our findings demonstrate that Hawking decoherence reduces the quantum correlations of Dirac fields in the physically accessible region, with the extent of reduction depending on the initial state parameters. Moreover, as Hawking decoherence intensifies in the physically inaccessible and spacetime regions, the quantum correlations of Dirac fields reemerge and ultimately converge to specific values at infinite Hawking temperature. These results contribute to our understanding of quantum correlation dynamics within the framework of relativistic quantum information (RQI).</description>

      <title>Testing the cosmic distance duality relation using Type Ia supernovae and radio quasars through model-independent methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a cosmological-model-independent test on the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) by comparing the angular diameter distance (ADD) obtained from the compact radio quasars (QSOs) with the luminosity distance (LD) from the Pantheon Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) sample. The binning method and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are employed to match ADD data with LD data at the same redshift, and three different parameterizations are adopted to quantify the possible deviations from the CDDR. We initially investigate the impacts of the specific prior values for the absolute magnitude $M_{\rm B}$ from SNIa and the linear size scaling factor $l$ from QSOs on the CDDR test, demonstrating that these prior values introduce significant biases in the CDDR test. To avoid the biases, we propose a method independent of $M_{\rm B}$ and $l$ to test CDDR, which treats the fiducial value of a new variable $\kappa\equiv10^{M_{\rm B} \over 5}\,l$ as a nuisance parameter and then marginalize its impact with a flat prior in the statistical analysis. We demonstrate that the parametric method for testing CDDR can not only be used to reduce the computational complexity associated with numerical integration but also be independent of cosmological models. The results indicate that the CDDR is consistent with the observational data, and QSOs can serve as a powerful tool for testing the CDDR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a complete classification of the consistent two-derivative cubic couplings for a system containing an arbitrary number of massless spin-1, massless spin-2, and partially massless (PM) spin-2 fields in $D$-dimensional (anti-)de Sitter space. In addition to previously known results, we find a unique candidate mixing between spin-1 and PM spin-2 fields. We derive all the quadratic constraints on the structure constants of the theory, allowing for relative ``wrong-sign'' kinetic terms for any of the fields. In the particular case when the kinetic terms in each sector have no relative signs, we find that the unique consistent non-trivial theory is given by multiple independent copies of conformal gravity coupled to a Yang-Mills sector in $D=4$. Our results strengthen the well-known no-go theorems on the absence of mutual interactions for massless and PM spin-2 fields.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional Carrollian fluids I: Carroll-Galilei duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galilean and Carrollian algebras acting on two-dimensional Newton-Cartan and Carrollian manifolds are isomorphic. A consequence of this property is a duality correspondence between one-dimensional Galilean and Carrollian fluids. We describe the dynamics of these systems as they emerge from the relevant limits of Lorentzian hydrodynamics, and explore the advertised duality relationship. This interchanges longitudinal and transverse directions with respect to the flow velocity, and permutes equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium observables, unveiling specific features of Carrollian physics. We investigate the action of local hydrodynamic-frame transformations in the Galilean and Carrollian configurations, i.e. dual Galilean and Carrollian local boosts, and comment on their potential breaking. Emphasis is laid on the additional geometric elements that are necessary to attain complete systems of hydrodynamic equations in Newton-Cartan and Carroll spacetimes. Our analysis is conducted in general Cartan frames as well as in more explicit coordinates, specifically suited to Galilean or Carrollian use.</description>

Abstract: The Carrollian fluid equations arise from the equations for relativistic fluids in the limit as the speed of light vanishes, and have recently experienced a surge of interest in the theoretical physics community in the context of asymptotic symmetries and flat-space holography. In this paper we initiate the rigorous systematic analysis of these equations by studying them in one space dimension in the $C^1$ setting. We begin by proposing a notion of isentropic Carrollian equations, and use this to reduce the Carrollian equations to a $2 \times 2$ system of conservation laws. Using the scheme of Lax, we then classify when $C^1$ solutions to the isentropic Carrollian equations exist globally, or blow up in finite time. Our analysis assumes a Carrollian analogue of a constitutive relation for the Carrollian energy density, with exponent in the range $\gamma \in (1,3]$.</description>

      <title>One-Dimensional Carrollian Fluids III: Global Existence and Weak Continuity in $L^\infty$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Carrollian fluid equations arise as the $c \to 0$ limit of the relativistic fluid equations and have recently experienced a surge of activity in the flat-space holography community. However, the rigorous mathematical well-posedness theory for these equations does not appear to have been previously studied. This paper is the third in a series in which we initiate the systematic analysis of the Carrollian fluid equations. In the present work we prove the global-in-time existence of bounded entropy solutions to the isentropic Carrollian fluid equations in one spatial dimension for a particular constitutive law ($\gamma = 3$). Our method is to use a vanishing viscosity approximation for which we establish a compensated compactness framework. Using this framework we also prove the compactness of entropy solutions in $L^\infty$, and establish a kinetic formulation of the problem. This global existence result in $L^\infty$ extends the $C^1$ theory presented in our companion paper ``One-Dimensional Carrollian Fluids II: $C^1$ Blow-up Criteria''.</description>

      <title>A generalized method of constraining Warm Inflation with CMB data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A thorough MCMC analysis of any inflationary model against the current cosmological data is essential for assessing the validity of such a model as a viable inflationary model. Warm Inflation, producing both thermal and quantum fluctuations, yield a complex form of scalar power spectrum, which, in general, cannot be directly written as a function of the comoving wavenumber $k$, an essential step to incorporate the primordial spectra into CAMB to do an MCMC analysis through CosmoMC/Cobaya. In this paper, we devised an efficient generalized methodology to mould the WI power spectra as a function of $k$, without the need of slow-roll approximation of the inflationary dynamics. The methodology is directly applicable to any Warm Inflation model, including the ones with complex forms of the dissipative coefficient and the inflaton potential.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Ultraviolet Tail of the Primordial Gravitational Wave</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-frequency primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) with wave numbers larger than the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation are originated from the ultraviolet (UV) modes, which are never stretched out of the horizon. Such a UV tail of the PGW energy spectrum has a spurious logarithmic divergence. We study the origin of such a divergence, and find that it comes from the instantaneous inflation-to-post-inflation transition, which can be removed by considering a finite duration. For the first time, we obtain a semi-analytical expression for the PGW energy spectrum. We find that the UV tail decays exponentially, while the decay rate depends solely on the transition rate. When there is a stiff post-inflationary stage, the enhanced PGW displays a characteristic spectral shape of power-law increasing and exponential decaying. We propose a fitting formula which can be used for signal searching.</description>

      <title>Hypergeometric Potential Inflation and Swampland Program in Rescaled Gravity with Stringy Corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by string theory activities, we investigate inflationary models and the swampland criteria in the context of a stringy rescaled gravity.
  Inspired by differential equations associated with special functions, we develop an algorithm to derive new scalar potential functions with hypergeometric behaviors from string theory correction terms. Among others, we obtain a family of models indexed by a couple $(m,n)$, where $m$ and $n$ are natural numbers constrained by hypergeometric behaviors and certain physical requirements. Using the falsification scenario, we confront the derived models with the Planck observational data for such a stringy rescaled gravity. Then, we approach the associated swampland conjectures. For certain models of phenomenological interest, we find that the swampland criteria are satisfied for small values of the slow-roll parameters in such a modified gravity.</description>

Abstract: We initiate the study of stability and pseudospectra of complex momentum modes of asymptotically anti-de Sitter black holes. Similar to quasinormal modes, these can be defined as the poles of the holographic Green's function, albeit for real frequency and complex momentum. Their pseudospectra are in stark contrast to the pseudospectra of quasinormal modes of AdS black holes. Contrary to the case of quasinormal mode pseudospectra, the resolvent is well-defined, and the numerical approximation shows fast convergence. At zero frequency, complex momentum modes are stable normal modes of a Hermitian operator. Even for large frequencies, they show only comparatively mild spectral instability. We also find that local potential perturbations cannot destabilize the lowest complex momentum mode.</description>

      <title>Colloquium: Synthetic quantum matter in non-standard geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation is making a significant impact on scientific research. The prevailing tendency of the field is to build quantum simulators that get closer to real-world systems of interest, in particular electronic materials. However, progress in the microscopic design also provides an opportunity for an orthogonal research direction: building quantum many-body systems beyond real-world limitations. This colloquium takes this perspective: Concentrating on synthetic quantum matter in non-standard lattice geometries, such as fractal lattices or quasicrystals, higher-dimensional or curved spaces, it aims at providing a fresh introduction to the field of quantum simulation aligned with recent trends across various quantum simulation platforms, including atomic, photonic, and electronic devices. We also shine light on the novel phenomena which arise from these geometries: Condensed matter physicists may appreciate the variety of different localization properties as well as novel topological phases which are offered by such exotic quantum simulators. But also in the search of quantum models for gravity and cosmology, quantum simulators of curved spaces can provide a useful experimental tool.</description>

Abstract: We conduct a novel study to obtain the initial spin of the primordial black holes created during a first-order phase transition due to delayed false vacuum decay. Remaining within the parameter space consistent with observational bounds, we express the abundance and the initial spin of the primordial black holes as functions of the phase transition parameters. The abundance of the primordial black holes is extremely sensitive to the phase transition parameters. We also find that the initial spin weakly depends on all parameters except the transition temperature.</description>

Abstract: Moving mirrors have been used for a long time as simple models for studying various properties of black hole radiation, such as the thermal spectrum and entanglement entropy. These models are typically constructed to mimic the collapse of a spherically symmetric distribution of matter in the Minkowski background. We generalize this correspondence to the case of non-trivial background geometry and consider two examples, the Schwarzschild -- de Sitter black hole and the Ba\~nados--Teitelboim--Zanelli (BTZ) black hole. In the BTZ case we were also able to show that this approach works for the spinning black hole which has only axial symmetry.</description>

      <title>I-Love-$\langle c_s^2 \rangle$: Approximately universal relations for the average neutron star stiffness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate observations of neutron stars have deepened our knowledge of both general relativity and the properties of nuclear physics at large densities. Relating observations to the microphysics that govern these stars can sometimes be aided by approximate universal relations. One such relation connects the ratio of the central pressure to the central energy density and the compactness of the star, and it has been found to be insensitive to realistic models for the equation of state to a $\sim 10\%$ level. In this paper, we clarify the meaning of the microscopic quantity appearing in this relation, which is reinterpreted as the average of the speed of sound squared in the interior of a star, $\langle c_s^2 \rangle\!$. The physical origin of the quasi-universality of the $\langle c_s^2 \rangle - C$ relation is then investigated. Making use of post-Minkowskian expansions, we find it to be linked to the Newtonian limit of the structure equations, as well as to the fact that the equations of state that describe NSs are relatively stiff. The same post-Minkowskian approach is also applied to the relations between $\langle c_s^2 \rangle\!$, the moment of inertia, and the tidal deformability of a neutron star, arriving at similar conclusions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the time evolution of non minimal gravity coupling can provide a natural explanation to the apparent Hubble tension. The non minimal coupling induces a modification of the Friedman equation with respect to the $\Lambda$CDM model, and the low redshift variation of the coupling can can affect the distance of the anchors used to calibrate supernovae (SNe), while higher redshift observations are not affected. Since effective field theory (EFT) in unitary gauge predicts the non minimal coupling to be only a function of time, tests of the equivalence principle are insensitive to it, if experiments are performed in regions of space-time where the time scale of the coupling time evolution is much larger than the experiment time scale. The effects of a time varying non minimal gravity coupling only manifest on sufficiently long time scales, such as in cosmological observations at different redshifts, and if ignored lead to apparent tensions in the values of cosmological parameters estimated with observations from different epochs of the Universe history.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our Universe is ruled by quantum mechanics and should be treated as a quantum system. {$SU(\infty)$-QGR is a recently proposed quantum model for the Universe, in which gravity is associated to $SU(\infty)$ symmetry of its Hilbert space. Clustering/blockization of its infinite dimensional state due to random quantum fluctuations divides the Universe to approximately isolated subsystems. In addition to parameters of their {\it internal} finite rank symmetries, states and dynamics of subsystems are characterized by 4 continuous parameters, and the perceived classical spacetime is their effective representation, reflecting quantum states of subsystems and their relative evolution. At lowest order the effective Lagrangian of {$SU(\infty)$-QGR has the form of Yang-Mills gauge theories for both $SU(\infty)$ - gravity - and internal symmetries defined on the aforementioned 4D parameter space. In the present work we study more thoroughly some of the fundamental aspects of {$SU(\infty)$-QGR. Specifically, we clarify impact of the degeneracy of $\mathcal{SU}(\infty)$; describe mixed states of subsystems and their purification; calculate measures of their entanglement to the rest of the Universe; and discuss their role in the emergence of local gauge symmetries. We also describe the relationship between what is called {\it internal space} of $SU(\infty)$ Yang-Mills with the 4D parameter space, and analytically demonstrate irrelevance of the geometry of parameter space for physical observables. Along with these topics, we demonstrate the equivalence of two sets of criteria for compositeness of a quantum system, and show uniqueness of the limit of various algebras leading to $\mathcal{SU}(\infty)$.</description>

      <title>No smooth spacetime: Exploring primordial perturbations in Lorentzian quantum cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent analysis of quantum cosmology has focused on the Lorentzian path integral formulations of both the no-boundary and tunneling proposals. However, it has been criticized that the wave function for linearized perturbations around a homogeneous and isotropic background leads to an inverse Gaussian distribution. This results in divergent correlation functions and cosmological inconsistencies. In this paper we explore these perturbation problems in Lorentzian quantum cosmology, focusing in particular on the quantum creation of closed, flat, and open universes from no spacetime and the beginning of primordial inflation. We show that most quantum cosmological scenarios have serious perturbation problems. We also study the effects of trans-Planckian physics on quantum cosmology, using the generalized Corley-Jacobson dispersion as a case study of modified dispersion relations. Our findings indicate that resolving perturbation problems in Lorentzian quantum cosmology with modified dispersion relations remains a challenge. However, the perturbations can be Gaussian in the quantum creation of the flat or open universe within the confines of the saddle-point approximation and the generalized Corley-Jacobson dispersion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wormhole solutions, bridges that connect different parts of spacetime, were proposed early in the history of General Relativity. Soon after, it was shown that all wormholes violate classical energy conditions, which are non-negativity constraints on contractions of the stress-energy tensor. Since these conditions are violated by quantum fields, it was believed that wormholes can be constructed in the context of semiclassical gravity. But negative energies in quantum field theory are not without restriction: quantum energy inequalities (QEIs) control renormalized negative energies averaged over a geodesic. Thus, QEIs provide restrictions on the construction of wormholes. This work is a review of the relevant literature, thus focusing on results where QEIs restrict traversable wormholes. Both 'short' and 'long' (without causality violations) wormhole solutions in the context of semiclassical gravity are examined. A new result is presented on constraints on the Maldacena, Milekhin, and Popov 'long' wormhole from the recently derived doubled smeared null energy condition.</description>

Abstract: Particles initially at rest hit by a passing sandwich gravitational wave exhibit, in general, thevelocity memory effect (VM): they fly apart with constant velocity. For specific values of the wave parameters their motion can however become pure displacement (DM) as suggested by Zel'dovich and Polnarev. For such a ``miraculous'' value, the particle trajectory is composed of an integer number of (approximate) standing half-waves. Our statements are illustrated numerically by a Gaussian, and analytically by the P\"oschl-Teller profiles.</description>

In this paper, we consider the influence of quintessence, a hypothetical dark energy component with negative pressure. we have computed the extended generalized uncertainty principle (EGUP) corrections to the thermodynamics of RN-AdS black hole, including Hawking temperature, heat capacity, entropy function and pressure. Furthermore, as a special case of EGUP, we have computed and compared the result obtained from the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) with those from the extended uncertainty principle (EUP). This work contributes to the understanding of the interplay between fundamental physics and the macroscopic properties of black holes, offering a novel perspective on the thermodynamics of RN-AdS black holes in the context of quintessence and quantum gravity corrections. More importantly, we found that, unlike in the case of the Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) black hole, the qualitative behavior for the RN-AdS black hole with quintessence remain largely unchanged, except for minor differences, at the equation of state parameters w=-1/3 and w=-2/3. In addition , unlike RN black holes, the phase transition point of RN-AdS black holes shift to almost zero.</description>

      <title>Quadratic perturbations of the Schwarzschild black hole: The algebraically special sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quadratic algebraically special perturbations (ASPs) of the Schwarzschild black hole. Their dynamics are derived from the expansion up to second order in perturbation of the most general algebraically special twisting vacuum solution of general relativity. Following this strategy, we present analytical expressions for the axial-axial, polar-polar and polar-axial source terms entering in the dynamical equations. We show that these complicated inhomogeneous equations can be solved analytically and we present explicit expressions for the profiles of the quadratic ASPs. As expected, they exhibit exponential growth both at the past and future horizons even in the non-linear regime. We further use this result to analyze the quadratic zero modes and their interpretation in terms of quadratic corrections to mass and spin of the Schwarzschild black hole. The present work provides a direct extension beyond the linear regime of the original work by Couch and Newman.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of ringdown with excitation factors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In black hole perturbation formalism, the gravitational waveform is obtained by the convolution of the Green's function and the source term causing radiation emission. Hence, the ringdown properties, namely its start time, depend on both functions. The unknown time-shift encoded in the Green's function introduces a "time-shift problem" for ringdown. We study the ringdown time-shift problem by reconstructing a waveform via the excitation factors of quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of a spinning black hole. For the first time, we reconstruct ringdown with a significant number of QNMs weighted with their excitation factors and confirm its excellent convergence. We then precisely identify the ringdown starting time. We also find (i) that for moderate or large spins and $\ell=m=2$, QNMs should be included up to around the $20$th prograde overtones and around fifth retrograde overtones to reconstruct the ringdown waveform for the delta-function source with a mismatch threshold $ M &lt; O(10^{-3})$. For higher angular modes, a more significant number of QNMs are necessary to reconstruct it; (ii) that the time shift of ringdown caused by the Green's function is the same for different $(\ell, m, n)$ modes but that nontrivial sources can change this conclusion. Finally, we demonstrate (iii) that the greybody factor can be reconstructed with the superposed QNM spectrum in the frequency domain.</description>

      <title>Common origin of black holes in high mass X-ray binaries and in gravitation-wave sources</title>

Abstract: BH HMXB systems are likely the progenitors of the BH-BH mergers detected in gravitational waves by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK). Yet merging BHs reach higher masses (~ $100 M_{\odot}$) than BHs in HMXBs ($\sim 20M_{\odot}$) and have typically lower spins ($a_{\rm BH}\lesssim 0.25$ with a larger values tail) than often claimed for BH in HMXBs ($a_{\rm BH}\gtrsim 0.9$). This could suggest that these two classes of systems belong to different populations, but we show here that this does not have to be the case. The difference in masses is easily explained as the known HMXB-BHs are in galaxies with relatively high metallicity, so their progenitor stars are subject to strong mass loss from winds, leading to relatively low mass BH at core collapse. But LVK can also detect BHs from low-metallicity galaxies that naturally produce more massive stellar-origin BHs. However, a difference in spin is more difficult to explain. Models with efficient angular momentum transport in stellar interiors produces slowly spinning progenitors of both LVK and HMXB BHs. Known HMXBs have orbital periods too long for efficient tidal spin-up, and are also unlikely to have undergone significant accretion spin-up. We show that the derived value of the BH spin depends strongly on how the HMXB accretion disc emission is modelled. We argue that since Cyg X-1 is never observed to be in a soft spectral state, the appropriate spectral models must take into account the Comptonization of the disc photosphere. We show that such models {are consistent with low spin values: $a_{\rm BH}\sim 0.1$.} This has been confirmed recently by other teams for both Cyg X-1 and LMC X-1, and we show this is also the case for M33 X-7. We conclude that all known HMXB BHs can have low spin, in accordance with the results of stellar evolution models. Hence, current observations are consistent with LVK BHs and HMXB BHs belonging to the same population.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Non-minimally Coupled Scalar Fields in the Jordan Frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.08388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of scalar fields with non-minimal gravitational interactions of the form $\xi |\phi|^2 R$ may have important implications for the physics of the early universe. While many studies solve the dynamics of non-minimally coupled scalars in the Einstein frame, where gravity is simply described by the Einstein-Hilbert action, we instead propose a procedure to solve the dynamics directly in the original Jordan frame where the non-minimal couplings are maintained explicitly. Our algorithm can be applied to scenarios that include minimally coupled fields and an arbitrary number of non-minimally coupled scalars, with the expansion of the universe sourced by all fields present. This includes situations when the dynamics become fully inhomogeneous, fully non-linear (due to e.g.~backreaction or mode rescattering effects), and/or when the expansion of the universe is dominated by non-minimally coupled species. As an example, we study geometric preheating with a non-minimally coupled scalar spectator field when the inflaton oscillates following the end of inflation. In the future, our technique may be used to shed light on aspects of the equivalence of the Jordan and Einstein frames at the quantum level.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric black holes with a single axial symmetry in five dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.11782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a classification of asymptotically flat, supersymmetric black hole and soliton solutions of five-dimensional minimal supergravity that admit a single axial symmetry which `commutes' with the supersymmetry. This includes the first examples of five-dimensional black hole solutions with exactly one axial Killing field that are smooth on and outside the horizon. The solutions have similar properties to the previously studied class with biaxial symmetry, in particular, they have a Gibbons-Hawking base and the harmonic functions must be of multi-centred type with the centres corresponding to the connected components of the horizon or fixed points of the axial symmetry. We find a large moduli space of black hole and soliton spacetimes with non-contractible 2-cycles and the horizon topologies are $S^3$, $S^1\times S^2$ and lens spaces $L(p,1)$.</description>

      <title>Generalized Uncertainty Principle for Entangled States of Two Identical Particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11966v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we determine the consequences of the quantum entanglement of a system of two identical particles when a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) is considered. GUP's are usually associated with the existence of a minimal length. We focus on the main GUP's (KMM, ADV, Pedram and Nouicer) and then we determine the minimal uncertainties in position induced by those modified GUP's. Our results point out that the minimal uncertainty is reduced by half of its usual value independently of the GUP employed. This implies that the minimal length is also reduced by half. On the other hand, it is generally expected that the minimal length must not depend on physical system. We overcome this apparent paradox by realizing that the entangled system is composed by two particles so that an effective parameter related to the minimal length must be employed.</description>

      <title>Magnetized tori with magnetic polarization around Kerr black holes: Variable angular momentum discs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15867v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analytical models of magnetized, geometrically thick disks are relevant to understand the physical conditions of plasma around compact objects and to explore its emitting properties. This has become increasingly important in recent years in the light of the Event Horizon Telescope observations of Sgr A$^*$ and M87. Models of thick disks around black holes usually consider constant angular momentum distributions and do not take into account the magnetic response of the fluid to applied magnetic fields. We present a generalization of our previous work on stationary models of magnetized accretion disks with magnetic polarization (Pimentel et al. 2018). This extension is achieved by accounting for non-constant specific angular momentum profiles, done through a two-parameter ansatz for those distributions. We build a large number of new equilibrium solutions of thick disks with magnetic polarization around Kerr black holes, selecting suitable parameter values within the intrinsically substantial parameter space of the models. We study the morphology and the physical properties of those solutions, finding qualitative changes with respect to the constant angular momentum tori solutions (Pimentel et al. 2018). However, the dependences found on the angular momentum distribution or on the black hole spin do not seem to be strong. Some of the new solutions, however, exhibit a local maximum of the magnetization function, absent in standard magnetized tori. Due to the enhanced development of the magneto-rotational instability as a result of magnetic susceptibility, those models might be particularly well-suited to investigate jet formation through general-relativistic MHD simulations. The new equilibrium solutions reported here can be used as initial data in numerical codes to assess the impact of magnetic susceptibility in the dynamics and observational properties of black hole-thick disk systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15744v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that for one sign of the deformation coupling single-trace $T{\bar T}$ deformation moves the holographic screen in G\"{o}del universe radially inward. For the other sign of the coupling it moves the holographic screen radially outward. We (thus) argue, on general grounds, that in holography (single-trace) $T{\bar T}$ deformation can be generally thought of as either moving the holographic boundary into the bulk or washing it away to infinity. In Anti-de Sitter this breaks the spacetime conformal symmetry. We further note that moving timelike holographic boundary into bulk creates a curvature singularity. In the boundary the singularity is understood by states with imaginary energies. To make the theory sensible we introduce an ultraviolet cutoff and thereby move the boundary into the bulk. In this paper we first obtain the Penrose limit of the single-trace $T{\bar T}$ deformed string background and then perform $T$-duality along a space-like isometry to obtain a class of (deformed) G\"{o}del universes. The string background we consider is $AdS_3\times S^3\times {\cal M}_4$. The single-trace $T{\bar T}$ deformation is a particular example of the more general $O(d, d)$ transformations.</description>

Abstract: The microseismic motion, ambient ground vibration caused by ocean waves, affects ground-based gravitational wave detectors. In this study, characteristics of the ocean waves including seasonal variations and correlation coefficients were investigated for the significant wave heights at 13 coasts in Japan. The relationship between the ocean waves and the microseismic motion at the KAGRA site was also evaluated. As a result, it almost succeeded in explaining the microseismic motion at the KAGRA site by the principal components of the ocean wave data. One possible application of this study is microseismic forecasting, an example of which is also presented.</description>

      <title>Features in the Inflaton Potential and the Spectrum of Cosmological Perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological perturbations, originating in the quantum fluctuations of the fields that drive inflation, are observed to be nearly scale invariant at the largest scales. At smaller scales, however, perturbations are not severely constrained and might be of particular importance if their amplitude is large. They can trigger the creation of primordial black holes (PBHs) or stochastic gravitational waves (GWs). Small-scale perturbations are generated during the later stages of inflation, when possible strong features in the inflaton potential can break scale invariance and leave characteristic imprints on the spectrum. We focus on and review three types of features: inflection points and steep steps in the potential, as well as sharp turns in the inflationary trajectory in field space. We show that such features induce a strong enhancement of the curvature spectrum within a certain wavenumber range. In particular cases, they also generate characteristic oscillatory patterns that are transferred in the spectrum of secondary GWs, which are potentially observable by operating or designed experiments. We demonstrate these effects through the calculation of the primordial power spectrum and the PBH abundance in the context of $\alpha$-attractors and supergravity (SUGRA) models of inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The observability of afterglows from binary neutron star mergers, occurring within AGN disks is investigated. We perform 3D GRMHD simulations of a post-merger system, and follow the jet launched from the compact object. We use semi-analytic techniques to study the propagation of the blast wave powered by the jet through an AGN disk-like external environment, extending to distances beyond the disk scale height. The synchrotron emission produced by the jet-driven forward shock is calculated to obtain the afterglow emission. The observability of this emission at different frequencies is assessed by comparing it to the quiescent AGN emission. In the scenarios where the afterglow could temporarily outshine the AGN, we find that detection will be more feasible at higher frequencies (&gt; 10^(14) Hz) and the electromagnetic counterpart could manifest as a fast variability in the AGN emission, on timescales less than a day.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmic magnification is able to probe the geometry of large scale structure on cosmological scales, thereby providing another window for probing theories of the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe. It holds the potential to reveal new information on the nature of dark energy and modified gravity. By using the angular power spectrum, with all known relativistic corrections incorporated, we investigated cosmic magnification in beyond-Horndeski gravity. We probed both the total relativistic signal, and the individual relativistic signals. Our results suggest that surveys at low redshifts ($z \,{\lesssim}\, 0.5$) will be able to measure directly the total relativistic signal in the total magnification angular power spectrum without the need for multi-tracer analysis (to beat down cosmic variance). Similarly, for the Doppler signal, our results indicate that it can also be measured directly at the given low redshifts. However, for the integrated-Sachs-Wolfe, the time-delay, and the (gravitational) potential signals, respectively, it will require going to high redshifts ($z \,{\gtrsim}\, 3$) for the signals to surpass cosmic variance. For actual detectability though, proper quantitative methods and error analysis (not considered in this work) will need to be taken into account, i.e. in addition to cosmic variance. We also found that the beyond-Horndeski gravity boosts relativistic effects; consequently, cosmic magnification. Conversely, relativistic effects enhance the potential of the total magnification angular power spectrum to detect the imprint of beyond-Horndeski gravity.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Non-Gaussian primordial curvature perturbation from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA third observing run</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW), arising from large amplitude primordial density fluctuations, provide a unique observational test for directly probing the epoch of inflation. In this work, we provide constraints on the SIGW background by taking into account the non-Gaussianity in the primordial density fluctuations, using the third observing run (O3) data of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. We find that the non-Gaussianity gives a non-negligible effect on the GW energy density spectrum and starts to affect the analysis of the O3 data when the non-Gaussianity parameter is $F_{\rm NL} &gt; 3.55$. Furthermore, the constraints exhibit asymptotic behavior given by $F_{\rm NL} A_g = \rm{const.}$ at large $F_{\rm NL}$ limit, where $A_g$ denotes the amplitude of the curvature perturbations. In the limit of large $F_{\rm NL}$, we placed a 95% confidence level upper limit $F_{\rm NL} A_g \leq 0.13, 0.09, 0.10$ at fixed scales of $10^{16}, 10^{16.5}, 10^{17}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Shock waves, black hole interiors and holographic RG flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12940v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study holographic renormalization group (RG) flows perturbed by a shock wave in dimensions $d\geq 2$. The flows are obtained by deforming a holographic conformal field theory with a relevant operator, altering the interior geometry from AdS-Schwarzschild to a more general Kasner universe near the spacelike singularity. We introduce null matter in the form of a shock wave into this geometry and scrutinize its impact on the near-horizon and interior dynamics of the black hole. Using out-of-time-order correlators, we find that the scrambling time increases as we increase the strength of the deformation, whereas the butterfly velocity displays a non-monotonic behavior. We examine other observables that are more sensitive to the black hole interior, such as the thermal $a$-function and the entanglement velocity. Notably, the $a$-function experiences a discontinuous jump across the shock wave, signaling an instantaneous loss of degrees of freedom due to the infalling matter. This jump is interpreted as a `cosmological time skip' which arises from an infinitely boosted length contraction. The entanglement velocity exhibits similar dependence to the butterfly velocity as we vary the strength of the deformation. Lastly, we extend our analyses to a model where the interior geometry undergoes an infinite sequence of bouncing Kasner epochs.</description>

      <title>Geometric conservation in curved spacetime and entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an improved definition of new conserved quantities derived from the energy-momentum tensor in curved spacetime by introducing an additional scalar function. We find that the conserved current and the associated conserved charge become geometric under a certain initial condition of the scalar function, and show that such a conserved geometric current generally exists in curved spacetime. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the geometric conserved current agrees with the entropy current for the perfect fluid, thus the conserved charge is the total entropy of the system. While the geometric charge can be regarded as the entropy for non-dissipative fluid, its physical meaning should be investigated for more general cases.</description>

      <title>Massive carrollian fields at timelike infinity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by flat space holography, we demonstrate that massive spin-$s$ fields in Minkowski space near timelike infinity are massive carrollian fields on the carrollian counterpart of anti-de Sitter space called $\mathsf{Ti}$. Its isometries form the Poincar\'e group, and we construct the carrollian spin-$s$ fields using the method of induced representations. We provide a dictionary between massive carrollian fields on $\mathsf{Ti}$ and massive fields in Minkowski space, as well as to fields in the conformal primary basis used in celestial holography. We show that the symmetries of the carrollian structure naturally account for the BMS charges underlying the soft graviton theorem. Finally, we initiate a discussion of the correspondence between massive scattering amplitudes and carrollian correlation functions on $\mathsf{Ti}$, and introduce physical definitions of detector operators using a suitable notion of conserved carrollian energy-momentum tensor.</description>

      <title>Can we identify primordial black holes? Tidal tests for subsolar-mass gravitational-wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of a subsolar object in a compact binary merger is regarded as one of the smoking gun signatures of a population of primordial black holes~(PBHs). We critically assess whether these systems could be distinguished from stellar binaries, for example composed of white dwarfs or neutron stars, which could also populate the subsolar mass range. At variance with PBHs, the gravitational-wave signal from stellar binaries is affected by tidal effects, which dramatically grow for moderately compact stars as those expected in the subsolar range. We forecast the capability of constraining tidal effects of putative subsolar neutron star binaries with current and future LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) sensitivities as well as next-generation experiments. We show that, should LVK O4 run observe subsolar neutron-star mergers, it could measure the (large) tidal effects with high significance. In particular, for subsolar neutron-star binaries, O4 and O5 projected sensitivities would allow measuring the effect of tidal disruption on the waveform in a large portion of the parameter space, also constraining the tidal deformability at ${\cal O}(10\%)$ level, thus excluding a primordial origin of the binary. Vice versa, for subsolar PBH binaries, model-agnostic upper bounds on the tidal deformability can rule out neutron stars or more exotic competitors. Assuming events similar to the subthreshold candidate SSM200308 reported in LVK O3b data are PBH binaries, O4 projected sensitivity would allow ruling out the presence of neutron-star tidal effects at $\approx 3 \sigma$ C.L., thus strengthening the PBH hypothesis. Future experiments would lead to even stronger ($&gt;5\sigma$) conclusions on potential discoveries of this kind.</description>

      <title>Impact of unmodeled eccentricity on the tidal deformability measurement and implications for gravitational wave physics inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the expected large number of binary neutron star (BNS) observations through gravitational waves (GWs), third-generation GW detectors, Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET), will be able to constrain the tidal deformability, and hence the equation of state (EoS) of neutron star (NS) with exquisite precision. A subset of the detected BNS systems can retain residual eccentricity in the detector frequency band. We study the systematic errors due to unmodeled eccentricity in the tidal deformability measurement and its implications for NS EoS and redshift measurement via the Love siren method. We find that the systematic errors in the tidal deformability parameter exceed the statistical errors at an eccentricity of $\sim 10^{-3}$ ($\sim 3\times 10^{-4}$) at $10$Hz reference GW frequency for CE (ET). We show that these biases on tidal deformability parameter can significantly bias the NS EoS inference. Furthermore, the error on tidal deformability propagates to the source frame NS mass, which in turn biases the redshift inference. For CE, the redshift inference is significantly biased at an eccentricity of $\sim 10^{-3}$ (at a reference frequency of $10$Hz). We also study the implications of biased tidal deformability in testing the Kerr nature of black holes. Systematic error on the tidal deformability parameter leads to a non-zero value of tidal deformability for binary black holes, indicating a false deviation from the Kerr nature. Finally, we show that including eccentricity in the waveform model increases the statistical errors in tidal deformability measurement by a factor of $\lesssim 2$. Our study, therefore, highlights the importance of using accurate eccentric waveform models for GW parameter inference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Renormalization of quantum loop effects generated from large fluctuations is a hugely debatable topic of research these days which rules out the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) formation within the framework of single-field inflation. In this article, we briefly discuss that the correct implementation of regularization, renormalization, and resummation techniques in a setup described by an ultra-slow-roll phase sandwiched between two slow-roll phases in the presence of smooth or sharp transitions can lead to a stringent constraint on the PBH mass (i.e. ${\cal O}(10^{2}{\rm gm}$)), which we advertise as a new No-go theorem. Finally, we will give some of the possible way-outs using which one can evade this proposed No-go theorem and produce solar/sub-solar mass PBHs.</description>

      <title>Quintessential interpretation of the evolving dark energy in light of DESI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05722v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent result of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) in combination with other cosmological data shows evidence of the evolving dark energy parameterized by $w_0w_a$CDM model. We interpret this result in terms of a quintessential scalar field and demonstrate that it can explain the DESI result even though it becomes eventually phantom in the past. Relaxing the assumption on the functional form of the equation-of-state parameter $w=w(a)$, we also discuss a more realistic quintessential model. The implications of the DESI result for Swampland conjectures, cosmic birefringence, and the fate of the Universe are discussed as well.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature renormalization of Standard Model coupled with gravity, and its implications for cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite-temperature one-loop renormalization of the Standard Model, coupled with dynamic metrics, is conducted in this study. The entire analysis is coherently carried out by using the refined background field method, applied in the spirit of the Coleman-Weinberg technique. The general form of the propagator, introduced in our previous work to facilitate Feynman diagram computation in a general curved background, proves useful in the presence of time-dependent temperature. Its utilization allows for the analysis of a FLRW background to essentially reduce to that of a constant finite-T flat spacetime. Notably, this method also provides an effective tool for addressing one of the longstanding problems in QCD, the Linde problem. The implications of our findings for cosmology, particularly the cosmological constant problem and Hubble tension, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantumness of gravitational cat states in correlated dephasing channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantumness of gravitational cat states in correlated dephasing channels. Our focus is on exploring how classical correlations between successive actions of a dephasing channel influence the decoherence of two gravitational cats (two qubits) at a thermal regime. The results show that the quantum coherence, local quantum Fisher information, and Bell non-locality can be significantly enhanced by augmenting classical correlations throughout the entire duration when the two qubits pass the channel. However, the gravitational interaction and energy gap between states exhibit intricate impacts on the quantum characteristics of gravitational cats. New features are reported that can be significant for both gravitational physics and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Applying the starquake model to study the formation of elastic mountains on spinning neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a neutron star is spun-up or spun-down, the changing strains in its solid elastic crust can give rise to sudden fractures known as starquakes. Early interest in starquakes focused on their possible connection to pulsar glitches. While modern glitch models rely on pinned superfluid vorticity rather than crustal fracture, starquakes may nevertheless play a role in the glitch mechanism. Recently, there has been interest in the issue of starquakes resulting in non-axisymmetric shape changes, potentially linking the quake phenomenon to the building of neutron star mountains, which would then produce continuous gravitational waves. Motivated by this issue, we present a simple model that extends the energy minimisation-based calculations, originally developed to model axisymmetric glitches, to also include non-axisymmetric shape changes. We show that the creation of a mountain in a quake necessarily requires a change in the axisymmetric shape too. We apply our model to the specific problem of the spin-up of an initially non-rotating star, and estimate the maximum mountain that can be built in such a process, subject only to the constraints of energy and angular momentum conservation.</description>

      <title>Transient dynamics of quasinormal mode sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes of spacetimes with event horizons are typically governed by a non-normal operator. This gives rise to spectral instabilities, a topic of recent interest in the black hole pseudospectrum programme. In this work we show that non-normality leads to the existence of arbitrarily long-lived sums of short-lived quasinormal modes, corresponding to localising packets of energy near the future horizon. There exist sums of $M$ quasinormal modes whose lifetimes scale as $\log{M}$. This transient behaviour results from large cancellations between non-orthogonal quasinormal modes. We provide simple closed-form examples for a massive scalar field in the static patch of dS$_{d+1}$ and the BTZ black hole. We also provide numerical examples for scalar perturbations of Schwarzschild-AdS$_{d+1}$, and gravitational perturbations of Schwarzschild in asymptotically flat spacetime, using hyperboloidal foliations. The existence of these perturbations is linked to certain properties of black hole pseudospectra. We comment on implications for thermalisation times in holographic plasmas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Paczos et al. (Phys. Rev. D 109 (2024)) proposed a covariant quantum field theory for free and interacting tachyon fields. We show that the proposed Feynman propagator leads to unitarity violation in the 1-loop mass renormalization of an ordinary particle it interacts with, proper asymptotic (in/out) tachyon states do not exist, and the proposed S-matrix describing interactions of tachyons and subluminal matter is ill-defined. Since tachyons behave as bosons, interacting tachyons may also self-interact, e.g., any interaction with ordinary matter generates such terms. As a result, the physical vacuum, instead of being at the origin of the potential, may correspond to the proper minimum of the tachyon potential, or such state does not exist at all. Our analysis indicates that quantum tachyon field does not describe a physical on-shell particle with negative mass squared.</description>

      <title>Time transformation between the solar system barycenter and the surfaces of the Earth and Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transformation of time between the surface of the Earth, the solar system barycenter, and the surface of the Moon involves relativistic corrections. For solar system Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB), we also require that there be no rate difference between Terrestrial Time (TT) and TDB. The IAU has addressed these transformations with several resolutions. A series of robotic and crewed landings on the Moon are planned. The analogous transformation between TDB and time on the surface of the Moon (TL) needs a review and discussion. In this paper, we compute the rate terms involved in that transformation. We also present the TDB-compatible spatial scale and Lorentz contraction of Moon-centered positional coordinates. These transformations have been implemented in the JPL programs used to generate ephemerides of the Moon and planets. Finally, we provide expressions that can be used to synchronize TT and TL using either TDB or TT. The relevant transformations contain a small secular drift between the two time scales, along with additional small periodic terms that can be numerically evaluated using the solar system and lunar ephemerides.</description>

      <title>Running of the Number of Degrees of Freedom in Quantum Conformal Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how the number of degrees of freedom in Weyl conformal gravity runs with the energy scale from the UV fixed point. To this end we employ two approaches. First, we utilize the Fradkin--Tseytlin prescription for the number of degrees of freedom and demonstrate that the one-loop results are highly dependent on the selected background. We then employ the counting methodology based on the $a$- and $c$-functions, which are typically used to characterize the trace anomaly of conformal field theory in four dimensions. We compute these in the enhanced one-loop approximation and demonstrate that the degrees of freedom decrease monotonically from six degrees in the UV regime. This behavior is independent of the backgrounds considered. Finally, we show how to relate the Fradkin--Tseytlin prescription to counting based on the $a$- and $c$-functions.</description>
