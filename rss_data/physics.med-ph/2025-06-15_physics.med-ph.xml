      <title>Fast MRI of bones in the knee -- An AI-driven reconstruction approach for adiabatic inversion recovery prepared ultra-short echo time sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Inversion recovery prepared ultra-short echo time (IR-UTE)-based MRI enables radiation-free visualization of osseous tissue. However, sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can only be obtained with long acquisition times. This study proposes a data-driven approach to reconstruct undersampled IR-UTE knee data, thereby accelerating MR-based 3D imaging of bones. Methods: Data were acquired with a 3D radial IR-UTE pulse sequence, implemented using the open-source framework Pulseq. A denoising convolutional neural network (DnCNN) was trained in a supervised fashion using data from eight healthy subjects. Conjugate gradient sensitivity encoding (CG-SENSE) reconstructions of different retrospectively undersampled subsets (corresponding to 2.5-min, 5-min and 10-min acquisition times) were paired with the respective reference dataset reconstruction (30-min acquisition time). The DnCNN was then integrated into a Landweber-based reconstruction algorithm, enabling physics-based iterative reconstruction. Quantitative evaluations of the approach were performed using one prospectively accelerated scan as well as retrospectively undersampled datasets from four additional healthy subjects, by assessing the structural similarity index measure (SSIM), the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), the normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE), and the perceptual sharpness index (PSI). Results: Both the reconstructions of prospective and retrospective acquisitions showed good agreement with the reference dataset, indicating high image quality, particularly for an acquisition time of 5 min. The proposed method effectively preserves contrast and structural details while suppressing noise, albeit with a slight reduction in sharpness. Conclusion: The proposed method is poised to enable MR-based bone assessment in the knee within clinically feasible scan times.</description>

      <title>Automated Treatment Planning for Interstitial HDR Brachytherapy for Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy plays a critical role in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer but remains highly dependent on manual treatment planning expertise. The objective of this study is to develop a fully automated HDR brachytherapy planning framework that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) and dose-based optimization to generate clinically acceptable treatment plans with improved consistency and efficiency. We propose a hierarchical two-stage autoplanning framework. In the first stage, a deep Q-network (DQN)-based RL agent iteratively selects treatment planning parameters (TPPs), which control the trade-offs between target coverage and organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing. The agent's state representation includes both dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics and current TPP values, while its reward function incorporates clinical dose objectives and safety constraints, including D90, V150, V200 for targets, and D2cc for all relevant OARs (bladder, rectum, sigmoid, small bowel, and large bowel). In the second stage, a customized Adam-based optimizer computes the corresponding dwell time distribution for the selected TPPs using a clinically informed loss function. The framework was evaluated on a cohort of patients with complex applicator geometries. The proposed framework successfully learned clinically meaningful TPP adjustments across diverse patient anatomies. For the unseen test patients, the RL-based automated planning method achieved an average score of 93.89%, outperforming the clinical plans which averaged 91.86%. These findings are notable given that score improvements were achieved while maintaining full target coverage and reducing CTV hot spots in most cases.</description>

      <title>Practical Global Backprojection-Convolution in Transmission Cone-beam Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global backprojection-convolution (GBC) is a recently developed theory for exact reconstruction in transmission cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). It is the first exact inversion theory that applies when the X-ray source points comprise a multidimensional `source locus' $X \subset \mathbb R^3$. Theoretically, GBC is computationally highly expedient due to its structure, but producing a practical computational implementation poses a significant challenge because the method is uniquely vulnerable to four sources of discretisation error: (1) accurate discretisation of a multidimensional locus requires more points than for a 1-dimensional locus, (2) the convolution kernel has infinite range and so the backprojected volume must be of infinite size, (3) the discrete convolution kernel cannot be computed in closed form, and (4) aliasing artefacts in the backprojection are enormously magnified by the convolution step. In this article, we propose an assortment of strategies to mitigate the discretisation errors, at the level of the symbolic algorithm. As a prototype, we deploy the concept on the case where $X$ is a cylinder. The resulting algorithm is evaluated through a series of reconstructions of the 3D Shepp-Logan phantom. As additional validation, we also briefly present a reconstruction from a real experimental dataset.</description>

      <title>Censor-Aware Semi-Supervised Survival Time Prediction in Lung Cancer Using Clinical and Radiomics Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01661v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objectives: Lung cancer poses a significant global health challenge, necessitating improved prognostic methods for personalized treatment. This study introduces a censor-aware semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework that integrates clinical and imaging data, addressing biases in traditional models handling censored data. Methods: We analyzed clinical, PET and CT data from 199 lung cancer patients from public and local data respositories, focusing on overall survival (OS) time as the primary outcome. Handcrafted (HRF) and Deep Radiomics features (DRF) were extracted after preprocessing using ViSERA software and were combined with clinical features (CF). Feature dimensions were optimized using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), followed by the application of supervised learning (SL) and SSL. SSL incorporated pseudo-labeling of censored data to improve performance. Seven regressors and three hazard ratio survival analysis (HRSA) algorithms were optimized using five-fold cross-validation, grid search and external test bootstrapping. Results: For PET HRFs, SSL reduced the mean absolute error (MAE) by 26.5%, achieving 1.55 years with PCA+decision tree regression, compared to SL's 2.11 years with PCA+KNNR (p&lt;0.05). Combining HRFs (CT_HRF) and DRFs from CT images using SSL+PCA+KNNR achieved an MAE of 2.08 years, outperforming SL's 2.26 years by 7.96% (p&lt;0.05). In HRSA, CT_HRF applied to PCA+Component Wise Gradient Boosting Survival Analysis achieved an external c-index of 0.65, effectively differentiating high- and low-risk groups. Conclusions: We demonstrated that the SSL strategy significantly outperforms SL across PET, CT, and CF. As such, censor-aware SSL applied to HRFs from PET images significantly improved survival prediction performance by 26.5% compared to the SL approach.</description>
