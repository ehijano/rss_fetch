      <title>Detection of Radio Emission from Super-flaring Solar-Type Stars in the VLA Sky Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar-type stars have been observed to flare at optical wavelengths to energies much higher than observed for the Sun. To date, no counterparts have been observed at longer wavelengths. We have searched the the VLA Sky Survey (VLASS) for radio emission associated with a sample of 150 single, solar-type stars previously been observed to exhibit superflares in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Counterparts to six of these stars were present in VLASS as transient or highly variable radio sources. One of the stars is detected in all three epochs, exhibiting an unprecedented level of apparently persistent radio emission. The engine for this radio emission is unclear, but may be related to accretion, a binary companion, or the presence of large-scale magnetic field. Two stars show radio emission with &gt;50 circular polarization fraction, indicating a coherent emission process likely being present. We find that the six VLASS-detected stars tend to have higher flare rates and higher flare energies of our TESS sample. This, in addition to the VLASS-detected stars adhering to the Gudel-Benz relation, suggest that the radio emission may be directly associated with superflares. These results confirm that the superflare phenomenon on solar-type stars extends to radio wavelengths, in this instance tracing particle acceleration. These data provide the first window on the luminosity function of radio superflares for solar-type stars and highlights the need for coordinated, multi-wavelength monitoring of such stars to fully illustrate the stellar flare-particle relation.</description>

      <title>Stellar model tests and age determination for RGB stars from the APO-K2 catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By adopting the recently empirically derived dependence of $\alpha$-elements on $[\alpha/{\rm Fe}]$ instead of the conventionally applied uniform one, we tested the agreement between stellar model predictions and observations for red giant branch (RGB) stars in the APO-K2 catalogue. We particularly focused on the biases in effective temperature scales and on the robustness of age estimations. We computed a grid of stellar models relying on the empirical scaling of $\alpha$-elements, investigating the offset in effective temperature $\Delta T$ between these models and observations, using univariate analyses for both metallicity [Fe/H] and $[\alpha/{\rm Fe}]$. To account for potential confounding factors, we then employed a multivariate generalised additive model to study the dependence of $\Delta T$ on [Fe/H], $[\alpha/{\rm Fe}]$, $\log g$, and stellar mass. The initial analysis revealed a negligible trend of $\Delta T$ with [Fe/H], in contrast with previous works in the literature. A slight $\Delta T$ difference of 25 K was detected between stars with high and low $\alpha$-enhancement. Our multivariate analysis reveals a dependence of $\Delta T$ on both [Fe/H] and $[\alpha/{\rm Fe}]$, and highlights a significant dependence on stellar mass. This suggests a discrepancy in how effective temperature scales with stellar mass in the models compared to observations. Despite differences in assumed chemical composition, our analysis, through a fortunate cancellation effect, yields ages that are largely consistent with recent studies of the same sample. Notably, our analysis identifies a 6% fraction of stars younger than 4 Ga within the high-$\alpha$ population. However, our analysis of the [C/N] ratio supports the possible origin of the these stars as a result of mergers or mass transfer events.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for the continuum radiative transfer problem inside axis-symmetric circumstellar envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the continuum radiative transfer problem inside circumstellar envelopes is both a theoretical and numerical challenge, especially in the frequency-dependent and multi-dimensional case. While approximate methods are easier to handle numerically, they often fail to accurately describe the radiation field inside complex geometries. For these cases, it is necessary to directly solve numerically the radiative transfer equation. We investigate the accuracy of a discontinuous Galerkin finite element method (DGFEM hereafter) applied to the frequency-dependent two dimensional radiative transfer equation, coupled with the radiative equilibrium equation, inside axis-symmetric circumstellar envelopes. The DGFEM is a variant of finite element methods. It employs discontinuous elements and flux integrals along their boundaries, ensuring local conservation. However, as opposed to the classical finite-element methods, the solution is discontinuous across element edges. We implemented the method in a code and tested its accuracy by comparing our results with the benchmarks from the literature. For all the tested cases, the temperature profile agrees within one percent. Additionally, the emerging spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and images, obtained subsequently by ray-tracing techniques from the DGFEM solution, agree on average within $5~\mathrm{\%}$ and $10~\mathrm{\%}$, respectively. We show that the DGFEM can accurately describe the temperature profile inside axis-symmetric circumstellar envelopes. Consecutively the emerging SEDs and images are also well reproduced. The discontinuous Galerkin finite element method provides an alternative method (other than Monte Carlo methods for instance) for solving the radiative transfer equation, and could be used in cases that are more difficult to handle with the other methods.</description>

      <title>Probing coronal mass ejections inclination effects with EUHFORIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are complex magnetized plasma structures in which the magnetic field spirals around a central axis, forming what is known as a flux rope (FR). The central FR axis can be oriented at any angle to the ecliptic. Throughout its journey, a CME will encounter interplanetary magnetic field and solar wind which are neither homogeneous nor isotropic. Consequently, CMEs with different orientations will encounter different ambient medium conditions and, thus, the interaction of a CME with its surrounding environment will vary depending on the orientation of its FR axis, among other factors. This study aims to understand the effect of inclination on CME propagation. We performed simulations with the EUHFORIA 3D magnetohydrodynamic model. This study focuses on two CMEs modelled as spheromaks with nearly identical properties, differing only by their inclination. We show the effects of CME orientation on sheath evolution, MHD drag, and non-radial flows by analyzing the model data from a swarm of 81 virtual spacecraft scattered across the inner heliospheric. We have found that the sheath duration increases with radial distance from the Sun and that the rate of increase is greater on the flanks of the CME. Non-radial flows within the studied sheath region appear larger outside the ecliptic plane, indicating a "sliding" of the IMF in the out-of ecliptic plane. We found that the calculated drag parameter does not remain constant with radial distance and that the inclination dependence of the drag parameter can not be resolved with our numerical setup.</description>

      <title>Evidence for magnetic boundary layer accretion in RU Lup. A spectrophotometric analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14996v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to characterize the accretion process of the classical T Tauri Star RU Lup. We studied optical high-resolution spectroscopic observations from CHIRON and ESPRESSO, obtained simultaneously with photometric data from AAVSO and TESS. We detected a periodic modulation in the narrow component of the He I 5876 line with a period that is compatible with the stellar rotation period, indicating the presence of a compact region on the stellar surface that we identified as the footprint of the accretion shock. We show that this region is responsible for the veiling spectrum, which is made up of a continuum component plus narrow line emission. An analysis of the high-cadence TESS light curve reveals quasi-periodic oscillations on timescales shorter than the stellar rotation period, suggesting that the accretion disk in RU~Lup extends inward of the corotation radius, with a truncation radius at $\sim 2 ~ R_{\star}$. This is compatible with predictions from three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic models of accretion through a magnetic boundary layer (MBL). In this scenario, the photometric variability of RU Lup is produced by a nonstationary hot spot on the stellar surface that rotates with the Keplerian period at the truncation radius. The analysis of the broad components of selected emission lines reveals the existence of a non-axisymmetric, temperature-stratified flow around the star, in which the gas leaves the accretion disk at the truncation radius and accretes onto the star channeled by the magnetic field lines. The unusually rich metallic emission line spectrum of RU Lup might be characteristic of the MBL regime of accretion. In conclusion, the behavior of RU Lup reveals many similarities to predictions from the MBL accretion scenario. Alternative explanations would require the existence of a hot spot with a complex shape, or a warped structure in the inner disk.</description>

      <title>Systematic search for cool hypervelocity stars in multi-epoch WISE data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sixty years after the discovery of brown dwarfs, the search for these objects continues, particularly in the vicinity of the Sun. Objects near the Sun are characterized by large proper motions, making them seen as fast-moving objects. While the Gaia DR3 catalogue is a comprehensive source of proper motions, it lacks the depth needed for discovering fainter objects. Modern multi-epoch surveys, with their greater depth, offer a new opportunity for systematic search for ultra-cool dwarfs. The study aims to systematically search for high proper motion objects using the newly released catalogue of epochal WISE data in order to identify new brown dwarf candidates in the solar neighborhood, estimate their spectral types, distances and spatial velocities. We used recently released unTimely catalogue of epochal detections in unWISE coadds to search for objects with high proper motions using simple motion detection algorithm. This method was used to identify objects with proper motions exceeding approximately 0.6 arcseconds per year. The identified objects were then cross-referenced with data from other large-scale sky surveys to further analyze their characteristics. The search yielded 3245 moving objects with significant proper motions, 32 of which had not been previously published. Among these, at least 15 were identified as reliable new brown dwarf candidates, with estimated distances closer than 50 parsecs and spectral types later than T0.</description>

      <title>Long-term variation of the solar polar magnetic fields at different latitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polar magnetic fields of the Sun play an important role in governing solar activity and powering fast solar wind. However, because our view of the Sun is limited in the ecliptic plane, the polar regions remain largely uncharted. Using the high spatial resolution and polarimetric precision vector magnetograms observed by Hinode from 2012 to 2021, we investigate the long-term variation of the magnetic fields in polar caps at different latitudes. The Hinode magnetic measurements show that the polarity reversal processes in the north and south polar caps are non-simultaneous. The variation of the averaged radial magnetic flux density reveals that, in each polar cap, the polarity reversal is completed successively from the 70 degree latitude to the pole, reflecting a poleward magnetic flux migration therein. These results clarify the polar magnetic polarity reversal process at different latitudes.</description>

      <title>Key Science Goals for the Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA): Update from the ngVLA Science Advisory Council (2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2017, the next generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) Science Advisory Council, together with the international astronomy community, developed a set of five Key Science Goals (KSGs) to inform, prioritize and refine the technical capabilities of a future radio telescope array for high angular resolution operation from 1.2 - 116 GHz with 10 times the sensitivity of the Jansky VLA and ALMA. The resulting KSGs, which require observations at centimeter and millimeter wavelengths that cannot be achieved by any other facility, represent a small subset of the broad range of astrophysical problems that the ngVLA will be able address. This document presents an update to the original ngVLA KSGs, taking account of new results and progress in the 7+ years since their initial presentation, again drawing on the expertise of the ngVLA Science Advisory Council and the broader community in the ngVLA Science Working Groups. As the design of the ngVLA has also matured substantially in this period, this document also briefly addresses initial expectations for ngVLA data products and processing that will be needed to achieve the KSGs. The original ngVLA KSGs endure as outstanding problems of high priority. In brief, they are: (1) Unveiling the Formation of Solar System Analogues; (2) Probing the Initial Conditions for Planetary Systems and Life with Astrochemistry; (3) Charting the Assembly, Structure, and Evolution of Galaxies from the First Billion Years to the Present; (4) Science at the Extremes: Pulsars as Laboratories for Fundamental Physics; (5) Understanding the Formation and Evolution of Stellar and Supermassive Black Holes in the Era of Multi-Messenger Astronomy.</description>

      <title>Assessing realistic binding energies of some essential interstellar radicals with amorphous solid water: A fully quantum chemical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the absence of laboratory data, state-of-the-art quantum chemical approaches can provide estimates on the binding energy (BE) of interstellar species with grains. Without BE values, contemporary astrochemical models are compelled to utilize wild guesses, often delivering misleading information. Here, we employ a fully quantum chemical approach to estimate the BE of 7 diatomic radicals - CH, NH, OH, SH, CN, NS, and NO, playing a crucial role in shaping the interstellar chemical composition, using a suitable amorphous solid water model as a substrate since water is the principal constituent of interstellar ice in dense and shielded regions. While the BEs are compatible with physisorption, the binding of CH in some sites shows chemisorption, in which a chemical bond to an oxygen atom of a water molecule is formed. While no structural change can be observed for the CN radical, it is believed that the formation of a hemibonded system between the outer layer of the water cluster and the radical is the reason for the unusually large BE in one of the binding sites considered in our study. A significantly lower BE for NO, consistent with recent calculations, is obtained, which is useful in explaining the recently observed HONO/NH2OH and HONO/HNO ratio in the low-mass hot corino, IRAS 16293-2422B, with chemical models.</description>

      <title>Global analysis of the extended cosmic-ray decreases observed with world-wide networks of neutron monitors and muon detectors; temporal variation of the rigidity spectrum and its implication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the global analysis of two extended decreases of the galactic cosmic ray intensity observed by world-wide networks of ground-based detectors in 2012. This analysis is capable of separately deriving the cosmic ray density (or omnidirectional intensity) and anisotropy each as a function of time and rigidity. A simple diffusion model along the spiral field line between Earth and a cosmic-ray barrier indicates the long duration of these events resulting from about 190$^\circ$ eastern extension of a barrier such as an IP-shock followed by the sheath region and/or the corotating interaction region (CIR). It is suggested that the coronal mass ejection merging and compressing the preexisting CIR at its flank can produce such the extended barrier. The derived rigidity spectra of the density and anisotropy both vary in time during each event period. In particular we find that the temporal feature of the ``phantom Forbush decrease'' reported in an analyzed period is dependent on rigidity, looking quite different at different rigidities. From these rigidity spectra of the density and anisotropy, we derive the rigidity spectrum of the average parallel mean-free-path of pitch angle scattering along the spiral field line and infer the power spectrum of the magnetic fluctuation and its temporal variation. Possible physical cause of the strong rigidity dependence of the ``phantom Forbush decrease'' is also discussed. These results demonstrate the high-energy cosmic rays observed at Earth responding to remote space weather.</description>

      <title>Interplanetary Causes and Impacts of the 2024 May Superstorm on the Geosphere: An Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent superstorm of 2024 May 10-11 is the second largest geomagnetic storm in the space age and the only one that has simultaneous interplanetary data (there were no interplanetary data for the 1989 March storm). The May superstorm was characterized by a sudden impulse (SI+) amplitude of +88 nT, followed by a three-step storm main phase development which had a total duration of ~9 hr. The cause of the first storm main phase with a peak SYM-H intensity of -183 nT was a fast forward interplanetary shock (magnetosonic Mach number Mms ~7.2) and an interplanetary sheath with southward interplanetary magnetic field component Bs of ~40 nT. The cause of the second storm main phase with a SYM-H intensity of -354 nT was a deepening of the sheath Bs to ~43 nT. A magnetosonic wave (Mms ~0.6) compressed the sheath to a high magnetic field strength of ~71 nT. Intensified Bs of ~48 nT was the cause of the third and most intense storm main phase with a SYM-H intensity of -518 nT. Three magnetic cloud events with Bs fields of ~25-40 nT occurred in the storm recovery phase, lengthening the recovery to ~2.8 days. At geosynchronous orbit, ~76 keV to ~1.5 MeV electrons exhibited ~1-3 orders of magnitude flux decreases following the shock/sheath impingement onto the magnetosphere. The cosmic ray decreases at Dome C, Antarctica (effective vertical cutoff rigidity &lt;0.01 GV) and Oulu, Finland (rigidity ~0.8 GV) were ~17% and ~11%, respectively relative to quite time values. Strong ionospheric current flows resulted in extreme geomagnetically induced currents of ~30-40 A in the sub-auroral region. The storm period is characterized by strong polar region field-aligned currents, with ~10 times intensification during the main phase, and equatorward expansion down to ~50 deg geomagnetic (altitude-adjusted) latitude.</description>

Abstract: We report the timing and spectral studies of the accreting X-ray pulsar 4U 2206+54 using astrosat and hxmt observations taken in 2016 and 2020 respectively. X-ray pulsations from the system are detected by both missions. The astrosat discovered a significant periodic signal at $\sim 5619$ s in 2016 and hxmt found a pulsation period at $\sim 5291$ s in 2020. A comparison of its spin-period evolution with the present spin-period estimates shows that the neutron star in 4U 2206+54 now has recently undergoing a spin-up episode after attaining to its slow pulsations of ~5750~s around 2015 from its prolonged spin-down phase. The present average spin-up rate of the pulsar is found to be at $\sim1.2\times10^{-13}$ Hz~s$^{-1}$. The phase-averaged spectra of the pulsar in 1-60\kev could be explained with a high energy cutoff power-law continuum model, no evident line features are found with astrosat. The application of Comptonization models such as comptt and compmag to the phase averaged spectra of 4U 2206+54 reveal a hotter source photon region near the pulsar with an emission size extending to $\sim 2-2.8$~km. Using the quasi-spherical settling accretion theory, we explain the present spin-up and the possibility of strong magnetic field of the pulsar.</description>

      <title>Stellar/BH Population in AGN Disks: Direct Binary Formation from Capture Objects in Nuclei Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09129v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Active Galatic Nuclei(AGN) disk has been proposed as a potential channel for the merger of binary black holes. The population of massive stars and black holes in AGN disks captured from the nuclei cluster plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency of binary formation and final merger rate within the AGN disks. In this paper, we investigate the capture process using analytical and numerical approaches. We discover a new constant integral of motion for one object's capture process. Applying this result to the whole population of the nuclei cluster captured by the AGN disk, we find that the population of captured objects depends on the angular density and eccentricity distribution of the nuclei clusters and is effectively independent of the radial density profile of the nuclei cluster and disk models. An isotropic nuclei cluster with thermal eccentricity distribution predicts a captured profile $d N/d r \propto r^{-1/4}$. The captured objects are found to be dynamically crowded within the disk. Direct binary formation right after the capture would be promising, especially for stars. The conventional migration traps that help pile up single objects in AGN disks for black hole mergers might not be required.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRCam 4-5 $\mu$m Imaging of the Giant Planet AF Lep b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With a dynamical mass of $3 \, M_\mathrm{Jup}$, the recently discovered giant planet AF Lep b is the lowest-mass imaged planet with a direct mass measurement. Its youth and spectral type near the L/T transition make it a promising target to study the impact of clouds and atmospheric chemistry at low surface gravities. In this work, we present JWST/NIRCam imaging of AF Lep b. Across two epochs, we detect AF Lep b in F444W ($4.4 \, \mathrm{\mu m}$) with S/N ratios of $9.6$ and $8.7$, respectively. At the planet's separation of $320 \, \mathrm{mas}$ during the observations, the coronagraphic throughput is ${\approx}7\%$, demonstrating that NIRCam's excellent sensitivity persists down to small separations. The F444W photometry of AF Lep b affirms the presence of disequilibrium carbon chemistry and enhanced atmospheric metallicity. These observations also place deep limits on wider-separation planets in the system, ruling out $1.1 \, M_\mathrm{Jup}$ planets beyond $15.6 \, \mathrm{au}$ ($0.58$ arcsec), $1.1 \, M_\mathrm{Sat}$ planets beyond $27 \, \mathrm{au}$ ($1$ arcsec), and $2.8 \, M_\mathrm{Nep}$ planets beyond $67 \, \mathrm{au}$ ($2.5$ arcsec). We also present new Keck/NIRC2 $L'$ imaging of AF Lep b; combining this with the two epochs of F444W photometry and previous Keck $L'$ photometry provides limits on the long-term $3{-}5 \, \mathrm{\mu m}$ variability of AF Lep b on months-to-years timescales. AF Lep b is the closest-separation planet imaged with JWST to date, demonstrating that planets can be recovered well inside the nominal (50\% throughput) NIRCam coronagraph inner working angle.</description>

      <title>Accreting companion occurrence rates using a new method to compute emission-line survey sensitivity: Application to the H-alpha Giant Accreting Protoplanet Survey (GAPlanetS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key scientific goal of exoplanet surveys is to characterize the underlying population of planets in the local galaxy. In particular, the properties of accreting protoplanets can inform the rates and physical processes of planet formation. We develop a novel method to compute sensitivity to protoplanets in emission-line direct-imaging surveys, enabling estimates of protoplanet population properties under various planetary accretion and formation theories. In this work, we specialize to the case of H-alpha and investigate three formation models governing the planetary-mass-to-mass-accretion-rate power law, and two accretion models that describe the scaling between total accretion luminosity and observable H-alpha line luminosity. We apply our method to the results of the Magellan Giant Accreting Protoplanet Survey (GAPlanetS) to place the first constraints on accreting companion occurrence rates in systems with transitional circumstellar disks. We compute the posterior probability for transitional disk systems to host an accreting companion (-8&lt; log MMdot MJ^2/yr &lt; -2) within 2 arcseconds (~200 au). Across accretion models, we find consistent accreting companion rates, with median and one-sigma credible intervals of 0.15 (+0.18, -0.10) and 0.19 (+0.23, -0.12). Our technique enables studying protoplanet populations under flexible assumptions about planet formation. This formalism provides the statistical underpinning necessary for protoplanet surveys to discriminate among formation and accretion theories for planets and brown dwarfs.</description>
