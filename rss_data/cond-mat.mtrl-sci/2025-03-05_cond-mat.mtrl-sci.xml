      <title>A General Neural Network Potential for Energetic Materials with C, H, N, and O elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery and optimization of high-energy materials (HEMs) are constrained by the prohibitive computational expense and prolonged development cycles inherent in conventional approaches. In this work, we develop a general neural network potential (NNP) that efficiently predicts the structural, mechanical, and decomposition properties of HEMs composed of C, H, N, and O. Our framework leverages pre-trained NNP models, fine-tuned using transfer learning on energy and force data derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This strategy enables rapid adaptation across 20 different HEM systems while maintaining DFT-level accuracy, significantly reducing computational costs. A key aspect of this work is the ability of NNP model to capture the chemical activity space of HEMs, accurately describe the key atomic interactions and reaction mechanisms during thermal decomposition. The general NNP model has been applied in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and validated with experimental data for various HEM structures. Results show that the NNP model accurately predicts the structural, mechanical, and decomposition properties of HEMs by effectively describing their chemical activity space. Compared to traditional force fields, it offers superior DFT-level accuracy and generalization across both microscopic and macroscopic properties, reducing the computational and experimental costs. This work provides an efficient strategy for the design and development of HEMs and proposes a promising framework for integrating DFT, machine learning, and experimental methods in materials research. (To facilitate further research and practical applications, we open-source our NNP model on GitHub: https://github.com/MingjieWen/General-NNP-model-for-C-H-N-O-Energetic-Materials.)</description>

      <title>Unveiling temperature and phase boundaries in laser-driven shocked and released copper: insights from ultra-fast X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy up to 300 GPa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cu is an ubiquitous material used in industry for its great thermal and electrical properties. Studying the high-pressure high temperature properties of copper (Cu) is relevant for nuclear fusion research as projectiles and flyers used in hypervelocity impacts are generally made of copper, where it is used also in the design of the nuclear fusion targets. Recently, a solid (fcc)-solid (bcc) phase transition has been detected in shock compressed Cu with X-Ray Diffraction. Here, we present a study on shock compressed copper up to 300 GPa and 7100 K probed by single pulse (100 ps FWHM) X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS). Based on the analysis of the XAS spectra, we provide structural identification and bulk temperature measurements along the Hugoniot up to the melting. The collection of XAS spectra under release conditions, i.e. at later times than the breakout time of the shock wave, helped constraining the experimental fcc-bcc and solid-liquid phase boundaries. In particular, we report the first bulk temperature measurement in shock compressed copper on the melting plateau located between 237(40) GPa and 5750(1130) K and 261 (27) GPa and 6240 (1155) K and on liquid copper at 300 GPa and 7100 K.</description>

      <title>At extreme strain rates, pure metals thermally harden while alloys thermally soften</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When materials are deformed at extreme strain rates, greater than $10^6 \text{ s}^{-1}$, a counterintuitive mechanical response is seen where the strength and hardness of pure metals increases with increasing temperature. The anti-thermal hardening is due to defects in the material becoming pinned by phonons in the crystal lattice. However, here, using optically driven microballistic impact testing to measure the dynamic strength and hardness, we show that when the composition is systematically varied away from high purity, the mechanical response of metals transitions from ballistic transport of dislocations back to thermally activated pinning of dislocations, even at the highest strain rates. This boundary from "hotter-is-stronger" to "hotter-is-softer" is observed and mapped for nickel, titanium, and gold. The ability to tune between deformation mechanisms with very different temperature dependencies speaks to new directions for alloy design in extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Metastability and Ostwald Step Rule in the Crystallisation of Diamond and Graphite from Molten Carbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crystallisation of carbon from the melt under extreme conditions is highly relevant to earth and planetary science, materials manufacturing, and nuclear fusion research. The thermodynamic conditions near the graphite-diamond-liquid (GDL) triple point are especially of interest for geological and technological applications, but high-pressure flash heating experiments aiming to resolve this region of the phase diagram of carbon exhibit large discrepancies. Experimental challenges are often related to the persistence of metastable crystalline or glassy phases, superheated crystals, or supercooled liquids. A deeper understanding of the crystallisation kinetics of diamond and graphite is crucial for effectively interpreting the outcomes of these experiments. Here, we reveal the microscopic mechanisms of diamond and graphite nucleation from liquid carbon through molecular simulations with first-principles machine learning potentials. Our simulations accurately reproduce the experimental phase diagram of carbon in the region around the GDL triple point and show that liquid carbon crystallises spontaneously upon cooling at constant pressure. Surprisingly, metastable graphite crystallises in the domain of diamond thermodynamic stability at pressures above the triple point. Furthermore, whereas diamond crystallises through a classical nucleation pathway, graphite follows a two-step process in which low-density fluctuations forego ordering. Calculations of the nucleation rates of the two competing phases confirm this result and reveal a manifestation of Ostwald's step rule where the strong metastability of graphite hinders the transformation to the stable diamond phase. Our results provide a new key to interpreting melting and recrystallisation experiments and shed light on nucleation kinetics in polymorphic materials with deep metastable states.</description>

      <title>Polymerization of environmentally stable 1D-NF chain with high-energy density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on first-principles calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics methods, the energies density, suitable precursor, and synthesis conditions of Cmca-type NF compound with 1D chain feature are investigated. We find that if using Al as reducing agent, it possesses an gravimetric energy density of 13.55 kJ/g higher than that of cg-N (9.70 kJ/g), since it has both polymerized nitrogen and strong oxidizing F atoms. The cis N2F2 molecules is a suitable precursor, and they can polymerize to cis NF chains above 90 GPa. Furthermore, the phase diagram of Cmca-type NF compound is established at conditions of 0-3000 K and 0-200 GPa. Importantly, NF chains polymerized under high temperature and pressure can be quenched to ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>Giant moment increase by ultrafast laser light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is now well established that a few femtosecond laser pulse will induce an ultrafast loss of moment in a magnetic material. Here we show that the opposite effect can also occur: an ultrafast increase in moment. Employing both tight-binding and state-of-the-art time dependent density functional theory we find that laser light tuned to the majority spin conduction band in the 2d magnets CrI$_3$ and CrSBr generates an ultrafast giant moment increase, of up to 33\% in the case of CrI$_3$ (2~$\mu_B$). Underpinning this is spin-orbit induced valence band spin texture that, in combination with a strong field light pulse, facilitates an optical spin flip transition involving both intra- and inter-band excitation. Our findings, that establish a general mechanism by which ultrafast light pulses may enhance as well as decrease the magnetic moment, point towards rich possibilities for light control over magnetic matter at femtosecond times.</description>

      <title>Electronic structures of crystalline and amorphous GeSe and GeSbTe compounds using machine learning empirical pseudopotentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The newly developed machine learning (ML) empirical pseudopotential (EP) method overcomes the poor transferability of the traditional EP method with the help of ML techniques while preserving its formal simplicity and computational efficiency. We apply the new method to binary and ternary systems such as GeSe and Ge-Sb-Te (GST) compounds, well-known materials for non-volatile phase-change memory and related technologies. Using a training set of {\it ab initio} electronic energy bands and rotation-covariant descriptors for various GeSe and GST compounds, we generate transferable EPs for Ge, Se, Sb, and Te. We demonstrate that the new ML model accurately reproduces the energy bands and wavefunctions of structures outside the training set, closely matching first-principles calculations. This accuracy is achieved with significantly lower computational costs due to the elimination of self-consistency iterations and the reduced size of the plane-wave basis set. Notably, the method maintains accuracy even for diverse local atomic environments, such as amorphous phases or larger systems not explicitly included in the training set.</description>

      <title>Wyckoff Transformer: Generation of Symmetric Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry rules that atoms obey when they bond together to form an ordered crystal play a fundamental role in determining their physical, chemical, and electronic properties such as electrical and thermal conductivity, optical and polarization behavior, and mechanical strength. Almost all known crystalline materials have internal symmetry. Consistently generating stable crystal structures is still an open challenge, specifically because such symmetry rules are not accounted for. To address this issue, we propose WyFormer, a generative model for materials conditioned on space group symmetry. We use Wyckoff positions as the basis for an elegant, compressed, and discrete structure representation. To model the distribution, we develop a permutation-invariant autoregressive model based on the Transformer and an absence of positional encoding. WyFormer has a unique and powerful synergy of attributes, proven by extensive experimentation: best-in-class symmetry-conditioned generation, physics-motivated inductive bias, competitive stability of the generated structures, competitive material property prediction quality, and unparalleled inference speed.</description>

      <title>Structural and Dynamical Behaviors of Fast Ionic Conducting Potassium nido-(Carba)borates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state batteries are one of the most recent iterations of electrochemical energy storage, and the technology can potentially provide safer and more-energy-dense batteries. The metal closo- and nido-(carba)borates show promise as versatile solid electrolytes and have been shown to have some of the highest ionic conductivities as well as wide electrochemical stability windows. In the present study, we investigate the four potassium nido-(carba)borates KB$_{11}$H$_{14}$, K-7-CB$_{10}$H$_{13}$, K-7,8-C$_2$B$_9$H$_{12}$, and K-7,9-C$_2$B$_9$H$_{12}$, and a total of eight new crystal structures were solved. All four compounds transition from a low-temperature, ordered phase to a high-temperature, disordered phase with the space group Fm-3m. In the high-temperature polymorphs, the anions are disordered and undergo rapid reorientational dynamics, which is confirmed by quasielastic neutron scattering experiments. Reorientational activation energies of 0.151(2) eV, 0.146(32) eV, and 0.143(3) eV were determined for K-7-CB$_{10}$H$_{13}$, K-7,8-C$_2$B$_9$H$_{12}$, and K-7,9-C$_2$B$_9$H$_{12}$, respectively. Additionally, such rotationally fluid anions are concomitant with fast potassium-ion conductivity. The highest ionic conductivity is observed for K-7,8-C$_2$B$_9$H$_{12}$ with 1.7$\times$10$^{-2}$ Scm$^{-1}$ at 500 K and an activation energy of 0.28 eV in the disordered state. The differences in phase transition temperatures, reorientational dynamics, and ionic conductivities between the potassium nido-(carba)borates illustrate a strong correlation between the K$^+$ cationic mobility and the local cation-anion interactions, anion dynamics, and the specific positions of the carbon-atoms in the nido-(carba)borate anion cages.</description>

      <title>Spin valve effect in junctions with a single ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin valves are essential components in spintronic memory devices, whose conductance is modulated by controlling spin-polarized electron tunneling through the alignment of the magnetization in ferromagnetic elements. Whereas conventional spin valves unavoidably require at least two ferromagnetic elements, here we demonstrate a van der Waals spin valve based on a tunnel junction that comprises only one such ferromagnetic layer. Our devices combine a Fe3GeTe2 electrode acting as spin injector together with a paramagnetic tunnel barrier, formed by a CrBr3 multilayer operated above its Curie temperature. We show that these devices exhibit a conductance modulation with values comparable to that of conventional spin valves. A quantitative analysis of the magnetoconductance that accounts for the field-induced magnetization of CrBr3, and that includes the effect of exchange interaction, confirms that the spin valve effect originates from the paramagnetic response of the barrier, in the absence of spontaneous magnetization in CrBr3.</description>

      <title>Theory of Photocurrent and High-Harmonic Generation with Chiral Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically discover possible dc-current induction and high-harmonic generation from photodriven chiral fermions in B20-type semimetals irradiated with circularly polarized light as nonlinear optical responses with several unconventional properties. First, we find multiple sign changes of the induced bulk dc photocurrent as a function of light parameters, which is ascribed to the nature of asymmetric photon-dressed bands in chiral systems. Moreover, we observe a parity-dependent directivity of high-harmonic generation where the odd- and even-order harmonics have intensities only in directions perpendicular and parallel to the polarization plane, respectively, which can be understood from dynamical symmetry of the present photodriven chiral systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Charge Transport in A-site Ordered Perovskite Derivatives A2A'Bi2I9 (A = Cs; A'= Ag, Cu): A First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have synthesized Cs2AgBi2I9 by partially substituting Cs+ with Ag+ at the A-site of Cs3Bi2I9, resulting in enhanced charge transport properties compared to Cs3Bi2I9. However, the atomic-scale mechanisms behind this enhancement remain unclear. In this work, we investigate the carrier transport mechanisms in Cs2A'Bi2I9 (A' = Ag, Cu) using first-principles calculations and Boltzmann transport calculations. Our results reveal that A-site ordered Cs2A'Bi2I9 exhibits carrier mobilities that are 3-4 times higher than those of Cs3Bi2I9 within the 100-500 K temperature range. We identify polar phonon scattering as the dominant mechanism limiting mobility. Furthermore, the enhanced out-of-plane carrier mobility in Cs2A'Bi2I9, particularly between 100 and 200K, leads to reduced mobility anisotropy. These improvements are mainly due to the shorter A'-I bond lengths and increased Ag+/Cu+ s-I p orbital coupling. Notably, substitution with Cu+ results in a further reduction in the band gap and enhanced hole mobility compared to Ag+ substitution in Cs3Bi2I9. Further analysis reveals that the significant increase in carrier mobility in Cs2A'Bi2I9 can be largely explained by the smaller carrier effective masses (m*) and weaker Fr\"ohlich coupling strengths ({\alpha}), resulting in a lower polar mass {\alpha}(m*/me), compared to Cs3Bi2I9. Our study provides valuable insights into the transport properties of Bi-based perovskite derivatives, paving the way for their future applications in optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>THz-Driven Coherent Phonon Fingerprints of Hidden Symmetry Breaking in 2D Layered Hybrid Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-halide perovskites (MHPs) emerged as a family of novel semiconductors with outstanding optoelectronic properties for applications in photovoltaics and light emission. Recently, they also attract interest as promising candidates for spintronics. In materials lacking inversion symmetry, spin-orbit coupling (SOC) leads to the Rashba-Dresselhaus effect, offering a pathway for spin current control. Therefore, inversion symmetry breaking in MHPs, which are characterized by strong SOC, has crucial implications. Yet, in complex low-dimensional hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs), the presence of and structural contributions to inversion symmetry breaking remain elusive. Here, employing intense THz fields, we coherently drive lattice dynamics carrying spectroscopic fingerprints of inversion symmetry breaking in Ruddlesden-Popper (PEA)$_2$(MA)$_{n-1}$PbnI${3n+1}$ perovskites, which are globally assigned to a centrosymmetric space group. We demonstrate coherent control by THz pulses over specific phonons, which we assign to either purely inorganic or highly anharmonic hybrid cage-ligand vibrations. By developing a general polarization analysis for THz-driven phonons, we pinpoint linear and nonlinear driving mechanisms. From this, we identify simultaneous IR- and Raman-activity of inorganic cage modes below 1.5 THz, indicating mode-selective inversion symmetry breaking. By exploring the driving pathways of these coherent phonons, we lay the groundwork for simultaneous ultrafast control of optoelectronic and spintronic properties in 2D HOIPs.</description>

      <title>Comparison of various UHMWPE formulations from contemporary total knee replacements before and after accelerated aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have collected 21 different formulations of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), which have been employed as liners in contemporary total knee replacements (TKR). The UHMWPE liners were bought from the most important manufacturers on the orthopedic market in the Czech Republic as of 2020. The collected liners represented a broad range of both traditional and modern UHMWPE formulations, which differed by the level of crosslinking, type of thermal treatment, sterilization and/or stabilization. All obtained UHMWPE's were characterized by multiple methods immediately after purchase and after the accelerated aging in H2O2. The experimental results (oxidative degradation, structure changes, and micromechanical properties) were correlated with manufacture's data (crosslinking, thermal treatment, sterilization, and stabilization). The investigated UHMWPE liners exhibited significant differences in their properties, namely in their resistance to long term oxidative degradation. The stiffness-related mechanical properties showed a strong correlation with the overall crystallinity. The crystallinity depended mostly on the oxidative degradation of the UHMWPE liners, while the thermal treatment played a minor role. The highest resistance to oxidation and wear, which promises the best in vivo performance, was found for the crosslinked UHMWPE formulations with biocompatible stabilizers (such as alpha-tocopherol, which is the key component of vitamin E).</description>

      <title>Tunable Thermal Conductivity and Mechanical Properties of Metastable Silicon by Phase Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extensive applications of cubic silicon in flexible transistors and infrared detectors are much hindered by its intrinsic properties. Metastable silicon phases, such as Si-III, IV and XII prepared using extreme pressure method, provide a unique "genetic bank" with diverse structures and exotic characteristics, however, exploration on their inherent physical properties remains immature. Herein, we demonstrate the phase engineering strategy to modulate the thermal conductivity and mechanical properties of metastable silicon. The thermal conductivity obtained via Raman optothermal approach presents the broad tunability across various Si-I, III, XII and IV phases. The hardness and Young's modulus of Si-IV are remarkably greater than those of Si-III/XII mixture, confirmed by nanoindentation technique. Moreover, it was found that the pressure-induced structural defects can substantially degrade the thermal and mechanical properties of silicon. This systematic investigation can offer feasible route to design novel semiconductors and further advance their desirable applications in advanced nanodevices and mechanical transducers.</description>

      <title>Dual Optical Hyperbolicity of PdCoO$_2$ and PdCrO$_2$ Delafossite Single Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperbolic materials exhibit a very peculiar optical anisotropy with simultaneously different signs of the dielectric tensor components. This anisotropy allows the propagation of exotic surface-wave excitations like hyperbolic phonons and plasmon polaritons. While hyperbolic materials hold promise for applications in subwavelength photonics and enhanced light-matter interactions, their natural occurrence is limited to few materials, often accompanied by significant dielectric losses and limited hyperbolic spectral bandwidth. Focusing on PdCoO$_2$ and PdCrO$_2$ delafossite transition-metal oxides, in this paper we demonstrate their unique dual hyperbolic regimes: one localized around a phonon absorption in the mid-infrared spectral region, and the other extending into the visible range. Both hyperbolic regimes show exceptional properties including low dissipation and high hyperbolic quality factors. These results pave the way for innovative applications of delafossite layered metals in subwavelength photonics, imaging, and sensing.</description>

      <title>Symmetrical bipolar electrobending deformation in acceptor-doped piezoceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since 2022, large apparent strains (&gt;1%) with highly asymmetrical strain-electric field (S-E) curves have been reported in various thin piezoceramic materials, attributed to a bidirectional electric-field-induced bending (electrobending) deformation, which consistently produces convex bending along the negative electric field direction. In this study, we report a novel unidirectional electrobending behavior in acceptor-doped K0.5Na0.5NbO3 ceramics, where convex bending always occurs along the pre-poling direction regardless of the direction of the applied electric field. This unique deformation is related to the reorientation of the defect dipoles in one surface layer during the pre-poling process, resulting in an asymmetrical distribution of defect dipoles in the two surface layers. The synergistic interaction between ferroelectric domains and defect dipoles in the surface layers induces this unidirectional electrobending, as evidenced by a butterfly-like symmetrical bipolar S-E curve with a giant apparent strain of 3.2%. These findings provide new insights into defect engineering strategies for developing advanced piezoelectric materials with large electroinduced displacements.</description>

      <title>Amorphous to Crystalline Transformation: How Cluster Aggregation Drives the Multistep Nucleation of ZIF-8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nucleation, the pivotal first step of crystallization, governs essential characteristics of crystallization products, including size distribution, morphology, and polymorphism. While understanding this process is paramount to the design of chemical, pharmaceutical and industrial production processes, major knowledge gaps remain, especially with respect to the crystallization of porous solids. Also for nanocrystalline ZIF-8, one of the most widely studied metal-organic frameworks, questions regarding the species involved in the nucleation pathway and their structural and chemical transformations remain unanswered. By combining harmonic light scattering, inherently sensitive to structural changes, with NMR spectroscopy, which reveals molecular exchanges between particles and solution, we were able to capture the crystallization mechanism of ZIF-8 in unprecedented detail. This dual approach provides concurrent structural and chemical insights, revealing key processes not previously observed in ZIF crystallization. Upon mixing small charged prenucleation clusters (PNCs) are formed, exhibiting an excess of ligands and net positive charge. We show that nucleation is initiated by aggregation of PNCs, through the release of ligands and associated protons to the liquid. This leads to the formation of charge neutral amorphous precursor particles (APPs) which incorporate neutral monomers from solution, and crystallize ZIF-8. Our work highlights chemical dynamics as a vital, yet often overlooked, dimension in the multi-stage structural evolution of MOFs. By establishing the critical role of PNCs in the nucleation of ZIF-8, new pathways open up for controlling crystallization of metal-organic frameworks through targeted chemical interactions with these species.</description>

      <title>Four regimes of primary radiation damage in tungsten</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe for the first time in silico the transition to a linear regime in the primary damage production in tungsten. As the critical plasma-facing material in fusion reactors, radiation damage in tungsten has been studied extensively in experiments and simulations. Irradiation experiments routinely produce recoils in the MeV range while full atomistic modelling has been limited to a few hundred keV. Here we bridge these scales with extremely large-scale and accurate machine-learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations with recoil energies up to 2 MeV in systems up to one billion atoms. We reveal four regimes of primary damage as a function of damage energy, with a transition to a high-energy regime that deviates from all previous models. Curiously, the start of the high-energy regime coincides with the highest possible recoil energy to tungsten atoms from fusion-emitted neutrons (300 keV).</description>

      <title>New investigation of the electronic and structural properties of (Mg,Ti)-doped and co-doped ZnO structures: A DFT and DFT+U study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the novelty of the crystalline and electronic structure of (Mg,Ti)-doped ZnO and the co-doped Zn1-x-yMgxTiyO structures using Gaussian and plane-wave basis sets, as implemented in the CP2K code. The goal of incorporating low concentration of Mg and Ti into ZnO is to influence its electronic properties without significantly altering its geometrical and crystalline structure. Within the framework of density functional theory (DFT), we analyze various doped and co-doped configurations. Our results show that Ti-doped ZnO exhibits an indirect band gap, while Mg doping preserves the direct semiconductor behavior of ZnO structure, with an increase in band gap energy. Additionally, the co-doped Zn1-x-yMgxTiyO system, at varying concentrations of Ti and Mg, displays minimal lattice deformation. These findings suggest that this material could be a promising candidate for transparent electronic devices, highlighting the importance of understanding the electronic structure of ZnO to optimize its physical properties.</description>

      <title>Micro/nanoscale spacers for enhanced thermophotovoltaic and thermionic energy conversion: a comprehensive review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermionics and thermophotovoltaics are solid-state technologies that convert high-temperature heat into electricity by utilizing fundamental particles, electrons in thermionics and photons in thermophotovoltaics, as energy carriers. Both systems have the potential to achieve high efficiency and power density, contingent on the optimization of radiative/electronic energy fluxes. A critical factor in enhancing energy flux in these devices is the introduction of microscale (thermionics) or nanoscale (thermophotovoltaics) gaps between the hot thermal emitter and the cooler receiver. In thermionic converters, microscale gaps mitigate space charge effects that create energy barriers to electron flow. For thermophotovoltaic systems, nanoscale gaps facilitate photon tunneling, significantly boosting photon flux towards the thermophotovoltaic cell. Forming these small-scale gaps often necessitates intermediate materials or spacers between the emitter and receiver. Over the past few decades, various spacer designs have been proposed and studied, demonstrating their effectiveness in enhancing energy transfer and conversion. However, challenges remain regarding their reliability and scalability. This article provides a comprehensive overview of spacer technologies for thermionics and thermophotovoltaics and summarizes recent advancements, current capabilities, and persistent challenges.</description>

      <title>Topotactic Growth of Zintl Phase Eu$_5$In$_2$As$_6$ Nanowires with Antiferromagnetic Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a topotactic transformation of zincblende InAs(Sb) nanowires into the Zintl phase Eu$_5$In$_2$As$_6$ through a vapor-solid mutual exchange process involving Eu and In in molecular beam epitaxy. This conversion preserves the polyhedral coordination lattice of the parent InAs(Sb) structure while inducing orthorhombic symmetry in the product phase, Eu$_5$In$_2$As$_6$, in which quasi-one-dimensional [InAs$_3$]$^6$$^-$ chains with tetrahedral sites align along the &lt;110&gt; direction of the zincblende structure. Local and global magnetic characterization identified two distinct antiferromagnetic phase transitions at approximately 7 K and 16 K in Eu$_5$In$_2$As$_6$ nanowires, potentially classified as altermagnetic phases. The versatility of the topotactic conversion of III-V semiconductor nanowires provides a platform for designing functional Zintl materials with tunable magnetic properties, making them promising candidates for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Polycrystalline Morphology and Anomalous Hall Effect in RF-Sputtered Co2MnGa Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Heusler compound Co2MnGa is a topological semimetal with intriguing electronic and magnetic properties, making it a promising candidate for spintronic applications. This study systematically investigates the effects of substrate temperature and RF sputtering power on the structure, morphology, and anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in Co2MnGa thin films. Using X-ray diffraction line analysis, we identify variations in film orientation and crystallinity, revealing the emergence of high-index textures at specific growth conditions. Atomic force microscopy imaging provide insight into grain morphology and size distributions demonstrating a correlation between deposition parameters and film texture. Hall transport measurements confirm a strong dependence of AHE on growth conditions, exhibiting a non-monotonic relationship with RF power and temperature. Despite significant variations in microstructure, a striking linear relationship between AHE and the zero-field slope of the Hall resistivity is observed, suggesting an underlying universal mechanism. These findings provide a foundation for investigating the complex interplay of CMG thin film conditions and transport for next-generation magnetic and electronic devices.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Computational Photovoltaic Study of Lead-free Inorganic NaSnCl$_3$-based Perovskite Solar Cell: Effect of Charge Transport Layers and Material Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead-free all-inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a promising alternative to toxic lead-based solar cells and organic solar cells, which have limited stability. This work explores such a PSC with sodium tin chloride (NaSnCl$_3$) as the absorber, due to its significant potential for optoelectronic applications. To investigate this potential, a comprehensive computational analysis of NaSnCl$_3$-based solar cells is performed using the one-dimensional solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS -1D). Simulations are performed for device structures with front contact/Indium Tin Oxide (ITO)/electron transport layer (ETL)/NaSnCl$_3$/hole transport layer (HTL)/back contact configuration, where TiO$_2$, SnS$_2$, IGZO, ZnSe, CdS, GaSe, ZnSnN$_2$, WS$_2$, PCBM, STO, and CSTO are utilized as ETLs and CNTS, GO, Mg-CuCrO$_2$, Spiro-OMeTAD, CdTe, GaAs, MoTe$_2$, BaSi$_2$, and P3HT are utilized as HTLs. Based on the obtained power conversion efficiency (PCE), six best ETL-HTL combinations with SnS$_2$, STO, WS$_2$, IGZO, ZnSe and CSTO as ETLs and MoTe$_2$ as HTL are chosen for further analysis. The effects of different material and device parameters, such as thickness and doping density; effective density of states; bulk and interface defects; series and shunt resistance; and operating conditions, such as temperature and light intensity are investigated. Using the optimized material parameters, SnS$_2$ ETL and MoTe$_2$ HTL-based solar cell show the best performance with open circuit voltage, Voc = 1.196V, short circuit current density, Jsc = 35.82 mA/cm$^2$, fill factor, FF = 89.72% and PCE = 38.42%. This detailed study provides valuable insights for the fabrication of high efficiency NaSnCl$_3$-based solar cells.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how generative machine learning can be used for the rapid computation of strongly dynamical electron diffraction directly from crystal structures, specifically in large-angle convergent-beam electron diffraction (LACBED) patterns. We find that a conditional generative adversarial network can learn the connection between the projected potential from a cubic crystal's unit cell and the corresponding LACBED pattern. Our model can generate diffraction patterns on a GPU many orders of magnitude faster than existing direct simulation methods. Furthermore, our approach can accurately retrieve the projected potential from diffraction patterns, opening a new approach for the inverse problem of determining crystal structure.</description>

      <title>An accurate and robust level-set formulation for multiple junction kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The front-capturing Level-Set (LS) method is widely employed in academia and industry to model grain boundary (GB) migration during the microstructure evolution of polycrystalline materials under thermo-mechanical treatments. During capillarity-driven grain growth, the conventional mean curvature flow equation, $\vec{v} = - \mu \gamma \kappa \vec{n}$, is used to compute the GB normal migration velocity. Over recent decades, extensive efforts have been made to incorporate polycrystalline heterogeneity into this framework. However, despite increased complexity and computational costs, these approaches have yet to achieve fully satisfactory performance. This paper introduces a simple yet robust LS formulation that accurately captures multiple junction kinetics, even with extreme GB energy ratios. Validation against existing analytical solutions highlights the method's accuracy and efficiency. This novel approach offers significant potential for advancing the study of highly heterogeneous interface systems.</description>

Abstract: Sliding-induced topological transitions in biphenylene bilayers are investigated, considering various stacking configurations which are analyzed from a symmetry perspective and described in detail,highlighting the intricate patterns of type-II Dirac cone crossings. Topological changes in the Fermi surface are assessed via the Euler characteristic, linking each transition to its corresponding symmetry, which can be experimentally tested by conductance measurements. Moreover, the ability to tune these topological properties by sliding the layers provides a simpler and more effective way to observe such phenomena.</description>

      <title>CrystalFramer: Rethinking the Role of Frames for SE(3)-Invariant Crystal Structure Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystal structure modeling with graph neural networks is essential for various applications in materials informatics, and capturing SE(3)-invariant geometric features is a fundamental requirement for these networks. A straightforward approach is to model with orientation-standardized structures through structure-aligned coordinate systems, or"frames." However, unlike molecules, determining frames for crystal structures is challenging due to their infinite and highly symmetric nature. In particular, existing methods rely on a statically fixed frame for each structure, determined solely by its structural information, regardless of the task under consideration. Here, we rethink the role of frames, questioning whether such simplistic alignment with the structure is sufficient, and propose the concept of dynamic frames. While accommodating the infinite and symmetric nature of crystals, these frames provide each atom with a dynamic view of its local environment, focusing on actively interacting atoms. We demonstrate this concept by utilizing the attention mechanism in a recent transformer-based crystal encoder, resulting in a new architecture called CrystalFramer. Extensive experiments show that CrystalFramer outperforms conventional frames and existing crystal encoders in various crystal property prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>Spin injection and detection in all-van der Waals 2D devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we report efficient out-of-plane spin injection and detection in an all-van der Waals based heterostructure using only exfoliated 2D materials. We demonstrate spin injection by measuring spin-valve and Hanle signals in non-local transport in a stack of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ (FGT), hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and graphene layers. FGT flakes form the spin aligning electrodes necessary to inject and detect spins in the graphene channel. The hBN tunnel barrier provides a high-quality interface between the ferromagnetic electrodes and graphene, eliminating the conductivity mismatch problem, thus ensuring efficient spin injection and detection with spin injection efficiencies of up to $P=40$\,\%. Our results demonstrate that FGT/hBN/graphene heterostructures form a promising platform for realizing 2D van der Waals spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Systematic Mapping of Altermagnetic Magnons by Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Circular Dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets, a unique class of magnetic materials that combines features of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, have garnered attention for their potential in spintronics and magnonics. While the electronic properties of altermagnets have been well studied, characterizing their magnon excitations is essential for fully understanding their behavior and enabling practical device applications. In this work, we introduce a measurement protocol combining resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) with circular polarization and azimuthal scanning to probe the chiral nature of the altermagnetic split magnon modes in CrSb. This approach circumvents the challenges posed by domain averaging in macroscopic samples, allowing for precise measurements of the polarization and energy of the magnons in individual antiferromagnetic domains. Our findings demonstrate a pronounced circular dichroism in the magnon peaks, with an azimuthal dependence that directly confirms the theoretical predictions. By establishing a reliable and accessible method for probing altermagnetic magnons, this work opens new avenues for fundamental studies of these collective excitations and for developing next-generation magnonic device applications.</description>

      <title>SAGE-Amine: Generative Amine Design with Multi-Property Optimization for Efficient CO2 Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient CO2 capture is vital for mitigating climate change, with amine-based solvents being widely used due to their strong reactivity with CO2. However, optimizing key properties such as basicity, viscosity, and absorption capacity remains challenging, as traditional methods rely on labor-intensive experimentation and predefined chemical databases, limiting the exploration of novel solutions. Here, SAGE-Amine was introduced, a generative modeling approach that integrates Scoring-Assisted Generative Exploration (SAGE) with quantitative structure-property relationship models to design new amines tailored for CO2 capture. Unlike conventional virtual screening restricted to existing compounds, SAGE-Amine generates novel amines by leveraging autoregressive natural language processing models trained on amine datasets. SAGE-Amine identified known amines for CO2 capture from scratch and successfully performed single-property optimization, increasing basicity or reducing viscosity or vapor pressure. Furthermore, it facilitated multi-property optimization, simultaneously achieving high basicity with low viscosity and vapor pressure. The 10 top-ranked amines were suggested using SAGE-Amine and their thermodynamic properties were further assessed using COSMO-RS simulations, confirming their potential for CO2 capture. These results highlight the potential of generative modeling in accelerating the discovery of amine solvents and expanding the possibilities for industrial CO2 capture applications.</description>

      <title>Controlling the microscopic quantum pathways for ultrafast charge transfer in van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient charge separation in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures is crucial for optimizing light-harvesting and detection applications. However, precise control over the microscopic pathways governing ultrafast charge transfer remains an open challenge. These pathways are intrinsically linked to charge transfer states with strongly delocalized wave functions that appear at various momenta in the Brillouin zone. Here, we use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) to investigate the possibility of steering carriers through specific charge transfer states in a prototypical WS2-graphene heterostructure. By selectively exciting electron-hole pairs at the K-point and close to the Q-point of WS2 with different pump photon energies, we find that charge separation is faster at higher excitation energies. We attribute this to distinct tunneling mechanisms dictated by the momentum where the initial excitation takes place. Our findings introduce a novel strategy for controlling charge transfer dynamics in vdW heterostructures, paving the way for more efficient optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Smart Reaction Templating: A Graph-Based Method for Automated Molecular Dynamics Input Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately modeling chemical reactions in molecular dynamics simulations requires detailed pre- and post-reaction templates, often created through labor-intensive manual workflows. This work introduces a Python-based algorithm that automates the generation of reaction templates for the LAMMPS REACTION package, leveraging graph-theoretical principles and sub-graph isomorphism techniques. By representing molecular systems as mathematical graphs, the method enables automated identification of conserved molecular domains, reaction sites, and atom mappings, significantly reducing manual effort. The algorithm was validated on three case studies: poly-addition, poly-condensation, and chain polymerization, demonstrating its ability to map conserved regions, identify reaction-initiating atoms, and resolve challenges such as symmetric reactants and indistinguishable atoms. Additionally, the generated templates were optimized for computational efficiency by retaining only essential reactive domains, ensuring scalability and consistency in high-throughput workflows for computational chemistry, materials science, and machine learning applications. Future work will focus on extending the method to mixed organic-inorganic systems, incorporating adaptive scoring mechanisms, and integrating quantum mechanical calculations to enhance its applicability.</description>

      <title>Flat band driven itinerant magnetism in the Co-pnictides (La,Ca)Co$_2$(As,P)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat bands can induce strong electron correlation effects that help stabilize both magnetic and superconducting states. Here, we carry out angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to study the electronic structure of the Co-pnictides CaCo$_2$As$_2$ and LaCo$_2$P$_2$. We find that, while the $k_z$ Fermi topology of ferromagnetic LaCo$_2$P$_2$ is markedly 2-dimensional, antiferromagnetic CaCo$_2$As$_2$ develops a 3D Fermi surface described by a $zig-zag$-like band dispersion perpendicular to the Co-As plane. Furthermore, the magnetism is driven by the electronic correlations of the flat bands with $d_{xy}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbital character at the Fermi level. Our results link the electronic dimensionality and the magnetic order, and emphasize the critical role of the As-As and P-P bond strength along the $c$-direction to understand the electronic band structure and the rich phase diagram of transition metal pnictides.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of divacancies in 3C-, 4H- and 6H-SiC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The divacancy comprising two neighboring vacant sites in the SiC lattice is a promising defect for applications in quantum technology. So far, most work is concerned with the divacancy in 4H-SiC, whereas the divacancies in 6H- and 3C-SiC have received much less attention. Here, we outline arguments showing that the neutral charge state of the divacancies in the latter two polytypes is intrinsically stable, in contrast to that in 4H-SiC where the photoluminescence quenches in most materials for certain excitation energies (below approximately 1.3 eV). Divacancies in 6H- and 3C-SiC are anticipated to remain stable even with resonant excitation. We provide new ab initio calculation results for the charge transfer levels of divacancies in 6H- and 3C-SiC. Using the temperature dependence of the divacancy emission in 3C-SiC, we estimate the energy position of the (+|0) charge transfer level of the divacancy within the bandgap of this polytype and compare with theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Universal analytical modeling of coated plasmonic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From a structural point of view, plasmonic nanoparticles are always at least two-layer structures with a dielectric layer of stabilizing, targeting, fluorescent, Raman, or other functional molecules, often embedded in a matrix such as porous silica. To optimize the optical properties of such bioconjugates, one needs efficient analytical models based on simple physical ideas and with reasonable accuracy comparable to rigorous numerical methods requiring significant computer resources. Here, we present such type models based on a combination of the modal expansion method (MEM) and the dipole equivalence method (DEM). The MEM+DEM approach makes it possible to use the MEM parameters of the original metal particles and does not require additional numerical calculations to build models for bilayered or multilayered conjugates. Our analytical solutions depend on the particle shape, the shell thickness, and the shell refractive index, regardless of the particle size and the metal's nature. To illustrate the universality of our method, we calculate extinction and scattering spectra of gold and silver nanorods, nanodiscs, triangle nanoprisms, bicones, and bipyramids with a dielectric coating thickness from 0 to 30 nm. For the main plasmonic peaks, we found excellent agreement between our analytical method and numerical simulations performed with COMSOL. Due to the simplicity and reasonable accuracy of the MEM+DEM analytical models, they can help apply machine learning to predict various plasmonic responses such as light absorption, scattering, SERS, and metal-enhanced fluorescence.</description>

      <title>Viscosity of polymer melts using non-affine theory based on vibrational modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Viscosity, a fundamental transport and rheological property of liquids, quantifies the resistance to relative motion between molecular layers and plays a critical role in understanding material behavior. Conventional methods, such as the Green-Kubo (GK) approach, rely on time integration of correlation functions, which becomes computationally intensive near the glass transition due to slow correlation decay. A recently proposed method based on non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD) and instantaneous normal mode analysis offers a promising alternative for estimating the viscosity. In this study, we apply the NALD approach to compute the viscosity of the Kremer-Grest polymer system over a range of temperatures and compare these results with those from the GK method and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that all vibration modes, including the instantaneous normal modes, contribute to the viscosity. This work presents an efficient framework for calculating viscosity across diverse systems, including near the glass transition where the GK method is no longer applicable. Also, it opens the avenue to understanding the role of different vibrational modes linked with structure, facilitating the design of materials with tunable rheological properties.</description>

Abstract: Here, we present a theoretical study in the context of photovoltaic (PV) and thermoelectric (TE) applications of ScAgC. The electronic, optical, and thermoelectric properties have been investigated systematically using density functional theory (DFT) and semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. DFT calculates a direct band gap of 0.47 eV, whereas the $G_{0}W_{0}$ method estimates a band gap of 1.01 eV. We used parabola fitting to estimate the effective mass values for bands B1 to B4 at $\Gamma$-point, which are -0.087 (-0.075), -0.17 (-0.27), -0.17 (-0.27), and 0.049 (0.058) along the $\Gamma$-$X$ ($\Gamma$-$L$) direction, respectively. Furthermore, the optoelectronic properties are calculated and analyzed over an energy range of 0 to 10 eV. The optical conductivity, refractive index, and dielectric function show strong optical transitions in the visible region. The lowest calculated reflectivity is 0.24 at 4.7 eV, and the highest calculated value of the absorption coefficient is $1.7\times10^{6}$ cm$^{-1}$ at $8.5$ eV. At 300 K, we expect a maximum solar efficiency (SLME) of 33\% at a thickness of $1~\mu$m. The lattice part of the thermal conductivity shows a maximum value of 3.8 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at $1200$ K. At 1200 K, for electron doping of $3.9\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-3}$, the maximum value of $S^{2}\sigma /\tau$ is $145 \times 10^{14}$ $\mu$WK$^{-2}$cm$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, while for hole doping of $1.5\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-3}$, it is $123 \times 10^{14}$ $\mu$WK$^{-2}$cm$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$. The highest $ZT$ at $1200$ K is expected to be $0.53$, whereas the optimal efficiency is predicted to be $8.5\%$ for cold and hot temperatures of $300$ K and $1200$ K, respectively. The collected results suggest that the ScAgC compound is a potential candidate for renewable energy sources such as solar cell and TE applications</description>

      <title>Temperature dependence of the Raman spectrum of orthorhombic Bi2Se3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bismuth selenide, a benchmark topological insulator, grows in a trigonal structure at ambient conditions and exhibits a number of enticing properties related to the formation of Dirac surface states. Besides this polytype, a metastable orthorhombic modification with Pnma space group has been produced by electrodeposition and high-pressure high-temperature synthesis displaying upon Sb doping significant thermoelectric properties in the midtemperature range. However, very little experimental information is available on the fundamental properties of this polytype, such as, e.g., the electronic band gap and the lattice dynamics. We report here the temperature dependence of the Raman spectra of orthorhombic Bi2Se3 between 10 K and 300 K, which displays an anharmonic behavior of the optical phonons that can be modelled with a two-phonon decay channel. In order to analyze the data we performed ab initio calculations of the electronic bandstructure, the phonon frequencies at the center of the Brillouin zone, and the phonon dispersion relations along the main symmetry directions, examining the effect of spin-orbit coupling in both phonon and electronic energies. Lastly, we report here cathodoluminescence experiments at 83 K that set a lower limit to the electronic bandgap at 0.835 eV, pointing to an indirect nature, in agreement with our calculations. These results shed light to essential properties of orthorhombic Bi2Se3 for further understanding of the potential of this semiconductor for thermoelectrics and new applications.</description>

Abstract: This study introduces BIRDSHOT, an integrated Bayesian materials discovery framework designed to efficiently explore complex compositional spaces while optimizing multiple material properties. We applied this framework to the CoCrFeNiVAl FCC high entropy alloy (HEA) system, targeting three key performance objectives: ultimate tensile strength/yield strength ratio, hardness, and strain rate sensitivity. The experimental campaign employed an integrated cyber-physical approach that combined vacuum arc melting (VAM) for alloy synthesis with advanced mechanical testing, including tensile and high-strain-rate nanoindentation testing. By incorporating batch Bayesian optimization schemes that allowed the parallel exploration of the alloy space, we completed five iterative design-make-test-learn loops, identifying a non-trivial three-objective Pareto set in a high-dimensional alloy space. Notably, this was achieved by exploring only 0.15% of the feasible design space, representing a significant acceleration in discovery rate relative to traditional methods. This work demonstrates the capability of BIRDSHOT to navigate complex, multi-objective optimization challenges and highlights its potential for broader application in accelerating materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of phase change accommodating hydrogen uptake in bimetallic nanoparticles</title>

Abstract: Hydrogen holds great promise as a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels, but its efficient and affordable storage remains a significant challenge. Bimetallic systems, such as Pd-Ni, present a promising option for storing hydrogen. In this study, using the combination of different cuttingedge X-ray and electron techniques, we observed the transformations of Pd-Ni nanoparticles, which initially consist of a NiO-rich shell surrounding a Pd-rich core but undergo a major transformation when interacting with hydrogen. During the hydrogen exposure, the Pd core breaks into smaller pockets, dramatically increasing its surface area and enhancing the hydrogen storage capacity, especially in nanoparticles with lower Pd content. The findings provide deep understanding of the morphological changes at the atomic level during hydrogen storage and contribute for designing cost-effective hydrogen storage using multi-metallic systems.</description>

      <title>Designing single and degenerate flat bands in the kagome lattice with long-range hopping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic structure of the kagome lattice model with first, second, and two kinds of third nearest-neighbor hoppings. We reveal that by tuning the third nearest-neighbor hoppings, not only single flat band but also degenerate flat band can be created on the \Gamma - M line. We provide the detailed conditions to realize them. The coexistence of these bands can be almost realized near the fundamental band gap in graphene with triangular defects in a superhoneycomb arrangement. Furthermore, due to these flat bands, several sharp peaks appear in the optical conductivity. Our results strongly indicate that long-range electron hopping has a new possibility for designing electronic structures.</description>

Abstract: This article reports the synthesis of a single crystalline gray Arsenic (As) via the Bismuth flux method. The X-ray Diffraction (XRD) pattern revealed the single phase of the grown crystal, which crystallized in the rhombohedral structure with the space group R3m. The sharp XRD peaks observed on mechanically exfoliated thin flakes of the same ensured high crystallinity of the same with growth direction along the c-axis. The resistivity measurements illustrated its metallic nature throughout, right from 300K down to 2K. The measured residual resistivity ratio of the sample is 180, which endorses the high metallic nature of the as-synthesized As single crystal. The transverse magnetic field-dependent resistivity (RH) measurements elucidated huge magneto-resistance (MR) at 2K and 14Tesla transverse magnetic fields. Also seen are the SDH oscillations, indicating the presence of topological surface states. The non-trivial band topology and edge states in As are confirmed by first principle calculations.</description>

      <title>Spin-split flat bands at the band edge and two-dimensional hole gases towards quantum Hall effect in altermagnetic CoF$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16188v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetic phase is recently found as a new magnetic phase in addition to the conventional collinear spin orders, and great efforts have been made to explore novel effects and potential applications in such materials. Here, we show that there are robust altermagnetic spin-split flat bands near the valence band edge in rutile CoF$_2$ through first-principles investigation. It is uncovered that the magnetic moments can remain in the z axis because of the magnetocrystalline energy due to the spin-orbits coupling and the spin orientation can be made more stable by magnetic field applied in the xy plane. We describe the spin-dependent band structure (including the flat bands) near the Fermi level by a spin-resolved effective low-energy model, and reveal that they can host spin-dependent two-dimensional hole gases. Importantly, we find spin-dependent quantum Hall effects in the two-dimensional hole gases by applying the magnetic field in the xy plane, and then explore the dependence of Hall conductivity and Hall resistance on the Fermi level and the magnetic field (both magnitude and direction) and related longitudinal carrier transport properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02812v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thin-films of bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ grown by molecular beam epitaxy on MgO(001) were measured to have an enhanced atomic magnetic moment of $2.52 \pm 0.07$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ beyond the pinnacle of the Slater-Pauling curve for Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$ with a moment of $2.42$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$. The compositional variation of the average total moment for thin-film bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ alloys is in stark contrast to the historical measurements of bulk fcc Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$. These GGA calculations reveal that significant improvements of this ferromagnetic forced bct phase on MgO(001) are possible via substrate selection. For example, bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ films on MgO(001) are calculated to have lower atomic moments than those on substrates with smaller lattice constants such as GaAs(001), BaTiO$_3$(110), and SrTiO$_3$(110) which is predicted to increase the average atomic moment up to $2.61$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ and lead to increased structural stability and therefore thicker film growths.</description>

      <title>Agnostic calculation of atomic free energies with the descriptor density of states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new method to evaluate vibrational free energies of atomic systems without a priori specification of an interatomic potential. Our model-agnostic approach leverages descriptors, high-dimensional feature vectors of atomic structure. The entropy of a high-dimensional density, the descriptor density of states, is accurately estimated with conditional score matching. Casting interatomic potentials into a form extensive in descriptor features, we show free energies emerge as the Legendre-Fenchel conjugate of the descriptor entropy, avoiding all high-dimensional integration. The score matching campaign requires less resources than fixed-model sampling and is highly parallel, reducing wall time to a few minutes, with tensor compression schemes allowing lightweight storage. Our model-agnostic estimator returns differentiable free energy predictions over a broad range of potential parameters in microseconds of CPU effort, allowing rapid forward and back propagation of potential variations through finite temperature simulations, long desired for uncertainty quantification and inverse design. We test predictions against thermodynamic integration calculations over a broad range of models for BCC, FCC and A15 phases of W, Mo and Fe at high homologous temperatures. Predictions pass the stringent accuracy threshold of 1-2 meV/atom (1/40-1/20 kcal/mol) for phase prediction with propagated score uncertainties robustly bounding errors. We also demonstrate targeted fine-tuning, reducing the alpha-gamma transition temperature in a non-magnetic machine learning model of Fe from 2030 K to 1063 K through back-propagation, with no additional sampling. Applications to liquids and fine-tuning foundational models are discussed along with the many problems in computational science which estimate high-dimensional integrals.</description>

      <title>Doping-Driven Modulation of Spin-Orbit Coupling, Spin Textures, and Rashba-Edelstein Response in Chiral Tellurium: A First-Principles Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral semiconductors such as elemental tellurium (Te) exhibit unconventional spin textures and large charge-to-spin conversion efficiencies, yet the influence of doping on these properties remains underexplored. Here, we address this gap by investigating how substituting Te with lighter (S, Se) or heavier (Sb) elements systematically modifies the spin-orbit-driven phenomena in chiral Te, including the band structure, spin Berry curvature, and Rashba-Edelstein response. The objective is to determine whether doping strategies can be leveraged to optimize collinear spin textures, enhance spin accumulation, and possibly extend spin lifetimes-all crucial aspects for magnet-free spintronics. Using density functional theory calculations implemented in Quantum ESPRESSO, combined with tight-binding interpolation in PAOFLOW, we map out the doping-dependent electronic states and quantify their associated spin transport coefficients. Our findings reveal that lighter dopants shift the Fermi level to regions of pronounced spin splitting, thereby increasing the magnitude of spin current conversion, whereas heavier dopants can introduce or remove near-degenerate bands that strongly affect spin-orbit coupling. In both scenarios, the fundamental chirality of Te remains robust, preserving the radial or "collinear" spin-momentum locking. These results not only confirm that doping is a potent and feasible route for tuning spin-orbit phenomena but also offer practical guidelines for experimental efforts aiming to engineer chiral semiconductors for spin devices. By correlating dopant identity with specific spin-texture enhancements, this study paves the way for rationally designing next-generation spintronic components free from external magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Canted antiferromagnetism in a spin-orbit coupled $S_{\text{eff}} = 3/2$ triangular-lattice magnet DyAuGe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploration of nontrivial magnetic states induced by strong spin-orbit interaction is a central topic of frustrated magnetism. Extensive studies are concentrated on rare-earth-based magnets and 4d/5d transition metal compounds, which are mostly described by an effective spin $S_{\text{eff}} = 1/2$ for the Kramers doublet of the lowest crystal-electric-field levels. Variety of magnetic orderings may be greatly enhanced when magnetic dipolar moments intertwined with multipolar degrees of freedom which are described by higher-rank tensors and often require the magnetic ions with $S_{\text{eff}} &gt; 1/2$. Here, our synchrotron x-ray diffraction near the Dy $L_3$ edge has unveiled a canted antiferromagnetic ground state arising from a quasi-quartet ($S_{\text{eff}} = 3/2$) of 4f electrons in a triangular-lattice (TL) rare-earth intermetallics DyAuGe. Magnetic moment and electric-quadrupole moment are closely interlocked and noncollinear magnetic-dipole alignment is induced by antiferroic electric-quadrupole (AFQ) ordering in the TL layers. The correlation between the AFQ and canted magnetic structures is further confirmed by phase transitions in an in-plane magnetic field. These findings offer insights into the emergence of nontrivial magnetic states in frustrated TL systems described beyond the $S_{\text{eff}} = 1/2$.</description>

Abstract: Transforming CO$_2$ into methanol represents a crucial step towards closing the carbon cycle, with thermoreduction technology nearing industrial application. However, obtaining high methanol yields and ensuring the stability of heterocatalysts remain significant challenges. Herein, we present a sophisticated computational framework to accelerate the discovery of novel thermal heterogeneous catalysts, using machine-learned force fields. We propose a new catalytic descriptor, termed adsorption energy distribution, that aggregates the binding energies for different catalyst facets, binding sites, and adsorbates. The descriptor is versatile and can easily be adjusted to a specific reaction through careful choice of the key-step reactants and reaction intermediates. By applying unsupervised machine learning and statistical analysis to a dataset comprising nearly 160 metallic alloys, we offer a powerful tool for catalyst discovery. Finally, we propose new promising candidate materials such as ZnRh and ZnPt$_3$, which to our knowledge, have not yet been tested, and discuss their possible advantage in terms of stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bands with non-trivial topological indices have a topological obstruction preventing them from being represented by exponentially localized Wannier states. Here, we propose a procedure to construct exponentially localized Wannier functions that span a subspace of topologically obstructed bands through the use of the projection method. These Wannier functions form what we refer to as a "reduced Wannier representation," indicating that the Wannier functions necessarily do not span the full topological manifold. By constructing supercells, we obtain reduced Wannier functions that break the primitive translational symmetry while capturing a substantial portion of the topologically obstructed manifold. This approach effectively decomposes the topological manifold into two subspaces: an itinerant subspace inheriting the topology and a localized trivial subspace represented by reduced Wannier functions. We consider the Haldane and Kane-Mele tight-binding models as the platforms for our investigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a macroscopic theory of optical phonons, Fr{\"o}hlich polarons, and exciton-polarons in two-dimensional (2D) polar crystalline monolayers. Our theory extends the classical macroscopic formulation of the electron-phonon problem in three-dimensional (3D) polar crystals to the new generation of 2D materials. Similarly to the 3D case, in our approach, the effective electron-phonon Hamiltonian is parametrized solely in terms of macroscopic experimentally accessible quantities -- 2D polarizabilities of the monolayer at low and high frequencies. We derive the dispersion of long wave length longitudinal optical (LO) phonons, which can be viewed as a 2D form of the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation, and study the formation of 2D Fr{\"o}hlich polarons by adopting the intermediate coupling approximation. Finally, we apply this approach to excitons in polar 2D crystals and derive an effective potential of the electron-hole interaction dressed by LO phonons. Due to a specific dispersion of LO phonons, polarons and exciton-polarons in 2D materials exhibit unique features not found in their 3D counterparts. As an illustration, the polaron and exciton-polaron binding energies are computed for a representative set of 2D polar crystals, demonstrating the interplay between dimensionality, polarizability of materials, and electron-phonon coupling.</description>

      <title>Accurate and efficient machine learning interatomic potentials for finite temperature modeling of molecular crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As with many parts of the natural sciences, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are revolutionizing the modeling of molecular crystals. However, challenges remain for the accurate and efficient calculation of sublimation enthalpies - a key thermodynamic quantity measuring the stability of a molecular crystal. Specifically, two key stumbling blocks are: (i) the need for thousands of ab initio quality reference structures to generate training data; and (ii) the sometimes unreliable nature of density functional theory, the main technique for generating such data. Exploiting recent developments in foundational models for chemistry and materials science alongside accurate quantum diffusion Monte Carlo benchmarks, offers a promising path forward. Herein, we demonstrate the generation of MLIPs capable of describing molecular crystals at finite temperature and pressure with sub-chemical accuracy, using as few as $\sim 200$ data structures; an order of magnitude improvement over the current state-of-the-art. We apply this framework to compute the sublimation enthalpies of the X23 dataset, accounting for anharmonicity and nuclear quantum effects, achieving sub-chemical accuracy with respect to experiment. Importantly, we show that our framework can be generalized to crystals of pharmaceutical relevance, including paracetamol and aspirin. Nuclear quantum effects are also accurately captured as shown for the case of squaric acid. By enabling accurate modeling at ambient conditions, this work paves the way for deeper insights into pharmaceutical and biological systems.</description>

Abstract: This comment critically examines the claims made in arXiv papers arXiv:2501.17230 and arXiv:2502.00103, which argue that a multiplicity of polar optical phonons can generate a long-range attractive interaction via a generalized Frohlich coupling. I identify a fundamental flaw in their derivation, showing that their result relies on an unphysical assumption--specifically, neglecting the intermode Coulomb interactions between different polar optical phonons. By restoring these missing interactions I show the screened Coulomb interaction is always repulsive in the static limit.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic orders of non-Heisenberg Tsai-type 1/1 approximant crystals (ACs) in the Au-Ga-Dy system were studied through bulk magnetization, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering techniques. The results uncovered noncoplanar, ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin configurations whirling along [111] crystallographic axis, which is analogous to those observed in the Tb- and Ho-contained counterparts. The crystal electric field excitations similar to those in the Tb-based counterpart are also observed indicating the strong Ising-like magnetic anisotropy. These comprehensive experiments and analyses have revealed the existence of a universal mechanism that stabilizes noncoplanar FM and AFM structures in non-Heisenberg Tsai-type ACs, independent of the rare-earth species (Tb, Dy, Ho); FM intra-cluster interactions and strong Ising-like anisotropy.</description>
