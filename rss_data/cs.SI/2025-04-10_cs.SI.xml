      <title>The Schwurbelarchiv: a German Language Telegram dataset for the Study of Conspiracy Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sociality borne by language, as is the predominant digital trace on text-based social media platforms, harbours the raw material for exploring multiple social phenomena. Distinctively, the messaging service Telegram provides functionalities that allow for socially interactive as well as one-to-many communication. Our Telegram dataset contains over 6,000 groups and channels, 40 million text messages, and over 3 million transcribed audio files, originating from a data-hoarding initiative named the ``Schwurbelarchiv'' (from German schwurbeln: speaking nonsense). This dataset publication details the structure, scope, and methodological specifics of the Schwurbelarchiv, emphasising its relevance for further research on the German-language conspiracy theory discourse. We validate its predominantly German origin by linguistic and temporal markers and situate it within the context of similar datasets. We describe process and extent of the transcription of multimedia files. Thanks to this effort the dataset uniquely supports multimodal analysis of online social dynamics and content dissemination. Researchers can employ this resource to explore societal dynamics in misinformation, political extremism, opinion adaptation, and social network structures on Telegram. The Schwurbelarchiv thus offers unprecedented opportunities for investigations into digital communication and its societal implications.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Dilemmas in Rational Debate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an epistemic activity, rational debate and discussion requires cooperation, yet involves a tension between collective and individual interests. While all participants benefit from collective outcomes like reaching consensus on true beliefs, individuals face personal costs when changing their minds. This creates an incentive for each debater to let others bear the cognitive burden of exploring alternative perspectives. We present a model to examine the strategic dynamics between debaters motivated by two competing goals: discovering truth and minimizing belief revisions. Our model demonstrates that this tension creates social dilemmas where strategies that are optimal for individuals systematically undermine the collective pursuit of truth. Paradoxically, our analysis reveals that increasing debaters' motivation to seek truth can sometimes produce equilibria with worse outcomes for collective truth discovery. These findings illuminate why rational debate can fail to achieve optimal epistemic outcomes, even when participants genuinely value truth.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Consensus: Modeling Multi-Agent Networks with Long-Range Interactions through path-Laplacian Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended connectivity in graphs can be analyzed through k-path Laplacian matrices, which permit the capture of long-range interactions in various real-world networked systems such as social, transportation, and multi-agent networks. In this work, we present several alternative methods based on machine learning methods (LSTM, xLSTM, Transformer, XGBoost, and ConvLSTM) to predict the final consensus value based on directed networks (Erd\"os-Renyi, Watts-Strogatz, and Barab\'asi-Albert) and on the initial state. We highlight how different k-hop interactions affect the performance of the tested methods. This framework opens new avenues for analyzing multi-scale diffusion processes in large-scale, complex networks.</description>

      <title>Market, power, gift, and concession economies: Comparison using four-mode primitive network models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducing wealth inequality is a global challenge, and the problems of capitalism stem from the enclosure of the commons and the breakdown of the community. According to previous studies by Polanyi, Karatani, and Graeber, economic modes can be divided into capitalist market economy (enclosure and exchange), power economy (de-enclosure and redistribution), gift economy (obligation to return and reciprocity), and concession economy (de-obligation to return). The concession economy reflects Graeber's baseline communism (from each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs) and Deguchi's We-turn philosophy (the "I" as an individual has a "fundamental incapability" and the subject of physical action, responsibility, and freedom is "We" as a multi-agent system, including the "I"). In this study, we constructed novel network models for these four modes and compared their properties (cluster coefficient, graph density, reciprocity, assortativity, centrality, and Gini coefficient). From the calculation results, it became clear that the market economy leads to inequality; the power economy mitigates inequality but cannot eliminate it; the gift and concession economies lead to a healthy and equal economy; and the concession economy, free from the ties of obligation to return, is possible without guaranteeing reciprocity. We intend to promote the transformation from a capitalist economy to a concession economy through activities that disseminate baseline communism and the We-turn philosophy that promotes concession, that is, developing a cooperative platform to support concession through information technology and empirical research through fieldwork.</description>

      <title>Green building blocks reveal the complex anatomy of climate change mitigation technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate-change mitigating innovation is considered essential for the world's transition toward a sustainable global economy. To guide this transition, integrated assessment models map sectoral emissions reduction targets into long-term trajectories towards carbon neutrality at the macro-level, while detailed engineering studies at the micro-level develop concrete carbon-mitigation technologies tailored to individual industries. However, we lack a meso-level understanding of how solutions connect across technological domains. Building on the notion that innovating often entails combining existing technologies in new ways, we identify Green Building Blocks (GBBs): modules of technologies that can be added to nongreen technologies to mitigate their climate-change impact. Using natural language processing and dimensionality reduction techniques, we show how GBBs can be extracted from large-scale patent data. Next, we describe the anatomy of the green transition as a network that connects nongreen technologies to GBBs. This network has a nontrivial structure: whereas some nongreen technologies can connect to various GBBs, opening up a variety of ways to mitigate their impact on the global climate, other nongreen technologies only connect to a single GBB. Similarly, some GBBs are general purpose technologies that can reduce green house gases in a vast range of applications, whereas others are tailored to specific use cases. Furthermore, GBBs prove predictive of the green technologies that firms develop, allowing us to map the green capabilities of firms not in terms of the specific green technological solutions they invent, but in terms of their capacity to develop broader classes of solutions with the GBBs they possess.</description>

      <title>Optimal promotions of new products on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel methodology for analyzing the optimal promotion in the Bass model for the spreading of new products on networks. For general networks with $M$ nodes, the optimal promotion is the solution of $2^M-1$ nonlinearly-coupled boundary-value problems. On structured networks, however, the number of equations can be reduced to a manageable size which is amendable to simulations and analysis. This enables us to gain insight into the effect of the network structure on optimal promotions. We find that the optimal advertising strategy decreases with time, whereas the optimal boosting of peer effects increases from zero and then decreases. In low-degree networks, it is optimal to prioritize advertising over boosting peer effects, but this relation is flipped in high-degree networks. When the planning horizon is finite, the optimal promotion continues until the last minute, as opposed to an infinite planning horizon where the optimal promotion decays to zero. Finally, promotions with short planning horizons can yield an order of magnitude higher increase of profits, compared to those with long planning horizons.</description>

      <title>Topic-aware Most Influential Community Search in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Influential community search (ICS) finds a set of densely connected and high-impact vertices from a social network. Although great effort has been devoted to ICS problems, most existing methods do not consider how relevant the influential community found is to specific topics. A few attempts at topic-aware ICS problems cannot capture the stochastic nature of community formation and influence propagation in social networks. To address these issues, we introduce a novel problem of topic-aware most influential community search (TAMICS) to discover a set of vertices such that for a given topic vector q, they induce a $(k, l, \eta)$-core in an uncertain directed interaction graph and have the highest influence scores under the independent cascade (IC) model. We propose an online algorithm to provide an approximate result for any TAMICS query with bounded errors. Furthermore, we design two index structures and an index-based heuristic algorithm for efficient TAMICS query processing. Finally, we experimentally evaluate the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed approaches on various real-world datasets. The results show that (1) the communities of TAMICS have higher relevance and social influence w.r.t.~the query topics as well as structural cohesiveness than those of several state-of-the-art topic-aware and influential CS methods and (2) the index-based algorithm achieves speed-ups of up to three orders of magnitude over the online algorithm with an affordable overhead for index construction.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Effect of Opinion Polarization in Short Video Browsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the impact of Opinion Polarization (OP) in the increasingly prevalent context of short video browsing, a dominant medium in the contemporary digital landscape with significant influence on public opinion and social dynamics. We investigate the effects of OP on user perceptions and behaviors in short video consumption, and find that traditional user feedback signals, such as like and browsing duration, are not suitable for detecting and measuring OP. Recognizing this problem, our study employs Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals as a novel, noninvasive approach to assess the neural processing of perception and cognition related to OP. Our user study reveals that OP notably affects users' sentiments, resulting in measurable changes in brain signals. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of using EEG signals to predict users' exposure to polarized short video content. By exploring the relationships between OP, brain signals, and user behavior, our research offers a novel perspective in understanding the dynamics of short video browsing and proposes an innovative method for quantifying the impact of OP in this context.</description>

      <title>A spatial hypergraph model to smoothly interpolate between pairwise graphs and hypergraphs to study higher-order structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a spatial graph and hypergraph model that smoothly interpolates between a graph with purely pairwise edges and a graph where all connections are in large hyperedges. The key component is a spatial clustering resolution parameter that varies between assigning all the vertices in a spatial region to individual clusters, resulting in the pairwise case, to assigning all the vertices in a spatial region to a single cluster, which results in the large hyperedge case. An important outcome of this model is that the spatial structure is invariant to the choice of hyperedges. Consequently, this model enables us to study clustering coefficients, graph diffusion, and epidemic spread and how their behavior changes as a function of the higher-order structure in the network with a fixed spatial substrate. We hope that our model will find future uses to distill or explain other behaviors in higher-order networks.</description>

      <title>Cohesive Subgraph Discovery in Hypergraphs: A Locality-Driven Indexing Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypergraphs, increasingly utilised for modelling complex and diverse relationships in modern networks, gain much attention representing intricate higher-order interactions. Among various challenges, cohesive subgraph discovery is one of the fundamental problems and offers deep insights into these structures, yet the task of selecting appropriate parameters is an open question. To handle that question, we aim to design an efficient indexing structure to retrieve cohesive subgraphs in an online manner. The main idea is to enable the discovery of corresponding structures within a reasonable time without the need for exhaustive graph traversals. This work can facilitate efficient and informed decision-making in diverse applications based on a comprehensive understanding of the entire network landscape. Through extensive experiments on real-world networks, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed indexing technique.</description>

      <title>SIGMA: An Efficient Heterophilous Graph Neural Network with Fast Global Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09958v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) realize great success in graph learning but suffer from performance loss when meeting heterophily, i.e. neighboring nodes are dissimilar, due to their local and uniform aggregation. Existing attempts of heterophilous GNNs incorporate long-range or global aggregations to distinguish nodes in the graph. However, these aggregations usually require iteratively maintaining and updating full-graph information, which limits their efficiency when applying to large-scale graphs. In this paper, we propose SIGMA, an efficient global heterophilous GNN aggregation integrating the structural similarity measurement SimRank. Our theoretical analysis illustrates that SIGMA inherently captures distant global similarity even under heterophily, that conventional approaches can only achieve after iterative aggregations. Furthermore, it enjoys efficient one-time computation with a complexity only linear to the node set size $\mathcal{O}(n)$. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that SIGMA achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior aggregation and overall efficiency. Notably, it obtains $5\times$ acceleration on the large-scale heterophily dataset pokec with over 30 million edges compared to the best baseline aggregation.</description>

      <title>ClarityEthic: Explainable Moral Judgment Utilizing Contrastive Ethical Insights from Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rise and widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring their safety is crucial to prevent harm to humans and promote ethical behaviors. However, directly assessing value valence (i.e., support or oppose) by leveraging large-scale data training is untrustworthy and inexplainable. We assume that emulating humans to rely on social norms to make moral decisions can help LLMs understand and predict moral judgment. However, capturing human values remains a challenge, as multiple related norms might conflict in specific contexts. Consider norms that are upheld by the majority and promote the well-being of society are more likely to be accepted and widely adopted (e.g., "don't cheat,"). Therefore, it is essential for LLM to identify the appropriate norms for a given scenario before making moral decisions. To this end, we introduce a novel moral judgment approach called \textit{ClarityEthic} that leverages LLMs' reasoning ability and contrastive learning to uncover relevant social norms for human actions from different perspectives and select the most reliable one to enhance judgment accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in moral judgment tasks. Moreover, human evaluations confirm that the generated social norms provide plausible explanations that support the judgments. This suggests that modeling human moral judgment with the emulating humans moral strategy is promising for improving the ethical behaviors of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Reflection on Code Contributor Demographics and Collaboration Patterns in the Rust Community</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open-source software communities thrive on global collaboration and contributions from diverse participants. This study explores the Rust programming language ecosystem to understand its contributors' demographic composition and interaction patterns. Our objective is to investigate the phenomenon of participation inequality in key Rust projects and the presence of diversity among them. We studied GitHub pull request data from the year leading up to the release of the latest completed Rust community annual survey in 2023. Specifically, we extracted information from three leading repositories: Rust, Rust Analyzer, and Cargo, and used social network graphs to visualize the interactions and identify central contributors and sub-communities. Social network analysis has shown concerning disparities in gender and geographic representation among contributors who play pivotal roles in collaboration networks and the presence of varying diversity levels in the sub-communities formed. These results suggest that while the Rust community is globally active, the contributor base does not fully reflect the diversity of the wider user community. We conclude that there is a need for more inclusive practices to encourage broader participation and ensure that the contributor base aligns more closely with the diverse global community that utilizes Rust.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Rabbit Hole: Emergent Biases in LLM-Generated Attack Narratives Targeting Mental Health Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to demonstrate imbalanced biases against certain groups. However, the study of unprovoked targeted attacks by LLMs towards at-risk populations remains underexplored. Our paper presents three novel contributions: (1) the explicit evaluation of LLM-generated attacks on highly vulnerable mental health groups; (2) a network-based framework to study the propagation of relative biases; and (3) an assessment of the relative degree of stigmatization that emerges from these attacks. Our analysis of a recently released large-scale bias audit dataset reveals that mental health entities occupy central positions within attack narrative networks, as revealed by a significantly higher mean centrality of closeness (p-value = 4.06e-10) and dense clustering (Gini coefficient = 0.7). Drawing from sociological foundations of stigmatization theory, our stigmatization analysis indicates increased labeling components for mental health disorder-related targets relative to initial targets in generation chains. Taken together, these insights shed light on the structural predilections of large language models to heighten harmful discourse and highlight the need for suitable approaches for mitigation.</description>
