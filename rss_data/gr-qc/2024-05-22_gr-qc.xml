      <title>Conformal deformations of initial data sets to the strict dominant energy condition using a spacetime Poisson equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an alternate proof of one of the results given in [16] showing that initial data sets with boundary for the Einstein equations $(M, g, k)$ satisfying the dominant energy condition can be conformally deformed to the strict dominant energy condition, while preserving the character of the boundary (minimal, future trapped, or past trapped) while changing the area of the boundary and ADM energy of the initial data set by an arbitrarily small amount. The proof relies on solving an equation that looks like the equation for spacetime harmonic functions studied in [7], but with a Neumann boundary condition and non-zero right hand side, which we refer to as a spacetime Poisson equation. One advantage of this method of proof is that the conformal deformation is explicitly constructed as a solution to a PDE, as opposed to only knowing the solution exists via an application of the implicit function theorem as in [16]. We restrict ourselves to the physically relevant case of a $3$-manifold $M$, though the proof can be generalized to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Ringing out General Relativity: Quasi-normal mode frequencies for black holes of any spin in modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After black holes collide, the remnant settles to a stationary state by emitting gravitational waves. Once non-linearities subside, these ringdown waves are dominated by exponentially-damped sinusoids, or quasinormal modes. We develop a general method using perturbative spectral expansions to calculate the quasinormal-mode frequencies and damping times in a wide class of modified gravity theories for black holes with any subextremal spin. We apply this method to scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity to show its accuracy, thus enabling robust ringdown tests with gravitational wave data.</description>

      <title>Hushing black holes: tails in dynamical spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stationary, asymptotically flat, black hole solutions of the vacuum field equations of General Relativity belong to the Kerr family. But how does one approach this state, dynamically? Linearized fluctuations decay at late times, at fixed spatial position, as a Price power law for generic initial conditions. However, little attention was paid to forced and nonlinear spacetimes, where matter and nonlinearities play a role. We uncover a new, source-driven tail governing waves generated by pointlike matter and nonlinearities, which can dominate over Price's decay.</description>

      <title>Constraining regularization ambiguities in Loop Quantum Cosmology via CMB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to investigate the potential observational signals of different regularization ambiguities in loop quantum cosmological models, we systematically compute and compare the primordial scalar power spectra and the resulting angular power spectra in the standard loop quantum cosmology (LQC) and its Thiemann regularized versions -- modified LQC-I/II (mLQC-I/II), using both the dressed metric and the hybrid approaches. All three loop quantum cosmological models yield a non-singular bounce with a post-bounce physics that converges rapidly in a few Planck seconds. Using Starobinsky potential and the initial conditions for the background dynamics chosen to yield the same inflationary e-foldings, which are fixed to be $65$ in all three LQC models, we require that all three models result in the same scale-invariant regime for the primordial power spectrum with a relative difference of less than one percent. This permits us to explore the differences resulting from the deep Planck regime in the angular power spectrum. For the adiabatic states, our results demonstrate that the angular power spectrum predicted by the hybrid approach has a smaller deviation from the angular power spectrum predicted by the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model at large angles in comparison with the dressed metric approach for all three models. The angular power spectrum predicted by mLQC-I in both the hybrid and the dressed metric approaches shows the smallest deviation from the one predicted by the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model at large angular scales, except for the case of fourth order adiabatic initial states in the hybrid approach. On the contrary, mLQC-II results in the largest deviations for the amplitude of the angular power spectrum at large angles and is most disfavored.</description>

      <title>Holographic vacuum energy regularization and corrected entropy of de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that the spectrum of the surface area of the apparent horizon (AH) of de Sitter (dS) spacetime leads to corrected temperature and entropy of the dS spacetime, offering new insights into its thermodynamic properties. This is done by employing the spectrum of the AH radius, acquired from the Wheeler--DeWitt (WDW) equation, together with the Stefan--Boltzmann law, the time-energy uncertainty relation, and the unified first law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Time-reversed information flow through a wormhole in scalar-tensor gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Letter aims to advance novel properties of a class of Closed Timelike Curves recently discovered in scalar-tensor gravity [Universe 9, 467 (2023)]. Therein, it was shown that a wormhole acts a gateway between two $\textit{time-mirrored}$ worlds, where the two asymptotically flat sheets in the Kruskal-Szekeres diagram are glued antipodally along $\textit{three}$ directions -- time $t$ and the polar and azimuth angles $(\theta,\,\varphi)$ of the 2-sphere -- to form a wormhole throat. This contrasts with the standard embedding diagram which typically glues the sheets only along the $\theta$ and $\varphi$ directions. Crucially, due to the `gluing' along the $t$ direction, the wormhole becomes a portal connecting the two spacetime sheets with $\textit{opposite}$ physical time flows, enabling the emergence of closed timelike loops which straddle the throat. We shall point out that this portal $\textit{mathematically}$ permits the possibility of backward propagation of information $\textit{against}$ time. This feature is ubiquitous for wormholes in scalar-tensor theories. In addition, we formulate the Feynman sum for transition amplitudes of microscopic particles in the proximity of a wormhole throat in which we account for timelike paths that experience time reversal.</description>

      <title>Dirac fermions under rainbow gravity effects in the Bonnor-Melvin-Lambda spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the relativistic energy spectrum for Dirac fermions under rainbow gravity effects in the $(3+1)$-dimensional Bonnor-Melvin-Lambda spacetime, where we work with the curved Dirac equation in cylindrical coordinates. Using the tetrads formalism of General Relativity and considering a first-order approximation for the trigonometric functions, we obtain a Bessel equation. To solve this differential equation, we also consider a region where a hard-wall confining potential is present (i.e., some finite distance where the radial wave function is null). In other words, we define a second boundary condition (Dirichlet boundary condition) to achieve the quantization of the energy. Consequently, we obtain the spectrum for a fermion/antifermion, which is quantized in terms of quantum numbers $n$, $m_j$ and $m_s$, where $n$ is the radial quantum number, $m_j$ is the total magnetic quantum number, $m_s$ is the spin magnetic quantum number, and explicitly depends on the rainbow functions $F(\xi)$ and $G(\xi)$, curvature parameter $\alpha$, cosmological constant $\Lambda$, fixed radius $r_0$, and on the rest energy $m_0$, and $z$-momentum $p_z$. So, analyzing this spectrum according to the values of $m_j$ and $m_s$, we see that for $m_j&gt;0$ with $m_s=-1/2$ (positive angular momentum and spin down), and for $m_j&lt;0$ with $m_s=+1/2$ (negative angular momentum and spin up), the spectrum is the same. Besides, we graphically analyze in detail the behavior of the spectrum for the three scenarios of rainbow gravity as a function of $\Lambda$, $r_0$, and $\alpha$ for three different values of $n$ (ground state and the first two excited states).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Planck scale inflationary era -- in a quantum gravity theory predicting discreteness of quantum geometry at the fundamental scale -- produces the scale invariant spectrum of inhomogeneities with very small tensor-to-scalar ratio of perturbations and a hot big bang leading to a natural dark matter genesis scenario. Here we evoke the possibility that some of the major puzzles in cosmology would have an explanation rooted in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Interacting Kerr-Newman Electromagnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study some of the properties of the $G \to 0$ limit of the Kerr-Newman solution of Einstein-Maxwell equations. Noting Carter's observation of the near equality between the $g = 2$ gyromagnetic ratio in the Kerr-Newman solution and that of the electron, we discuss additional such coincidences relating to the Kerr-Newman multipoles and properties of the electron. In contrast to the Coulomb field, this spinning Maxwell field has a finite Lagrangian. Moreover, by evaluating the Lagrangian for the superposition of two such Kerr-Newman electromagnetic fields on a flat background, we are able to find their interaction potential. This yields a correction to the Coulomb interaction due to the spin of the field.</description>

      <title>Constraining the stochastic gravitational wave background using the future lunar seismometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the old idea of using the moon as a resonant gravitational-wave (GW) detector, as well as the recent updates in modeling the lunar response to GWs, } we re-evaluate the feasibility of using a network of lunar seismometers to constrain the stochastic GW background (SGWB). In particular, using the updated model of the lunar response, we derive the pattern functions for the two polarizations of GW. With these pattern functions, we further calculate the overlap reduction functions for a network of lunar seismometers, where we have relaxed the conventional assumption that lunar seismometers are perfectly leveled to measure only the vertical acceleration. We apply our calculation to two future lunar projects, namely, Chang'e and the Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA). We find that the two projects could constrain the SGWB to a level of $\Omega_{\text{GW}}^{\text{Chang'e}} &lt; 79$ and $\Omega_{\text{GW}}^{\text{LGWA}} &lt; 6.7 \times 10^{-11}$, respectively. These results are better than the constraints placed previously on the SGWB in the mid-frequency band (around $10^{-3}- 10~\text{Hz}$) by various types of experiments.</description>

      <title>Unified formalism for the emergence of space in non-equilibrium description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies indicate that the expansion law in emergence of space can be derived from the first law f thermodynamics. It has been proposed a unified formulation for the expansion law applicable to a general set of gravity theories in equilibrium description. In that formulation, which is based on the first law of thermodynamics, the non-equilibrium terms are ignored. Additionally, the structure of surface degrees of freedom in that formulation deviates from the standard notion, where $N_{sur} \ne 4S$ in general theories of gravity. This motivates us to develop a new unified formulation for the expansion law by incorporating non-equilibrium terms into the first law of thermodynamics. In this work, we formulate a unified expansion law in a non-equilibrium context, utilizing the first law of thermodynamics along with the definition of an effective Misner-Sharp energy. Compared to previous generalizations of the expansion law, our formulation reconciles the basic definition of surface degrees of freedom $N_{sur} = 4S$ for a general set of gravity theories. The unified expansion law in non-equilibrium not only highlights the direct relationship between the rate of areal volume and the difference in degrees of freedom between the surface and bulk $(N_{sur}-N_{bulk})$, but also reveals an inverse correlation with the density of surface degrees of freedom. We also demonstrate that the unified expansion law is instrumental in deriving the expansion law for a general set of gravity theories, including those with higher-order curvature corrections such as $f(R)$ theories of gravity, which require a non-equilibrium description.</description>

      <title>Scalar Quasi-Normal Modes of a Loop Quantum Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the Quasi-Normal Mode (QNM) frequencies for scalar perturbations for modified Schwarzschild black holes in Loop Quantum Gravity. We study the singularity-free polymerized metric characterised by two parameters encoding loop quantum effects: the minimal area gap $a_0$ and the polymeric deformation parameter $P$. We perform numerical computations using Leaver's continued fraction method and compare our results to other semi-analytical methods and existing literature. We study the effects on the QNM spectrum of variation of both deformation parameters and systematically compare to the standard Schwarzschild case. In particular we find that the scalar fundamental mode is modified from the third decimal for values of $P$ in accordance with the most recent astrophysical constraints. We also show that qualitative differences arise for highly damped modes: on the one hand, a new crossing of the imaginary axis occurs for high values of $a_0$ and, on the other hand, increasing $P$ produces a positive shift of the real part and an increase of the spacing in imaginary part between modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General relativity is highly successful in explaining a wide range of gravitational phenomena including the gravitational waves emitted by binary systems and the shadows cast by supermassive black holes. From a modern perspective the theory is not fundamental though, but constitutes the lowest order term in an effective field theory description of the gravitational force. As a consequence, the gravitational dynamics should receive corrections by higher-derivative terms. This essay discusses structural aspects associated with these corrections and summarizes their imprint on static, spherically symmetric geometries. Along these lines, we critically reassess the common practice of using local field redefinitions in order to simplify the dynamics at the danger of shifting physics effects into sectors which are beyond the approximation under consideration.</description>

      <title>Influence of quantum correction on the Schwarzschild black hole polarized image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a model of an accretion disk around a Schwarzschild black hole, the analytic estimates for image polarization were derived by Narayan $et~al.$. [Astrophys. J, 102, 912 (2021)]. Recently, the EHT team also obtained polarization images of the Sgr A$^{*}$ and measured both linear and circular polarization [Astrophys. J. Lett, 964, L25 (2024)]. We find that quantum correction effects can also influence polarization information. Considering the quantum corrected Schwarzschild black hole (Kazakov-Solodukhin black hole), we derive the polarization intensity of the target black hole and investigate polarization images under different parameters. It is found that a larger quantum deformation leads to an expansion of the polarization region, while the polarization intensity value decrease. Under different observation angles, magnetic fields, fluid direction angles, and fluid velocity conditions, we also derive polarization images of corrected black holes. These key indicators not only affect the intensity of polarization but also the direction of polarization. We establish the relationship between polarization intensity and quantum correction deformation parameters, revealing a gradual decline in polarization intensity with reduced radius and an anti-polarization behavior induced by the progressive increase in deformation parameters at a constant radius. Our analysis may provide observational evidence for quantum effect of general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sandwich gravitational waves exhibit the velocity memory effect (VM) which however can become, for specific values of the wave parameters, pure displacement (DM) as suggested by Zel'dovich and Polnarev. Fixing such a "miraculous" value, the particle trajectory is an (approximate) standing wave characterized by a unique integer $m$, for which the particle does not absorb any energy from the passing wave. Our statements are illustrated by a simple Gaussian and by the P\"oschl-Teller potential as profiles.</description>

      <title>Holographic thermodynamics of a charged AdS black holes with global monopole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By regarding the Newton constant {G}N and cosmological constant {\Lambda} as variables, we in this paper study the thermodynamics and phase transition of Reissner-Nordstrom anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS) black hole with global monopole in the framework of AdS/CFT correspondence. It is found that there are interesting critical phenomena and phase behaviors in the (grand) canonical ensembles of fixed (Q, V, C), ({\Phi}, V, C) and (Q, V, {\mu}). When the other parameters are fixed, the free energy increases with the global monopole increases. In (Q, V, C) ensemble, the range of unstable region increases with the increase of global monopole. In ({\Phi}, V, C) ensemble, when {\Phi} &lt; {\Phi}c, the free energy appears two branches, the upper and lower branches correspond to low entropy and high entropy respectively. When (Q, V, {\mu}) is fixed, a new zero-order phase transition occurs in the high-entropy phase and the low-entropy phase at certain {\mu}-dependent temperatures. When {\mu} increases to a certain value, this zero-order phase transition disappears. This certain value is positively related to the magnitude of the global monopole. Finally, we find that p-V criticality does not appear with the change of global monopole. Therefore, it is important to note that the CFT states of charged black holes with global monopole do not correspond to Van der Waals fluids. Finally, we find that charged black holes with global monopoles can better reflect thermodynamic phase transitions and critical phenomena under the AdS/CFT correspondence. By adjusting the change of the global monopole, the thermodynamic phase transition will also change.</description>

Abstract: We study free graviton entanglement between Rindler wedges in the Minkowski vacuum state via the Euclidean path integral. We follow Kabat's method for computing the conical entropy, using the heat kernel on the cone with the tip removed, whose resulting von Neumann entropy for photons correctly predicted electromagnetic edge modes. We find that, in addition to the bulk graviton contributions, the conical entropy has a contact term that can be attributed to a vector field anchored to the (d-2)-dimensional (Euclidean) Rindler horizon whose contribution equals d-2 times Kabat's contact term for photons. We suggest that graviton edge modes are hence the d-2 large diffeomorphisms which act internally within the Rindler horizon. Along the way, we address several known issues regarding graviton entanglement. We furthermore sketch how our results may be used to study edge modes in closed bosonic string theory.</description>

      <title>Cosmology of self-replicating universes in black holes formed by dark matter-seeded stellar collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that dark matter with certain minimal properties can convert the majority of baryons in galaxies to black holes over hundred trillion year timescales. We argue that this has implications for cosmologies which propose that new universes are created in black hole interiors. We focus on the paradigm of cosmological natural selection, which connects black hole production to a universe's likelihood for existing. Further, we propose that the universe's timescale for entropy production could be dynamically linked to black hole production in a naturally selected universe. Our universe would fit this scenario for models of particle dark matter that convert helium white dwarfs to black holes in around a hundred trillion years, where the dominant source of entropy in our universe are the helium white dwarfs' stellar progenitors, which cease forming and burning also in around a hundred trillion years. Much of this dark matter could be discovered at ongoing experiments.</description>

      <title>Circular orbits and chaos bound in slow-rotating curved acoustic black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the incorporation of acoustic black holes into Schwarzschild spacetime has enabled the simultaneous existence of event and acoustic horizons, as derived from the Gross-Pitaevskii theory. This paper investigates the dynamics of a particle-like vortex in free fall as it approaches the horizon of a curved slowly-rotating acoustic black hole, specifically within the context of the Lens-Thirring spacetime. We analyze the circular orbits of vortices around the acoustic black hole and delve into the chaotic motion of the vortex at the unstable equilibrium in the vicinity of the horizon. Furthermore, we explore whether a universal bound exists for the Lyapunov exponent characterising this chaotic motion, drawing parallels to the known bounds for the particle motion in general relativity. We anticipate that future experiments will be able to corroborate these findings.</description>

      <title>Communication protocols and QECC from the perspective of TQFT, Part II: QECCs as spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) provide a general, minimal-assumption lan- guage for describing quantum-state preparation and measurement. They therefore provide a general language in which to express multi-agent communication protocols, e.g. local operations, classical communication (LOCC) protocols. In the accompanying Part I, we construct LOCC protocols using TQFT, and show that LOCC protocols induce quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) on the agent-environment boundary. Such QECCs can be regarded as implementing or inducing the emergence of spacetimes on such boundaries. Here we investigate this connection between inter-agent communication and spacetime, exploiting different realizations of TQFT. We delve into TQFTs that support on their boundaries spin-networks as computational systems: these are known as topological quan- tum neural networks (TQNNs). TQNNs, which have a natural representation as tensor networks, implement QECC. We recognize into the HaPPY code a paradigmatic example. We then show how generic QECCs, as bulk-boundary codes, induce effective spacetimes. The effective spatial and temporal separations that take place in QECC enables LOCC protocols between spatially separated observers. We then consider the implementation of QECCs in BF and Chern-Simons theories, and show that QECC-induced spacetimes provide the classical redundancy required for LOCC. Finally, we consider topological M-theory as an implementation of QECC in higher spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>Measuring Hawking Radiation from Black Hole Morsels in Astrophysical Black Hole Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that it is possible to observe the Hawking radiation emitted by small black holes assumed to form in catastrophic astrophysical events such as black hole mergers. Gamma ray bursts in the TeV range are unique footprints of these asteroid-mass black hole morsels ejected during the merger. The time delay of the gamma ray bursts from the gravitational wave event is correlated to the mass distribution of the morsels. The integrated mass of the morsels allowed by the unaccounted merger mass leads to a Hawking induced radiation in photons that is above the sensitivity of atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes such as HESS, LHAASO and HAWC.</description>

      <title>Measuring source properties and quasi-normal-mode frequencies of heavy massive black-hole binaries with LISA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The laser-interferometer space antenna (LISA) will be launched in the mid 2030s. It promises to observe the coalescence of massive black-hole (BH) binaries with signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) reaching thousands. Crucially, it will detect some of these binaries with high SNR both in the inspiral and the merger-ringdown stages. Such signals are ideal for tests of General Relativity (GR) using information from the whole waveform. Here, we consider astrophysically motivated binary systems at the high-mass end of the population observable by LISA, and simulate their signals using the newly developed multipolar effective-one-body model: \texttt{pSEOBNRv5HM}. The merger-ringdown signal in this model depends on the binary properties, and also on parameters that describe fractional deviations from the GR quasi-normal-mode (complex) frequencies of the remnant BH. Performing full Bayesian analyses, we assess to which accuracy LISA will be able to constrain deviations from GR in the ringdown signal when using information from the whole signal. We find that these deviations can typically be constrained to within $10\%$ and in the best cases to within $1\%$. We also show that with this model we can measure the binary masses and spins with great accuracy even for very massive BH systems with low SNR in the inspiral. We also probe the accuracy of the \texttt{SEOBNRv5HM} waveform family by performing synthetic injections of GR numerical-relativity waveforms. Using a novel method that we develop here to quantify the impact of systematic errors, we show that already for sources with SNR $\mathcal{O}(100)$, we would measure erroneous deviations from GR due to waveform model inaccuracies. One of the main sources of error is the mismodelling of the relative alignment between harmonics. Our results confirm the need for improving waveform models to perform tests of GR with high SNR binary BHs observed by LISA.</description>

Abstract: These notes are self-contained, with the first 7 chapters used in a one-semester course with recommended texts by Wald, by Misner, Thorne and Wheeler, and by Schutz. In its treatment of topics covered in these standard texts, the presentation here typically includes steps skipped in Wald or MTW. Treatments of gravitational waves, particle orbits in black-hole backgrounds, the Teukolsky equation, and the initial value equations are motivated in part by the discoveries of gravitational waves from the inspiral and coalescence of binary black holes and neutron stars, advances in numerical relativity, and the expected LISA space-based observatory. The notes begin with a detailed presentation of special relativity with a geometrical orientation, starting with with time dilation and length contraction and including relativistic particles, fluids, electromagnetism, and curvilinear coordinates. Chaps. 2-5 cover curvature, the Einstein equation, relativistic stars, and black holes. Chap. 6, on gravitational waves, includes a discussion of detection and noise. Chap. 7 is a brief introduction to cosmology, deriving the metrics of homogeneous isotropic space, the equations governing a universe with matter, radiation and vacuum energy, and their solutions, and discussions of the cosmological redshift and on using gravitational waves to measure the Hubble constant.
  Chap. 8, on the initial value problem, has a section on the form of the equations used in numerical relativity. The Newman-Penrose formalism and the Teukolsky equation are covered in Chap. 9. Following that is a chapter on black-hole thermodynamics and a final chapter on the gravitational action and on conserved quantities for asymptotically flat spacetimes, using Noether's theorem. An appendix covers forms, densities, integration, and Cartan calculus.</description>

Abstract: The importance and significance of magnetic fields in the astrophysical scenario is well known. Many domains of astrophysical black hole physics such as polarized shadow image, high energy emitting processes and jet formation are dependent on the behavior of the magnetic fields in the vicinity of the compact objects. In light of this, we determine the master equation and master differential equation that determine the spatial behavior of the magnetic field inside a matter distribution or vacuum region, of general spherically symmetric metric, which is immersed in a test magnetic field. We also investigate here the case of JMN-1 singularity immersed in a uniform weak magnetic field and determine the behavior of magnetic fields by defining electromagnetic four potential vector. We find that the tangential component of the magnetic field is discontinuous at the matching surface of the JMN-1 singularity with the external Schwarzschild metric, resulting in surface currents. We define the covariant expression of surface current density in this scenario. We also analyze the behavior of center-of-mass energy of two oppositely charged particles in the geometry of the magnetized JMN-1 singularity. We briefly discuss the possible scenarios which would possess a discontinuous magnetic field and implications of the same and future possibilities in the realm of astrophysics are indicated.</description>

      <title>The pseudospectra of black holes in AdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stability of quasinormal modes (QNMs) in electrically charged black brane spacetimes that asymptote to AdS by means of the pseudospectrum. Methodologically, we adopt ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates to cast QNMs in terms of a generalised eigenvalue problem involving a non-selfadjoint operator; this simplifies the computation significantly in comparison with previous results in the literature. Our analysis reveals spectral instability for (neutral) scalar as well as gravitoelectric perturbations. This indicates that the equilibration process of perturbed black branes is sensitive to external perturbations. Particular attention is given on the hydrodynamic modes, which are found to be the least unstable. In contrast with computations in hyperboloidal coordinates, we find that the pseudospectral contour lines cross to the upper half plane. This indicates the existence of pseudo-resonances as well as the possibility of transient instabilities. We also investigate the asymptotic structure of pseudospectral contour levels and we find remarkable universality across all sectors, persistent in the extremal limit.</description>

Abstract: The causal-stable Muller-Israel-Stewart (MIS) theory is known to have a finite number of out of equilibrium derivative order corrections but requires treating the viscosity tensor as a separate degree of freedom with its own equations of motion, apart from the fundamental fluid degrees of freedom like velocity and temperature. In this work, I will show that it is possible to rewrite the MIS theory only in terms of velocity and temperature, but the resultant constitutive relation for dissipation must include all orders of gradient corrections. In this work I will argue that an all-order resummation of gradient contributions is equivalent to introducing new `non-fluid' degrees of freedom in the MIS theory. It will also be shown, using the relativistic quantum causality condition, that any finitely truncated order of derivative correction, however high it is, leads to a theory that is acausal, unless the corrections are infinitely summed up to all orders.</description>

      <title>A unified description of curvature, torsion, and non-metricity of the metric-affine geometry with the M\"{o}bius representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the mathematical fundamentals for a unified description of curvature, torsion, and non-metricity 2-forms in the way extending the so-called M\"{o}bius representation of the affine group, which is the method to convert the semi-direct product into the ordinary matrix product, to revive the fertility of gauge theories of gravity. First of all, we illustrate the basic concepts for constructing the metric-affine geometry. Then the curvature and torsion 2-forms are described in a unified manner by using the Cartan connection of the M\"{o}bius representation of the affine group. In this unified-description, the curvature and torsion are derived by Cartan's structure equation with respect to a common connection 1-form. After that, extending the M\"{o}bius representation, the dilation and shear 2-forms, or equivalently, the non-metricity 2-form, are introduced in the same unified manner. Based on the unified-description established in this paper, introducing a new group parametrization and applying the In\"{o}n\"{u}-Wigner group contraction to the full theory, the relationships among symmetries, geometric quantities, and geometries are investigated with respect to the three gauge groups: the metric-affine group and its extension, and an extension of the (anti)-de Sitter group in which the non-metricity exists. Finally, possible applications to theories of gravity are briefly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid progress in gravitational wave astronomy has provided an opportunity for investigating the presence of long-range scalar forces that exclusively manifest around astrophysical black holes. In this paper, we explore a new possibility in this context, particularly in connection to the hypothesis that astrophysical black holes might be horizonless ultracompact objects (UCOs). In the absence of horizons, UCOs could feature unique interiors with extreme environments. This could help generate non-trivial scalar profiles and significant scalar charges. For demonstration, we consider 2-2-holes in quadratic gravity as a concrete example of UCOs. These objects can be formed by ordinary gases and closely resemble black holes externally. However, they have distinct interiors characterized by high curvatures and substantial redshift. In particular, the gases inside could reach extremely high temperatures or densities, making them an ideal object for investigating the generation of scalar profiles by UCOs. Within a minimal model of the scalar field, we find that this unique environment enables the generation of a substantial scalar charge for astrophysical 2-2-holes, which is challenging for other stellar objects. The predicted scalar charge-to-mass ratio of 2-2-holes remains nearly constant across a wide range of masses, offering different predictions for gravitational wave observations compared to other mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes and scalar-induced gravitational waves from the polynomial attractor model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) generated in the early Universe are considered as one of the candidates for dark matter. To produce PBHs with sufficient abundance, the primordial scalar power spectrum needs to be enhanced to the order of 0.01. Considering the third-order polynomial potential with polynomial $\alpha$ attractors, we show that PBHs with the mass about $10^{17}$g can be produced while satisfying the constraints from the cosmic microwave background observations at the 2$\sigma$ confidence level. The mass of PBHs produced in the polynomial $\alpha$ attractors can be much bigger than that in the exponential $\alpha$ attractors. By adding a negative power-law term to the polynomials, abundant PBHs with different masses and the accompanying scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) with different peak frequency are easily generated. The PBHs with masses around $10^{-15}-10^{-12}$ $M_\odot$ can account for almost all dark matter. The SIGWs generated in the nanohertz band can explain the recent detection of stochastic gravitational-wave background by the pulsar timing array observations. The non-Gaussianity of the primordial curvature perturbations in the squeezed and equilateral limits are calculated numerically. We find that the non-Gaussianity correction greatly enhances the PBH abundance which makes the production of PBHs much easier, but the effect of non-Gaussianity on the generation of SIGWs is negligible.</description>

Abstract: Our motivation in this work is due to the great importance of relativistic boson stars as fierce competitors of black holes which from theoretical perspective they described by some KG complex scalar waves interacting with curved background in general form. To do so we use the Einstein-Klein Gordon (KG) scalar tensor gravity in presence of Coleman-Weinberg (CW) self-interaction potential to study possible of formation of a spherically symmetric boson star and situation of its stability. As we know the CW potential plays an important role in description of cosmic inflation and so we encourage to check its effects in formation of a relativistic boson star.</description>

Abstract: Black bounces are spacetimes that can be interpreted as either black holes or wormholes depending on specific parameters. In this study, we examine the Simpson-Visser and Bardeen-type solutions as black bounces and investigate the gravitational wave in the background of these solutions. We then explore the displacement and velocity memory effects by analyzing the deviation of two neighboring geodesics and their derivatives influenced by the magnetic charge parameter a. This investigation aims to trace the magnetic charge in the gravitational memory effect. Additionally, we consider another family of traversable wormhole solutions obtained from non-exotic matter sources to trace the electric charge Q_e in the gravitational memory effect, which can be determined from the far field asymptotic. Furthermore, this research aims to explore the gravitational memory effect related to the variation in Bondi mass for the Simpson-Visser and Bardeen-Type black bounces. The investigation will also be conducted on a traversable wormhole solution that does not require any exotic field. This study holds importance in not only identifying compact objects such as wormholes through gravitational memory effects but also in observing the charge Qe, which offers a tangible manifestation of Wheeler's idea of "electric charge without charge."</description>

      <title>Imaging a semi-classical horizonless compact object with strong redshift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent advancements in black hole imaging have opened a new era of probing horizon-scale physics with electromagnetic radiation. However, a feature of the observed images, a bright ring encircling a relatively dark region, has not sufficiently proved the existence of event horizons. It thus requires extreme care when studying the possibility of using such image features to examine quantum effects that may change the classical picture of black holes slightly or drastically. In this work, we investigate the image of a horizonless compact object, whose interior metric satisfies the 4D semi-classical Einstein equation non-perturbatively for the Planck constant, and whose entropy agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. Although the absence of an event horizon allows light rays to pass through the dense interior, the extremely strong redshift significantly darkens the image, making it almost identical to the classical black-hole image. In particular, if there is light emission a bit inside the surface of the object, the intensity around the inner shadow is slightly enhanced, which could be a future observable prediction to characterize the object. We also find through a phenomenological parameter that the image is further darkened due to interactions inside. Thus, the image is consistent with current observations, and the object could be a candidate for black holes in quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Impact of non-zero strange quark mass $(m_{s}\neq0)$ in $f(R,T)$ gravity admitting observational results of strange stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we propose a new class of isotropic strange star using Buchdahl-I metric ansatz in the context of MIT bag model equation of state considering of non-zero strange quark mass $(m_{s})$ in the framework of modified $f(R,T)$ theory of gravity. The barotropic form of MIT bag model equation of state and a specific class of $f(R,T)$ model, {\it viz.}, $f(R,T)=R+2\alpha_{c}T$ where $\alpha_{c}$ is termed as the gravity-matter coupling constant, produces a tractable set of solutions of Einstein field equations. From the allowed numerical values of the coupling constant $(\alpha_{c})$, we have considered a range of $\alpha_{c}$ from -2.0 to 2.0. Maximum mass and radius in this model is found by numerically solving the TOV equations and we note that within the stability window imposed by energy per baryon, for an arbitrary choice of bag constant $B=70~MeV/fm^{3}$, $m_{s}$ and $\alpha_{c}$ act as a constraining factor. Interestingly, the increment of $m_{s}$ and $\alpha_{c}$ results in a softer equation of state which leads to the decrease in the maximum mass and radius while negative values of $\alpha_{c}$ leads to a stiffer equation of state thereby increasing the maximum mass and radius in the present model. For physical application, we consider EXO 1745-248 and study the effects of $m_{s}$ and $\alpha_{c}$ on its radius. Using the formalism, we have analysed the characteristic properties of EXO 1745-248. Apart from that, we have predicted the radii of a wide range of strange star candidates in the context of $f(R,T)$ gravity and the obtained results agree well with the observed results. We note that the proposed model satisfies all the necessary energy conditions and stability criteria to emerge as a viable stellar configuration.</description>

      <title>SPHINCS_BSSN: Numerical Relativity with Particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this book chapter we describe the {\em Lagrangian} numerical relativity code \sphi. This code evolves spacetimes in full General Relativity by integrating the BSSN equations on structured meshes with a simple dynamical mesh refinement strategy. The fluid is evolved by means of freely moving Lagrangian particles, that are evolved using a modern Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) formulation. To robustly and accurately capture shocks, our code uses artificial dissipation terms, but, similar to Finite Volume schemes, we apply a slope-limited reconstruction within the dissipative terms and we use in addition time-dependent dissipation parameters, so that dissipation is only applied where needed. The technically most complicated, but absolutely crucial part of the methodology, is the coupling between the particles and the mesh. For the mapping of the energy-momentum tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ from the particles to the mesh, we use a sophisticated combination of "Local Regression Estimate" (LRE) method and a "multi-dimensional optimal order detection" (MOOD) approach which we describe in some detail. The mapping of the metric quantities from the grid to the particles is achieved by a quintic Hermite interpolation. Apart from giving an introduction to our numerical methods, we demonstrate the accurate working of our code by presenting a set of representative relativistic hydrodynamics tests. We begin with a relativistic shock tube test, then compare the frequencies of a fully relativistic neutron star with reference values from the literature and, finally, we present full-blown merger simulations of irrotational binary systems, one case where a central remnant survives and another where a black hole forms, and of a binary where only one of the stars is rapidly spinning.</description>

      <title>Probing Massive Fields with Multi-Band Gravitational-Wave Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the prospect of probing massive fields and testing gravitational theories with multi-band observations of gravitational waves emitted from coalescing compact binaries. Focusing on the dipole radiation induced by a massive field, we show that multi-band observations can probe the field with mass ranging from $10^{-16}$ eV to $10^{-15}$ eV, a parameter space that cannot be probed by the milli-Hertz band observations alone. Multi-band observations can also improve the constraints obtained with the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA binaries by up to 3 orders of magnitude in the mass range. Moreover, we show that multi-band observations can discriminate the spin of the field, which cannot be identified with single-band observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of decoherence induced by quantum spacetime properties on neutrino oscillation phenomena. We develop a general formalism where the evolution of neutrinos is governed by a Lindblad-type equation and we compute the oscillation damping factor for various models that have been proposed in the literature. Furthermore, we discuss the sensitivity to these effects of different types of neutrino oscillation experiments, encompassing astrophysical, atmospheric, solar, and reactor neutrino experiments. By using neutrino oscillation data from long-baseline reactors and atmospheric neutrino observations, we establish stringent constraints on the energy scale governing the strength of the decoherence induced by stochastic metric fluctuations, amounting to, respectively, $E_{QG}\geq 2.6 \cdot 10^{34}\; \text{GeV}$ and $E_{QG}\geq 2.5\cdot 10^{55}\;\text{GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Analog of cosmological particle production in Dirac materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals materials have recently been established experimentally as a highly-tunable condensed matter platform, facilitating the controlled manipulation of band structures and interactions. In several of these materials, Dirac cones are present in the low-energy regime near the Fermi level. Thus, fermionic excitations emerging in these materials close to the Dirac cones have a linear dispersion relation near the Fermi surface as massless relativistic Dirac fermions. Here, we study low-energy fermionic excitations of such Dirac materials in the presence of a mass gap that may be generated by symmetry breaking. Introducing a dynamical Fermi velocity and/or time-dependent mass gap for the Dirac quasiparticles, we exhibit the emergence of an analog of cosmological fermion pair production in terms of observables such as the expected occupation number or two-point correlation functions. We find that it is necessary and sufficient for quasiparticle production that only the ratio between the mass gap and the Fermi velocity is time-dependent. In this way, we establish that highly-tunable Dirac materials can serve as analog models for cosmological spacetime geometries, in particular, for Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker expanding cosmologies. We briefly discuss possibilities for experimental realization</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The action growth proposal relates the holographic complexity to the value of the action on the Wheeler-de Witt patch. We introduce a new method of calculating the gravitational action using the "bulk" term, i.e. the part of the Einstein-Hilbert action quadratic in connection coefficients. We demonstrate how to address the issue of non-covariance of the bulk action and evaluate it using the tetrad formalism. Due to the boundary term-free nature of the bulk action, we can gain further insights into the spatial structure of the action on the Wheeler-de Witt patch. We then argue that our entire scheme can be naturally covariantized within the framework of teleparallel geometry.</description>

Abstract: We study Ricci-flat perturbations of gravitational instantons of Petrov type D. Analogously to the Lorentzian case, the Weyl curvature scalars of extreme spin-weight satisfy a Riemannian version of the separable Teukolsky equation. As a step towards rigidity of the type D Kerr and Taub-bolt families of instantons, we prove mode stability, i.e., that the Teukolsky equation admits no solutions compatible with regularity and asymptotic (local) flatness.</description>

      <title>Low- and high-redshift H II starburst galaxies obey different luminosity-velocity dispersion relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To determine whether or not H II starburst galaxies (H IIG) are standardizable candles, we study the correlation between the H$\beta$ luminosity ($L$) and the velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) of the ionized gas from H IIG measurements by simultaneously constraining the $L-\sigma$ relation parameters and the cosmological model parameters. We investigate six flat and nonflat relativistic dark energy cosmological models. We find that low-redshift and high-redshift H IIG data subsets are standardizable but obey different $L-\sigma$ relations. Current H IIG data are too sparse and too non-uniformly distributed in redshift to allow for a determination of why the samples follow different relations, but it could be caused by the high-redshift sample containing relatively fewer intrinsically dimmer sources (Malmquist bias) or it could be a consequence of H IIG evolution. Until this issue is better understood, H IIG data cosmological constraints must be treated with caution.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signals From Early Matter Domination: Interpolating Between Fast and Slow Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An epoch of matter domination in the early universe can enhance the primordial stochastic gravitational wave signal, potentially making it detectable to upcoming gravitational wave experiments. However, the resulting gravitational wave signal is quite sensitive to the end of the early matter-dominated epoch. If matter domination ends gradually, a cancellation results in an extremely suppressed signal, while in the limit of an instantaneous transition, there is a resonant-like enhancement. The end of the matter dominated epoch cannot be instantaneous, however, and previous analyses have used a Gaussian smoothing technique to account for this, and consider only a limited regime around the fast transition limit. In this work, we present a study of the enhanced gravitational wave signal from early matter domination without making either approximation and show how the signal smoothly evolves from the strongly suppressed to strongly enhanced regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some attempts of easing the critical Hubble tension present in modern cosmology have resorted to using variations of fundamental constants, such as the fine-structure constant, at the time of recombination. In this article we demonstrate that there are critical hurdles to construct such viable models using scalar fields, due to the striking precision of local constraints on the fine-structure constant stability. These hurdles demonstrate that in single-field models one has to extremely fine-tune the shape of the potential and/or the initial conditions. Indeed, for single field models in a potential that is not fine-tuned we can put a generic bound at recombination of $\Delta \alpha/\alpha &lt; 5\cdot 10^{-4}$ (95\% CL).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relativistic bubble walls from cosmological phase transitions (PT) necessarily accumulate expanding shells of particles. We systematically characterize shell properties, and identify and calculate the processes that prevent them from free streaming: phase-space saturation effects, out-of-equilibrium $2\to2$ and $3\to2$ shell-shell and shell-bath interactions, and shell interactions with bubble walls. We find that shells do not free stream in scenarios widely studied in the literature, where standard predictions will need to be reevaluated, including those of bubble wall velocities, gravitational waves (GW) and particle production. Our results support the use of bulk-flow GW predictions in all regions where shells free stream, irrespectively of whether or not the latent heat is mostly converted in the scalar field gradient.</description>

Abstract: We recently introduced a particular nonlinear generalization of quantum mechanics which has the property that it is exactly solvable in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian of the usual linear quantum mechanics problem. In this paper we suggest that the two components of the wave function represent the system described by the Hamiltonian H in two different asymptotic regions of spacetime and we show that the non-linear terms can be viewed as giving rise to gravitational effects.</description>
