      <title>Mean-Field Price Formation on Trees with a Network of Relative Performance Concerns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial firms and institutional investors are routinely evaluated based on their performance relative to their peers. These relative performance concerns significantly influence risk-taking behavior and market dynamics. While the literature studying Nash equilibrium under such relative performance competitions is extensive, its effect on asset price formation remains largely unexplored. This paper investigates mean-field equilibrium price formation of a single risky stock in a discrete-time market where agents exhibit exponential utility and relative performance concerns. Unlike existing literature that typically treats asset prices as exogenous, we impose a market-clearing condition to determine the price dynamics endogenously within a relative performance equilibrium. Using a binomial tree framework, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the market-clearing mean-field equilibrium in both single- and multi-population settings. Finally, we provide illustrative numerical examples demonstrating the equilibrium price distributions and agents' optimal position sizes.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Eigensolver for Real-World Finance: Scalable Solutions for Dynamic Portfolio Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scalable, hardware-aware methodology for extending the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to large, realistic Dynamic Portfolio Optimization (DPO) problems. Building on the scaling strategy from our previous work, where we tailored a VQE workflow to both the DPO formulation and the target QPU, we now put forward two significant advances. The first is the implementation of the Ising Sample-based Quantum Configuration Recovery (ISQR) routine, which improves solution quality in Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problems. The second is the use of the VQE Constrained method to decompose the optimization task, enabling us to handle DPO instances with more variables than the available qubits on current hardware. These advances, which are broadly applicable to other optimization problems, allow us to address a portfolio with a size relevant to the financial industry, consisting of up to 38 assets and covering the full Spanish stock index (IBEX 35). Our results, obtained on a real Quantum Processing Unit (IBM Fez), show that this tailored workflow achieves financial performance on par with classical methods while delivering a broader set of high-quality investment strategies, demonstrating a viable path towards obtaining practical advantage from quantum optimization in real financial applications.</description>

      <title>Index-Tracking Portfolio Construction and Rebalancing under Bayesian Sparse Modelling and Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the construction and rebalancing of sparse index-tracking portfolios from an operational research perspective, with explicit emphasis on uncertainty quantification and implementability. The decision variables are portfolio weights constrained to sum to one; the aims are to track a reference index closely while controlling the number of names and the turnover induced by rebalancing. We cast index tracking as a high-dimensional linear regression of index returns on constituent returns, and employ a sparsity-inducing Laplace prior on the weights. A single global shrinkage parameter controls the trade-off between tracking error and sparsity, and is calibrated by an empirical-Bayes stochastic approximation scheme. Conditional on this calibration, we approximate the posterior distribution of the portfolio weights using proximal Langevin-type Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms tailored to the budget constraint. This yields posterior uncertainty on tracking error, portfolio composition and prospective rebalancing moves. Building on these posterior samples, we propose rules for rebalancing that gate trades through magnitude-based thresholds and posterior activation probabilities, thereby trading off expected tracking error against turnover and portfolio size. A case study on tracking the S&amp;P~500 index is carried out to showcase how our tools shape the decision process from portfolio construction to rebalancing.</description>
