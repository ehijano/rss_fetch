      <title>Can a Quantum Support Vector Machine algorithm be utilized to identify Key Biomarkers from Multi-Omics data of COVID19 patients?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying key biomarkers for COVID-19 from high-dimensional multi-omics data is critical for advancing both diagnostic and pathogenesis research. In this study, we evaluated the applicability of the Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) algorithm for biomarker-based classification of COVID-19. Proteomic and metabolomic biomarkers from two independent datasets were ranked by importance using ridge regression and grouped accordingly. The top- and bottom-ranked biomarker sets were then used to train and evaluate both classical SVM (CSVM) and QSVM models, serving as predictive and negative control inputs, respectively. The QSVM was implemented with multiple quantum kernels, including amplitude encoding, angle encoding, the ZZ feature map, and the projected quantum kernel. Across various experimental settings, QSVM consistently achieved classification performance that was comparable to or exceeded that of CSVM, while reflecting the importance rankings by ridge regression. Although the experiments were conducted in numerical simulation, our findings highlight the potential of QSVM as a promising approach for multi-omics data analysis in biomedical research.</description>

      <title>Erasure Minesweeper: exploring hybrid-erasure surface code architectures for efficient quantum error correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual-rail erasure qubits can substantially improve the efficiency of quantum error correction, allowing lower error rates to be achieved with fewer qubits, but each erasure qubit requires $3\times$ more transmons to implement compared to standard qubits. In this work, we introduce a hybrid-erasure architecture for surface code error correction where a carefully chosen subset of qubits is designated as erasure qubits while the rest remain standard. Through code-capacity analysis and circuit-level simulations, we show that a hybrid-erasure architecture can boost the performance of the surface code -- much like how a game of Minesweeper becomes easier once a few squares are revealed -- while using fewer resources than a full-erasure architecture. We study strategies for the allocation and placement of erasure qubits through analysis and simulations. We then use the hybrid-erasure architecture to explore the trade-offs between per-qubit cost and key logical performance metrics such as threshold and effective distance in surface code error correction. Our results show that the strategic introduction of dual-rail erasure qubits in a transmon architecture can enhance the logical performance of surface codes for a fixed transmon budget, particularly for near-term-relevant transmon counts and logical error rates.</description>

      <title>Scrambling Dynamics with Imperfections in a Solvable Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how probes of quantum scrambling dynamics respond to two kinds of imperfections -- unequal forward and backward evolutions and decoherence -- in a solvable Brownian circuit model. We calculate a ``renormalized'' out-of-time-order correlator (ROTOC) in the model with $N$ qubits, and we show that the circuit-averaged ROTOC is controlled by an effective probability distribution in operator weight space which obeys a system of $N$ non-linear equations of motion. These equations can be easily solved numerically for large system sizes which are beyond the reach of exact methods. Moreover, for an operator initially concentrated on weight one $w_0=1$, we provide an exact solution to the equations in the thermodynamic limit of many qubits that is valid for all times, all non-vanishing perturbation strengths $p\gtrsim 1/\sqrt{N}$, and all decoherence strengths. We also show that a generic initial condition $w_0 &gt;1$ leads to a metastable state that eventually collapses to the $w_0=1$ case after a lifetime $\sim \log(N/w_0)$. Our results highlight situations where it is still possible to extract the unperturbed chaos exponent even in the presence of imperfections, and we comment on the applications of our results to existing experiments with nuclear spins and to future scrambling experiments.</description>

      <title>An unbiased measure over the matrix product state manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix product states are useful representations for a large variety of naturally occurring quantum states. Studying their typical properties is important for understanding universal behavior, including quantum chaos and thermalization, as well as the limits of classical simulations of quantum devices. We show that the usual ensemble of sequentially generated random matrix product states (RMPS) using local Haar random unitaries is not uniform when viewed as a restriction of the full Hilbert space. As a result, the entanglement across the chain exhibits an anomalous asymmetry under spatial inversion. We show how to construct an unbiased measure starting from the left-canonical form and design a Metropolis algorithm for sampling random states. Some properties of this new ensemble are investigated both analytically and numerically, such as the resulting resolution of identity over matrix product states and the typical entanglement spectrum, which is found to differ from the sequentially generated case.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning Implies Quantum Glassiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show a surprising relation between quantum learning theory and algorithmic hardness. We demonstrate that finding near-ground states of certain sparse disordered quantum systems is average-case hard for "Lipschitz" quantum algorithms if there exists an efficient, local learning algorithm -- such as the classical shadows algorithm -- for estimating the energy of a state of the system. A corollary of our result is that many standard quantum algorithms fail to find near-ground states of these systems, including short-time Lindbladian dynamics, short-time quantum annealing, phase estimation, and shallow-depth variational quantum algorithms. To achieve this, we introduce a topological property of quantum systems that we call the quantum overlap gap property (QOGP). This property is only satisfied by systems with an efficient local learning algorithm for the energy. We prove that systems which exhibit this topological property in their low-energy space are intractable for quantum algorithms whose outputs are stable under perturbations to their inputs. We then prove that the QOGP is satisfied for a sparsified variant of the quantum $p$-spin model, giving the first known algorithmic hardness-of-approximation result for quantum algorithms in finding the ground state of a non-stoquastic, noncommuting quantum system. Our resulting lower bound for quantum algorithms optimizing this model using Lindbladian evolution matches the best-known time lower bound for classical Langevin dynamics optimizing classical $p$-spin models. For this reason we suspect that finding ground states of typical quantum $p$-spin models using quantum algorithms is, in practice, as intractable as the classical $p$-spin model is for classical algorithms. Inversely, we show that the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model does not exhibit the QOGP, consistent with previous evidence that the model is rapidly mixing at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Approximation theory for Green's functions via the Lanczos algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that Green's functions can be expressed as continued fractions; the content at the $n$-th level of the fraction is encoded in a coefficient $b_n$, which can be recursively obtained using the Lanczos algorithm. We present a theory concerning errors in approximating Green's functions using continued fractions when only the first $N$ coefficients are known exactly. Our focus lies on the stitching approximation (also known as the recursion method), wherein truncated continued fractions are completed with a sequence of coefficients for which exact solutions are available. We assume a now standard conjecture about the growth of the Lanczos coefficients in chaotic many-body systems, and that the stitching approximation converges to the correct answer. Given these assumptions, we show that the rate of convergence of the stitching approximation to a Green's function depends strongly on the decay of staggered subleading terms in the Lanczos cofficients. Typically, the decay of the error term ranges from $1/\mathrm{poly}(N)$ in the best case to $1/\mathrm{poly}(\log N)$ in the worst case, depending on the differentiability of the spectral function at the origin. We present different variants of this error estimate for different asymptotic behaviours of the $b_n$, and we also conjecture a relationship between the asymptotic behavior of the $b_n$'s and the smoothness of the Green's function. Lastly, with the above assumptions, we prove a formula linking the spectral function's value at the origin to a product of continued fraction coefficients, which we then apply to estimate the diffusion constant in the mixed field Ising model.</description>

      <title>Coherently mitigating boson samplers with stochastic errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling experiments provide a viable route to show quantum advantages of quantum devices over classical computers in well-defined computational tasks. However, quantum devices such as boson samplers are susceptible to various errors, including stochastic errors due to fabrication imperfections. These cause the implemented unitary operations to deviate randomly from their intended targets, following distributions with finite variance. Whilst full-scale quantum error correction remains challenging in the near term, quantum error mitigation schemes have been devised to estimate expectation values, but it is unclear how these schemes would work for sampling experiments. In this work, we demonstrate that, given access to multiple stochastic unitaries, it is possible to mitigate the effect of these errors in sampling experiments. We adopt the unitary averaging protocol which employs multiple stochastic boson samplers to generate a distribution that approximates the ideal boson sampler distribution as the number of samplers increases. We derive a rigorous upper bound on the trace distance between the output probability distributions induced by invertible vacuum-heralded networks based on the Schur-Weyl duality. This result can be seen concretely as an error mitigation scheme in sampling experiments against stochastic errors. On a broader level, it suggests a path towards understanding error mitigation for sampling experiments and developing analysis tools for photonic circuits incorporating measurements and feed-forward. We further provide other applications of unitary averaging, including its use in implementing the linear combination of unitaries and benchmarking fabrication repeatability in linear optics.</description>

      <title>Open-systems tools for non-thermalizing closed quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design several examples of constrained, symmetric quantum circuit dynamics that generate non-equilibrium steady states. The qubit networks maintain local memory of the initial conditions and display inhomogeneous subsystem dynamics over long times, clearly distinguishable from approximately thermalizing networks of the same size. Each network can be described as an ensemble of open systems, a collection of qubits evolving with phase-covariant dynamics. Constraints from the conservation law and global unitary dynamics of the entire network bound the distribution of single-qubit dynamics in the ensemble, but different steady states are distinguishable by several measures. We quantify the distance of the steady states from the homogeneous steady state and further characterize them using the complexity of their mutual information networks, the volume of state space explored, a thermodynamic utility measure using extractable work, and correlated structure in the occurrence of non-completely positive qubit propagator maps.</description>

      <title>Tree tensor network hierarchical equations of motion based on time-dependent variational principle for efficient open quantum dynamics in structured thermal environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient method TTN-HEOM for exactly calculating the open quantum dynamics for driven quantum systems interacting with highly structured bosonic baths by combining the tree tensor network (TTN) decomposition scheme to the bexcitonic generalization of the numerically-exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). The method yields a series of quantum master equations for all core tensors in the TTN that efficiently and accurately capture the open quantum dynamics for non-Markovian environments to all orders in the system-bath interaction. These master equations are constructed based on the time-dependent Dirac-Frenkel variational principle which isolates the optimal dynamics for the core tensors given the TTN ansatz. The dynamics converges to the HEOM when increasing the rank of the core tensors, a limit in which the TTN ansatz becomes exact. We introduce TENSO, Tensor Equations for Non-Markovian Structured Open systems, as a general-purpose Python code to propagate the TTN-HEOM dynamics. We implement three general propagators for the coupled master equations: Two fixed-rank methods that require a constant memory footprint during the dynamics, and one adaptive-rank method with variable memory footprint controlled by the target level of computational error. We exemplify the utility of these methods by simulating a two-level system coupled to a structured bath containing one Drude-Lorentzian component and eight Brownian oscillators, which is beyond what can presently be computed using the standard HEOM. Our results show that the TTN-HEOM is capable to simulate both dephasing and relaxation dynamics of driven quantum system interacting with structured baths, even those of chemical complexity, with affordable computational cost.</description>

      <title>Toward Practical Quantum Machine Learning: A Novel Hybrid Quantum LSTM for Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel hybrid quantum-classical neural network architecture for fraud detection that integrates a classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with a variational quantum circuit. By leveraging quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement, our model enhances the feature representation of sequential transaction data, capturing complex non-linear patterns that are challenging for purely classical models. A comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline is employed to clean, encode, balance, and normalize a credit card fraud dataset, ensuring a fair comparison with baseline models. Notably, our hybrid approach achieves per-epoch training times in the range of 45-65 seconds, which is significantly faster than similar architectures reported in the literature, where training typically requires several minutes per epoch. Both classical and quantum gradients are jointly optimized via a unified backpropagation procedure employing the parameter-shift rule for the quantum parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrate competitive improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score relative to a conventional LSTM baseline. These results underscore the promise of hybrid quantum-classical techniques in advancing the efficiency and performance of fraud detection systems.

      <title>A New Hybrid Quantum-Classical Algorithm for Solving the Unit Commitment Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving problems related to planning and operations of large-scale power systems is challenging on classical computers due to their inherent nature as mixed-integer and nonlinear problems. Quantum computing provides new avenues to approach these problems. We develop a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for the Unit Commitment (UC) problem in power systems which aims at minimizing the total cost while optimally allocating generating units to meet the hourly demand of the power loads. The hybrid algorithm combines a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) with a classical Bender's type heuristic. The resulting algorithm computes approximate solutions to UC in three stages: i) a collection of UC vectors capable meeting the power demand with lowest possible operating costs is generated based on VQA; ii) a classical sequential least squares programming (SLSQP) routine is leveraged to find the optimal power level corresponding to a predetermined number of candidate vectors; iii) in the last stage, the approximate solution of UC along with generating units power level combination is given. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method, three different systems with 3 generating units, 10 generating units, and 26 generating units were tested for different time periods. In addition, convergence of the hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for select time periods is proven out on IonQ's Forte system.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atom Electric Field Sensors as Linear Time-invariant Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, Rydberg atom electric field sensors have been under investigation as potential alternatives or complements to conventional antenna-based receivers for select applications in RF communications, remote sensing, and precision metrology. To understand the potential utility of these devices for various use cases, it is crucial to develop models that accurately predict key performance metrics such as instantaneous bandwidth and dynamic range. However, existing numerical models require solving a large set of coupled differential equations that is computationally intensive and lengthy to solve. We present an analytic approach that can be used to derive an impulse response function that allows up to two orders-of-magnitude reduction in computation time compared to the full time-dependent integration of the equations of motion. This approach can be used to enable rapid assessments of the Rydberg sensor's response to various waveforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Approaches to the Quadratic Assignment Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) is an NP-hard fundamental combinatorial optimization problem introduced by Koopmans and Beckmann in 1957. The problem is to assign $n$ facilities to $n$ different locations with the goal of minimizing the cost of the total distances between facilities weighted by the corresponding flows. We initiate the study of using Rydberg arrays to find optimal solutions to the QAP and provide a complementing circuit theory to facilitate an easy representation of other hard problems. We provide an algorithm for finding valid and optimal solutions to the QAP using Rydberg arrays.</description>

      <title>On a time-resolved interpretation of the Husimi function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we interpret the Husimi function as the conditional probability density of continuously measuring a stream of constant position and momentum outcomes, indefinitely. This gives rise to an alternative definition that naturally extends to an arbitrary collection of self-adjoint operators without reference to coherent states. This definition recovers the Husimi distribution for a spin-half particle when monitoring the three Pauli matrices, as well as Born's rule for quantum measurement when monitoring commuting quantum observables. Ultimately, the proposed paradigm generates positive representations of quantum states as conditional densities, on both finite and infinite time classical experiments, as expectations of a fundamental operator, the Gaussian semigroup.</description>

      <title>Wideband covariance magnetometry below the diffraction limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a method for measuring correlations of wideband magnetic signals with spatial resolution below the optical diffraction limit. Our technique employs two nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as nanoscale magnetometers, spectrally resolved by inhomogeneous optical transitions. Using high-fidelity optical readout and long spin coherence time, we probe correlated MHz-range noise with sensitivity of 15 nT Hz$^{-1/4}$. In addition, we use this system for correlated $T_1$ relaxometry, enabling correlation measurements of GHz-range noise. Under such externally applied noise, while individual NV centers exhibit featureless relaxation, their correlation displays rich coherent and incoherent dynamics reminiscent of superradiance physics. This capability to probe high-frequency correlations provides a powerful tool for investigating a variety of condensed-matter phenomena characterized by nonlocal correlations.</description>

      <title>Tripartite hybrid quantum systems: Skyrmion-mediated quantum interactions between single NV centers and superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond and superconducting qubits are two promising solid-state quantum systems for quantum science and technology, but the realization of controlled interfaces between individual solid-state spins and superconducting qubits remains fundamentally challenging. Here, we propose and analyze a hybrid quantum system consisting of a magnetic skyrmion, an NV center, and a superconducting qubit, where the solid-state qubits are both positioned in proximity to the skyrmion structure in a thin magnetic disk. We show that it is experimentally feasible to achieve strong magnetic (coherent or dissipative) coupling between the NV center and the superconducting qubit by using the \textit{quantized gyration mode of the skyrmion} as an intermediary. This allows coherent information transfer and nonreciprocal responses between the NV center and the superconducting qubit at the single quantum level with high controllability. The proposed platform provides a scalable pathway for implementing quantum protocols that synergistically exploit the complementary advantages of spin-based quantum memories, microwave-frequency superconducting circuits, and topologically protected magnetic excitations.</description>

      <title>Dissipative qutrit-mediated stable charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a stable charging scheme mediated by a dissipative three-level system, which allows a unidirectional energy flow from the external power source to a finite-dimensional quantum battery. By virtue of the dissipation, the battery avoids the spontaneous discharging induced by the time-reversal symmetry in any unitary charging scheme. Irrespective to the initial state, the battery can be eventually stabilized at the maximal-ergotropy state as long as the charger-battery interaction is present. We use a Dyson series of Lindbladian superoperator to obtain an effective master equation to describe the battery dynamics and extract the optimization condition for charging efficiency. Also it proves that the Fermi's golden rule can adapt to the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We justify the outstanding performance of our charging scheme when applied to the finite-size system with a uniform energy ladder operator, the large spin battery, and the truncated harmonic oscillator battery.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Decomposition of the Carleman Linearized Burgers' Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Herein, we present a polylogarithmic decomposition method to load the matrix from the linearized 1-dimensional Burgers' equation onto a quantum computer. First, we use the Carleman linearization method to map the nonlinear Burgers' equation into an infinite linear system of equations, which is subsequently truncated to order $\alpha$. This new finite linear system is then embedded into a larger system of equations with the key property that its matrix can be decomposed into a linear combination of $\mathcal{O}(\log n_t + \alpha^2\log n_x)$ terms, where $n_t$ is the number of time steps and $n_x$ is the number of spatial grid points. While the terms in this linear combination are not unitary, we have extended the methods of [arXiv:2404.16991] to block encode them and apply the variational quantuam linear solver (VQLS) [arXiv:1909.05820v4] routine to obtain a solution. Finally, a complexity analysis of the required VQLS circuits shows that the upper bound of the two-qubit gate depth among all of the block encoded matrices is $\mathcal{O}(\alpha(\log n_x)^2)$.</description>

      <title>A Low-Noise and High-Stability DC Source for Superconducting Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid scaling of superconducting quantum processors, electronic control systems relying on commercial off-the-shelf instruments face critical bottlenecks in signal density, power consumption, and crosstalk mitigation. Here we present a custom dual-channel direct current (DC) source module (QPower) dedicated for large-scale superconducting quantum processors. The module delivers a voltage range of $\pm$7 V with 200 mA maximum current per channel, while achieving the following key performance benchmarks: noise spectral density of 20 nV/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at 10 kHz, output ripple $&lt;$500 $\mu$V$_{\mathrm{pp}}$ within 20 MHz bandwidth, and long-term voltage drift $&lt;$5 $\mu$V$_{\mathrm{pp}}$ over 12 hours. Integrated into the control electronics of a 66-qubit quantum processor, QPower enables qubit coherence times of $T_1 = 87.6~\mu\mathrm{s}$ and Ramsey $T_2 = 5.1~\mu\mathrm{s}$, with qubit resonance frequency drift constrained to $\pm$40 kHz during 12-hour operation. This modular design is compact in size and efficient in energy consumption, providing a scalable DC source solution for intermediate-scale quantum processors with stringent noise and stability requirements, with potential extensions to other quantum hardware platforms and precision measurement.</description>

      <title>Experimental evidence for the physical delocalization of individual photons in an interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally assumed that the detection of a single photon as part of an interference pattern erases all possible which-path information. However, recent insights suggest that weak interactions can provide non-trivial experimental evidence for the physical delocalization of a single particle passing through an interferometer. Here, we present an experimental setup that can quantify the delocalization of individual photons using the rate of polarization flips induced by small rotations of polarization. The results show that photons detected in equal superpositions of the two paths are delocalized when detected in a high probability output port, and "super-localized" when detected in a low probability output port. We can thus confirm that delocalization depends on the detection of photons in the output of the interferometer, providing direct experimental evidence for the dependence of physical reality on the context established by a future measurement.</description>

      <title>The Smoothed Wigner distribution, using past and future information, is not the Wigner function of the Smoothed Weak-Valued state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we correct a mistake we made in [Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{122}$, 190402 (2019)] and [Phys. Rev. A $\textbf{103}$, 012213 (2021)] regarding the Wigner function of the so-called smoothed Weak-Valued state (SWV state). Here smoothing refers to estimation of properties at time $t$ using information obtained in measurements both before and after $t$. The SWV state is a pseudo-state (Hermitian but not necessarily positive) that gives, by the usual trace formula, the correct value for a weak measurement preformed at time $t$, $\textit{i.e.}$, its weak value. The Wigner function is a pseudo-probability-distribution (real but not necessarily positive) over phase-space. A smoothed (in this estimation sense) Wigner distribution at time $t$ can also be defined by applying classical smoothing for probability-distributions to the Wigner functions. The smoothed Wigner distribution (SWD) gives identical means for the canonical phase-space variables as does the SWV state. However, contrary to the assumption in the above references, the Wigner function of the SWV state is not the smoothed Wigner distribution.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Ultralow-Mass Nuclear Magnetic Resonance using Spin Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically active quantum defects in solids, such as the nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond, are a leading modality for micron-scale and nanoscale (ultralow-mass) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and imaging under ambient conditions. However, the spin and optical properties of NV centers degrade when closer than about 10 nm from the diamond surface, limiting NMR sensitivity as well as spectral and spatial resolution. Here we outline efforts to develop an alternative nanoscale NMR sensor using the negatively charged boron vacancy ($V_B^-$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). As a van der Waals material, hBN's surface is free from dangling bonds and other sources of paramagnetic noise that degrade the performance of near surface NVs, allowing stable $V_B^-$ defects to exist $\sim1\,$nm from the material surface. We discuss the properties of boron vacancies as they apply to narrowband (AC) magnetic field sensing and outline experimental designs optimized for this system. We propose measurement protocols for $V_B^-$ NMR for both statistically and uniformly polarized samples at the nano- and micron-scales, including relevant pulse sequences, sensitivity calculations, and sample confinement strategies; and compare the expected performance to NV-NMR. We estimate back-action effects between the $V_B^-$ electronic spins and the sample nuclear spins at the nanoscale; and account for unconventional diffusion dynamics in the flow-restricted nanoscale regime, calculating its effects on the expected $V_B^-$ NMR signal. Lastly, we identify potential sample targets and operational regimes best suited for both nanoscale and micron-scale $V_B^-$ NMR.</description>

      <title>Exact treatment of the quantum Langevin equation under time-dependent system-bath coupling via a train of delta distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the quantum Langevin equation for the Caldeira-Leggett model with an arbitrary time-dependent coupling constant. We solve this equation exactly by employing a train of Dirac-delta switchings. This method also enables us to visualize the memory effect in the environment. Furthermore, we compute the two-time correlation functions of the system's quadratures and show that the discrete-time Fourier transform is well-suited for defining spectral densities, as the Dirac-delta switchings turn continuous functions into discretized samples.</description>

      <title>A new approximate Eastin-Knill theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transversal encoded gatesets are highly desirable for fault tolerant quantum computing. However, a quantum error correcting code which exactly corrects for local erasure noise and supports a universal set of transversal gates is ruled out by the Eastin-Knill theorem. Here we provide a new approximate Eastin-Knill theorem for the single-shot regime when we allow for some probability of error in the decoding. In particular, we show that a quantum error correcting code can support a universal set of transversal gates and approximately correct for local erasure if and only if the conditional min-entropy of the Choi state of the encoding and noise channel is upper bounded by a simple function of the worst-case error probability. Our no-go theorem can be computed by solving a semidefinite program, and, in the spirit of the original Eastin-Knill theorem, is formulated in terms of a condition that is both necessary and sufficient, ensuring achievability whenever it is passed. As an example, we find that with $n=100$ physical qutrits we can encode $k=1$ logical qubit in the $W$-state code, which admits a universal transversal set of gates and corrects for single subsystem erasure with error probability of $\varepsilon = 0.005$. To establish our no-go result, we leverage tools from the resource theory of asymmetry, where, in the single-shot regime, a single (output state-dependent) resource monotone governs all state purifications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to determine the exact success probability at each step of Shor's algorithm. Although the literature usually provides a lower bound on this probability, we present an improved bound. The derived formulas enable the identification of all failure cases in Shor's algorithm, which correspond to a success probability of zero. A simulation routine is provided to evaluate the theoretical success probability for a given integer when its prime factorization is known with potential applications in quantum resource estimation and algorithm benchmarking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a density matrix-based network analysis to explore the ground state of the Kitaev chain, uncovering previously hidden structural and entanglement features. This approach successfully identifies the critical point associated with the topological phase transition and reveals a singular point where the ground state exhibits uniform, nonzero entanglement between all fermion pairs, corresponding to a fully connected network structure. We provide an analytical explanation for this singular behavior and establish a connection to the concept of ground state factorization observed in spin chains. Moreover, we analyze the open chain scenario and observe characteristic symmetry changes in the ground state corresponding to Majorana zero modes. These results demonstrate the power of complex network analysis in revealing hidden features in such systems.</description>

      <title>On estimating the quantum $\ell_{\alpha}$ distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the computational complexity of estimating the quantum $\ell_{\alpha}$ distance ${\mathrm{T}_\alpha}(\rho_0,\rho_1)$, defined via the Schatten $\alpha$-norm $\|A\|_{\alpha} = \mathrm{tr}(|A|^{\alpha})^{1/\alpha}$, given $\operatorname{poly}(n)$-size state-preparation circuits of $n$-qubit quantum states $\rho_0$ and $\rho_1$. This quantity serves as a lower bound on the trace distance for $\alpha &gt; 1$. For any constant $\alpha &gt; 1$, we develop an efficient rank-independent quantum estimator for ${\mathrm{T}_\alpha}(\rho_0,\rho_1)$ with time complexity $\operatorname{poly}(n)$, achieving an exponential speedup over the prior best results of $\exp(n)$ due to Wang, Guan, Liu, Zhang, and Ying (TIT 2024). Our improvement leverages efficiently computable uniform polynomial approximations of signed positive power functions within quantum singular value transformation, thereby eliminating the dependence on the rank of the quantum states.
  Our quantum algorithm reveals a dichotomy in the computational complexity of the Quantum State Distinguishability Problem with Schatten $\alpha$-norm (QSD$_{\alpha}$), which involves deciding whether ${\mathrm{T}_\alpha}(\rho_0,\rho_1)$ is at least $2/5$ or at most $1/5$. This dichotomy arises between the cases of constant $\alpha &gt; 1$ and $\alpha=1$:
  - For any $1+\Omega(1) \leq \alpha \leq O(1)$, QSD$_{\alpha}$ is $\mathsf{BQP}$-complete.
  - For any $1 \leq \alpha \leq 1+\frac{1}{n}$, QSD$_{\alpha}$ is $\mathsf{QSZK}$-complete, implying that no efficient quantum estimator for $\mathrm{T}_\alpha(\rho_0,\rho_1)$ exists unless $\mathsf{BQP} = \mathsf{QSZK}$.
  The hardness results follow from reductions based on new rank-dependent inequalities for the quantum $\ell_{\alpha}$ distance with $1\leq \alpha \leq \infty$, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Quantum mechanics of inverted potential well -- Hermitian Hamiltonian with imaginary eigenvalues, quantum-classical correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We in this paper study the quantization of a particle in an inverted potential well. The Hamiltonian is Hermitian, while the potential is unbounded below. Classically the particle moves away acceleratingly from the center of potential top. The existing eigenstates must be unstable with imaginary eigenvalues, which characterize the decay rate of states. We solve the Hamiltonian problem of inverted potential well by the algebraic method with imaginary-frequency raising and lowering boson operators similar to the normal oscillator case. The boson number operator is non-Hermitian, while the integer-number eigenvalues are, of course, real. Dual sets of eigenstates, denoted by "bra" and "ket", are requested corresponding respectively to the complex conjugate number-operators. Orthonormal condition exists between the "bra" and "ket" states. We derive a spatially non-localized generating function, from which $n$-th eigenfunctions can be generated by the raising operators in coordinate representation. The "bra" and "ket" generating functions are mutually normalized with the imaginary integration measure. The probability density operators defined between the "bra" and "ket" states are non-Hermitian invariants, which lead to the Schr\H{o}dinger equations respectively for the "bra" and "ket" states. While probabilities of "bra" and "ket" states themselves are not conserved quantities because of the decay. The imaginary-frequency boson coherent states are defined as eigenstates of lowering operators. The minimum uncertainty relation is proved explicitly in the coherent states. Finally the probability average of Heisenberg equation in the coherent states is shown precisely in agreement with the classical equation of motion. The quantum-classical correspondence exists in the imaginary eigenvalue system.</description>

      <title>Simplified Fermionic Scattering State Preparation for the NISQ Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With quantum computers steadily improving, large volume quantum scattering simulations is getting very close. Yet, in the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era, we are limited to shallow circuits on the order of a thousand layers. Thus, accurate and efficient state preparation methods are needed. We introduce a simplified fermionic scattering state preparation method that reduces circuit depth significantly by partially relaxing the fermionic condition. Using the 1+1D transverse field Ising model as our test bed with exact diagonalization and time evolving block decimation with matrix product states, we show that our simplified states retain nearly all of the behavior of the true fermionic state while being prepared on just a handful of qubits. We also show promising early results on IonQ Forte 1.</description>

      <title>Search for a parity-violating long-range spin-dependent interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-sensitivity quantum sensors are a promising tool for experimental searches for beyond-Standard-Model interactions. Here, we demonstrate an atomic comagnetometer operating under a resonantly-coupled hybrid spin-resonance (HSR) regime to probe P-odd, T-even interactions. The HSR regime enables robust nuclear-electron spin coupling, enhancing measurement bandwidth and stability without compromising the high sensitivity of spin-exchange relaxation-free magnetometers. To minimize vibration noise from velocity-modulated sources, we implement a multistage vibration isolation system, achieving a vibration noise reduction exceeding 700-fold. We establish new constraints on vector-boson-mediated parity-violating interactions, improving experimental sensitivity by three orders of magnitude compared to previous limits. The new constraints complement existing astrophysical and laboratory studies of potential extensions to the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Adjoint Method for Quantum Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive and implement a second-order adjoint method to compute exact gradients and Hessians for a prototypical quantum optimal control problem, that of solving for the minimal energy applied electric field that drives a molecule from a given initial state to a desired target state. For small to moderately sized systems, we demonstrate a vectorized GPU implementation of a second-order adjoint method that computes both Hessians and gradients with wall times only marginally more than those required to compute gradients via commonly used first-order adjoint methods. Pairing our second-order adjoint method with a trust region optimizer (a type of Newton method), we show that it outperforms a first-order method, requiring significantly fewer iterations and wall time to find optimal controls for four molecular systems. Our derivation of the second-order adjoint method allows for arbitrary parameterizations of the controls.</description>

      <title>Local Information Flow in Quantum Quench Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum information in one-dimensional systems undergoing a quantum quench using a local perspective based on the information lattice. This framework provides a scale- and space-resolved decomposition of quantum correlations, enabling a hydrodynamic description of the information flow through well-defined local densities -- termed local information -- and currents. We apply this framework to three local quenches in noninteracting fermionic chains: (i) the release of a single particle into an empty tight-binding chain, (ii) the connection of two critical chains via the removal of a central barrier, and (iii) the coupling of a topological Kitaev chain to a critical chain. In each case, the information lattice reveals the local structure of correlation buildup and information interface effects, going beyond global measures such as the von Neumann entropy. In particular, through the information lattice we uncover the signatures in the local information flow associated with topological edge modes and analytically explain the fractional von Neumann entropy values observed in Majorana quench protocols. Our approach is general and applicable to interacting, disordered, and open systems, providing a powerful tool for characterizing quantum information dynamics.</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum Computing with Optical Links</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers have great potential to solve problems which are intractable on classical computers. However, quantum processors have not yet reached the required scale to run applications which outperform traditional computers. Leading hardware platforms, such as superconducting qubit based processors, will soon become bottlenecked by the physical constraints of their low temperature environments, and the expansion of quantum computers will necessitate quantum links between multiple processor modules. Optical frequencies offer the most promising path for these links due to their resilience to noise even at ambient temperature and the maturity of classical optical networks. However, required microwave-to-optics transducers cannot operate deterministically yet, which has widely been seen as a key challenge for their integration into fault-tolerant quantum computers. In this work, we examine implementations of optical links between cryogenic units that surpass the performance of individual cryogenic modules even with the performance of existing or near-term microwave-to-optics transducers. We show methods for these transducers to provide on-demand entanglement between separated quantum processors with high fidelity and lay out key steps for adoption of the technology including scaling transducer numbers and integration with other hardware. Finally, we discuss a number of architectures comprised of these links which can drive the expansion of quantum data centers to utility scale.</description>

      <title>Two-Qubit Gate Synthesis via Linear Programming for Heterogeneous Instruction Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present GULPS (Global Unitary Linear Programming Synthesis), a segmented Cartan trajectory method that compiles arbitrary two-qubit unitaries into native gate sets by decomposing the synthesis problem into locally solvable sub-problems. Each segment corresponds to a depth-2 circuit synthesized from a linear program over canonical gate invariants, subject to quantum Littlewood-Richardson (QLR) constraints. The intermediate invariants are stitched together via nonlinear least-squares optimization to recover the local operations between segments. This hybrid LP-numerical method enables robust synthesis across parameterized instruction sets. As quantum hardware continues to evolve, GULPS provides a scalable, ISA-aware compilation strategy suitable for integration into platforms like Qiskit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms (QAOA) promise efficient solutions to classically intractable combinatorial optimization problems by harnessing shallow-depth quantum circuits. Yet, their performance and scalability often hinge on effective parameter optimization, which remains nontrivial due to rugged energy landscapes and hardware noise. In this work, we introduce a quantum meta-learning framework that combines quantum neural networks, specifically Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) architectures, with QAOA. By training the QLSTM optimizer on smaller graph instances, our approach rapidly generalizes to larger, more complex problems, substantially reducing the number of iterations required for convergence. Through comprehensive benchmarks on Max-Cut and Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model instances, we demonstrate that QLSTM-based optimizers converge faster and achieve higher approximation ratios compared to classical baselines, thereby offering a robust pathway toward scalable quantum optimization in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Narrow Inhomogeneous Distribution and Charge State Stabilization of Lead-Vacancy Centers in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead-vacancy (PbV) centers in diamond with a large ground state splitting are expected to be a building block of quantum network nodes. Due to the heaviness of the Pb atom, it is challenging to fabricate high-quality PbV centers with a narrow inhomogeneous distribution and stable charge state. In this study, for the formation of the PbV centers, high temperature anneal up to 2300{\deg}C is performed after Pb ion implantation. At a lower temperature of 1800{\deg}C, the PbV centers show a large inhomogeneous distribution and spectral diffusion, while higher temperatures of 2200-2300{\deg}C leads to narrow inhomogeneous distributions with standard deviations of ~5 GHz. The charge state transition of the PbV centers formed at 2200{\deg}C occurs by capturing photo-carriers generated from surrounding defects under 532 nm laser irradiation. Finally, multiple stable PbV centers with nearly identical photon frequencies are obtained, which is essential for applications in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Exact Many-body Quantum Dynamics in One-Dimensional Baths via "Superspins"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the exact dynamics of many-body quantum systems becomes intractable as system size grows. Here, we present a symmetry-based method that provides an exponential reduction in the complexity of a broad class of such problems $\unicode{x2014}$ qubits coupled to one-dimensional electromagnetic baths. We identify conditions under which partial permutational symmetry emerges and exploit it to group qubits into collective multi-level degrees of freedom, which we term ''superspins.'' These superspins obey a generalized angular momentum algebra, reducing the relevant Hilbert space dimension from exponential to polynomial. Using this framework, we efficiently compute many-body superradiant dynamics in large arrays of qubits coupled to waveguides and ring resonators, showing that $\unicode{x2014}$ unlike in conventional Dicke superradiance $\unicode{x2014}$ the total spin length is not conserved. At long times, dark states become populated. We identify configurations where these states exhibit metrologically useful entanglement. Our approach enables exact treatment of complex dissipative dynamics beyond the fully symmetric limit and provides a rigorous benchmark for approximate numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Fully passive quantum random number generation with untrusted light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) harness the inherent unpredictability of quantum mechanics to produce true randomness. Yet, in many optical implementations, the light source remains a potential vulnerability - susceptible to deviations from ideal behavior and even adversarial eavesdropping. Source-device-independent (SDI) protocols address this with a pragmatic strategy, by removing trust assumptions on the source, and instead rely on realistic modelling and characterization of the measurement device. In this work, we enhance an existing SDI-QRNG protocol by eliminating the need for a perfectly balanced beam splitter within the trusted measurement device, which is an idealized assumption made for the simplification of security analysis. We demonstrate that certified randomness can still be reliably extracted across a wide range of beam-splitting ratios, significantly improving the protocol's practicality and robustness. Using only off-the-shelf components, our implementation achieves real-time randomness generation rates of 0.347 Gbps. We also experimentally validate the protocol's resilience against adversarial attacks and highlight its self-testing capabilities. These advances mark a significant step toward practical, lightweight, high-performance, fully-passive, and composably secure QRNGs suitable for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Probing excited-state dynamics of transmon ionization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fidelity and quantum nondemolition character of the dispersive readout in circuit QED are limited by unwanted transitions to highly excited states at specific photon numbers in the readout resonator. This observation can be explained by multiphoton resonances between computational states and highly excited states in strongly driven nonlinear systems, analogous to multiphoton ionization in atoms and molecules. In this work, we utilize the multilevel nature of high-$E_J/E_C$ transmons to probe the excited-state dynamics induced by strong drives during readout. With up to 10 resolvable states, we quantify the critical photon number of ionization, the resulting state after ionization, and the fraction of the population transferred to highly excited states. Moreover, using pulse-shaping to control the photon number in the readout resonator in the high-power regime, we tune the adiabaticity of the transition and verify that transmon ionization is a Landau-Zener-type transition. Our experimental results agree well with the theoretical prediction from a semiclassical driven transmon model and may guide future exploration of strongly driven nonlinear oscillators.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Multipartite Entanglement through Topological Summaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of multipartite entanglement is much less developed than the bipartite scenario. Recently, a string of results \cite{diPierro_2018, mengoni2019persistenthomologyanalysismultiqubit, bart2023, hamilton2023probing} have proposed using tools from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to attach topological quantities to multipartite states. However, these quantities are not directly connected to concrete information processing tasks making their interpretations vague. We take the first steps in connecting these abstract topological quantities to operational interpretations of entanglement in two scenarios. The first is we provide a bound on the Integrated Euler Characteristic defined by Hamilton and Leditzky in \cite{hamilton2023probing} via an average distillable entanglement, which we develop as a generalization of the Meyer-Wallach entanglement measure studied by Scott in \cite{Scott_k-uniform}. This allows us to connect the distance of an error correcting code to the Integrated Euler Characteristic. The second is we provide a characterization of graph states via the birth and death times of the connected components and 1-dimensional cycles of the entanglement complex. In other words, the entanglement distance behavior of the first Betti number $\beta_1(\varepsilon)$ allows us to determine if a state is locally equivalent to a GHZ state, potentially providing new verification schemes for highly entangled states.</description>

      <title>Offset Charge Dependence of Measurement-Induced Transitions in Transmons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in achieving scalable fault tolerance in superconducting quantum processors is readout fidelity, which lags behind one- and two-qubit gate fidelity. A major limitation in improving qubit readout is measurement-induced transitions, also referred to as qubit ionization, caused by multiphoton qubit-resonator excitation occurring at specific photon numbers. Since ionization can involve highly excited states, it has been predicted that in transmons -- the most widely used superconducting qubit -- the photon number at which measurement-induced transitions occur is gate charge dependent. This dependence is expected to persist deep in the transmon regime where the qubit frequency is gate charge insensitive. We experimentally confirm this prediction by characterizing measurement-induced transitions with increasing resonator photon population while actively stabilizing the transmon's gate charge. Furthermore, because highly excited states are involved, achieving quantitative agreement between theory and experiment requires accounting for higher-order harmonics in the transmon Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a measure for evaluating the efficiency of finite universal quantum gate sets $\mathcal{S}$, called the Quantum Circuit Overhead (QCO), and the related notion of $T$-Quantum Circuit Overhead ($T$-QCO). The overhead is based on the comparison between the efficiency of $\mathcal{S}$ versus the optimal efficiency among all gate sets with the same number of gates. We demonstrate the usefulness of the ($T$-)QCO by extensive numerical calculations of its upper bounds, providing insight into the efficiency of various choices of single-qubit $\mathcal{S}$, including Haar-random gate sets and the gate sets derived from finite subgroups, such as Clifford and Hurwitz groups. In particular, our results suggest that, in terms of the upper bounds on the $T$-QCO, the famous T gate is a highly non-optimal choice for the completion of the Clifford gate set, even among the gates of order 8. We identify the optimal choices of such completions for both finite subgroups.</description>

      <title>Quantum information engines: Bounds on performance metrics by measurement time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information engines, sometimes referred to as Maxwell Demon engines, utilize information obtained through measurement to control the conversion of energy into useful work. Discussions around such devices often assume the measurement step to be instantaneous, assessing its cost by Landauer's information erasure within the measurement device. While this simplified perspective is sufficient for classical feedback-controlled engines, for nanoengines that often operate in the quantum realm, the overall performance may be significantly affected by the measurement duration (which may be comparable to the engine's cycle time) and cost (energy needed to create the system-meter correlation). In this study, we employ a generalized von-Neumann measurement model to highlight that obtaining a finite amount of information requires a finite measurement time and incurs an energetic cost. We investigate the crucial role of these factors in determining the engine's performance, particularly in terms of efficiency and power output. Furthermore, for the information engine model under consideration, we establish a precise relationship between the acquired information in the measurement process and the maximum energy extractable through the measurement. We also discuss ways to extend our considerations using these concepts, such as in measurement-enhanced photochemical reactions.</description>

      <title>Faster Quantum Algorithm for Multiple Observables Estimation in Fermionic Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving quantum advantage in efficiently estimating collective properties of quantum many-body systems remains a fundamental goal in quantum computing. While the quantum gradient estimation (QGE) algorithm has been shown to achieve doubly quantum enhancement in the precision and the number of observables, it remains unclear whether one benefits in practical applications. In this work, we present a generalized framework of adaptive QGE algorithm, and further propose two variants which enable us to estimate the collective properties of fermionic systems using the smallest cost among existing quantum algorithms. The first method utilizes the symmetry inherent in the target state, and the second method enables estimation in a single-shot manner using the parallel scheme. We show that our proposal offers a quadratic speedup compared with prior QGE algorithms in the task of fermionic partial tomography for systems with limited particle numbers. Furthermore, we provide the numerical demonstration that, for a problem of estimating fermionic 2-RDMs, our proposals improve the number of queries to the target state preparation oracle by a factor of 100 for the nitrogenase FeMo cofactor and by a factor of 500 for Fermi-Hubbard model of 100 sites.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Study on Heisenberg-limited Quantum Algorithms for Multiple Observables Estimation</title>

Abstract: In the accompanying paper of arXiv:25XX.XXXXX, we have presented a generalized scheme of adaptive quantum gradient estimation (QGE) algorithm, and further proposed two practical variants which not only achieve doubly quantum enhancement in query complexity regarding estimation precision and number of observables, but also enable minimal cost to estimate $k$-RDMs in fermionic systems among existing quantum algorithms. Here, we provide full descriptions on the algorithm, and provide theoretical guarantee for the estimation precision in terms of the root mean squared error. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of the quantum amplitude estimation algorithm, another variant of the Heisenberg-limited scaling algorithm, and show how the estimation error is minimized under the circuit structure that resembles the phase estimation algorithm. We finally describe the details for the numerical evaluation of the query complexity of the Heisenberg-limited algorithms and sampling-based methods to make a thorough comparison in the task of estimating fermionic $k$-RDMs.</description>

      <title>A log-depth in-place quantum Fourier transform that rarely needs ancillas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When designing quantum circuits for a given unitary, it can be much cheaper to achieve a good approximation on most inputs than on all inputs. In this work we formalize this idea, and propose that such "optimistic quantum circuits" are often sufficient in the context of larger quantum algorithms. For the rare algorithm in which a subroutine needs to be a good approximation on all inputs, we provide a reduction which transforms optimistic circuits into general ones. Applying these ideas, we build an optimistic circuit for the in-place quantum Fourier transform (QFT). Our circuit has depth $O(\log (n / \epsilon))$ for tunable error parameter $\epsilon$, uses $n$ total qubits, i.e. no ancillas, is logarithmically local for input qubits arranged in 1D, and is measurement-free. The circuit's error is bounded by $\epsilon$ on all input states except an $O(\epsilon)$-sized fraction of the Hilbert space. The circuit is also rather simple and thus may be practically useful. Combined with recent QFT-based fast arithmetic constructions [arXiv:2403.18006], the optimistic QFT yields factoring circuits of nearly linear depth using only $2n + O(n/\log n)$ total qubits. Applying our reduction technique, we also construct the first approximate QFT to achieve the asymptotically optimal depth of $O(\log (n/\epsilon))$ with a sublinear number of ancilla qubits, well-controlled error on all inputs, and no intermediate measurements.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired exoplanet detection in the presence of experimental imperfections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ideal spatial demultiplexing (SPADE) is proven to be a quantum-optimal tool for exoplanet detection, i.e., asymmetric source discrimination. However, recent investigations into the related problems of separation estimation and symmetric source discrimination showed its efficiency to be limited in the presence of noise. In this work, we use analytical tools to scrutinize the practical applicability of SPADE and derive the associated optimal decision strategy for exoplanet detection in the presence of experimental imperfections. On the one hand, we find that the probability of detection of noisy SPADE has the same scaling with planet-star separation and relative brightness as conventional techniques, such as direct imaging and coronagraphs. On the other hand, we prove that, due to a superior scaling coefficient under realistic noise conditions, SPADE remains the most efficient method for practical exoplanet detection in the sub-Rayleigh regime.</description>

The talk focuses on the application of the open quantum system framework and the formulation of the chromoelectric correlator that uniquely encodes properties of the quark-gluon plasma relevant for quarkonium dynamics and thus can be extracted from theory-experiment comparison.</description>

      <title>Investigating Opportunities for Growth and Increased Diversity in Quantum Information Science and Engineering Education in the U.S. based on an Analysis of the Current Educational Landscape</title>

Abstract: Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE) is rapidly gaining interest across a wide range of disciplines. As QISE continues to evolve, engineering will play an increasingly critical role in advancing quantum technologies. While efforts to characterize introductory QISE courses are underway, a comprehensive understanding of QISE education across the United States remains lacking. Developing a broad understanding of the QISE education landscape is crucial for addressing the needs of the growing quantum industry and ensuring equitable access for a diverse range of participants. This paper presents part of an ongoing effort to characterize the current landscape of QISE courses and degree programs in higher education in the US. To achieve this, we used publicly available information from university and college websites to capture information on over 8000 courses that address quantum in some way and nearly 90 QISE specific programs (e.g., degrees, minors, certificates). The majority of these programs are interdisciplinary and include engineering; 14 of them are housed exclusively in engineering departments. We find most programs are offered at research intensive institutions. Our results showcase an opportunity for program developers at non-research intensive institutions to justify the creation of QISE programs, which would also address calls from different stakeholders in QISE education for a more diverse QISE workforce. We suggest strategies based on the findings of this study such as integrating QISE into existing engineering courses, investing in the development of QISE courses and programs at non-PhD-granting institutions, and making courses with QISE content accessible to students from a variety of majors.</description>

      <title>Design and Monte Carlo Simulation of a Phase Grating Moir\'e Neutron Interferometer to Measure the Gravitational Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational constant (G) is the least precisely known fundamental constant of nature, with persistent and significant discrepancies between measurement methods. New techniques for measuring G with systematic effects different from commonly applied pendulum methods are required. Neutrons are convenient probes of gravitational forces as they are both massive and electrically neutral, properties that allowed a single-crystal neutron interferometer (NI) to achieve the first experimental demonstration of gravitationally induced quantum interference. Despite this, the limitation of single-crystal NIs to monoenergetic beams significantly reduces neutron flux, making precision gravitational measurements unfeasible. A new NI design called the phase-grating moir\'{e} interferometer (PGMI) has been shown to increase neutron flux by orders of magnitude while allowing grating separation that maintains similar interferometer area to previous NI devices. Here, we propose and describe an experiment to measure G using the PGMI to a precision comparable to measurements from the CODATA 2022 evaluation. A Monte Carlo model for incorporating nonlinear potentials into a PGMI is introduced. This model is used to evaluate sources of systematic uncertainty and quantify the uncertainty in G arising from these effects. The effect of lunar gravitation on a torsion pendulum experiment from CODATA 2022 is calculated, and the need for possible correction factors is demonstrated. This work demonstrates that a neutron PGMI can be used to measure G to $150$ parts-per-million in the near term with the potential to achieve greater precision in future experimental designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state spin-based quantum systems have emerged as popular platforms for quantum networking applications due to their optical interfaces, their long-lived quantum memories, and their natural compatibility with semiconductor manufacturing. Photonic crystal cavities are often used to enhance radiative emission; however, fabrication of the necessary subwavelength cavities is typically limited to small batch electron beam lithography. In this work, we demonstrate high quality factor, small mode volume nanobeam cavities fabricated on a scalable silicon photonic foundry platform. The foundry fabricated cavities are then interfaced with single erbium ions through backend deposition of TiO2 thin films lightly doped with erbium. Single ion lifetime measurements indicate Purcell enhancement up to about 500, thereby demonstrating a route toward manufacturable deterministic single photon sources in the telecom C-band.</description>

      <title>On the Schr\"odingerization method for linear non-unitary dynamics with optimal dependence on matrix queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schr\"odingerization method converts linear partial and ordinary differential equations with non-unitary dynamics into systems of Schr\"odinger-type equations with unitary evolution. It does so via the so-called warped phase transformation that maps the original equation into a Schr\"odinger-type equation in one higher dimension \cite{Schrshort,JLY22SchrLong}. We show that by employing a smooth initialization of the warped phase transform \cite{JLM24SchrBackward}, Schr\"odingerization can in fact achieve optimal scaling in matrix queries. This paper presents the detailed implementation of three smooth initializations for the Schr\"odingerization method: (a) the cut-off function, (b) the higher-order polynomial interpolation, and (c) the Fourier transform methods, that achieve optimality for (a) and near-optimality for (b) and (c). A detailed analysis of key parameters affecting time complexity is conducted.</description>

Abstract: This letter aims to derive the exact relativistic orbital-free kinetic energy density functional for one-particle nuclear systems in one-dimensional case.
  The kinetic energy is expressed as a functional of both vector and scalar densities.
  The functional derivatives of the kinetic energy density functional are also derived.
  Both the kinetic energy density functional and its functional derivatives are validated to be correct.
  This serves as a foundation for further exploration of more general relativistic orbital-free kinetic energy density functionals.</description>

      <title>Accelerating two-dimensional tensor network contractions using QR-decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful tool for studying strongly correlated systems directly in the thermodynamic limit. A core component of the algorithm is the approximate contraction of the iPEPS, where the computational bottleneck typically lies in the singular value or eigenvalue decompositions involved in the renormalization step. This is particularly true on GPUs, where tensor contractions are substantially faster than these decompositions. Here we propose a contraction scheme for $C_{4v}$-symmetric tensor networks based on combining the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) with QR-decompositions which are substantially faster -- especially on GPUs. Our approach achieves up to two orders of magnitude speedup compared to standard CTMRG and yields state-of-the-art results for the Heisenberg and $J_1$-$J_2$ models in about one hour on an H100 GPU.</description>

      <title>Observation of Resonant Tunneling from Molecular Shape into Vibronic Feshbach Resonances Followed by Mode-Specific Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a kinematically complete study of dissociative electron attachment (DEA) in linear OCS molecules, focusing on how electrons resonantly attach and trigger dissociation. Near the Franck-Condon regime, DEA is dominated by molecular shape resonances, where transient OCS$^-$ states form with high vibrational amplitudes, spectroscopically evident as broad features in DEA cross-sections. As the electron beam energy increases from 5.5 to 6.0 eV, S$^-$ population shifts from lower to higher-energy highly dense bending vibrational states, reinforcing our findings on dipole-forbidden vibronic intensity borrowing. Our advanced potential energy curve calculations, employing the Equation-of-motion coupled cluster singles and doubles for electron attachment (EA-EOMCCSD) method, reveal that beyond the shape resonance, non-adiabatic resonant tunneling governs the avoided crossings, dynamically generating three mode-specific vibronic Feshbach resonances before complete dissociation into three distinct kinetic energy bands of S$^-$. Our theoretical results probe most of the experimental observations quantitatively and qualitatively. These insights deepen our fundamental understanding of resonance-mediated dissociation in electron-molecule resonant scattering, with broader implications for quantum mechanics, plasma physics, vibrational revival, astrochemistry, and radiation damage research.</description>

      <title>Strange correlator and string order parameter for non-invertible symmetry protected topological phases in 1+1d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct strange correlators and string order parameters for non-invertible symmetry protected topological phases (NISPTs) in 1+1d quantum lattice spin models. The strange correlator exhibits long-range order when evaluated between two distinct NISPTs and decays exponentially otherwise. We show that strange charged operators inserted into the strange correlator are linked to the interface algebra (boundary tube algebra) and are non-trivial when all its irreducible representations have dimensions greater than one. We discuss the generalization to higher dimensions. The string order parameter is obtained by contracting the truncated symmetry operator with charge decoration operators, which are determined by the NISPT action tensors. We illustrate the above construction using the three NISPTs of $\text{Rep}(D_8)$ and demonstrate the extraction of categorical data via tensor networks, particularly through the ZX calculus. Finally, we show that the entanglement spectrum degeneracy is determined by the irreducible representations of the interface algebra when assuming non-invertible symmetry on-site condition.</description>

      <title>Self-restricting Noise and Exponential Relative Entropy Decay Under Unital Quantum Markov Semigroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.03745v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: States of open quantum systems often decay continuously under environmental interactions. Quantum Markov semigroups model such processes in dissipative environments. It is known that finite-dimensional quantum Markov semigroups with GNS detailed balance universally obey complete modified logarithmic Sobolev inequalities (CMLSIs), yielding exponential decay of relative entropy to a subspace of fixed point states. We analyze continuous processes that combine dissipative with Hamiltonian time-evolution, precluding this notion of detailed balance. First, we find counterexamples to CMLSI-like decay for these processes and determine conditions under which it fails. In contrast, we prove that despite its absence at early times, exponential decay re-appears for unital, finite-dimensional quantum Markov semigroups at finite timescales. Finally, we show that when dissipation is much stronger than Hamiltonian time-evolution, the rate of eventual, exponential decay toward the semigroup's decoherence-free subspace is bounded inversely in the decay rate of the dissipative part alone. Dubbed self-restricting noise, this inverse relationship arises when strong damping suppresses effects that would otherwise spread noise beyond its initial subspace.</description>

      <title>Geometric correspondence of noisy quantum dynamics and universal robust quantum gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14521v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum information processing faces a significant hurdle: noise. Different noise sources induce varying errors in quantum operations depending on the underlying dynamics. To gain a deeper understanding of these error mechanisms, we introduce the concept of Quantum Error Evolution Diagrams (QEED). These QEEDs establish a dual correspondence between driven noisy quantum dynamics and geometric space curves, offering quantitative geometric metrics to assess the severity of these errors. This theory provides a framework for designing universal robust quantum gates to correct the errors induced by generic noises. Furthermore, we present a protocol for constructing a universal set of single- and two-qubit robust quantum gates. These gates, designed with simple and smooth control pulses of arbitrary length, achieve fidelities exceeding 99.99\% across a wide range of noise strengths. This geometric approach offers significant advantages over existing methods. Overall, our work provides new insights into the geometric nature of noisy quantum dynamics and paves the way for the development of approaches to dynamically correct quantum errors.</description>

      <title>Classical variational optimization of PREPARE circuit for quantum phase estimation of quantum chemistry Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method for constructing $\texttt{PREPARE}$ circuits for quantum phase estimation of a molecular Hamiltonian in quantum chemistry by using variational optimization of quantum circuits solely on classical computers. The $\texttt{PREPARE}$ circuit generates a quantum state which encodes the coefficients of the terms in the Hamiltonian as probability amplitudes and plays a crucial role in the state-of-the-art efficient implementations of quantum phase estimation. We employ the automatic quantum circuit encoding algorithm [Shirakawa $\textit{et al.}$, arXiv:2112.14524] to construct $\texttt{PREPARE}$ circuits, which requires classical simulations of quantum circuits of $O(\log N)$ qubits with $N$ being the number of qubits of the Hamiltonian. The generated $\texttt{PREPARE}$ circuits do not need any ancillary qubit. We demonstrate our method by investigating the number of $T$-gates of the obtained $\texttt{PREPARE}$ circuits for quantum chemistry Hamiltonians of various molecules, which shows a constant-factor reduction compared to previous approaches that do not use ancillary qubits. Since the number of available logical qubits and $T$ gates will be limited at the early stage of the fault-tolerant quantum computing, the proposed method is particularly of use for performing the quantum phase estimation with such limited capability.</description>

      <title>Space-Efficient and Noise-Robust Quantum Factoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00899v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide two improvements to Regev's recent quantum factoring algorithm (Journal of the ACM 2025), addressing its space efficiency and its noise-tolerance.
  Our first contribution is to improve the quantum space efficiency of Regev's algorithm while keeping the circuit size the same. Our main result constructs a quantum factoring circuit using $O(n \log n)$ qubits and $O(n^{3/2} \log n)$ gates. We achieve the best of Shor and Regev (upto a logarithmic factor in the space complexity): on the one hand, Regev's circuit requires $O(n^{3/2})$ qubits and $O(n^{3/2} \log n)$ gates, while Shor's circuit requires $O(n^2 \log n)$ gates but only $O(n \log n)$ qubits. As with Regev, to factor an $n$-bit integer $N$, we run our circuit independently $O(\sqrt{n})$ times and apply Regev's classical postprocessing procedure.
  Our optimization is achieved by implementing efficient and reversible exponentiation with Fibonacci numbers in the exponent, rather than the usual powers of 2, adapting work by Kaliski (arXiv:1711.02491) from the classical reversible setting to the quantum setting. This technique also allows us to perform quantum modular exponentiation that is efficient in both space and size without requiring significant precomputation, a result that may be useful for other quantum algorithms. A key ingredient of our exponentiation implementation is an efficient circuit for a function resembling in-place quantum-quantum modular multiplication.
  Our second contribution is to show that Regev's classical postprocessing procedure can be modified to tolerate a constant fraction of the quantum circuit runs being corrupted by errors. In contrast, Regev's analysis of his classical postprocessing procedure requires all $\approx \sqrt{n}$ runs to be successful. In a nutshell, we achieve this using lattice reduction techniques to detect and filter out corrupt samples.</description>

      <title>Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution Based on Routed Bell Tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photon losses are the main obstacle to fully photonic implementations of device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD). Motivated by recent work showing that routed Bell scenarios offer increased robustness to detection inefficiencies for the certification of long-range quantum correlations, we investigate DIQKD protocols based on a routed setup. In these protocols, in some of the test rounds, photons from the source are routed by an actively controlled switch to a nearby test device instead of the distant one. We show how to analyze the security of these protocols and compute lower bounds on the key rates using noncommutative polynomial optimization and the Brown-Fawzi-Fawzi method. We determine lower bounds on the asymptotic key rates of several simple two-qubit routed DIQKD protocols based on CHSH or BB84 correlations and compare their performance to standard protocols. For high-quality short-path tests, we find that routed DIQKD protocols are significantly more robust to losses, showing an improvement of approximately $30\%$ in the detection efficiency compared to their nonrouted counterparts. This translates to a large improvement in the distance over which nonzero key can be distilled in optical setups with near-perfect single-photon detectors, where the main source of loss in the setup is due to transmission in the fiber. Notably, the routed BB84 protocol achieves a positive key rate with a detection efficiency as low as $50\%$ for the distant device, the minimal threshold for any QKD protocol featuring two untrusted measurements. However, the advantages we find are highly sensitive to noise and losses affecting the short-range correlations involving the additional test device.</description>

      <title>Improving semi-device-independent randomness certification by entropy accumulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04244v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Certified randomness guaranteed to be unpredictable by adversaries is central to information security. The fundamental randomness inherent in quantum physics makes certification possible from devices that are only weakly characterised, i.e. requiring little trust in their implementation. It was recently shown that the amount of certifiable randomness can be greatly improved using the so-called Entropy Accumulation Theorem generalised to prepare-and-measure settings. Furthermore, this approach allows a finite-size analysis which avoids assuming that all rounds are independent and identically distributed. Here, we demonstrate this improvement in semi-device-independent randomness certification from untrusted measurements.</description>

      <title>On the non-Markovian quantum control dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study both open-loop control and closed-loop measurement feedback control of non-Markovian quantum dynamics resulting from the interaction between a quantum system and its environment. We use the widely studied cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity-QED) system as an example, where an atom interacts with the environment composed of a collection of oscillators. In this scenario, the stochastic interactions between the atom and the environment can introduce non-Markovian characteristics into the evolution of quantum states, differing from the conventional Markovian dynamics observed in open quantum systems. As a result, the atom's decay rate to the environment varies with time and can be described by nonlinear equations. The solutions to these nonlinear equations can be analyzed in terms of the stability of a nonlinear control system. Consequently, the evolution of quantum state amplitudes follows linear time-varying equations as a result of the non-Markovian quantum transient process. Additionally, by using measurement feedback through homodyne detection of the cavity output, we can modulate the steady atomic and photonic states in the non-Markovian process. When multiple coupled cavity-QED systems are involved, measurement-based feedback control can influence the dynamics of high-dimensional quantum states, as well as the resulting stable and unstable subspaces.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of decoherence in a noisy driven environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01375v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the decoherence dynamics of a central spin coupled to a spin chain with a time-dependent noisy magnetic field, focusing on how noise influences the system's decoherence. Our results show that decoherence due to the nonequilibrium critical dynamics of the environment is amplified in the presence of uncorrelated and correlated Gaussian noise. We demonstrate that decoherence factor consistently signals the critical points, and exhibits exponential scaling with the system size, the square of noise intensity, and the noise correlation time at the critical points. We find that strong coupling between the qubit and the environment leads to partial revivals of decoherence, which diminish with increasing noise intensity or decreasing noise correlation time. In contrast, weak coupling leads to monotonic enhanced decoherence. The numerical results illustrate that, the revivals decay and scale exponentially with noise intensity. Moreover, the revivals increase and indicate linear or power law scaling with noise correlation time depends on how the correlated noise is fast or slow. Additionally, we explore the non-Markovianity of the dynamics, finding that it decays in the presence of noise but increases as the noise correlation time grows.</description>

      <title>Effects of phase-gradient on the nonadiabatic dynamics and photon-phonon conversion in one-dimensional array of optomechanical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18447v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Manipulation of photonic and phononic coupling in the coupled cavities plays a crucial role in the development of nonreciprocal devices and photon-phonon conversion. Here, we theoretically investigate how the phase gradient of a driving laser affects the coupling between photonic and phononic modes. This, in turn, affects and offers the controllability of the nonadiabatic dynamics of the population of hybrid eigenmodes following a sudden change in the optomechanical coupling. We show that the controllable nonadiabatic dynamics can be attributed to the phase-induced alteration of the bandgaps in the hybrid eigenmodes. We further demonstrate that the phase-assisted control of the relative weight of photonic and phononic modes in the hybrid eigenmodes also contributes to the nonadiabatic dynamics. Finally, we investigate the effects of phase on the coherent conversion of photon-phonon in a finite-size array.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a polynomial-time algorithm for preparing the Gibbs state of the two-dimensional toric code Hamiltonian at any temperature, starting from any initial condition, significantly improving upon prior estimates that suggested exponential scaling with inverse temperature. Our approach combines the Lindblad dynamics using a local Davies generator with simple global jump operators to enable efficient transitions between logical sectors. Our proof also shows that the Lindblad dynamics with a digitally implemented low-temperature local Davies generator is able to efficiently drive the quantum state towards the ground state manifold.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient Quantum State Tomography for Structured Quantum States in One Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While quantum state tomography (QST) remains the gold standard for benchmarking and verifying quantum devices, it requires an exponentially large number of measurements and classical computational resources for generic quantum many-body systems, making it impractical even for intermediate-size quantum devices. Fortunately, many physical quantum states often exhibit certain low-dimensional structures that enable the development of efficient QST. A notable example is the class of states represented by matrix product operators (MPOs) with a finite matrix/bond dimension, which include most physical states in one dimension and where the number of independent parameters describing the states only grows linearly with the number of qubits. Whether a sample efficient quantum state tomography protocol, where the number of required state copies scales only linearly as the number of parameters describing the state, exists for a generic MPO state still remains an important open question.
  In this paper, we answer this fundamental question affirmatively by using a class of informationally complete positive operator-valued measures (IC-POVMs) -- including symmetric IC-POVMs (SIC-POVMs) and spherical $t$-designs -- focusing on sample complexity while not accounting for the implementation complexity of the measurement settings. For SIC-POVMs and (approximate) spherical 2-designs, we show that the number of state copies to guarantee bounded recovery error of an MPO state with a constrained least-squares estimator depends on the probability distribution of the MPO under the POVM but scales only linearly with $n$ when the distribution is approximately uniform. For spherical $t$-designs with $t\geq 3$, we prove that only a number of state copies proportional to the number of independent parameters in the MPO is sufficient for a guaranteed recovery of any state represented by an MPO.</description>

      <title>Efficient self-consistent learning of gate set Pauli noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding quantum noise is an essential step towards building practical quantum information processing systems. Pauli noise is a useful model that has been widely applied in quantum benchmarking, error mitigation, and error correction. Despite intensive study, most existing works focus on learning Pauli noise channels associated with some specific gates rather than treating the gate set as a whole. A learning algorithm that is self-consistent, complete, and efficient at the same time is yet to be established. In this work, we study the task of gate set Pauli noise learning, where a set of quantum gates, state preparation, and measurements all suffer from unknown Pauli noise channels with a customized noise ansatz. Using tools from algebraic graph theory, we analytically characterize the self-consistently learnable degrees of freedom for Pauli noise models with arbitrary linear ansatz, and design experiments to efficiently learn all the learnable information. Specifically, we show that all learnable information about the gate noise can be learned to relative precision, under mild assumptions on the noise ansatz. We then demonstrate the flexibility of our theory by applying it to concrete physically motivated ansatzs (such as spatially local or quasi-local noise) and experimentally relevant gate sets (such as parallel CZ gates). These results not only enhance the theoretical understanding of quantum noise learning, but also provide a feasible recipe for characterizing existing and near-future quantum information processing devices.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Data Poisoning Attacks on Quantum Machine Learning in the NISQ Era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the growing interest in Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and the increasing availability of quantum computers through cloud providers, addressing the potential security risks associated with QML has become an urgent priority. One key concern in the QML domain is the threat of data poisoning attacks in the current quantum cloud setting. Adversarial access to training data could severely compromise the integrity and availability of QML models. Classical data poisoning techniques require significant knowledge and training to generate poisoned data, and lack noise resilience, making them ineffective for QML models in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. In this work, we first propose a simple yet effective technique to measure intra-class encoder state similarity (ESS) by analyzing the outputs of encoding circuits. Leveraging this approach, we introduce a \underline{Qu}antum \underline{I}ndiscriminate \underline{D}ata Poisoning attack, QUID. Through extensive experiments conducted in both noiseless and noisy environments (e.g., IBM\_Brisbane's noise), across various architectures and datasets, QUID achieves up to $92\%$ accuracy degradation in model performance compared to baseline models and up to $75\%$ accuracy degradation compared to random label-flipping. We also tested QUID against state-of-the-art classical defenses, with accuracy degradation still exceeding $50\%$, demonstrating its effectiveness. This work represents the first attempt to reevaluate data poisoning attacks in the context of QML.</description>

      <title>Can Schroedingerist Wavefunction Physics Explain Brownian Motion? III: A One-Dimensional Heavy and Light Particles Model Exhibiting Brownian-Motion-Like Trajectories and Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08764v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two prior papers of this series, it was proposed that a wavefunction model of a heavy particle and a collection of light particles might generate ``Brownian-Motion-Like" trajectories as well as diffusive motion (displacement proportional to the square-root of time) of the heavy particle, but did not exhibit a concrete instance. Here we introduce a one-space-dimensional model which, granted a finite perturbation series, fulfills the criteria for BML trajectories and diffusion. We note that Planck's constant and the molecular mass of light particles make an appearance in the diffusion coefficient, which further differentiates the present theory from the work of Poincar{\'e} and Einstein in the previous century.</description>

      <title>Aspects of Complexity in Quantum Evolutions on the Bloch Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We enhance our quantitative comprehension of the complexity associated with both time-optimal and time sub-optimal quantum Hamiltonian evolutions that connect arbitrary source and target states on the Bloch sphere, as recently presented in Nucl. Phys. B1010, 116755 (2025). Initially, we examine each unitary Schrodinger quantum evolution selected through various metrics, such as path length, geodesic efficiency, speed efficiency, and the curvature coefficient of the corresponding quantum-mechanical trajectory that connects the source state to the target state on the Bloch sphere. Subsequently, we evaluate the selected evolutions using our proposed measure of complexity, as well as in relation to the concept of complexity length scale. The choice of both time-optimal and time sub-optimal evolutions, along with the selection of source and target states, enables us to conduct pertinent sanity checks that seek to validate the physical relevance of the framework supporting our proposed complexity measure. Our research suggests that, in general, efficient quantum evolutions possess a lower complexity than their inefficient counterparts. However, it is important to recognize that complexity is not solely determined by length; in fact, longer trajectories that are adequately curved may exhibit a complexity that is less than or equal to that of shorter trajectories with a lower curvature coefficient.</description>

Abstract: Genovese and Piacentini [Phys.Rev.A 111, 022204 (2025)] claim that in a recent experiment[S.Virz\`i et al., Quantum Sci. Technol. 9, 045027 (2024)] the Bell parameter was measured on a single pair of photons thus it challenges several conclusions and discussions on the meaning of Bell inequalities as well as certain QM interpretations. We explain that the parameter measured in Virzi et al. experiment it is not the Bell parameter S which was discussed and estimated in many loophole free tests. Therefore, this experiment neither challenges our understanding of Bell Tests nor allows having doubts about Bohr complementarity and contextuality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Encoding quantum information in a quantum error correction (QEC) code offers protection against decoherence and enhances the fidelity of qubits and gate operations. One of the fundamental challenges of QEC is to construct codes with asymptotically good parameters, i.e. a non-vanishing rate and relative minimum distance. Such codes provide compact quantum memory with low overhead and enhanced error correcting capabilities, compared to state-of-the-art topological error correction codes such as the surface or colour codes. Recently, bivariate bicycle (BB) codes have emerged as a promising candidate for such compact memory, though the exact tradeoff of the code parameters $[[n,k,d]]$ remained unknown. In this Article, we explore these codes by leveraging their ring structure, and predict their dimension as well as conditions on their existence. Finally, we highlight asymptotic badness. Though this excludes this subclass of codes from the search towards practical good low-density parity check (LDPC) codes, it does not affect the utility of the moderately long codes that are known, which can already be used to experimentally demonstrate better QEC beyond the surface code.</description>

Abstract: Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Target model in this study is an extended version of the cluster model in one dimension with $Z_2\otimes Z_2$ symmetry, and we investigate effects of decoherence applied to the ground state of the model, focusing on the symmetry aspect. By using a scheme that we propose, a strong symmetry protected topological (SPT) mixed state and double average SPT (ASPT) state are constructed through the pure gapless SPT order and the domain-wall duality. Among them, the double ASPT is categorized by coexisting orders, i.e., a strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking and ASPT defined by the remaining weak and strong symmetries. We make use of the doubled Hilbert space formalism for the construction scheme. We numerically demonstrate the emergence of the two mixed SPT states and find that a phase transition occurs between them tuned by the strength of decoherence. Finally, we discuss the coexistence of SPT and SWSSB in the double SPT state from the view point of symmetrically invertible property, and comment on the classification of ASPT proposed recently. Suitable multiple-decoherence channel applied to SPT states gives a broad possibility to induce rich ASPTs, possessing non-trivial internal entanglement properties from the view of doubled Hilbert space formalism.</description>

      <title>QEA: An Accelerator for Quantum Circuit Simulation with Resources Efficiency and Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The area of quantum circuit simulation has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. However, due to the exponentially increasing computational costs, assessing and validating these models on large datasets poses significant obstacles. Despite plenty of research in quantum simulation, issues such as memory management, system adaptability, and execution efficiency remain unresolved. In this study, we introduce QEA, a state vector-based hardware accelerator that overcomes these difficulties with four key improvements: optimized memory allocation management, open PE, flexible ALU, and simplified CX swapper. To evaluate QEA's capabilities, we implemented and evaluated it on the AMD Alveo U280 board, which uses only 0.534 W of power. Experimental results show that QEA is extremely flexible, supporting a wide range of quantum circuits, has excellent fidelity, making it appropriate for standard quantum emulators, and outperforms powerful CPUs and related works up to 153.16x better in terms of normalized gate speed. This study has considerable potential as a useful approach for quantum emulators in future works.</description>

      <title>A quantum algorithm for estimating the determinant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for estimating the matrix determinant based on quantum spectral sampling. The algorithm estimates the logarithm of the determinant of an $n \times n$ positive sparse matrix to an accuracy $\epsilon$ in time ${\cal O}(\log n/\epsilon^3)$, exponentially faster than previously existing classical or quantum algorithms that scale linearly in $n$. The quantum spectral sampling algorithm generalizes to estimating any quantity $\sum_j f(\lambda_j)$, where $\lambda_j$ are the matrix eigenvalues. For example, the algorithm allows the efficient estimation of the partition function $Z(\beta) =\sum_j e^{-\beta E_j}$ of a Hamiltonian system with energy eigenvalues $E_j$, and of the entropy $ S =-\sum_j p_j \log p_j$ of a density matrix with eigenvalues $p_j$.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting circuits comprising Josephson junctions have spurred significant research activity due to their promise to realize scalable quantum computers. Effective Hamiltonians for these systems have traditionally been derived assuming the junction connects superconducting islands of infinite size. We derive a quantized Hamiltonian for a Josephson junction between finite-sized islands and predict measurable corrections to the qubit frequency and charge susceptibility to test the theory.</description>

      <title>A Family of Self-Dual Quasicrystals with Critical Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for constructing self-dual one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice models with arbitrary-range hoppings and multifractal behaviors. Our framework generates a broad spectrum of quasicrystals, ranging from the off-diagonal Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper models on one end, to those with long-range power-law hoppings on another. Focusing on models with off-diagonal quasiperiodic hoppings with power-law decay, we exploit the fact that, when the self-dual condition is satisfied, the system must be in the critical state with multifractal properties. This enables the engineering of models with competing extended, critical, and localized phases, with rich mobility edges in between. As an outstanding example, we show that a limiting case of our family of self-dual quasicrystals can be implemented using Rydberg-atom arrays. Our work offers a systematic route toward self-duality and critical phases, and would facilitate their experimental simulation.</description>

      <title>SPARO: Surface-code Pauli-based Architectural Resource Optimization for Fault-tolerant Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface codes represent a leading approach for quantum error correction (QEC), offering a path towards universal fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). However, efficiently implementing algorithms, particularly using Pauli-based computation (PBC) with lattice surgery, necessitates careful resource optimization. Prior work often employs static layouts and simplified error models. These typically fail to capture the full costs and dynamic nature of active computation, leading to resource bottlenecks and suboptimal architectural designs. To address this, we introduce SPARO. SPARO features a comprehensive logical error model based on a large corpus of numerical simulations encompassing active Pauli-based computation (PBC) operations-including Pauli product measurements (PPMs), idling qubits, and patch rotations. Our numerical models are integrated within an end-to-end compilation pipeline. SPARO analyzes algorithm-specific bottlenecks arising from constraints such as limited routing areas or magic-state factory throughput. SPARO then dynamically allocates available hardware resources, balancing compute, routing, and magic-state distillation, to minimize space-time overhead and logical error rates for specific workloads. Our simulations demonstrate that SPARO effectively identifies critical resource trade-offs. When evaluated on benchmark circuits, SPARO identifies resource configurations achieving up to 51.11% logical error rate reductions for 433-qubit ADDER circuits when compared to state-of-the-art static layouts using an identical total resource budget. This dynamic approach enables effective co-optimization of PBC execution and surface-code architectures, significantly improving overall resource efficiency. SPARO will be open sourced.</description>

Abstract: In these notes we will give an overview and road map for a definition and characterization of (relative) entropy for both classical and quantum systems. In other words, we will provide a consistent treatment of entropy which can be applied within the recently developed Orlicz space based approach to large systems. This means that the proposed approach successfully provides a refined framework for the treatment of entropy in each of classical statistical physics, Dirac's formalism of Quantum Mechanics, large systems of quantum statistical physics, and finally also for Quantum Field Theory.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic phases in first detected return times of quantum many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05585v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the probability distribution of the first return time to the initial state of a quantum many-body system subject to global projective measurements at stroboscopic times. We show that this distribution can be mapped to a continuation of the canonical partition function of a classical spin chain with noninteracting domains at equilibrium, which is entirely characterized by the Loschmidt amplitude of the quantum many-body system. This allows us to conclude that this probability may decay either algebraically or exponentially at long times, depending on whether the spin chain displays a ferromagnetic or a paramagnetic phase. We illustrate this idea on the example of the return time of $N$ adjacent fermions in a tight-binding model, revealing a rich phase behavior, which can be tuned by scaling the probing time as a function of $N$. The analysis presented here provides an overarching understanding of many-body quantum first-detection problems in terms of equilibrium thermodynamic phases. Our theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with exact numerical computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A general framework for analyzing the topology of quantum channels of single-particle systems is developed to find a class of genuinely dynamical topological phases that can be realized by means of discrete quantum feedback control. We provide a symmetry classification of quantum channels by identifying ten symmetry classes of discrete quantum feedback control with projective measurements. We construct various types of topological feedback control by using topological Maxwell demons that achieve robust feedback-controlled chiral or helical transport against noise and decoherence. Topological feedback control thus offers a versatile tool for creating and controlling nonequilibrium topological phases in open quantum systems that are distinct from non-Hermitian and Lindbladian systems and should provide a guiding principle for topology-based design of quantum feedback control.</description>

Abstract: The non-equilibrium Green's function gives access to one-body observables for quantum systems. Of particular interest are quantities such as density, currents, and absorption spectra which are important for interpreting experimental results in quantum transport and spectroscopy. We present an integration scheme for the Green's function's equations of motion, the Kadanoff-Baym equations (KBE), which is both adaptive in the time integrator step size and method order as well as the history integration order. We analyze the importance of solving the KBE self-consistently and show that adapting the order of history integral evaluation is important for obtaining accurate results. To examine the efficiency of our method, we compare runtimes to a state of the art fixed time step integrator for several test systems and show an order of magnitude speedup at similar levels of accuracy.</description>

Abstract: Time crystalline structures can be created in periodically driven systems. They are temporal lattices which can reveal different condensed matter behaviours ranging from Anderson localization in time to temporal analogues of many-body localization or topological insulators. However, the potential practical applications of time crystalline structures have yet to be explored. Here, we pave the way for time-tronics where temporal lattices are like printed circuit boards for realization of a broad range of quantum devices. The elements of these devices can correspond to structures of dimensions higher than three and can be arbitrarily connected and reconfigured at any moment. Moreover, our approach allows for the construction of a quantum computer, enabling quantum gate operations for all possible pairs of qubits. Our findings indicate that the limitations faced in building devices using conventional spatial crystals can be overcome by adopting crystalline structures in time.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we examine the quantization of Hall conductance in an infinite plane geometry. We consider a microscopic charge-conserving system with a pure, gapped infinite-volume ground state. While Hall conductance is well-defined in this scenario, existing proofs of its quantization have relied on assumptions of either weak interactions, or properties of finite volume ground state spaces, or invertibility. Here, we assume that the conditions necessary to construct the braided $C^*$-tensor category which describes anyonic excitations are satisfied, and we demonstrate that the Hall conductance is rational if the tensor category is finite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dipolar supersolids--quantum states that are simultaneously superfluid and solid--have had their superfluid nature rigorously tested, while its solid nature remains uncharted. Arguably, the defining characteristic of a solid is the existence of elastic shear waves. In this work, we investigate transverse wave packet propagation in dipolar supersolids with triangular and honeycomb structure. Remarkably, the honeycomb supersolid displays anomalous dispersion, supporting waves traveling faster than the transverse speed of sound: a supersonic shear wave. While the distinction between anomalous and normal dispersion appears subtle, it has a profound influence on both the transport and scattering properties. For both supersolid phases, we calculate the shear modulus, a key parameter that quantifies the material's rigidity. Our findings are pertinent to current experimental efforts scrutinizing the fundamental properties of supersolids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a relativistic framework of integral quantization applied to the motion of spinless particles in the four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The proposed scheme is based on coherent states generated by the action of the Heisenberg-Weyl group and has been motivated by the Hamiltonian description of the geodesic motion in General Relativity. We believe that this formulation should also allow for a generalization to the motion of test particles in curved spacetimes. A key element in our construction is the use of suitably defined positive operator-valued measures. We show that this approach can be used to quantize the one-dimensional nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator, recovering the standard Hamiltonian as obtained by the canonical quantization. A direct application of our model, including a computation of transition amplitudes between states characterized by fixed positions and momenta, is postponed to a forthcoming article.</description>

Abstract: The interplay between unitary dynamics and quantum measurements induces diverse phenomena in open quantum systems with no counterparts in closed quantum systems at equilibrium. Here, we generally classify Kraus operators and their effective non-Hermitian dynamical generators, thereby establishing the tenfold classification for symmetry and topology of monitored free fermions. Our classification elucidates the role of topology in measurement-induced phase transitions and identifies potential topological terms in the corresponding nonlinear sigma models. Furthermore, we establish the bulk-boundary correspondence in monitored quantum dynamics: nontrivial topology in spacetime manifests itself as topologically nontrivial steady states and gapless boundary states in Lyapunov spectra, such as Lyapunov zero modes and chiral edge modes, leading to the topologically protected slowdown of dynamical purification.</description>

      <title>Genuine multi-entropy and holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Is bipartite entanglement sufficient for holography? Through the analysis of the Markov gap, it is known that the answer is no. In this paper, we give a new perspective on this issue from a different angle using a multi-entropy. We define a genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy from a $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy by subtracting appropriate linear combinations of $\mathtt{\tilde{q}}$-partite multi-entropies for $\mathtt{\tilde{q}} &lt; \mathtt{q}$, in such a way that the genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy vanishes for all $\mathtt{\tilde{q}}$-partite entangled states. After studying several aspects, we apply it to black holes and holography. For the application to black holes, we see that such a genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy is important only after the Page time. For the application to holography, we prove that non-bipartite multi-entropies are always positive and $\mathcal{O}\left({1/ G_N}\right)$, as long as boundary subregions are connected. This indicates that for holography, genuine multi-partite entanglement is not small and plays an important role.</description>

      <title>Two-component atomic Fermi superfluid with spin-orbital coupling in thin spherical-shell geometry</title>

Abstract: We present a theory of two-component atomic Fermi superfluid with tunable pairing interaction in a thin spherical shell subject to spin-orbit coupling (SOC). By incorporating SOC into the Fermi superfluid in the BCS-Bose Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover, we obtain the energy spectrum and equations of state. While the order parameter and chemical potential are suppressed by SOC on the BCS side, the former remains positive but the latter may be pushed to negative values by SOC. Meanwhile, the compressibility exhibits kinks as the pairing interaction or SOC varies, indicating singular behavior of higher-derivatives of the free energy despite the presence of the superfluid order parameter. The minimum of the energy dispersion indicates a decoupling of the energy gap from the order parameter, and the compressibility kinks occur when the energy gap approaches zero. We found the particle-hole mixing in the Fermi superfluid essential for the compressibility kinks since a Fermi gas with the same SOC but no pairing interaction only exhibits complicated dispersions but no singular behavior. Therefore, our results show that a combination of superfluid, SOC, and geometry can lead to interesting phenomena. We also discuss possible experimental realizations and implications.</description>

      <title>Hopf Exceptional Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points at which eigenvalues and eigenvectors of non-Hermitian matrices coalesce are ubiquitous in the description of a wide range of platforms from photonic or mechanical metamaterials to open quantum systems. Here, we introduce a class of Hopf exceptional points (HEPs) that are protected by the Hopf invariants (including the higher-dimensional generalizations) and which exhibit phenomenology sharply distinct from conventional exceptional points. Saliently, owing to their $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant related to the Witten anomaly, three-fold HEPs and symmetry-protected five-fold HEPs act as their own ``antiparticles". Furthermore, based on higher homotopy groups of spheres, we predict the existence of multifold HEPs and symmetry-protected HEPs with non-Hermitian topology captured by a range of finite groups (such as $\mathbb{Z}_3$, $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, or $\mathbb{Z}_{24}$) beyond the periodic table of Bernard-LeClair symmetry classes.</description>
