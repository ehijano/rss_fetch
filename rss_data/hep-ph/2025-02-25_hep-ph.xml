      <title>Comment on "QCD factorization with multihadron fragmentation functions"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make several comments on the recent work in Ref.~\cite{Rogers:2024nhb} while also reaffirming and adding to the work in Ref.~\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx}. We show that the factorization formula for $e^+e^-\to (h_1\cdots h_n)\, X$ in Ref.~\cite{Rogers:2024nhb} is equivalent to a version one can derive using the definition of a $n$-hadron fragmentation function (FF) introduced in Ref.~\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx}. In addition, we scrutinize how to generalize the number density definition of a single-hadron FF to a $n$-hadron FF, arguing that the definition given in Ref.~\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx} should be considered the standard one. We also emphasize that the evolution equations for dihadron FFs~(DiFFs) in Ref.~\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx} have the same splitting functions as those for single-hadron FFs. Therefore, the DiFF (and $n$-hadron FF) definitions in Ref.~\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx} have a natural number density interpretation and are consistent with collinear factorization using the standard hard factors and evolution kernels. Moreover, we make clear that the operator definition for the DiFF $D_1^{h_1h_2}(\xi,M_h)$ written down in Ref.~\cite{Rogers:2024nhb} agrees exactly with the one in Ref.~\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx}. Contrary to what is implied in Ref.~\cite{Rogers:2024nhb}, this definition did not appear in the literature prior to the work in Ref.~\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx}. There also seem to be inconsistencies in how $D_1^{h_1h_2}(\xi,M_h)$ appears in previous unpolarized cross section formulas in the literature.</description>

      <title>Ultralight Dark Matter Statistics for Pulsar Timing Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuations in ultralight dark matter produce significant metric perturbations, which may be detected by monitoring the arrival times of light from millisecond pulsars. While searches using this technique are already underway, they do not consistently account for the statistical properties of the dark matter field. The statistics of this field depend on the velocity dispersion of dark matter and, consequently, its coherence length. In the mass range relevant for pulsar timing arrays, the coherence length is comparable to separations between pulsars, making it crucial to incorporate its effects into the analysis. This work presents a consistent statistical method for gravitational direct detection of ultralight dark matter. Our key result is the derivation of the two-point function of the metric fluctuations, which we apply to pulsar timing and discuss its implementation in future searches.</description>

      <title>Functional Determinants for False Vacuum Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive simple expressions to regularise functional determinants from fluctuations of fields with spin 0, 1/2, and 1. These are important for the precise dimensionful determination of false vacuum decay rates. We work in $D = 4$ Euclidean dimensions and use familiar Feynman diagrammatic techniques with a double expansion in interactions and masses, together with dimensional regularisation in momentum space. We Fourier transform to coordinate space and end up with a simple prescription in terms of single integrals over the Euclidean radius of field-dependent masses and their derivatives. Our results apply to models with an arbitrary scalar potential and with any number of scalars, fermions, gauge bosons and associated ghosts. We exemplify this approach on the Standard Model with a streamlined derivation of fluctuation determinants.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Corrections to Quark TMDPDFs in the Background-Field Method: Gauge Invariance, Equations of Motion, and Multiple Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the perturbative corrections in the strong coupling to the unpolarized quark transverse-momentum dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) operator within a background-field framework, extending the approach of Ref. [1]. We focus on ensuring gauge invariance, identifying two key components needed: a gauge-invariant TMDPDF operator with a transverse gauge link at spatial infinity, and accounting of the equations of motion (EoM) of the background fields. We go beyond next-to-leading order in strong coupling expansion, considering multiple interactions with the background field at all orders of strong coupling. By examining the interplay between quark and gluon contributions, we show that spurious singularities, proportional to EoM, can be misinterpreted as genuine divergences in QCD factorization unless properly identified and removed.</description>

      <title>Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states in color superconducting quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-density region of the QCD phase diagram displays an intricate competition between color superconductivity and the QCD Kondo effect due to color exchange in quark matter containing a single heavy quark impurity. We explore the characteristic impurity-induced superconducting subgap states arising in such systems by generalizing the surrogate model solver, recently considered in the context of condensed matter physics [Phys. Rev. B 108, L220506 (2023)]. The method consists of approximating the full superconducting bulk by only a small number of effective levels whose parameters are chosen so as to best reproduce the Matsubara frequency dependence of the impurity-bulk hybridization function. We numerically solve a surrogate QCD Kondo model describing a quantum impurity color-exchange coupled to a two-color two-flavor superconducting bulk. The results directly indicate the presence of multiple phase transitions as the coupling of the impurity to the bulk is increased, due to the interplay between various overscreened states. The methods introduced here are straightforward enough to be extended to more realistic QCD scenarios.</description>

      <title>Flavor-changing axions and Dirac neutrino masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implementing the axion concept in the context of 3-3-1 extensions of the Standard Model (SM) leads to richer properties than in the simpler axion setups, and related to the Dirac neutrino seesaw mechanism. In this way the smallness of neutrino masses, the strong CP problem, the nature of dark matter and the number of families all have a common origin. Besides having an enhanced coupling to photons, our revamped axion can also be distinguished from DFSZ and KSVZ axions through its couplings to fermions. The latter lead to interesting phenomenological consequences, including flavor-changing axion-emitting two-body K, B and D meson decays.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the $X(2370)$ and $X(2600)$ as light tetraquark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the states $X(2370)$ and $X(2600)$ reported by the BESIII Collaboration, we systematically investigate the mass spectra of light compact tetraquark states with configurations $ud\bar{u}\bar{d}$, $us\bar{u}\bar{s}$, and $ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$ in the $J^{PC}=0^{-+}$ and $2^{-+}$ channels using the QCD sum rules approach. To effectively describe these tetraquark states, we construct appropriate interpolating tetraquark currents featuring three Lorentz indices while avoiding derivative operators. Through meticulous calculations of correlation functions up to dimension 10 condensates, we extract the mass spectra for both $0^{-+}$ and $2^{-+}$ states by employing the projection operator technique. Our results indicate that the masses of light tetraquarks span $1.5-2.5~\text{GeV}$ for $0^{-+}$ states and $2.4-2.7~\text{GeV}$ for $2^{-+}$ states. Notably, our analysis suggests that the $X(2370)$ state could be interpreted as a $0^{-+}$ $us\bar{u}\bar{s}$ or $ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$ tetraquark state, while the $X(2600)$ state is likely to be a $2^{-+}$ $us\bar{u}\bar{s}$ tetraquark. These intriguing findings warrant further detailed investigation in future studies to better understand the nature of these states.</description>

      <title>Calculating the EFT likelihood via saddle-point expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the functional approach for calculating the EFT likelihood by applying the saddle-point expansion. We demonstrate that, after suitable reformulation, the likelihood expression is consistent with the path integral required to be computed in the theory of false vacuum decay. In contrast to the saddle-point approximation, the application of the saddle-point expansion necessitates more nuanced considerations, particularly concerning the treatment of the negative eigenvalues of the second derivative of the action at the saddle point. We illustrate that a similar issue arises in the likelihood calculation, which requires approximating the original integral contour through the combination of the steepest descent contours in the field space. Gaussian distribution as a working example, we then concentrate on the calculation of the EFT likelihood and propose a general procedure for computing the likelihood via saddle-point expansion method for arbitrary partition functions. Precise computation of the likelihood will benefit Bayesian forward modeling, thereby enabling more reliable theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Realization of electroweak baryogenesis by fourth generation fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the electroweak baryogenesis can be realized in the extended Standard Model with sequential fourth generation fermions (SM4). The solution to the coupled Dyson-Schwinger equations for the fermion and Higgs masses indicates that fourth generation quarks $t'$ and $b'$ with the Yukawa couplings above the threshold $g_Q^c\approx 9.1$ form condensates. This critical coupling, greater than the value $g_Y^f\approx 7$ at the ultraviolet fixed point of the renormalization-group evolution in the SM4, implies the existence of an electroweak symmetric phase at a high energy. The $t'$ and $b'$ Yukawa couplings evolve as the energy decreases, and exceed $g_Q^c$ at a lower scale. The Higgs potential with the dynamical symmetry breaking effect from heavy quark condensates, the one-loop correction from the heavy scalars formed by $t'$ and $b'$ quarks and the temperature-dependent contribution from fourth generation leptons allow the first-order phase transition characterized by the ratio $\phi_c/T_c\approx 0.9$, where $\phi_c$ is the location of the Higgs potential minimum at the critical temperature $T_c$. Together with the baryon number violating sphaleron interaction inherent in the Standard Model and the enhanced $CP$ violation source from fourth generation quarks, the baryon asymmetry in the Universe can be achieved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review, we discuss the current understanding of charged current (anti)neutrino scattering off nucleons and nuclear targets in the few-GeV energy range, a domain of paramount importance for accelerator and atmospheric neutrino experiments. We provide a concise yet comprehensive overview of the experimental and theoretical landscape of neutrino interaction processes across the kinematic region of the shallow and deep inelastic scattering regimes. Moreover, we underscore the pressing unresolved questions and formidable challenges that lie ahead, stressing the urgent need for more refined theoretical models and high-precision measurements to deepen our understanding of neutrino-nucleon and neutrino-nucleus interaction cross sections.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{T}$, $\mathcal{P}$-odd electron-nucleon interaction via a Higgs-boson exchange at the quark-gluon level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electron pseudoscalar -- nucleon scalar $\mathcal{T}$,~$\mathcal{P}$-odd interaction within the framework of the Standard Model is considered as an exchange mediated by the Higgs boson at the quark-gluon level. $\mathcal{CP}$ violation is introduced through a phase factor in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix, which characterizes the flavor structure of the quark loop. We explicitly demonstrate that the total three-loop contribution vanishes for the Higgs boson exchange mechanism. A nonzero contribution appears at the four-loop quark-gluon level only with the insertion of an additional gluon line between the quarks. The estimate of the $\mathcal{CP}$-odd electron-nucleon interaction coupling constant after reduction of divergencies of the quark loop integral using the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) mechanism yields a value $ \sim10^{-28}$. The final result, expressed in terms of the equivalent electron electric dipole moment ($e$EDM), is $10^{-48} \,\, e\text{cm}$, and its order of magnitude coincides with that of the GIM estimate of the $e$EDM at the quark-gluon level. Our parametric estimate of the $e$EDM differs from previous studies by a factor that depends on the mass of the $b$ quark.</description>

      <title>Influence of dark matter on the structure of strange quark stars in one-fluid model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16317v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the influence of scalar dark matter on the structural properties of strange quark stars (SQS) within a one-fluid framework, considering Yukawa interactions between dark matter and quark matter. Contributions from perturbative QCD, Yukawa interaction between scalar dark matter and quarks, and Bose-Einstein condensation of dark matter are included in the model. We first determine the allowable range of Yukawa interaction coupling by imposing the stability condition for strange quark matter (SQM). Using this range, we derive the equation of state (EOS) for different fractions of dark matter within the total pressure of SQS. These fractions are constrained by the tidal deformability limit from GW170817. The presence of dark matter alters the EOS, leading to changes in the mass-radius relationship, tidal deformability, and stability of SQS. We demonstrate that increasing the mass of dark matter softens the EOS, whereas higher fractions of dark matter lead to stiffer EOSs. We also explore the reasons behind this behavior. Our EOSs not only describe massive objects, such as PSR J0952-0607 and PSR J2215+5135, but also satisfy the tidal deformability constraint from GW170817. These results reveal that incorporating dark matter modifies the EOS, enabling the support of higher stellar masses while maintaining consistency with observational data.</description>

      <title>Ultra fast, event-by-event heavy-ion simulations for next generation experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel deep generative framework that uses probabilistic diffusion models for ultra fast, event-by-event simulations of heavy-ion collision output. This new framework is trained on UrQMD cascade data to generate a full collision event output containing 26 distinct hadron species. The output is represented as a point cloud, where each point is defined by a particle's momentum vector and its corresponding species information (ID). Our architecture integrates a normalizing flow-based condition generator that encodes global event features into a latent vector, and a diffusion model that synthesizes a point cloud of particles based on this condition. A detailed description of the model and an in-depth analysis of its performance is provided. The conditional point cloud diffusion model learns to generate realistic output particles of collision events which successfully reproduce the UrQMD distributions for multiplicity, momentum and rapidity of each hadron type. The flexible point cloud representation of the event output preserves full event-level granularity, enabling direct application to inverse problems and parameter estimation tasks while also making it easily adaptable for accelerating any event-by-event model calculation or detector simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In part I: We find a series physical scales such as 1) Planck scale, 2) Minimal approximate grand unification SU(5), 3) the mass scale of the see saw model right handed or Majorana neutrinoes, some invented scale with many scalar bosons, etc., and get the logarithms of these energy scales fitted by a quantity q related to the dimensions of to thescales related dimensionalities of coefficients in Lagrangian densities,or some generalization of this q to something similar in the variouscases of the scales. The logarithm of the energies behave as a straight line versus the dimension related number q. This is being explained by an ontologically existing lattice, which fluctuates in lattice canstant a from place to place in space time or more precisely, it fluctuates quantum mechanically. In Part II: We find a fitting of the three fine structure constantsin the Standard Model by means of a no-susy and SU(5)-like - but only accurately SU(5) symmetric in the classical approximation - by means of three other parameters for each of which, however, we have speculative predictions: Quantum corrections due to the lattice whichare three times as large as naive quantum corrections, because the lattice is supposed to lie in layers, one layer for each fermion-family; criticallity of the unified coupling, using the satnadrd model group S(U (2) x U (3)); the unification scale is fitted inot the scale-system of part I</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new particle-trajectory detector composed of Josephson junctions, named the superconducting cloud chamber. By measuring the quantum phase difference, this device can detect charged particles with extremely low kinetic energy, providing a new method for detecting slow-moving particles. It can also be utilized to detect millicharged dark matter particles thermalized with the Earth's environment within the mass range of $10^5\sim 10^{10}\,$GeV.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter from quasi-de Sitter Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming that (1) the universe underwent a post-inflationary accelerated expansion phase driven by a fluid with equation of state $P=w\rho$ and $-1&lt;w&lt;-1/3$, that (2) the cosmic horizon in an accelerating, quasi-de Sitter universe has a temperature inversely proportional to the proper size of the horizon, and that (3) we are static observers, we calculate the frozen-in density of a stable particle of mass $m$ produced by the cosmic horizon that does not undergo any number-changing processes in the late universe. We find that, as a function of the equation of state and the temperature when radiation domination starts and the quasi-de Sitter phase ends, the mass of the dark matter producing the observed cosmological abundance via this mechanism ranges from 10 keV up to close to the Planck scale.</description>

      <title>Dark Baryon Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a novel mechanism for dark matter production through the formation of light black holes from the collapse of dark baryons in confining SU(N) gauge theories in the large $N$ limit. While glueballs and mesons cannot form black holes under physically reasonable conditions, we prove that for appropriate ranges of the confinement scale, quark masses, number of colors $N$, and dark sector temperature, dark baryons can produce Planck-scale black hole relics in the early universe. Assuming the relics are stable, the abundance of both the dark baryon black hole population directly arising at confinement and that frozen in from dark glueball and meson pair annihilation are exponentially suppressed in $N$, leading to an upper limit $N\lesssim 100$ and of a few hundreds Planck units in mass for models where the black hole relics are the entirety of the dark matter. We present a detailed numerical study of the parameter space where this scenario is realized.</description>

      <title>Production of $S$-wave charmonia in the soft gluon resummation approach using the NRQCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the $S-$wave charmonium production at the small transverse momenta in the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) parton model (PM), as it is formulated in the soft gluon resummation (SGR) approach , using the nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics (NRQCD) as the model of the heavy quarkonium hadronization. To extend the scope of the calculation to the phenomenologically important region of intermediate transverse momenta, we use the inverse-error weighting (InEW) matching scheme to combine the TMD PM predictions with the results of the collinear PM (CPM) fixed-order calculations, which are applicable at the large transverse momenta. We predict the direct $\eta_c$ and the prompt $J/\psi$ production cross sections and transverse momentum spectra in proton-proton collisions at the LHC, RHIC, AFTER and NICA energies. Predictions for the polarized $J/\psi$ production processes are also presented.</description>

      <title>The strong coupling constants of doubly heavy baryons with heavy mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the experiment, only one doubly charmed baryon $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ was successfully identified. The LHCb collaboration is poised to discover other doubly heavy baryon, $\Xi_{cc}^{+}$ and $\Xi_{bc}^{+}$, necessitating a comprehensive study of doubly heavy baryons from various perspectives. Such investigations will elucidate the properties of the newly discovered states and facilitate the search for other doubly heavy baryons as predicted in quark model. In this paper, we explore the strong coupling between the doubly heavy baryon, singly heavy baryon, and heavy meson, ${\cal B}_{QQ^{\prime}}{\cal B}_{Q}M_{Q^{\prime}}$, using the light cone QCD sum rules approach. We analytically and numerically calculate the strong coupling, ${\cal B}_{QQ^{\prime}}{\cal B}_{Q}M_{Q^{\prime}}$, utilizing the light-cone distribution amplitudes of the singly heavy baryon ${\cal B}_{Q}$. The numerical predictions for these strong couplings are provided, along with the error analysis. Our theoretical findings can be employed to examine the strong and weak decay dynamics of doubly heavy baryons. Furthermore, our results may offer experimentalists a valuable tool for analyzing data on the strong coupling constants among hadronic multiplets.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the local longitudinal scaling behavior of the dilute Glasma. We gain insight into how the fragmentation region is dominated by the longitudinal structure of one of the two colliding nuclei in heavy-ion collisions and study the effect of the correlation scales of the nuclear color charge distributions. We compare with results from the full dilute Glasma framework and analyze the rapidity limits of the fragmentation region. From our findings, it follows that all scalar observables that can be constructed out of the dilute Glasma field strength tensor show limiting fragmentation behavior and the field strength tensor itself transforms locally via Lorentz boosts when changing the collision energy.</description>

Abstract: Proton-proton collisions are studied in the dilute Glasma framework. Compared to experimental multiplicity distributions, the dilute Glasma underestimates large multiplicity events. We show how event-by-event fluctuations of the saturation momentum Qs can help repair the multiplicity distribution. Furthermore, we discuss a hot spot model for protons and also find improvements in the multiplicity histograms.</description>

      <title>Imprints of an early matter-dominated era arising from dark matter dilution mechanism on cosmic string dynamics and gravitational wave signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of an early matter-dominated era in cosmic history on the dynamics of cosmic strings and the resulting stochastic gravitational waves. Specifically, we examine the case where this era originates from the dark matter dilution mechanism within the framework of the minimal left-right symmetric model. By numerically solving the Boltzmann equations governing the energy densities of the relevant components, we meticulously analyze the modifications to the cosmological scale factor, the number density of cosmic string loops, and the gravitational wave spectrum. Our results reveal that the early matter-dominated era causes a characteristic suppression in the high-frequency regime of the gravitational wave spectrum, providing distinct and testable signatures for future ground-based interferometer experiments.</description>

      <title>Constraining a scalar dark matter component through anomalous stellar light scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent work [Phys. Rev. D 110, 023520 (2024)] a baryogenesis scenario was proposed where our visible Universe is a 3-brane coevolving with a hidden 3-brane in a multidimensional bulk. This model introduced a new pseudo-scalar boson. In the present paper, it is shown that this boson can exist today as a relic from the Big Bang and constitute a minor dark matter component. Additionally, one identifies a one-loop process that allows for a non-zero, albeit very small, photon-boson scattering amplitude. One explores this phenomenon and suggests that observations of a subtle light scattering around blue giant stars could constrain the properties of the scalar boson. These constraints would, in turn, provide valuable insights into the parameters of the proposed baryogenesis model.</description>

      <title>Proton spin from small-$x$ with constraints from the valence quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the valence quark model recently calculated for polarized proton to constrain the non-perturbative initial condition for the small-$x$ helicity evolution. The remaining free parameters are constrained by performing a global analysis to the available polarized small-$x$ deep inelastic scattering data. A good description of the world data is obtained with only 8 free parameters. The model parameters are tightly constrained by the data, allowing us to predict the proton polarized structure function $g_1^p$ to be negative at small $x$. Furthermore, we obtain the small-$x$ quark and gluon spins to give a contribution $\int_{10^{-5}}^{0.1} dx \left( \frac{1}{2}\Delta\Sigma + \Delta G \right) = 0.76 \pm 0.13$ or $1.70\pm 0.20$ to the proton spin, depending on the applied running coupling prescription.</description>

      <title>Probing a Quarkophobic ${\mathbf{W}}^\prime$ at the High-Luminosity LHC via Vector Boson Fusion and Lorentz-Equivariant Point Cloud Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The addition of a heavy charged vector gauge boson ${\mathbf{W}}^\prime$ to the Standard Model (SM) with negligible quark couplings ("quarkophobic") and triple gauge couplings can address issues with the SM, such as the B-meson anomalies and recent discrepancies in the W boson mass measurements. We present a phenomenology study probing ${\mathbf{W}}^\prime$ production through weak boson fusion in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. We operate under a simplified model with a large ${\mathbf{W}}^\prime$ decay width and consider final states with two jets, large missing transverse momentum, and one light lepton. Notably, we use point cloud learning for the first time in a BSM search$\unicode{x2014}$specifically, a novel Lorentz-Equivariant Geometric Algebra Transformer$\unicode{x2014}$providing significant improvement in signal sensitivity compared to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Space Symmetry and Sterile Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On one hand, the concept of Quantum Phase Space which is compatible with the uncertainty principle has been considered recently. It has also been shown that a natural symmetry that can be associated with this quantum phase space is the symmetry corresponding to Linear Canonical Transformations (LCTs). On the other hand, sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that are expected to be important for the understanding of physics beyond the current standard model of particle physics. The existence of these particles are suggested both from theoretical and experimental sides. In this work, the objective is to discuss about the symmetry of quantum phase space corresponding to the LCT group and its relation to the possible existence of sterile neutrinos. It is shown that the spin representation of the LCT group associated to the quantum phase, for a signature (1, 4), suggests the existence of sterile neutrinos and lead to a new way for describing them. The mathematical formalism developed in this work provides a new framework for the study of neutrinos physics.</description>

      <title>Mechanical properties of proton using flavor-decomposed gravitational form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanical properties of the proton by extracting its flavor-decomposed gravitational form factors (GFFs) using Light-Cone QCD sum rules (LCSR). These form factors encode critical information about the internal dynamics and spatial distribution of energy, momentum, and internal forces within the proton. The flavor decomposition of the quark sector indicates the role of each flavor in the proton's pressure and shear force distributions. Our results show that the up quark contributes more significantly compared to the down quark in the three conserved proton GFFs, as well as in the energy and shear force distributions. Additionally, we define the non-conserved form factor $\bar{c}^q (t)$, which takes part in the distributions of energy and pressure; the latter is essential for maintaining proton stability. Furthermore, we determine the proton's mass and mechanical radii, providing valuable insight into its internal structure and dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We summarize our recent achievements in the description of neutrino oscillations in various gravitational fields. After the short review of the previous studies of neutrinos in gravitational fields, we consider the neutrinos propagation and oscillations in two gravitational backgrounds. First, we discuss neutrino spin oscillations in their gravitational scattering off a supermassive black hole surrounded by a thick magnetized accretion disk. Second, we study neutrino flavor oscillations in stochastic gravitational waves. We also consider applications of the obtained results for oscillations of astrophysical neutrinos.</description>

      <title>The exclusive production of a fully heavy tetraquark and a photon in electron-positron collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exclusive production of fully heavy tetraquark ($T(bb\bar{b}\bar{b})$, $T(cc\bar{c}\bar{c})$ and $T(bc\bar{b}\bar{c})$) in association with a hard photon in electron-positron collisions are calculated in the framework of non-relativistic QCD. Both inner structures of molecule-like state and compact state with $J=0,1,2$ for the fully heavy tetraquark are discussed. It is promising to observe the fully charmed tetraquark for the $2^{++}$ compact state $T_C((cc)[^3S_1]^{\bar{\mathbf{3}}}-(\bar{c}\bar{c})[^3S_1]^{\mathbf{3}})$ at Belle 2 with the integrated luminosity of 50 $ab^{-1}$. However, the detection of any fully heavy tetraquark at future Z factories for either molecule-like and compact configurations is next to impossible.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the $G$(3900) quantum numbers $J^{PC}$ in $e^+e^-$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the BESIII observation of exotic hadron $G$(3900) [PRL 133(2024)081901] and by the study presented in a recent paper [PRL 133(2024)241903] where $G$(3900) was identified as a $P$-wave $D\bar D^*/\bar DD^*$ resonance, we use the parton and hadron cascade model PACIAE to simulate the $G$(3900) production in $e^+e^-$ annihilations at $\sqrt s$=4.95 GeV. The $G$(3900) candidates are recombined by Dynamically Constrained Phase-space Coalescence model using component mesons of $D\bar D$ or $D\bar D^*/\bar DD^*$ in the PACIAE simulated final hadronic state. We then calculate the $G$(3900) orbital angular momentum quantum number in its rest frame for the first time and perform the spectral classification for each of the above $G$(3900) candidates. Our results confirm the BESIII observation of $G$(3900) in the $e^+e^-\rightarrow D^0\bar D^0/ D^+D^-$ processes and suggest that the $G$(3900) composed of $D\bar D$ is $D$-wave dominant with $J^{PC}=2^{++}$. Moreover, our results indicate that the $G$(3900) composed of $D\bar D^*/\bar DD^*$ is $P$-wave dominant with $J^{PC}=$ $0^{-+}$, $1^{-+}$ or $2^{-+}$, which is consistent with the conclusion in PRL 133(2024)241903. Finally, significant discrepancies in the yields, the transverse momentum spectra and the rapidity distributions among the $G$(3900) $S$-wave, $P$-wave, and $D$-wave states are observed. These discrepancies are proposed as valuable criteria for deciphering the $G$(3900) orbital angular momentum quantum number and $J^{PC}$.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $B_s \to PP$ and $PV$ Decays with Contributions from ${\phi}_{B2}$ with perturbativen QCD approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $B_s \to PP$ and $PV$ decay modes are revisited at leading order within the perturbative QCD approach, incorporating the $B_s$ mesonic wave function (WF) ${\phi}_{B2}$. Here, $P$ represents the pseudoscalar mesons ${\pi}$ and $K$, while $V$ denotes the ground-state vector mesons. The investigation incorporates two key refinements: the contribution of the sub-leading twist WF $\phi_{B2}$ of the $B_s$ meson and the effects of higher-order terms in the distribution amplitudes (DAs) of the final-state mesons. Employing the minimum $\chi^2$ method, we optimize the shape parameter $\omega_{B_s}$ of the $B_s$ meson WF and systematically calculate the branching ratios and $CP$ violation parameters for these decay modes. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of $\phi_{B2}$ significantly impacts both the branching ratios and $CP$ asymmetries, offer an improved agreement with existing experimental data for specific channels. This underscores the necessity of accounting for $\phi_{B2}$ in theoretical studies of $B_s$ weak decays. While the higher-order corrections in the final-state meson DAs yield comparatively smaller effects, they still enhance the theoretical predictions. These findings highlight the importance of refining both wave function modeling and higher-order contributions in pQCD calculations. Future high-precision experimental measurements will further test these predictions, while continued theoretical efforts are essential to explore additional interaction mechanisms and systematic uncertainties. The interplay between experimental advancements and theoretical improvements remains critical for a deeper understanding of $B_s$ meson decay dynamics.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric effects of an interacting hadron gas in the presence of an external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hot and dense hadronic medium formed during the heavy-ion collisions at the RHIC and LHC energies can show thermoelectric effects in the presence of temperature gradients and non-zero baryon chemical potential. In this article we study the thermoelectric coefficients of an interacting hot and dense hadron gas using the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) under the relaxation time approximation (RTA). We discuss the thermoelectric properties within different frameworks of Hardon Resonance Gas (HRG) models. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the thermoelectric coefficients become anisotropic, which leads to Hall-like thermoelectric coefficients, namely Nernst coefficients, along with the magneto-Seebeck coefficients. For the first time, we also estimate the Thomson coefficient of the medium, which comes into the picture due to the temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient of the medium. In the context of studying the thermoelectric generator performance, we calculate the values of the thermoelectric figure of merit of the medium.</description>

      <title>Z boson production in proton-lead collisions: A study utilizing MRW nuclear TMDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the production of Z bosons in proton-lead collisions at a center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 8.16$ TeV, utilizing various transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs), including the leading order Martin-Ryskin-Watt (LO-MRW), next-to-leading order MRW (NLO-MRW), and parton branching (PB) approaches. By comparing theoretical predictions with experimental data from the CMS collaboration, we assess the performance of these TMD models across different kinematic regions. Our analysis reveals that while both LO-MRW and NLO-MRW models generally align well with experimental data, the LO-MRW model tends to overestimate in certain kinematic regions. The NLO-MRW model, with its strong ordering constraint, provides better agreement in these areas. This study highlights the impact of different impositions of angular and strong ordering constraints in the LO-MRW and NLO-MRW approaches in describing Z boson production.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the line shape of $e^+e^-\to \jpsi \eta$ cross section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the cross sections for the processes $e^+e^-\to \jpsi \eta$ and $e^+e^-\to \jpsi \eta^\prime$ at various CM energies $\sqrt{s}$. We first predict these cross sections by combining NRQCD with LC factorization. The predicted cross sections are on the order of several femtobarns for $e^+e^-\to \jpsi \eta^\prime$, and less than 1 fb for $e^+e^-\to \jpsi \eta$, which are significantly smaller than the experimental measurements. It is anticipated that the cross sections are dominated by resonant contributions when $\sqrt{s}$ is close to the resonance mass. In this study, we employ the Vector Meson Dominance (VMD) model to predict these resonant contributions. The effective coupling constants between the photon and the resonance, as well as between the resonance and $J/\psi\eta$ are extracted from the data either provided by the latest PDG or predicted by theoretical calculations. Taking the predictions from the factorization calculation as the continuum contribution, we predict the cross section of $e^+e^-\to \jpsi \eta$ through a coherent sum of contributions from various resonances and the continuum. The relative phase angles between these contributions are determined through a least-$\chi^2$ fit to the experimental data. We then compare our theoretical predictions with the experimental data. Additionally, we find our theoretical prediction for the cross section of $e^+e^-\to \jpsi \eta$ is significantly larger than those for $e^+e^-\to \jpsi \eta^\prime$ measured by the BESIII collaboration.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric and heavy quark transport coefficients of hot QCD matter in the presence of magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this thesis is twofold: a) A comprehensive study of the thermoelectric response in QGP in the absence and presence of a background magnetic field, b) Exploring the dynamics of heavy quarks traversing in QGP in the presence of a weak background magnetic field.
  We have evaluated the strength of the thermoelectric response in QGP quantified by the Seebeck and Nernst coefficients, first in the absence of a background magnetic field, and then in the presence of a strong magnetic field. This is followed by the evaluation of the coefficients in the presence of a weak magnetic field. Each of the above-mentioned scenarios is investigated under the assumption that the QGP is isotropic. This assumption is then relaxed by using an anisotropic distribution for the quarks, and the calculations are repeated. The formalism adopted in the calculation of these coefficients is that of kinetic theory, particularly, the relativistic Boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation.
  The other part of this thesis deals with heavy quark (HQ) dynamics in the QGP. HQs have been recognised as very good probes of the QGP owing to their large masses. We have calculated the HQ energy loss $dE/dx$, longitudinal and transverse momentum diffusion coeffcients $\kappa L/T^3$ , and spatial diffusion coefficient $D_s$ , to leading order in the strong coupling $\alpha$, for both charm and bottom quarks. We consider Coulomb scattering of the HQ with thermal quarks and gluons to evaluate the scattering rate from which, all the aforementioned coefficients are obtained. We find that the values of $\kappa$'s increase in the presence of a weak magnetic field (compared to the $B = 0$ case), and the anisotropy therein is also heightened in the presence of the magnetic field. $D_s$ is found to decrease in the presence of magnetic field, compared to its value at $B = 0$.</description>

      <title>Bound Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How much energy is required to unbind baryons from the cosmological structures that originally bind them? This tutorial article explains why trying to answer this question using just a halo model can be misleading. Instead, it recommends parsing the universe into ``bound domains,'' which are the gravitationally bound structures that ultimately become widely separated islands as the universe evolves. It explains why a bound domain's potential well was about as deep ~1 Gyr after the Big Bang as it is now, and it outlines how future research might take advantage of a bound-domain approach to make progress on some open questions about the baryon distributions in and around galaxy groups and clusters.</description>

      <title>Five-point functions and the permutation group S5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Five-point functions and five-body wave functions play an important role in many areas of nuclear and particle physics, e.g., in 2 -&gt; 3 scattering processes, in the five-gluon vertex, or in the study of pentaquarks. In this work we consider the permutation group S5 to facilitate the description of such objects. We work out the multiplets transforming under irreducible representations of S5 and provide compact formulas allowing one to cast the permutations of an object $f_{12345}$ into combinations with definite permutation symmetry. We also give the explicit expressions for the irreducible multiplet products. We consider several practical applications as examples: We arrange the four-momenta and Lorentz invariants of a five-point function into the multiplet structure, we work out the color tensors of the five-gluon vertex in the multiplet notation, and we discuss applications for five-body wave functions like those of pentaquarks.</description>

      <title>Studying Effects of Evolution on Charge Separation in Small Collision System with A MultiPhase Transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In relativistic high energy heavy-ion collisions, Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) could produce a charge separation in QGP. The charge separation could survive into final hadron system during evolution, observed as correlator $\Delta\gamma$. This physics procedure could also occurs in small collision system if CME emerge in the QGP droplet. In this paper, we study the effects of QGP droplet evolution on charge separation in small collision system, based on AMPT model. Our calculation indicates that, with given initial charge separation, the effects of parton level evolution and hadron level evolution weaken the charge separation indeed, but there is still enough signals could remained. Furthermore, we found that, the contribution of background to $\Delta\gamma$ is negligible in small collision system. So, we propose the small collision system being a good place to confirm contribution of CME.</description>

      <title>1 Particle - 1 Qubit: Particle Physics Data Encoding for Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce 1P1Q, a novel quantum data encoding scheme for high-energy physics (HEP), where each particle is assigned to an individual qubit, enabling direct representation of collision events without classical compression. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 1P1Q in quantum machine learning (QML) through two applications: a Quantum Autoencoder (QAE) for unsupervised anomaly detection and a Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) for supervised classification of top quark jets. Our results show that the QAE successfully distinguishes signal jets from background QCD jets, achieving superior performance compared to a classical autoencoder while utilizing significantly fewer trainable parameters. Similarly, the VQC achieves competitive classification performance, approaching state-of-the-art classical models despite its minimal computational complexity. Furthermore, we validate the QAE on real experimental data from the CMS detector, establishing the robustness of quantum algorithms in practical HEP applications. These results demonstrate that 1P1Q provides an effective and scalable quantum encoding strategy, offering new opportunities for applying quantum computing algorithms in collider data analysis.</description>

      <title>Jet rates in Higgs boson decay at third order in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the production rates for two, three, four and five jets in the hadronic decay of a Higgs boson in its two dominant decay modes to bottom quarks and gluons to third order in the QCD coupling constant. The five-, four- and three-jet rates are obtained from a next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) calculation of Higgs decay to three jets, while the two-jet rate is inferred at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) from the inclusive decay rate. Our results show distinct differences in the dependence of the jet rates on the jet resolution parameter between the two decay modes, supporting the aim of discriminating different Higgs boson decay channels via classic QCD observables.</description>

      <title>Playing with lepton asymmetry at the resonant production of sterile neutrino dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the sterile neutrino dark matter production in the primordial plasma with lepton asymmetry unequally distributed over different neutrino flavors. We argue that with the specific flavor fractions, one can mitigate limits from the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis on the sterile-active neutrino mixing angle and sterile neutrino mass. It happens due to cancellation of the neutrino flavor asymmetries in active neutrino oscillations, which is more efficient in the case of inverse hierarchy of active neutrino masses and does not depend on the value of CP-phase. This finding opens a window of lower sterile-active mixing angles. Likewise, we show that, with lepton asymmetry disappearing from the plasma at certain intermediate stages of the sterile neutrino production, the spectrum of produced neutrinos becomes much colder, which weakens the limits on the model parameter space from observations of cosmic small-scale structures (Ly-$\alpha$ forest, galaxy counts, etc.). This finding reopens the region of lighter sterile neutrinos. The new region may be explored with the next generation of X-ray telescopes searching for the inherent peak signature provided by the dark matter sterile neutrino radiative decays in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Coalescence production of sexaquark with three diquarks in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coalescence production of sexaquark, a hypothetical stable state with quark content $(uuddss)$, is investigated by the parton and hadron cascade model PACIAE in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt s = 7$ TeV. In this work, the compact sexaquark bound state of three diquarks is formed in the final partonic state by a two-step approach, which involves ``diquark" formation via partonic coalescence and sexaquark construction with dynamically constrained phase-space coalescence model successively. The yields, yield ratios, and dependences of spatial parameters (the size of diquark $D_{0}$ and the radius of sexaquark $R_{0}$) of (anti-)sexaquark are predicted. The yields of a hadronic molecule H-dibaryon $\mathrm{H}(\Lambda\Lambda)$ generated in the final hadronic state are also compared. These estimates provide references for future sexaquark searches and other exotic state studies, such as dibaryons.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Physics Benchmark (TPBench) -- a Dataset and Study of AI Reasoning Capabilities in Theoretical Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a benchmark to evaluate the capability of AI to solve problems in theoretical physics, focusing on high-energy theory and cosmology. The first iteration of our benchmark consists of 57 problems of varying difficulty, from undergraduate to research level. These problems are novel in the sense that they do not come from public problem collections. We evaluate our data set on various open and closed language models, including o3-mini, o1, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o and versions of Llama and Qwen. While we find impressive progress in model performance with the most recent models, our research-level difficulty problems are mostly unsolved. We address challenges of auto-verifiability and grading, and discuss common failure modes. While currently state-of-the art models are still of limited use for researchers, our results show that AI assisted theoretical physics research may become possible in the near future. We discuss the main obstacles towards this goal and possible strategies to overcome them. The public problems and solutions, results for various models, and updates to the data set and score distribution, are available on the website of the dataset tpbench.org.</description>

      <title>The effect of three-body nucleon-nucleon interaction on the ground state binding energy of the light nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the ground state binding energies of the light nuclei such as 4He, 6Li, 12C and 14N by considering the effect of three-body nucleon-nucleon interaction. We use the effective twobody potential obtained from the lowest order constrained variational (LOCV) calculations of the nuclear matter for the Reid68, AV14, UV14, and AV18 nuclear potentials in different channels. To calculate the ground state binding energy, we implement the local density approximation by using the harmonic oscillator wave functions while the effect of three-body interaction is considered by employing the UIX potential. We compare the obtained two-body ground state binding energy with the energy related to the three-body effect. We also compare the obtained values with the experimental data and also work of others, and show that the results are relatively acceptable. We compute the root mean-square radius Rrms of the above nuclei for the Reid68, AV14, UV14, and AV18 potentials and compare the results with the experiment. We also obtain the contribution of different channels by matching to the experimental values of the quadrupole moments and magnetic dipole moments. Furthermore, we calculate the three-body cluster energy of the above nuclei and compare the results with that of nuclear matter. According to the obtained results, we see that the three-body cluster energy contribution is small. For example, for 4He nuclide, this value is 0.079 MeV with the Reid68 potential.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of Dark Matter in Neutron Stars: A Quantitative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis investigates the impact of dark matter on neutron star properties, focusing on mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Using two-fluid and single-fluid models, dark matter is incorporated into the equation of state (EOS) via a Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) approach. The study finds that increasing dark matter content reduces the maximum mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Bayesian inference, supported by LIGO-Virgo gravitational wave data and NICER mass-radius measurements, refines these models. Despite dark matter's influence, the semi-universal C-Love relation remains valid. Machine learning techniques effectively classify dark matter-admixed neutron stars. The thesis also explores a sigma-cut potential in the EOS, which stiffens the EOS at high densities, favoring larger radii and lower f-mode frequencies. The study of non-radial oscillations, particularly f- and p-modes, highlights their sensitivity to neutron star composition and EOS. These findings enhance our understanding of neutron star interiors and dark matter's role, emphasizing the need for further observational and theoretical advancements.</description>

      <title>Singularity resolution and regular black hole formation in gravitational collapse in asymptotically safe gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adopt an effective action inspired by asymptotically safe gravity, in which the effective gravitational constant is parameterized as $G(\epsilon) = G_{N} [1 + \tilde{\omega} (G_{N}^{2} \epsilon)^{\alpha}]^{-1}$, where $G_{N}$ and $\epsilon$ denote Newton's gravitational constant and the energy density of the matter field, respectively, with two dimensionless model parameters, $\tilde{\omega}$ and $\alpha$. Within this framework, we investigate the complete gravitational collapse of a homogeneous ball of perfect fluid and find that the singularity is completely resolved for $\alpha &gt; 1$ but not for $1/2 \le \alpha \le 1$. The case $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1/2$ is inconsistent with asymptotic safety. Moreover, we note that although the singularity cannot be fully resolved for $\alpha = 1$, it is significantly weakened by quantum gravity effects. Furthermore, we successfully construct a static exterior metric which, together with the interior solution, describes the dynamical formation of regular black holes in an asymptotically flat spacetime for the perfectly resolved case $\alpha &gt; 1$. The resulting regular black hole, obtained as the final static state, contains a de Sitter core and admits a static metric fully expressible in terms of the Lerch transcendent for general cases and in elementary functions for certain values of $\alpha$, including \alpha = 2$. We also discuss the formation of gravastars and the late-time evaporation process of the regular black holes.</description>

      <title>Robust treatment of finite nuclear size reduces CKM unitarity deficit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the extraction of the $|V_{ud}|$ CKM matrix element from the superallowed transition decay rate of $^{26m}$Al$\rightarrow$$^{26}$Mg, focusing on finite nuclear size effects. We show that the dependence of the decay rate of $^{26m}$Al on its charge radius is 4 times greater than previously believed, so it must be determined with high precision. However, for a short-lived isotope of an odd $Z$ element such as $^{26m}$Al, radius extraction relies on challenging many-body atomic calculations. We performed the needed calculations, finding an excellent agreement with previous ones, which used a highly different methodology. This sets a new standard for the reliability of isotope shift factor calculations in many-electron systems. The $\mathcal{F}t$ value obtained from our analysis is lower by $2.2\,\sigma$ than the corresponding value in the previous critical survey, resulting in an increase in $|V_{ud}|^2$ by $0.9\,\sigma$. Adopting $|V_{ud}|$ from this decay alone reduces the CKM unitarity deficit by one standard deviation, irrespective of the choice of $|V_{us}|</description>

      <title>Gauge Invariant Effective Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the long-standing problem of gauge dependence of the effective potential arises due to the factorisation of the determinant of operators, which is invalid when we take the zeta-regularised trace of the operators. We show by correcting for this assumption by computing the multiplicative anomaly, the gauge-dependent terms of the effective potential cancel. We also show that in two- and odd-dimensional non-compact spacetime manifolds where the multiplicative anomaly term is zero, the standard calculation of one-loop effective potential gives a gauge-independent result. These results are in support of our claim that the multiplicative anomaly may play a crucial role in removing the gauge dependence in the effective potential in the four-dimensional non-compact manifold. Noting the non-trivial aspects of this anomaly computation for a generic scenario, we propose the Heat-Kernel method to compute the effective potential where this anomaly emerges as a total derivative, thus redundant. We explicitly show how one can calculate the gauge independent, effective action and the Coleman-Weinberg effective potential by employing the Heat-Kernel method. Based on this result, we advocate the Heat-Kernel expansion as the most straightforward method, as it naturally deals with the matrix elliptic operator for the calculation of manifestly gauge independent, effective actions compared to other conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Gray-body factors: Method matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The calculation of gray-body factors is essential for understanding Hawking radiation and black hole thermodynamics. While the formalism developed by Chandrasekhar is effective for static black holes, it faces significant challenges in Kerr spacetimes, particularly in the superradiant regime, where a specific choice of coordinates introduces numerical inaccuracies. To address these limitations, an alternative method based on re-scaling radial coordinates and employing Frobenius-like expansions has been investigated. We compare the gray-body factors obtained for a near-maximally rotating black hole using both methods and find that the Chandrasekhar formalism systematically overestimates the values in the superradiant regime compared to well-established analytical results. Specifically, for a spin parameter of $a_* = 0.999$, the Chandrasekhar method yields values approximately twice as large as the correct result. Since this approach has been implemented in \texttt{BlackHawk}, we assess the impact of these discrepancies on constraints derived from gamma-ray observations of highly spinning primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Measuring $A_\text{FB}^b$ and $R_b$ with exclusive $b$-hadron decays at the FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel tagging technique to measure the beauty-quark partial decay-width ratio $R_b$ and its forward-backward asymmetry $A_\text{FB}^b$ at the FCC-ee, using $\mathcal{O}(10^{12})$ $Z$-boson decays. The method is based on the exclusive reconstruction of a selected list of $b$-hadron decay modes in $Z\to b\bar{b}$ events at the $Z$ pole, which can provide the flavour and possibly the charge of the hemisphere. This approach effectively eliminates the contamination from light-quark physics events and reduces the leading systematic uncertainties arising from background contamination, tagging-efficiency correlations, and gluon-radiation corrections by exploiting the geometric and kinematic properties of beauty hadrons. This results in a total relative uncertainty of the order of $0.01\,\%$ for both observables. Furthermore, this precision allows to obtain a commensurate precision on the weak mixing angle $\sin^2(\theta_W^\text{eff})$ compared to the muon forward-backward asymmetry on the order of $0.002\,\%$.</description>

      <title>Back-Reaction of Super-Hubble Fluctuations, Late Time Tracking and Recent Observational Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous studies suggested that the back-reaction of super-Hubble cosmological fluctuations could lead to a dynamical relaxation of the cosmological constant. Moreover, this mechanism appears to be self-regulatory, potentially leading to an oscillatory behavior in the effective dark energy. Such an effect would occur in any cosmological model with super-Hubble matter fluctuations, including the standard $\Lambda\text{CDM}$ model, without the need for additional mechanisms. The recent DESI data, which supports the possibility of dynamical dark energy, has renewed interest in exploring scenarios leading to such oscillatory behavior. In this work we propose a parametrization to account for the impact of super-Hubble fluctuations on the background energy density of the Universe. We model the total effective cosmological constant as the sum of a constant piece and an oscillating contribution. We perform a preliminary comparison of the background dynamics of this model with the recent radial BAO data from DESI. We also discuss the status of the $H_0$ tension problem in this model. While this analysis serves as a first step in testing the scenario, we emphasize the importance of considering this effect, as it is naturally expected to be present and could offer valuable insights in light of the recent observational data.</description>

Abstract: The two-Higgs-doublet model augmented with a complex scalar singlet (2HDMS) is a well-motivated candidate for Beyond Standard Model (BSM) Physics. We investigate the dark matter phenomenology of the 2HDMS with the complex scalar singlet as the dark matter candidate. We perform a study of the parameter space allowed by existing theoretical and experimental constraints from dark matter, flavour physics and collider searches. Further, we discuss a few benchmark scenarios to test the discovery potential for the 2HDMS at the HL-LHC and at future high-energy $e^+e^-$ colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.05390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-forward eikonal scattering matrix for dipole-proton scattering at high energy obtains an imaginary part due to a $C$-odd three gluon exchange. We present numerical estimates for the perturbative Odderon amplitude as a function of dipole size, impact parameter, their relative azimuthal angle, and light-cone momentum cutoff $x$. The proton is approximated as $\psi_\mathrm{qqq}|qqq\rangle + \psi_\mathrm{qqqg}|qqqg\rangle$, where $\psi_\mathrm{qqq}$ is a non-perturbative three quark model wave function while the gluon emission is computed in light-cone perturbation theory. We find that the Odderon amplitude increases as $x$ decreases from 0.1 to 0.01. At yet lower $x$, the reversal of this energy dependence would reflect the onset of universal small-$x$ renormalization group evolution.</description>

Abstract: A transformation on homogeneous polynomials is proposed, which is further applied to parametric Feynman integrals. The two representations related through this transformation are dual to each other. It naturally leads to dualities of Landau equations and linear integral relations between the two representations. For integrals with momentum-space correspondences, the dual representation is equivalent to the Baikov representation.</description>

      <title>Baryon Asymmetry from the Decay and Scattering of a Majorana Fermion Pair Coupled to Quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the baryon asymmetry in decay and scattering processes involving the electromagnetically charge-neutral fermion $\chi$ that carries nonzero baryon number and interacts with quark-like fermions $U,D$ via a vector-vector dimension-six effective operator, in the theory we developed in our earlier work. Majorana masses for the $\chi$ break baryon number and split the Dirac fermion $\chi$ into a pair of Majorana fermions $X_n$ with indefinite baryon number. We identify loop amplitudes for $X_n$ decay and scattering processes that are sensitive to the baryon number violation. The phases in the Majorana mass and couplings, in conjunction with the phase from intermediate onshell states, lead to $C$ and $CP$ violation in these processes. For some representative parameter choices, we numerically compute the decay and scattering baryon asymmetries between the process and its conjugate process, and find that the asymmetry generated is very interesting for explaining the baryon asymmetry of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Candidates of a Very Low Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review dark matter (DM) candidates of a very low mass, appearing in the window below the traditional weakly-interacting massive particle $m_\chi \lesssim 10$ GeV and extending down to $m_\chi \gtrsim 1$ meV, somewhat below the mass limit where DM becomes wavelike. Such candidates are motivated by hidden sectors such as Hidden Valleys, which feature hidden forces and rich dynamics, but have evaded traditional collider searches looking for New Physics because of their relatively weak coupling to the Standard Model. Such sectors can still be detected through dedicated low-energy colliders which, through their intense beams, can have sensitivity to smaller couplings, or through astrophysical observations of the evolution of DM halos and stellar structures which, through the Universe's epochs, can be sensitive to small DM interactions. We also consider mechanisms where the DM abundance is fixed through the interaction with the SM, which directly motivates the search for light DM in terrestrial experiments. The bulk of this review is dedicated to the new ideas that have been proposed for directly detecting such DM candidates of a low mass, through nuclear recoils, electronic excitations, or collective modes such as phonons and magnons. The rich tapestry of materials and modes in the Condensed Matter landscape is reviewed, along with specific prospects for detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We fit the three finestructure constants of the Standard Model with three, in first approximation theoretically estimable parameters, 1) a "unifiedscale",turning out not equal to the Planck scale and thus only estimable by a very speculative story, 2) a "number of layers" being a priori the number of families, and 3) a unified coupling related to a critical coupling on a lattice. So formally we postdict the three fine structure constants! In the philosophy of our model there is a physically lattice theory with link variables taking values in a (or in the various) "small" representations of the Standard Model Group. We argue for that these representations functio in first approximation as were the theory a genuine $SU(5)$ theory. Next we take into account fluctuation of the gauge fields in the lattice and obtain a correction to the a priori $SU(5)$ approximation, because of course the link fluctuations not corresponding any Standard model Lie algebra, but only to the SU(5), do not exist. The model is a development of our old anti-grand-unification model having as its genuine gauge group, close to fundamental scale, a cross product of the standard model group S(U(3)x U(2)) with itself, there being one Cartesian product factor for each family. In these old works we included the hypotesis of "multiple point criticallity principle" which here effectively means the coupling constants be critical on the lattice. Counted relative to the Higgs scale we suggest the in our sense "unified scale" (where the deviations between the inverse fine structure constants deviate by quantum fluctuations being only from standard model groups, not SU(5)) makes up the 2/3 th power of the Planck scale relative to the Higgs scale, or better the top quark mass scale.</description>

Abstract: Assuming that the number densities of heavy flavor in hadron gas and in QGP are same at $T_c$, we obtain the effective mass of heavy quark at $T_c$ from the comparison with the hadron resonance gas model which well describes particle yield in heavy-ion collisions. We find that charm quark mass at vanishing baryon chemical potential is around 1.8 GeV which is much heavier than QCD bare mass and close to $D$ meson mass. The mass slightly increases with increasing baryon chemical potential and then decreases. On the other hand, anticharm quark mass constantly decreases with increasing baryon chemical potential. Bottom quark mass has a similar pattern. Extending the hadron resonance gas model to a bit higher temperature beyond $T_c$, the effective masses of charm and bottom quarks decrease with increasing temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the extension of the Standard Model (SM) through a scalar quadruplet with hypercharge either $1/2$ or $3/2$; in the first case, we assume $CP$ invariance of the scalar potential (SP). We write down the unitarity conditions on the SP. We use a partly numerical method to find the bounded-from-below conditions on the SP. We determine the masses of the new scalars of the model. We compute the three- and four-Higgs couplings and compare them to the ones of the SM.</description>

      <title>Towards a Real-Time Computation of Timelike Hadronic Vacuum Polarization and Light-by-Light Scattering: Schwinger Model Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) and light-by-light scattering (HLBL) are crucial for evaluating the Standard Model predictions concerning the muon's anomalous magnetic moment. However, direct first-principle lattice gauge theory-based calculations of these observables in the timelike region remain challenging. Discrepancies persist between lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations in the spacelike region and dispersive approaches relying on experimental data parametrization from the timelike region. Here, we introduce a methodology employing 1+1-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED), i.e. the Schwinger Model, to investigate the HVP and HLBL. To that end, we use both tensor network techniques, specifically matrix product states, and classical emulators of digital quantum computers. Demonstrating feasibility in a simplified model, our approach sets the stage for future endeavors leveraging digital quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Regge trajectories for the triply heavy triquarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We attempt to apply the Regge trajectory approach to the triply heavy triquarks $((QQ')\bar{Q}^{\prime\prime})$ $(Q,\,Q',\,Q^{\prime\prime}=b,\,c)$. We present the triquark Regge trajectory relations, and then employ them to crudely estimate the spectra of the triquarks $((cc)\bar{c})$, $((cc)\bar{b})$, $((bc)\bar{c})$, $((bc)\bar{b})$, $((bb)\bar{c})$, and $((bb)\bar{b})$. The $\lambda$-trajectories and the $\rho$-trajectories are discussed. The triquark Regge trajectory becomes a new and very simple approach for estimating the spectra of triquarks. Moreover, the spin-averaged masses of the ground states of pentaquarks $(\bar{c}(cc))(cc)$, $(\bar{b}(cc))(cc)$ and $(\bar{c}(bb))(cc)$ are estimated, which are consistent with other theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>From strange-quark tagging to fragmentation tagging with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply advanced machine learning techniques to two challenging jet classification problems at the LHC. The first is strange-quark tagging, in particular distinguishing strange-quark jets from down-quark jets. The second, which we term fragmentation tagging, involves identifying the fragmentation channel of a quark. We exemplify the latter by training neural networks to differentiate between bottom jets containing a bottom baryon and those containing a bottom meson. The common challenge in these two problems is that neither quark lifetimes and masses nor parton showering provide discriminating tools, making it necessary to rely on differences in the distributions of the hadron types contained in each type of jet and their kinematics. For these classification tasks, we employ variations of Graph Attention Networks and the Particle Transformer, which receive jet and all constituent properties as inputs. We compare their performance to a simple Multilayer Perceptron that uses simple variables. We find that the more sophisticated architectures do not improve $s$-quark versus $d$-quark jet differentiation by a significant amount, but they do lead to a significant gain in $b$-baryon versus $b$-meson jet differentiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18474v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We suggest a resonant $c \bar b \to H^+$ production search, followed by bosonic $H^+ \to W^+ H$ weak decay at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the general two-Higgs-doublet model (G2HDM) that has flavor-changing neutral Higgs couplings, $H^+$ is resonantly produced via the top-charm $\rho_{tc} V_{tb}$ coupling at tree level, while $H^+ \to W^+ H$ weak decay occurs within the exotic second doublet, leading eventually to same-sign dilepton signals. We perform a signal-to-background analysis at the 14 TeV LHC and show that discovery seems possible with LHC Run 2 data already at hand.</description>

Abstract: Exotic hadrons are a new class of hadronic states whose properties do not allow them to be classified as conventional quark-antiquark mesons or three quark baryons. Finding new and understanding established exotic states is the most important topic in today's hadron spectroscopy and a promising avenue to advance our knowledge on Quantum Chromodynamics in the non-perturbative regime. While several high-quality reviews on the topic exist, they are all at an advanced level. The present article aims to address new-comers to the field with a simple introduction to exotic hadrons with an emphasis on the experimental studies.</description>

Abstract: Instability of the charged pion vacuum resulting in the pion condensation is studied within the $\lambda|\phi|^4$ model at the rapid rotation of the system in presence of external fields. Case of the static external scalar and electric square potential wells and the uniform magnetic field is studied in detail. The Meissner and Aharonov-Bohm effects and the London moment are taken into account. Analogies and differences with the behavior of metallic superconductors under the action of the rotation and the external magnetic field are analysed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the Standard Model (SM) analysis of Ref. [1], which was limited to light leptons in the final state, to the semileptonic $B \to D^* \tau \nu_\tau$ decay. By using quantities that can be analised without the knowledge of $\vert V_{cb}\vert$, we derive important information about the helicity amplitudes and the hadronic form factors that can be compared with the predictions of lattice QCD calculations. In particular, there is a difficulty in reproducing simultaneously the experimental values of $R(D^*)$ and of other quantities relevant for the semitauonic decays within the SM. As a byproduct of our analysis, we also present a determination of $\vert V_{cb}\vert$ from the total decay rate.</description>

      <title>Superconnections in AdS/QCD and the hadronic light-by-light contribution to the muon $g-2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider hard-wall AdS/QCD models extended by a string-theory inspired Chern-Simons action in terms of a superconnection involving a bi-fundamental scalar field which corresponds to the open-string tachyon of brane-antibrane configurations and which is naturally identified with the holographic dual of the quark condensate in chiral symmetry breaking. This realizes both the axial and chiral anomalies of QCD with a Witten-Veneziano mechanism for the $\eta'$ mass in addition to current quark masses, but somewhat differently than in the Katz-Schwartz AdS/QCD model used previously by us to evaluate pseudoscalar and axial vector transition form factors and their contribution to the HLBL piece of the muon $g-2$. Compared to the Katz-Schwartz model, we obtain a significantly more realistic description of axial-vector mesons with regard to $f_1$-$f_1'$ mixing and equivalent photon rates. Moreover, predictions of the $f_1\to e^+e^-$ branching ratios are found to be in line with a recent phenomenological study. However, pseudoscalar transition form factors compare less well with experiment; in particular the $\pi^0$ transition form factor turns out to be overestimated at moderate non-zero virtuality. For the combined HLBL contribution to the muon $g-2$ from the towers of axial vector mesons and excited pseudoscalars we obtain, however, a result very close to that of the Katz-Schwartz model.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the bubble wall velocity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the bubble wall velocity in first-order phase transitions is a challenging task, requiring the solution of (coupled) equations of motion for the scalar field and Boltzmann equations for the particles in the plasma. The collision terms appearing in the Boltzmann equation present a prominent source of uncertainty as they are often known only at leading log accuracy. In this paper, we derive upper and lower bounds on the wall velocity, corresponding to the local thermal equilibrium and ballistic limits. These bounds are completely independent of the collision terms.
  For the ballistic approximation, we argue that the inhomogeneous plasma temperature and velocity distributions across the bubble wall should be taken into account. This way, the hydrodynamic obstruction previously observed in local thermal equilibrium is also present for the ballistic approximation. This is essential for the ballistic approximation to provide a lower bound on the wall velocity. We use a model-independent approach to study the behaviour of the limiting wall velocities as a function of a few generic parameters, and we test our developments in the singlet extended Standard Model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a minimal composite dark matter model, based on a $SU(N_d)$ dark sector with $n_f$ dark quarks and a heavy t-channel mediator. For $n_f\geq 4$, the dark flavor symmetry guarantees the stability of a subset of the dark pions, which serve as our dark matter candidates. Their relic abundance is determined by co-scattering or co-annihilation with the remaining dark pions, which are unstable and decay. Due to their degenerate masses, the annihilation cross section is suppressed at low temperatures, thereby avoiding stringent constraints from indirect detection and opening up the GeV mass window. The decaying dark pions are naturally long lived. We obtain limits on the model from semi-visible or emerging jet searches and estimate the reach of future probes.</description>

      <title>CP violation in cold dense quark matter and axion effects on the non-radial oscillations of neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charge-conjugation and parity violation in strong interaction for cold dense quark matter is studied with axions of quantum chromodynamic within the three flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model that includes the coupling of axions to quarks. We first calculate the effective potential for axions at finite baryon density and zero temperature including the effects of a first order chiral phase transition. Using the equation of state for quark matter with axions and a hadronic matter equation of state in the ambit of a relativistic mean field theory in quantum hadrodynamics, we discuss the hadron-quark phase transition. Inclusion of axions reduces the critical density for chiral transition. We use a Gibbs construct for the hadron-quark phase transition satisfying the constraints of beta equilibrium and charge neutrality as appropriate for the neutron star matter. The equation of state so obtained is used to investigate the structure of hybrid neutron stars. It is found that with the presence of axions, it is possible to have stable hybrid neutron stars having an inner core of quark matter both in pure quark matter phase as well as in a mixed phase with hyperonic matter along with a outer core of hyperonic matter and is in agreement with modern astrophysical constraints. We also discuss the properties of non-radial oscillations of such hybrid neutron stars. It is observed that the quadrupolar fundamental modes ($f$-modes) for such hybrid neutron stars get substantial enhancements both due to a larger quark core in the presence of axions and from the hyperons as compared to a canonical nucleonic neutron stars.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the interaction between an optical laser and an ionic crystal and reveal coherent emission of axions through phase-match between laser and axion fields. Such emission is further enhanced by stacking thin crystal layers of half-wavelength thickness. Based on these findings, we propose a novel method for generating and detecting axions in terrestrial experiments, achieving up to a two-order-of-magnitude increase in transition probability compared to light-shining-through-wall (LSW) experiments with the same interaction region size. For an experimental length of 10 meters, this setup could lower the exclusion limit to $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\gtrsim1.32\times10^{-11}\textrm{GeV}^{-1}$ with currently available laser technologies.</description>

      <title>Bottomoniumlike states in proton collisions: Fragmentation and resummation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the semi-inclusive hadroproduction of doubly bottomed tetraquarks ($X_{b\bar{b}q\bar{q}}$) as well as fully bottomed ones ($T_{4b}$), to which we collectively refer as "bottomoniumlike" states. We rely upon the variable-flavor number-scheme fragmentation at leading power, where a single parton perturbatively splits into the corresponding Fock state, which then hadronizes into the color-neutral, observed tetraquark. To this end, we build new sets of DGLAP/HF-NRevo consistent, hadron-structure oriented collinear fragmentation functions, which we name TQHL1.1 and TQ4Q1.1 parametrizations. They extend and supersede the corresponding 1.0 versions recently derived in previous works. The first family describes the fragmentation of doubly heavy tetraquarks and is based on an improved version of the Suzuki model for the heavy-quark channel. The second family depicts the fragmentation of fully heavy tetraquarks and embodies initial-scale inputs for gluon and heavy-quark channels, both of them calculated by the hands of potential nonrelativistic QCD. As a phenomenological application, we provide novel predictions for tetraquark-plus-jet high-energy distributions, computed within the NLL/NLO$^+$ hybrid factorization from (sym)JETHAD, at 14 TeV and 100 TeV FCC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore toponium, the smallest known quantum bound state of a top quark and its antiparticle, bound by the strong force. With a Bohr radius of $8\times 10^{-18}$~m and a lifetime of $2.5 \times 10^{-25}$~s, toponium uniquely probes microphysics. Unlike all other hadrons, it is governed by ultraviolet freedom. This distinction offers novel insights into quantum chromodynamics. Our analysis reveals a toponium signal exceeding $5\sigma$ in the distribution of the cross section ratio between $e^+e^- \rightarrow b\bar{b}$ and $e^+e^- \rightarrow q\bar{q}$ ($q=b,c,s,d,u$), based on 400~fb$^{-1}$ of data collected at $\sqrt{s}\approx 341~{\rm GeV}$. This discovery enables a top quark mass measurement with an uncertainty reduced by a factor of ten compared to current precision levels. Moreover, this method improves the systematic uncertainty by at least a factor of 12 compared to any other possible methods.</description>

      <title>Minimal extension of the Standard Model with a mirror symmetry between fundamental fermions and a possible origin of dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a specific, nontrivial extension of the Standard Model of weak interactions based on the ${SU(2)}_L\times{U(1)}_Y\times{U(1)}_C$ group. Our motivation follows from the identification of the globally conserved charge $\Omega=\mathrm{B}-\mathrm{L}-\mathrm{Q}$ as a neutrino charge. An intriguing feature of the model is the emergence of a mirror symmetry between neutrinos and electrically charged leptons, as well as between up and down quarks. Following the spontaneous breaking of the weak gauge symmetry with the use of the Goldstone-Higgs iso-doublet, all elementary fermions acquire Dirac masses from Yukawa interaction. The $W^\pm$ and $Z$ bosons also acquire masses, although with a modified relationship between their respective masses, as compared to the Standard Model. Our model accounts for both chiral components of the neutrino and offers an explanation for the non-observability of the right-chiral neutrino. Additionally, it forbids neutrinoless double-beta decay. Spontaneous breaking of the local $U(1)$ symmetry leads to the new gauge boson $ \mathit{\Omega}_\mu$ mass $M_\mathit{\Omega}$, which we assume to be greater than the mass $m_\chi$ of a new scalar, Higgs-like field $\chi$. The cosmological stability of $\chi$, predicted under this condition, allows for its interpretation as dark matter, interacting exclusively with $\mathit{\Omega}_\mu$ and gravity. From this perspective, we solve and analyze a system of Boltzmann equations that describe the thermal evolution of the number density of $\chi$ dark matter and the $\mathit{\Omega}_\mu$ mediator field within the context of the $\mathrm{\Lambda CDM}$ cosmological model. Specifically, we estimate the coupling constant $q$ to be in the range of $\sim 10^{-8.5}\ g$ to $\sim 10^{-6}\ g$ which ensures cosmological stability of the $\chi$ particles.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet Completion of a Two-loop Neutrino Mass Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Zee-Babu model is an economical framework for neutrino mass generation as two-loop quantum corrections. In this work, we present a UV completion of this model by embedding it into an $SU(5)$ unified framework. Interestingly, we find that loop-induced contributions to neutrino masses arising from colored scalars are just as important as those from color-neutral ones. These new states, which are required from gauge coupling unification and neutrino oscillation data to have masses below $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ TeV, may be accessible to future collider experiments. Additionally, the model can be probed in proton decay searches. Our Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis of model parameters shows a high likelihood of observable $p \rightarrow e^+ \pi^0$ decay signal in the first decade of Hyper-Kamiokande operation. The model predicts a vector-like down-type quark at the TeV scale, utilized for realistic fermion mass generation and gauge coupling unification. The model is UV-complete in the sense that it is a unified theory which is realistic and asymptotically free that can be extrapolated to the Planck scale.</description>

      <title>Weak nuclear decays deep-underground as a probe of axion dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the time modulation of weak nuclear decays as a method to probe axion dark matter. To this end, we develop a theoretical framework to compute the $\theta$-dependence of weak nuclear decays, including electron capture and $\beta$ decay, which enables us to predict the time variation of weak radioactivity in response to an oscillating axion dark matter background. As an application, we recast old data sets, from the weak nuclear decays of ${^{40}\text{K}}$ and ${^{137}\text{Cs}}$ taken at the underground Gran Sasso Laboratory, in order to set constraints on the axion decay constant, specifically in the axion mass range from few $10^{-23}\;$eV up to $10^{-19}\;$eV. We finally propose a new measurement at the Gran Sasso Laboratory, based on the weak nuclear decay of ${^{40}\text{K}}$ via electron capture, in order to explore even shorter timescales, thus reaching sensitivities to axion masses up to $10^{-9}\;$eV.</description>

Abstract: The flavor-dependent quark-antiquark contact interactions, induced by vacuum polarization and recently derived for flavor U(3) Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, are articulated with the resulting mixing effects emerging from flavor symmetry breaking in view. The formal effects of the explicit mixing interactions, $G_{i\neq j}$, are detailed firstly for the meson mixing problem without the inclusion of 't Hooft interactions induced by instantons. Secondly, it is shown that these mixings, in the scalar channel of quark-antiquark interactions, might give rise to quark mixing in the gap equations. Sixth order quark-antiquark interactions from vacuum polarization, that break $U_A(1)$ symmetry, also contribute.</description>

      <title>Revisiting heavy-flavor conserving weak decays of charmed baryons within the nonrelativistic quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the heavy-flavor conserving weak decays of charmed baryons, specifically the processes $\Xi_{c} \to \Lambda_{c} \pi$ and $\Omega_{c} \to \Xi_{c} \pi$, where the pole model is employed to account for the nonfactorizable contributions. Additionally, the nonperturbative parameters involved are determined within the framework of the nonrelativistic quark model, utilizing exact baryon wave functions obtained by solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a nonrelativistic potential. By considering the mixing angle $\theta \in (24.4^\circ, 32.4^\circ)$ for $\Xi_{c}-\Xi_{c}^{\prime}$ mixing, we find that the experimental data can be effectively reproduced. Furthermore, we estimate the branching ratios: $\mathcal{B}(\Xi_{c}^{+} \to \Lambda_{c}^{+} \pi^{0}) = (8.69 \sim 9.79) \times 10^{-3}$, $\mathcal{B}(\Omega_{c}^{0} \to \Xi_{c}^{+} \pi^{-}) = (11.3 \sim 12.1) \times 10^{-3}$, and $\mathcal{B}(\Omega_{c}^{0} \to \Xi_{c}^{+} \pi^{0}) = (4.67 \sim 5.23) \times 10^{-3}$. These predictions can be tested in ongoing experiments at LHCb, Belle II, and BESIII.</description>

      <title>Decays of the light hybrid meson $1^{\mathrm{-+}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11331v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The full width of the light isovector hybrid meson $H_{\mathrm{V}}$ with spin-parities $1^{\mathrm{-+}}$ and content $(\overline{u}gu-\overline{d}gd)/ \sqrt{2}$ is evaluated by considering the decays $H_{\mathrm{V}} \to \rho^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}$, $b_1^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}$, $f_1(1285)\pi$, $f_1(1420)\pi$, $ \eta \pi$, and $\eta^{\prime} \pi$. To calculate the partial widths of these channels, we use QCD three-point sum rule method which is necessary to determine strong couplings at the corresponding hybrid-meson-meson vertices. It turns out that the main contribution to the full width $\Gamma[H_{\mathrm{ V}}]=(109.7 \pm 16.0)~\mathrm{MeV}$ of the hybrid meson comes from the processes $H_{\mathrm{V}} \to \rho^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}$ partial width of which amounts to $\approx 67~\mathrm{MeV}$. The effects of the decays $H_{\mathrm{V }} \to b_1\pi $ and $H_{\mathrm{V}} \to f_1\pi, f_1^{\prime} \pi$ are also sizeable: Their partial widths are equal to $13~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $20~ \mathrm{MeV}$, respectively. The decays to $\eta \pi$ and $\eta^{\prime} \pi$ mesons are subdominant reactions, nevertheless they form $\approx 9\%$ of the full width $\Gamma[H_{\mathrm{V}}]$. Results obtained in this work may be interesting to unravel the tangle of predictions about $H_{\mathrm{V}}$ existing in the literature, as well as useful in analyses of different resonances.</description>

Abstract: We discuss leptogenesis in a majoron model extended by a right-handed $SU(2)_L$ triplet fermion. We study several different parameter assignments and find that the interactions of neutrinos with the new particles in the majoron+triplet model can significantly alter the way leptogenesis proceeds. We show that for large parts of the considered parameter space, it is essential to solve the set of coupled Boltzmann equations for the evolution of the neutrinos and the additional particles rather than solving the Boltzmann equations for the neutrino evolution only.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Moduli and Non-perturbative Production of Axions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological moduli generically come to dominate the energy density of the early universe, and thereby trigger an early matter dominated era. Such non-standard cosmological histories are expected to have profound effects on the evolution and production of axion cold dark matter and dark radiation, as well as their prospects for detection. We consider moduli-axion couplings and investigate the early history of the coupled system, considering closely the evolution of the homogeneous modulus field, the back-reaction from the axion, and the energy densities of the two fields. A particular point of interest is the enhancement of axion production from modulus decay, due to tachyonic and parametric resonant instabilities, and the implications of such production on the cosmological moduli problem, axion dark radiation, and the available parameter space for axion dark matter. Using an effective field theory approach, WKB-based semi-analytical analysis, and detailed numerical estimates of the co-evolution of the system, we evaluate the expected decay efficiency of the modulus to axions. The effects of higher-order operators are studied and implications for UV-complete frameworks such as the Large Volume Scenarios in Type IIB string theory are considered in detail.</description>

      <title>New axion contribution to the two-photon decays of neutral pions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of axions introduces new diagrams at one-loop order to the two-photon decays of the neutral pion through axion-pion mixing. In this work, we calculate this correction, missing in all current calculations, in the framework of SU(2) chiral perturbation theory. We show that the correction is proportional to the axion-photon coupling and the square of axion mass, which in turn is strongly suppressed by the axion decay constant for the classical space window but may not be negligible for the QCD axion in the MeV or even larger mass range. On the other hand, in combination with the experimental measurement of the decay width of $\pi^0\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$ process, this result rules out the standard QCD axion as an explanation for the possible discrepancy between the chiral perturbation theory prediction and the experimental data.</description>

Abstract: Preserving the unique role of the one Higgs doublet of the standard model, it is proposed that quark and lepton mass patterns, often ascribed to the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism using nonrenormalizable higher-dimensional terms, may be enforced in a renormalizable theory of just one Higgs doublet by the scotogenic mechanism with soft symmetry breaking in the dark sector. A revised version of the original $A_4$ model of charged leptons and neutrinos is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.14463v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first calculation of the jet transport coefficient $\hat{q}$ in quenched and (2+1)-flavor QCD on a 4-D Euclidean lattice. The light-like propagation of an energetic parton is factorized from the mean square gain in momentum transverse to the direction of propagation, which is expressed in terms of the thermal field-strength field-strength correlator. The leading-twist term in its operator product expansion is calculated on the lattice. Continuum extrapolated quenched results, and full QCD estimates based on un-renormalized lattice data, over multiple lattice sizes, are compared with (non) perturbative calculations and phenomenological extractions of $\hat{q}$. The lattice data for $\hat{q}$ show a temperature dependence similar to the entropy density. Within uncertainties, these are consistent with phenomenological extractions, contrary to calculations using perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Raman Scattering in Effective Field Theory: a Scalar Tidal Matching at $\mathcal{O}(G^3)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework to compute amplitudes for the gravitational analog of the Raman process, a quasi-elastic scattering of waves off compact objects, in worldline effective field theory (EFT). As an example, we calculate third post-Minkowskian (PM) order ($\mathcal{O}(G^3)$), or two-loop, phase shifts for the scattering of a massless scalar field including all tidal effects and dissipation. Our calculation unveils two sources of the classical renormalization-group flow of dynamical Love numbers: a universal running independent of the nature of the compact object, and a running self-induced by tides. Restricting to the black hole case, we find that our EFT phase shifts agree exactly with those from general relativity, provided that the relevant static Love numbers are set to zero. In addition, we carry out a complete matching of the leading scalar dynamical Love number required to renormalize a universal short scale divergence in the S-wave. Our results pave the way for systematic calculations of gravitational Raman scattering at higher PM orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04076v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to explore the interplay between neutrinos and quantum gravity, illustrating some proposals about the use of these particles as probes for the supposed quantized structure of spacetime. The residual signatures of a more fundamental theory of quantum gravity can manifest themselves modifying the free particle dispersion relations and the connected velocity. In neutrino sector these supposed effects can modify the time of flight for astrophysical particles with different energies and can affect the usual neutrino oscillation pattern introducing species depending perturbations. We will highlight how perturbations caused by non-standard interactions in the solar neutrino sector can mimic the presumed quantum gravity effects. In fact, the mathematical formulation of non-standard interactions is equivalent to that of CPT-odd perturbations. We will, therefore, emphasize the need to identify the nature of different contributions in order to disentangle them in the search for quantum gravity effects. As a final point we will discuss the possibility to detect in the neutrino sector decoherence effects caused by the quantum gravity supposed perturbations. By reviewing current experimental constraints and observations, we seek to shed light on the intricate relationship between neutrinos and quantum gravity, and discuss the challenges and future directions in this fascinating field of research.</description>

Abstract: The long-standing puzzle of the quenched $g_A$ in nuclei is shown to have an extremely simple resolution in a renormalization-group (RG) treatment of a hidden local symmetric (HLS) and scale-symmetric (HSS) chiral Lagrangian. It is shown that the Landau-Migdal fixed-point approximation in nuclear matter (or $V_{lowk}$ in finite nuclei) in RG approach to strong correlations of fermionic hadrons on the Fermi surface {\it exactly} reproduces the superallowed Gamow-Teller transitions in the ``Extreme Single-Particle (shell-)Model (ESPM)" in doubly-magic closed shell nuclei. One arrives at the quenching factor $q\approx 0.78$ giving the quenched $g_A^{\rm eff} \approx 1$. This resolution exposes scale-chiral symmetry, hidden in QCD in the vacuum, emerging in nuclear matter from low density to high compact-star density. It has important implications on ``first principles" approaches to nuclear physics, such as the role of multi-body exchange currents in weak axial-current matrix elements in nuclei and in neutrinoless double $\beta$ decays for going Beyond the Standard Model. This resolution could put in serious doubt the most recent improved measurement of the superallowed Gamow-Teller transition in the doubly-magic closed shell nucleus $^{100}$Sn which if confirmed would require a ``{\it fundamental quenching}" $q_{ssb}\sim 1/2$.</description>

      <title>Infrared Sensitivity of Cosmological Probes In The Presence of Axion Field Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of long wavelength entropy fluctuations on cosmological probes such as galaxy clustering, luminosity distance, and CMB temperature anisotropies. Specifically, we consider fluctuations of a massless spectator scalar field set up in the early universe, which later acquires mass during the radiation-dominated era. We find that there are non-vanishing effects on observables, and the amplitude of these effects peaks for observables set up at the time of equal matter and radiation, and decreases as $\eta^{-2}$ where $\eta$ is the conformal time. Hence, the back-reaction effects are important for CMB anisotropies, but their impact on late-time observables is suppressed. In particular, the back-reaction effects are unable to explain the Hubble tension while they might alleviate the cosmic dipole tension. In contrast to a lot of the previous work on back-reaction, we work in position rather than momentum space.</description>

      <title>The Gauge Theory of Weyl Group and its Interpretation as Weyl Quadratic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we give an extensive description of Weyl quadratic gravity as the gauge theory of the Weyl group. The previously discovered (vectorial) torsion/non-metricity equivalence is shown to be built-in as it corresponds to a redefinition of the generators of the Weyl group. We present a generalisation of the torsion/non-metricity duality which includes, aside from the vector, also a traceless 3-tensor with two antisymmetric indices and vanishing skew symmetric part. A discussion of this relation in the case of minimally coupled matter fields is given. We further point out that a Rarita-Schwinger field can couple minimally to all the components of torsion and some components of non-metricity. Alongside we present the same gauge construction for the Poincar\'e and conformal groups. We show that even though the Weyl group is a subgroup of the conformal group, the gauge theory of the latter is actually only a special case of Weyl quadratic gravity.</description>

      <title>Simulating realistic self-interacting dark matter models including small and large-angle scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) self-interactions alter the matter distribution on galactic scales and alleviate tensions with observations. A feature of the self-interaction cross section is its angular dependence, influencing offsets between galaxies and DM halos in merging galaxy clusters. While algorithms for modelling mostly forward-dominated or mostly large-angle scatterings exist, incorporating realistic angular dependencies, such as light mediator models, within $N$-body simulations remains challenging. We develop, validate and apply a novel and efficient method, combining existing approaches to describe small- and large-angle scattering regimes within a hybrid scheme. Below a critical angle the effective description via a drag force combined with transverse momentum diffusion is used, while above the angle dependence is sampled explicitly. First, we verify the scheme using a test set-up with known analytical solutions, and check that our results are insensitive to the choice of the critical angle within an expected range. Next, we demonstrate that our scheme speeds up the computations by multiple orders of magnitude for realistic light mediator models. Finally, we apply the method to galaxy cluster mergers and discuss the sensitivity of the offset between galaxies and DM to the angle dependence of the cross section. Our scheme ensures accurate offsets for mediator mass $m_\phi$ and DM mass $m_\chi$ within the range $0.1v/c\lesssim m_\phi/m_\chi\lesssim v/c$, while for larger (smaller) mass ratios the offsets obtained for isotropic (forward-dominated) self-scattering are approached. Here $v$ is the typical velocity scale. Equivalently, the upper condition can be expressed as $1.1\lesssim \sigma_{\rm tot}/\sigma_{\mathrm{\widetilde{T}}}\lesssim 10$ for the ratio of the total and momentum transfer cross sections, with the ratio being $1$ ($\infty$) in the isotropic (forward-dominated) limits.</description>

      <title>An upper limit to the lifetime of stellar remnants from gravitational pair production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black holes are assumed to decay via Hawking radiation. Recently we found evidence that spacetime curvature alone without the need for an event horizon leads to black hole evaporation. Here we investigate the evaporation rate and decay time of a non-rotating star of constant density due to spacetime curvature-induced pair production and apply this to compact stellar remnants such as neutron stars and white dwarfs. We calculate the creation of virtual pairs of massless scalar particles in spherically symmetric asymptotically flat curved spacetimes. This calculation is based on covariant perturbation theory with the quantum field representing, e.g.,\ gravitons or photons. We find that in this picture the evaporation timescale, $\tau$, of massive objects scales with the average mass density, $\rho$, as $\tau\propto\rho^{-3/2}$. The maximum age of neutron stars, $\tau\sim 10^{68}\,\text{yr}$, is comparable to that of low-mass stellar black holes. White dwarfs, supermassive black holes, and dark matter supercluster halos evaporate on longer, but also finite timescales. Neutron stars and white dwarfs decay similarly to black holes, ending in an explosive event when they become unstable. This sets a general upper limit for the lifetime of matter in the universe, which in general is much longer than the Hubble--Lema\^itre time, although primordial objects with densities above $\rho_\text{max} \approx 3\times 10^{53}\,\text{g/}\text{cm}^3$ should have dissolved by now. As a consequence, fossil stellar remnants from a previous universe could be present in our current universe only if the recurrence time of star forming universes is smaller than about $\sim 10^{68}\,\text{years}$.</description>

      <title>Centre vortex evidence for a second finite-temperature QCD transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evidence for the existence of a second finite-temperature transition in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is obtained through the study of centre vortex geometry and its evolution with temperature. The dynamical anisotropic ensembles of the FASTSUM Collaboration are utilised to conduct a comprehensive analysis at eight temperatures beyond the established chiral transition. Visualisations of the centre vortex structure in temporal and spatial slices of the lattice reveal that vortex percolation persists through the chiral transition and ceases at a temperature that is approximately twice the chiral transition temperature $T_c$. This implies that confinement is retained through temperatures up to $T \approx 2\,T_c$, pointing toward a second transition corresponding to deconfinement. The loss of percolation is quantified by the vortex cluster extent, providing a clear signal for the deconfinement transition. Additional vortex statistics, including temporal correlations, vortex and branching point densities, the number of secondary clusters and vortex chain lengths between branching points, are scrutinised as a function of temperature. All ten measures investigated herein show the characteristics of two transitions in QCD, encompassing the chiral transition at $T_c$ and the deconfinement transition at $T \approx 2\,T_c$. Performing an inflection point analysis on the vortex and branching point densities produces an estimate of $T_c$ that agrees with the known FASTSUM value. By the same procedure, a precise estimate of the deconfinement point is extracted as $T_d = 321(6)\,$MeV.</description>

      <title>Toward extracting scattering phase shift from integrated correlation functions III: coupled-channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formalism developed in Refs.\cite{Guo:2023ecc,Guo:2024zal} that connects integrated correlation function of a trapped two-particle system to infinite volume scattering phase shift is further extended to coupled-channel systems in the present work. Using a trapped non-relativistic two-channel system as an example, a new relation is derived that retains the same structure as in the single channel, and has explicit dependence on the phase shifts in both channels but not on the inelasticity. The relation is illustrated by an exactly solvable coupled-channel quantum mechanical model with contact interactions. It is further validated by path integral Monte Carlo simulation of a quasi-one-dimensional model that can admit general interaction potentials. In all cases, we found rapid convergence to the infinite volume limit as the trap size is increased, even at short times, making it potentially a good candidate to overcome signal-to-noise issues in Monte Carlo applications.</description>

Abstract: Formulating a quantum theory of gravity lies at the heart of fundamental theoretical physics. This collection of lecture notes encompasses a selection of topics that were covered in six mini-courses at the Nordita PhD school "Towards Quantum Gravity". The scope was to provide a coherent picture, from its foundation to forefront research, emphasizing connections between different areas. The lectures begin with perturbative quantum gravity and effective field theory. Subsequently, two ultraviolet-complete approaches are presented: asymptotically safe gravity and string theory. Finally, elements of quantum effects in black hole spacetimes are discussed.</description>

Abstract: To deepen our understanding of Quantum Gravity and its connections with black holes and cosmology, building a common language and exchanging ideas across different approaches is crucial. The Nordita Program "Quantum Gravity: from gravitational effective field theories to ultraviolet complete approaches" created a platform for extensive discussions, aimed at pinpointing both common grounds and sources of disagreements, with the hope of generating ideas and driving progress in the field. This contribution summarizes the twelve topical discussions held during the program and collects individual thoughts of speakers and panelists on the future of the field in light of these discussions.</description>

      <title>Searching for New Physics in Ultradense Environment: a Review on Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron Stars (NSs), among the densest objects in the Universe, are exceptional laboratories for investigating Dark Matter (DM) properties. Recent theoretical and observational developments have heightened interest in exploring the impact of DM on NS structure, giving rise to the concept of Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars (DANSs). This review examines how NSs can accumulate DM over time, potentially altering their fundamental properties. We explore leading models describing DM behavior within NSs, focusing on the effects of both bosonic and fermionic candidates on key features such as mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Additionally, we review how DM can modify the cooling and heating processes, trigger the formation of a black hole, and impact Gravitational Waves (GWs) emissions from binary systems. By synthesizing recent research, this work highlights how DANSs might produce observable signatures, offering new opportunities to probe DM properties through astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Interference in Fuzzy Dark Matter Filaments: Idealised Models and Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fuzzy (wave) dark matter (FDM), the dynamical model underlying an ultralight bosonic dark matter species, produces a rich set of non-gravitational signatures that distinguishes it markedly from the phenomenologically related warm (particle) dark matter (WDM) scenario. The emergence of extended interference fringes hosted by cosmic filaments is one such phenomenon reported by cosmological simulations, and a detailed understanding of such may strengthen existing limits on the boson mass but also break the degeneracy with WDM, and provide a unique fingerprint of interference in cosmology. In this paper, we provide initial steps towards this goal. In particular, we show in a bottom-up approach, how the presence of interference in an idealised filament population can lead to a non-suppressive feature in the matter power spectrum -- an observation supported by fully-cosmological FDM simulations. To this end, we build on a theoretically motivated and numerically observed steady-state approximation for filaments and express the equilibrium dynamics of such in an expansion of FDM eigenstates. We optimise the size of the expansion by incorporating classical phase-space information. Ellipsoidal collapse considerations are used to construct a fuzzy filament mass function which, together with the reconstructed FDM wave function, allow us to efficiently compute the one-filament power spectrum. We showcase our non-perturbative interference model for a selection of boson masses and confirm our approach is able to produce the matter power boost observed in fully-cosmological FDM simulations. More precisely, we find an excess in correlation between the spatial scale associated with the FDM ground state and the quantum pressure scale. We speculate about applications of this effect in data analysis.</description>

      <title>Renormalon-like factorial enhancements to power expansion/OPE expansion in super-renormalizable QFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02031v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the issue regarding the asymptotic behavior of power-expansion/OPE-expansion in supper-renormalizable theory. Using an $O(N)$-model with $N$-components scalars coupled through quartic interaction at the next-to-leading $\frac{1}{N}$ order in the large-$N$ expansion, we show that the IR subtractions cause addition factorial enhancements for high order/power terms in the coefficient functions. Moreover, there are also factorial enhancements for the operator condensates, and the factorial enhancements cancel between coefficient functions and operators only off-diagonally across different powers. The factorial enhancements can be both alternating and non-alternating. The former are similar to ``UV renormalon'' of coefficient functions and cancel with factorial enhancements of operators at lower powers in diagrams with negative degrees of UV divergences. The latter are similar to ``IR renormalon'' and cancel with factorial enhancements of higher dimensional renormalized operators in diagrams with positive degrees of UV divergences. The factorial enhancement itself will render the momentum-space power expansion divergent.</description>

      <title>Violation of non-Abelian Bianchi identity and QCD topology -- An Abelian mechanism without instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When Abelian monopoles due to violation of the non-Abelian Bianchi identity J{\mu}(x) condense in the vacuum, color confinement of QCD is realized by the Abelian dual Meissner effect. Recently VNABI affects also topological features of QCD drastically. Firstly, self-dual instantons can not be a classical solution of QCD. Secondly, the topological charge density is not expressed by a total derivative of the Chern-Simons density K{\mu}(x), but has an additional term L(x)=2Tr(J{\mu}(x)A{\mu}(x)). Thirdly, the axial U(1) anomaly is similarly modified, while keeping the Atiyah-Singer index theorem unchanged. These suggest that the Abelian mechanism based on the Abelian monopoles from VNABI play an important role in these topological quantities instead of instantons. The additional term L(x) is evaluated in the framework of Monte-Carlo simulations on SU(2) lattices in details with partial gauge fixings such as the Maximal Center gauge (MCG) and the Maximal Abelian +U(1) gauge (MAU1) in addition to the gradient flow. The additional term tends to vanish after small gradient flow time ({\tau}) when infrared monopoles responsible for color confinement are also suppressed. The topological charge Qt and its Abelian counterpart Qa are discussed also on lattice. Theoretically Qa(A)=3Qt(A) is expected, but a simple lattice definition of Qa(A) is fluctuating between -2 and -3 in MCG and around -2 in MAU1 in a typical configuration where Qt(A) is stabilized around -1 after the flow time {\tau} is larger than 2.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of an unidentified point-like ultra-high-energy (UHE) $\gamma$-ray source, designated as 1LHAASO J1740+0948u, situated in the vicinity of the middle-aged pulsar PSR J1740+1000. The detection significance reached 17.1$\sigma$ (9.4$\sigma$) above 25$\,$TeV (100$\,$TeV). The source energy spectrum extended up to 300$\,$TeV, which was well fitted by a log-parabola function with $N0 = (1.93\pm0.23) \times 10^{-16} \rm{TeV^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-2}}$, $\alpha = 2.14\pm0.27$, and $\beta = 1.20\pm0.41$ at E0 = 30$\,$TeV. The associated pulsar, PSR J1740+1000, resides at a high galactic latitude and powers a bow-shock pulsar wind nebula (BSPWN) with an extended X-ray tail. The best-fit position of the gamma-ray source appeared to be shifted by $0.2^{\circ}$ with respect to the pulsar position. As the (i) currently identified pulsar halos do not demonstrate such offsets, and (ii) centroid of the gamma-ray emission is approximately located at the extension of the X-ray tail, we speculate that the UHE $\gamma$-ray emission may originate from re-accelerated electron/positron pairs that are advected away in the bow-shock tail.</description>

      <title>Projective imaging of high-energy nuclei through coherent exclusive vector meson production in electron-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15596</link>

Abstract: One of the major goals of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is to better understand the distributions of quarks and gluons inside nuclei at high-energy. A principal measurement is coherent exclusive vector meson (VM) production in diffractive $eA$ collisions. The gluon spatial distribution inside the nucleus can be obtained through a Fourier transform of the nuclear momentum transfer ($|t|$) distribution for these VMs. However, the $|t|$ distribution is one of the most challenging measurements at the EIC. This research aims to overcome one of the main obstacles in this measurement: limited precision in measuring $|t|$, making it difficult to resolve the diffractive pattern from coherent events. We employ a method for reconstructing $|t|$ by utilizing the electron beam polarization in $eA$ collisions and measuring the projected $|t|$ distribution to overcome this complication. Through the study of diffractive VM production, we carry out an experimental simulation of how the detector effect would change the extracted nuclear geometry and how to use projective techniques to avoid defects. This technique will allow us to measure the diffractive pattern in coherent events more precisely, providing a potential solution for a critical measurement that is difficult for the EIC baseline detector.</description>
