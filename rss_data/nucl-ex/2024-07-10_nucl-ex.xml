      <title>The Proton Electromagnetic Generalized Polarizabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electromagnetic polarizabilities are fundamental properties of the proton that characterize its response to an external EM field. The generalization of the EM polarizabilities to non-zero four-momentum transfer opens up a powerful path to study the internal structure of the proton. They map out the spatial distribution of the polarization densities in the proton, provide access to key dynamical mechanisms that contribute to the electric and the magnetic polarizability effects, and allow to determine fundamental characteristics of the system, such as the electric and the magnetic polarizability radii. This article reviews the knowledge of the proton EM generalized polarizabilities. An introduction is given to the basic concepts and to the theoretical framework, that is then followed by a discussion that emphasizes the recent developments and findings of the Virtual Compton scattering experiments and future perspectives on the topic.</description>

      <title>Flattenicity as "centrality" estimator in p-Pb collisions simulated with PYTHIA 8.312 Angantyr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a "centrality" estimator based on flattenicity ($\rho$) is studied in proton-led (p-Pb) collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV using PYTHIA 8 Angantyr. Although Angantyr is still under development, the existing implementation is enough to study the particle production in systems where medium effects are absent. Firstly, ALICE data on pseudorapidity distributions as a function of the forward multiplicity (V0M), as well as transverse momentum distributions of identified particles in non-single diffractive p-Pb collisions, are compared with Angantyr. Secondly, the average number of binary nucleon-nucleon ($N_{\rm coll}$) collisions for different "centrality" estimators are compared. The studies include the following "centrality" estimators: V0M, $\rho$ and midrapidity multiplicity (CL1). On one hand, the "centrality" dependence of $\langle N_{\rm coll} \rangle$ for the $\rho$ selection shows the smallest deviations ($&lt;8$ %) with respect to that obtained using impact parameter $b$; on the other hand, the V0M and CL1 yield huge deviations (up to a factor 2) with respect to the results using $b$. The particle ratios and nuclear modification factors ($Q_{\rm pPb}$) as a function of $p_{\rm T}$ are also studied. The proton-to-pion ratio exhibits a flow-like peak at intermediate $p_{\rm T}$ (2-8 GeV/$c$) with little or no "centrality" dependence for V0M, $\rho$ and $b$ selections. The kaon-to-pion ratio as a function of $p_{\rm T}$ is "centrality" independent for the same selections. On the contrary, for the CL1 class the ratios exhibit the typical behaviour associated with hard physics. Regarding $Q_{\rm pPb}$, a peak at intermediate $p_{\rm T}$ ($2-8$ GeV/$c$) for different particle species is observed when the "centrality" is obtained with $b$ or $\rho$. The observed features diminish for the selections based on V0M and CL1.</description>

      <title>Deep(er) Reconstruction of Imaging Cherenkov Detectors with Swin Transformers and Normalizing Flow Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaging Cherenkov detectors are crucial for particle identification (PID) in nuclear and particle physics experiments. Fast reconstruction algorithms are essential for near real-time alignment, calibration, data quality control, and efficient analysis. At the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), the ePIC detector will feature a dual Ring Imaging Cherenkov (dual-RICH) detector in the hadron direction, a Detector of Internally Reflected Cherenkov (DIRC) in the barrel, and a proximity focus RICH in the electron direction. This paper focuses on the DIRC detector, which presents complex hit patterns and is also used for PID of pions and kaons in the GlueX experiment at JLab. We present Deep(er)RICH, an extension of the seminal DeepRICH work, offering improved and faster PID compared to traditional methods and, for the first time, fast and accurate simulation. This advancement addresses a major bottleneck in Cherenkov detector simulations involving photon tracking through complex optical elements. Our results leverage advancements in Vision Transformers, specifically hierarchical Swin Transformer and normalizing flows. These methods enable direct learning from real data and the reconstruction of complex topologies. We conclude by discussing the implications and future extensions of this work, which can offer capabilities for PID for multiple cutting-edge experiments like the future EIC.</description>

      <title>Probe and Prejudice: Classification of compact objects and model comparison using EOS knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear theory and experiments, alongside astrophysical observations, constrain the equation of state (EOS) of supranuclear-dense matter. Conversely, knowledge of the EOS allows an improved interpretation of nuclear or astrophysical data. In this article, we use several established constraints on the EOS and the new NICER measurement of PSR J0437-4715 to comment on the nature of the primary companion in GW230529 and the companion of PSR J0514-4002E. We find that, with a probability of $\gtrsim 84\%$ and $\gtrsim 68\%$, respectively, both objects are black holes. These likelihoods increase to above $95\%$ when one uses GW170817's remnant as an upper limit on the TOV mass. We also demonstrate that the current knowledge of the EOS substantially disfavors high masses and radii for PSR J0030+0451, inferred recently when combining NICER with XMM-Newton background data and using particular hot-spot models. Finally, we also use our obtained EOS knowledge to comment on measurements of the nuclear symmetry energy, finding that the large value predicted by the PREX-II measurement displays some mild tension with other constraints on the EOS.</description>

      <title>An improved method to access initial states in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.05157v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observables in heavy-ion collisions are generally categorized into centralities, which reflect an average over events within a range of impact parameter including a wide variety of initial state configurations. A multiple binning method using spectator neutrons within each centrality has been previously shown to provide access to events with rare initial state conditions. This work suggests an improvement in quantifying the difference between standard centrality and spectator neutron binning towards accessing the initial state properties. A selection of events with higher initial state density at fixed participating nucleon number was observed to result in larger final state particle production and smaller elliptic flow. The relative difference between observables in centrality and spectator binning shows reduced sensitivity for the observables dominated by impact parameter fluctuations in initial state such as triangular flow. This property makes the spectator binning method a good candidate to separate geometric contributions from random fluctuations in initial state towards final state observables.</description>

      <title>Elliptic flow of identified hadrons in Au+Au collisions at $E_{lab} = 35\mathrm{~A~GeV}$ using the PHSD model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present elliptic flow ($v_2$) of identified hadrons at mid-rapidity ($|y| &lt; 1.0$) in Au+Au collisions at $E_{lab} = 35\mathrm{~A~GeV}$ using the Parton Hadron String Dynamics (PHSD) model. Transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) dependence of identified hadron $v_2$ in minimum bias (0-80%) and three different centrality intervals (0-10%, 10-40%, and 40-80%) are presented. A clear centrality dependence of $v_2(p_\mathrm{T})$ is observed for particles and anti-particles in Au+Au collisions at $E_{lab} = 35\mathrm{~A~GeV}$. We also present $p_\mathrm{T}$ dependence of $v_2$ difference ($\mathrm{\Delta} v_2$) between particles and corresponding antiparticles. A significant difference in $v_2$ values for baryons and anti-baryons is observed. The number of constituent quark (NCQ) scaling of $v_2$ is discussed in Au+Au collisions at $E_{lab} = 35\mathrm{~A~GeV}$. We also present ratio of $v_2(p_\mathrm{T})$ between the HSD and PHSD modes to explore the effect of hadronic and partonic interactions in the medium. We observe higher $v_2$ in PHSD mode than the HSD mode, which suggests the formation of partonic medium in Au+Au collisions at $E_{lab} = 35\mathrm{~A~GeV}$. These predictions are useful for the interpretation of data measured in Beam Energy Scan (BES) program at RHIC and will be useful for the future Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR).</description>

      <title>Precision mass measurements in the zirconium region pin down the mass surface across the neutron midshell at $N=66$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12107v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precision mass measurements of $^{104}$Y, $^{106}$Zr, $^{104,104m,109}$Nb, and $^{111,112}$Mo have been performed with the JYFLTRAP double Penning trap mass spectrometer at the Ion Guide Isotope Separator On-Line facility. The order of the long-lived states in $^{104}$Nb was unambiguously established. The trend in two-neutron separation energies around the $N=66$ neutron midshell appeared to be steeper with respect to the Atomic Mass Evaluation 2020 extrapolations for the $_{39}$Y and $_{40}$Zr isotopic chains and less steep for the $_{41}$Nb chain, indicating a possible gap opening around $Z=40$. The experimental results were compared to the BSkG2 model calculations performed with and without vibrational and rotational corrections. All of them predict two low-lying minima for $^{106}$Zr. While the unaltered BSkG2 model fails to predict the trend in two-neutron separation energies, selecting the more deformed minima in calculations and removing the vibrational correction, the calculations are more in line with experimental data. The same is also true for the $2^+_1$ excitation energies and differences in charge radii in the Zr isotopes. The results stress the importance of improved treatment of collective corrections in large-scale models and further development of beyond-mean-field techniques.</description>

      <title>On the nature of yrast states in neutron-rich polonium isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03839v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polonium isotopes having two protons above the shell closure at $Z=82$ show a wide variety of low-lying high-spin isomeric states across the whole chain. The structure of neutron-deficient isotopes up to $^{210}$Po ($N=126$) is well established as they are easily produced through various methods. However, there is not much information available for the neutron-rich counterparts for which only selective techniques can be used for their production. We report on the first fast-timing measurements of yrast states up to the 8$^+$ level in $^{214,216,218}$Po isotopes produced in the $\beta^-$ decay of $^{214,216,218}$Bi at ISOLDE, CERN. In particular, our new half-life value of 607(14) ps for the 8$_1^+$ state in $^{214}$Po is nearly 20 times shorter than the one available in literature and comparable with the newly measured half-lives of 409(16) and 628(25) ps for the corresponding 8$_1^+$ states in $^{216,218}$Po, respectively. The measured $B(E2;8_1^+ \to 6_1^+)$ transition probability values follow an increasing trend relative to isotope mass, reaching a maximum for $^{216}$Po. The increase contradicts the previous claims of isomerism for the $8^+$ yrast states in neutron-rich $^{214}$Po and beyond. Together with the other measured yrast transitions, the $B(E2)$ values provide a crucial test of the different theoretical approaches describing the underlying configurations of the yrast band. The new experimental results are compared to shell-model calculations using the KHPE and H208 effective interactions and their pairing modified versions, showing an increase in configuration mixing when moving towards the heavier isotopes.</description>

      <title>Effect of nuclear structure on particle production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions using the AMPT model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report first study of transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) spectra for $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, $p$, and $\bar{p}$ in isobar, $^{96}_{44}$Ru+$^{96}_{44}$Ru and $^{96}_{40}$Zr+$^{96}_{40}$Zr, collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 200$ GeV using a multi-phase transport (AMPT) model. Particle yields ($dN/dy$), average transverse momenta ($\langle p_\mathrm{T} \rangle$), and particle ratios are reported in various collision systems with different parameterizations of the Woods-Saxon (WS) distribution. We observed a maximum difference of 5% in the particle yields in peripheral collisions when we included a quadrupole and octupole deformation and a nuclear size difference between the isobars. The $\pi^{-}$/$\pi^{+}$ ratio is smaller in Ru+Ru collisions compared to Zr+Zr collisions indicating an effect of isospin due to difference in number of protons and neutrons between the two nuclei. The $K^{-}$/$K^{+}$ ratio is same in both the systems indicating the dominance of the pair production mechanism in the kaon production. The $\bar{p}/p$ ratio is further smaller in Ru+Ru collisions than Zr+Zr collisions, indicating the effect of baryon stopping in addition to the isospin effect. A system size dependence is observed in $dN/dy$ and $\langle p_\mathrm{T} \rangle$ when we compare the results from isobar collisions with Au+Au and U+U collisions.</description>
