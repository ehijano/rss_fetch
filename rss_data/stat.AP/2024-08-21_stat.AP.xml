      <title>Bye-Bye, Bye Advantage: Estimating the competitive impact of rest differential in the National Football League</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The National Football League (NFL) sets its regular season schedule to optimize viewership and minimize competitive inequities. One inequity assumed to impact team performance is rest differential, defined as the relative number of days between games. Using Bayesian state space models on both game outcomes and betting market data, we estimate the competitive effect of rest differential in American football. We find that the most commonly referred to inequities -- both the bye week rest advantage and the mini-bye week rest advantage -- currently show no significant evidence of providing the rested team a competitive edge. Further, we trace a decline in the advantage of a bye week to a 2011 change to the NFL's Collective Bargaining Agreement, which represents a natural experiment to test the relevance of rest and preparation in football. Prior to the agreement, NFL teams off a bye week received a significant advantage (+2.2 points per game), but since 2011, that benefit has been mitigated.</description>

      <title>More Options for Prelabor Rupture of Membranes, A Bayesian Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An obstetric goal for a laboring mother is to achieve a vaginal delivery as it reduces the risks inherent in major abdominal surgery (i.e., a Cesarean section). Various medical interventions may be used by a physician to increase the likelihood of this occurring while minimizing maternal and fetal morbidity. However, patients with prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) have only two commonly used options for cervical ripening, Pitocin and misoprostol. Little research exists on the benefits/risks for these two key drugs for PROM patients. A major limitation with most induction-of-labor related research is the inability to account for differences in \textit{Bishop scores} that are commonly used in obstetrical practice to determine the next induction agent offered to the patient. This creates a confounding factor, which biases the results, but has not been realized in the literature. In this work, we use a Bayesian model of the relationships between the relevant factors, informed by expert physicians, to separate the confounding variable from its actual impact. In doing so, we provide strong evidence that pitocin and buccal misoprostol are equally effective and safe; thus, physicians have more choice in clinical care than previously realized. This is particularly important for developing countries where neither medication may be readily available, and prior guidelines may create an artificial barrier to needed medication.</description>

      <title>Impossible temperatures are not as rare as you think</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The last decade has seen numerous record-shattering heatwaves in all corners of the globe. In the aftermath of these devastating events, there is interest in identifying worst-case thresholds or upper bounds that quantify just how hot temperatures can become. Generalized Extreme Value theory provides a data-driven estimate of extreme thresholds; however, upper bounds may be exceeded by future events, which undermines attribution and planning for heatwave impacts. Here, we show how the occurrence and relative probability of observed events that exceed a priori upper bound estimates, so-called "impossible" temperatures, has changed over time. We find that many unprecedented events are actually within data-driven upper bounds, but only when using modern spatial statistical methods. Furthermore, there are clear connections between anthropogenic forcing and the "impossibility" of the most extreme temperatures. Robust understanding of heatwave thresholds provides critical information about future record-breaking events and how their extremity relates to historical measurements.</description>

      <title>Can an unsupervised clustering algorithm reproduce a categorization system?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peer analysis is a critical component of investment management, often relying on expert-provided categorization systems. These systems' consistency is questioned when they do not align with cohorts from unsupervised clustering algorithms optimized for various metrics. We investigate whether unsupervised clustering can reproduce ground truth classes in a labeled dataset, showing that success depends on feature selection and the chosen distance metric. Using toy datasets and fund categorization as real-world examples we demonstrate that accurately reproducing ground truth classes is challenging. We also highlight the limitations of standard clustering evaluation metrics in identifying the optimal number of clusters relative to the ground truth classes. We then show that if appropriate features are available in the dataset, and a proper distance metric is known (e.g., using a supervised Random Forest-based distance metric learning method), then an unsupervised clustering can indeed reproduce the ground truth classes as distinct clusters.</description>

      <title>A toolbox for calculating objective image properties in aesthetics research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, researchers in the field of visual aesthetics have studied numerous quantitative (objective) image properties and how they relate to visual aesthetic appreciation. However, results are difficult to compare between research groups. One reason is that researchers use different sets of image properties in their studies. But even if the same properties are used, the image pre-processing techniques may differ and often researchers use their own customized scripts to calculate the image properties. To provide greater accessibility and comparability of research results in visual experimental aesthetics, we developed an open-access and easy-to-use toolbox (called the 'Aesthetics Toolbox'). The Toolbox allows users to calculate a well-defined set of quantitative image properties popular in contemporary research. The properties include lightness and color statistics, Fourier spectral properties, fractality, self-similarity, symmetry, as well as different entropy measures and CNN-based variances. Compatible with most devices, the Toolbox provides an intuitive click-and-drop web interface. In the Toolbox, we integrated the original scripts of four different research groups and translated them into Python 3. To ensure that results were consistent across analyses, we took care that results from the Python versions of the scripts were the same as those from the original scripts. The toolbox, detailed documentation, and a link to the cloud version are available via Github: https://github.com/RBartho/Aesthetics-Toolbox. In summary, we developed a toolbox that helps to standardize and simplify the calculation of quantitative image properties for visual aesthetics research.</description>

      <title>Modelling tree survival for investigating climate change effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.02247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using German forest health monitoring data we investigate the main drivers leading to tree mortality and the association between defoliation and mortality; in particular (a) whether defoliation is a proxy for other covariates (climate, soil, water budget); (b) whether defoliation is a tree response that mitigates the effects of climate change and (c) whether there is a threshold of defoliation which could be used as an early warning sign for irreversible damage.
  Results show that environmental drivers leading to tree mortality differ by species, but some are always required in the model. The defoliation effect on mortality differs by species but it is always strong and monotonic. There is some evidence that a defoliation threshold exists for spruce, fir and beech.
  We model tree survival with a smooth additive Cox model allowing for random effects taking care of dependence between neighbouring trees and non-linear functions of spatial time varying and functional predictors on defoliation, climate, soil and hydrology characteristics. Due to the large sample size and large number of parameters, we use parallel computing combined with marginal discretization of covariates. We propose a 'boost forward penalise backward' model selection scheme based on combining component-wise gradient boosting with integrated backward selection.</description>

      <title>The short-term association between environmental variables and mortality: evidence from Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using fine-grained, publicly available data, this paper studies the short-term association between environmental factors, i.e., weather and air pollution characteristics, and weekly mortality rates in small geographical regions in Europe. Hereto, we develop a mortality modeling framework where a baseline model describes a region-specific, seasonal trend observed within the historical weekly mortality rates. Using a machine learning algorithm, we then explain deviations from this baseline using features constructed from environmental data to identify anomalies and extreme events. We illustrate our proposed modeling framework through a case study on more than 550 NUTS 3 regions (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics, level 3) in 20 European countries. Using interpretation tools, we unravel insights into which environmental features are most important when estimating excess or deficit mortality relative to the baseline and explore how these features interact. Moreover, we investigate harvesting effects through our constructed weekly mortality modelling framework. Our findings show that temperature-related features are most influential in explaining mortality deviations from the baseline over short time periods. Furthermore, we find that environmental features prove particularly beneficial in southern regions for explaining elevated levels of mortality, and we observe evidence for a harvesting effect related to heat waves.</description>

      <title>Maintaining the validity of inference from linear mixed models in stepped-wedge cluster randomized trials under misspecified random-effects structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07248v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear mixed models are commonly used in analyzing stepped-wedge cluster randomized trials (SW-CRTs). A key consideration for analyzing a SW-CRT is accounting for the potentially complex correlation structure, which can be achieved by specifying a random effects structure. Common random effects structures for a SW-CRT include random intercept, random cluster-by-period, and discrete-time decay. Recently, more complex structures, such as the random intervention structure, have been proposed. In practice, specifying appropriate random effects can be challenging. Robust variance estimators (RVE) may be applied to linear mixed models to provide consistent estimators of standard errors of fixed effect parameters in the presence of random-effects misspecification. However, there has been no empirical investigation of RVE for SW-CRT. In this paper, we first review five RVEs (both standard and small-sample bias-corrected RVEs) that are available for linear mixed models. We then describe a comprehensive simulation study to examine the performance of these RVEs for SW-CRTs with a continuous outcome under different data generators. For each data generator, we investigate whether the use of a RVE with either the random intercept model or the random cluster-by-period model is sufficient to provide valid statistical inference for fixed effect parameters, when these working models are subject to misspecification. Our results indicate that the random intercept and random cluster-by-period models with RVEs performed similarly. The CR3 RVE estimator, coupled with the number of clusters minus two degrees of freedom correction, consistently gave the best coverage results, but could be slightly conservative when the number of clusters was below 16. We summarize the implications of our results for linear mixed model analysis of SW-CRTs in practice.</description>

      <title>Treatment bootstrapping: A new approach to quantify uncertainty of average treatment effect estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11683v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new non-parametric bootstrap method to quantify the uncertainty of average treatment effect estimate for the treated from matching estimators. More specifically, it seeks to quantify the uncertainty associated with the average treatment effect estimate for the treated by bootstrapping the treatment group only and finding the counterpart control group by pair matching on estimated propensity score without replacement. We demonstrate the validity of this approach and compare it with existing bootstrap approaches through Monte Carlo simulation and analysis of a real world data set. The results indicate that the proposed approach constructs confidence intervals and standard errors that have 95 percent or above coverage rate and better precision compared with existing bootstrap approaches, while these measures also depend on percent treated in the sample data and the sample size.</description>

      <title>Tree balance in phylogenetic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05185v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tree shape statistics, particularly measures of tree (im)balance, play an important role in the analysis of the shape of phylogenetic trees. With applications ranging from testing evolutionary models to studying the impact of fertility inheritance and selection, or tumor development and language evolution, the assessment of measures of tree balance is important. Currently, a multitude of at least 30 (im)balance indices can be found in the literature, alongside numerous other tree shape statistics.
  This diversity prompts essential questions: How can we assist researchers to choose only a small number of indices to mitigate the challenges of multiple testing? Is there a preeminent balance index tailored to specific tasks?
  This research expands previous studies on the examination of index power, encompassing almost all established indices and a broader array of alternative models, such as a variety of trait-based models. Our investigation reveals distinct groups of balance indices better suited for different tree models, suggesting that decisions on balance index selection can be enhanced with prior knowledge. Furthermore, we present the \textsf{R} software package \textsf{poweRbal} which allows the inclusion of new indices and models, thus facilitating future research on the power of tree shape statistics.</description>

      <title>NIRVAR: Network Informed Restricted Vector Autoregression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional panels of time series arise in many scientific disciplines such as neuroscience, finance, and macroeconomics. Often, co-movements within groups of the panel components occur. Extracting these groupings from the data provides a course-grained description of the complex system in question and can inform subsequent prediction tasks. We develop a novel methodology to model such a panel as a restricted vector autoregressive process, where the coefficient matrix is the weighted adjacency matrix of a stochastic block model. This network time series model, which we call the Network Informed Restricted Vector Autoregression (NIRVAR) model, yields a coefficient matrix that has a sparse block-diagonal structure. We propose an estimation procedure that embeds each panel component in a low-dimensional latent space and clusters the embedded points to recover the blocks of the coefficient matrix. Crucially, the method allows for network-based time series modelling when the underlying network is unobserved. We derive the bias, consistency and asymptotic normality of the NIRVAR estimator. Simulation studies suggest that the NIRVAR estimated embedded points are Gaussian distributed around the ground truth latent positions. On three applications to finance, macroeconomics, and transportation systems, NIRVAR outperforms competing models in terms of prediction and provides interpretable results regarding group recovery.</description>
