      <title>Sub-Scalp EEG for Sensorimotor Brain-Computer Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: To establish sub-scalp electroencephalography (EEG) as a viable option for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, particularly for chronic use, by demonstrating its effectiveness in recording and classifying sensorimotor neural activity. Approach: Two experiments were conducted in this study. The first aim was to demonstrate the high spatial resolution of sub-scalp EEG through analysis of somatosensory evoked potentials in sheep models. The second focused on the practical application of sub-scalp EEG, classifying motor execution using data collected during a sheep behavioural experiment. Main Results: We successfully demonstrated the recording of sensorimotor rhythms using sub-scalp EEG in sheep models. Important spatial, temporal, and spectral features of these signals were identified, and we were able to classify motor execution with above-chance performance. These results are comparable to previous work that investigated signal quality and motor execution classification using ECoG and endovascular arrays in sheep models. Significance: These results suggest that sub-scalp EEG may provide signal quality that approaches that of more invasive neural recording methods such as ECoG and endovascular arrays, and support the use of sub-scalp EEG for chronic BCI applications.</description>

      <title>Interference-Aware Multiuser Hybrid Precoding for Coexistence with LEO Satellite Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interference from terrestrial networks can reduce the communication rate for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites in the upper mid-band. To coexist in frequency, MIMO precoding can be used to reduce the signal that impinges on the LEO satellite. We present a beamforming algorithm designed for the hybrid architecture that incorporates a satellite interference penalty while optimizing the analog and digital precoders. Our algorithm optimizes the precoding at the base station (BS) within the set of precoders that null the interference to the satellite. Simulations demonstrate that our algorithm reduces the interference at the satellites and lowers the probability of violating prescribed LEO satellite protection thresholds, outperforming prior hybrid nulling algorithms. Results indicate that the algorithm maintains sum-rate within 3\% of the existing hybrid solutions, while effectively improving interference to noise power by 22.4 dB.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The System to Augment Restorative Sleep (StARS) is a modular hardware/software platform designed for real-time sleep monitoring and intervention. Utilizing the compact DCM biosignal device, StARS captures electrophysiological signals (EEG, EMG, EOG) and synchronizes sensor data using the ezmsg real-time software framework. StARS supports interventions such as closed-loop auditory stimulation and dynamic thermal modulation guided by sleep-stage decoding via advanced neural network models and transfer learning. Configurable with a lightweight EEG forehead patch or wearable sensors like smart rings, StARS offers flexible, low-burden solutions for EEG, BCI, and sleep-enhancement research and applications.

      <title>Minimally Invasive Brain Computer Interfaces: Evaluating the Impact of Tissue Layers on Signal Quality of Sub-Scalp EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individuals with severe physical disabilities often experience diminished quality of life stemming from limited ability to engage with their surroundings. Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology aims to bridge this gap by enabling direct technology interaction. However, current BCI systems require invasive procedures, such as craniotomy or implantation of electrodes through blood vessels, posing significant risks to patients. Sub-scalp electroencephalography (EEG) offers a lower risk alternative. This study investigates the signal quality of sub-scalp EEG recordings from various depths in a sheep model, and compares results with other methods: ECoG and endovascular arrays. A computational model was also constructed to investigate the factors underlying variations in electrode performance. We demonstrate that peg electrodes placed within the sub-scalp space can achieve visual evoked potential signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) approaching that of ECoG. Endovascular arrays exhibited SNR comparable to electrodes positioned on the periosteum. Furthermore, sub-scalp recordings captured high gamma neural activity, with maximum bandwidth ranging from 120 Hz to 180 Hz depending on electrode depth. These findings support the use of sub-scalp EEG for BCI applications, and provide valuable insights for future sub-scalp electrode design. This data lays the groundwork for human trials, ultimately paving the way for chronic, in-home BCIs that empower individuals with physical disabilities.</description>

      <title>High-Speed Ultra-Energy-Efficient Memristor-Based Massive MIMO SIC Detector Circuit with Hybrid Analog-Digital Computing Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging memristor crossbar array based computing circuits exhibit computing speeds and energy efficiency far surpassing those of traditional digital processors. This type of circuits can complete high-dimensional matrix operations in an extremely short time through analog computing, making it naturally applicable to linear detection and maximum likelihood detection in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, the challenge of employing memristor crossbar arrays to efficiently implement other nonlinear detection algorithms, such as the successive interference cancellation (SIC) algorithm, remains unresolved. In this paper we propose a memristor-based circuit design for massive MIMO SIC detector. The proposed circuit comprises several judiciously designed analog matrix computing modules and hybrid analog-digital slicers, which enables the proposed circuit to perform the SIC algorithm with a hybrid analog-digital computing architecture. We show that the computing speed and the computational energy-efficiency of the proposed detector circuit are 43 times faster and 110 times higher, respectively, than those of a traditional 8-core digital signal processor (DSP), and also advantageous over the benchmark high-performance field programmable gate array (FPGA) and graphics processing unit (GPU).</description>

      <title>A Generalized Graph Signal Processing Framework for Multiple Hypothesis Testing over Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the multiple hypothesis testing (MHT) problem over the joint domain formed by a graph and a measure space. On each sample point of this joint domain, we assign a hypothesis test and a corresponding $p$-value. The goal is to make decisions for all hypotheses simultaneously, using all available $p$-values. In practice, this problem resembles the detection problem over a sensor network during a period of time. To solve this problem, we extend the traditional two-groups model such that the prior probability of the null hypothesis and the alternative distribution of $p$-values can be inhomogeneous over the joint domain. We model the inhomogeneity via a generalized graph signal. This more flexible statistical model yields a more powerful detection strategy by leveraging the information from the joint domain.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Prediction of Electric Vehicle Charging Load Based on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of EVs and the subsequent increase in charging demand pose significant challenges for load grid scheduling and the operation of EV charging stations. Effectively harnessing the spatiotemporal correlations among EV charging stations to improve forecasting accuracy is complex. To tackle these challenges, we propose EV-LLM for EV charging loads based on LLMs in this paper. EV-LLM integrates the strengths of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) in spatiotemporal feature extraction with the generalization capabilities of fine-tuned generative LLMs. Also, EV-LLM enables effective data mining and feature extraction across multimodal and multidimensional datasets, incorporating historical charging data, weather information, and relevant textual descriptions to enhance forecasting accuracy for multiple charging stations. We validate the effectiveness of EV-LLM by using charging data from 10 stations in California, demonstrating its superiority over the other traditional deep learning methods and potential to optimize load grid scheduling and support vehicle-to-grid interactions.</description>

      <title>Multiuser Beamformig for Pinching-Antenna Systems: An Element-wise Optimization Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pinching-antenna system (PASS) reconstructs wireless channels through pinching beamforming, i.e., optimizing the activated locations of pinching antennas (PAs) along the waveguide. The aim of this article is to investigate the joint design of baseband beamforming and pinching beamforming. A low-complexity element-wise sequential optimization framework is proposed to address the sum-rate maximization problem in PASS-enabled downlink and uplink channels. i) For the downlink scenario, maximum ratio transmission (MRT), zero-forcing (ZF), and minimum mean square error (MMSE) beamforming schemes are employed as baseband beamformers. For each beamformer, a closed-form expression for the downlink sum-rate is derived as a single-variable function with respect to the pinching beamformer. Based on this, a sequential optimization method is proposed, where the positions of the PAs are updated element-wise using a low-complexity one-dimensional search. ii) For the uplink scenario, signal detection is performed using maximum ratio combining (MRC), ZF, and MMSE combiners. A closed-form sum-rate expression is derived for each linear combiner, and a similar element-wise design is applied to optimize the pinching beamforming. Numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and demonstrate that: (i) For all considered linear beamformers, the proposed PASS architecture outperforms conventional fixed-antenna systems in terms of sum-rate performance; (ii) in both downlink and uplink channels, ZF achieves performance close to that of MMSE and significantly outperforms MRT or MRC; and (iii) the proposed element-wise design eliminates the need for alternating updates between the baseband and pinching beamformers, thereby ensuring low computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Sparse Bayesian Learning Methods with Application to Massive MIMO Channel Estimation with Hardware Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate channel estimation is critical for realizing the performance gains of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Traditional approaches to channel estimation typically assume ideal receiver hardware and linear signal models. However, practical receivers suffer from impairments such as nonlinearities in the low-noise amplifiers and quantization errors, which invalidate standard model assumptions and degrade the estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose a nonlinear channel estimation framework that models the distortion function arising from hardware impairments using Gaussian process (GP) regression while leveraging the inherent sparsity of massive MIMO channels. First, we form a GP-based surrogate of the distortion function, employing pseudo-inputs to reduce the computational complexity. Then, we integrate the GP-based surrogate of the distortion function into newly developed enhanced sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) methods, enabling distortion-aware sparse channel estimation. Specifically, we propose two nonlinear SBL methods based on distinct optimization objectives, each offering a different trade-off between estimation accuracy and computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate significant gains over the Bussgang linear minimum mean squared error estimator and linear SBL, particularly under strong distortion and at high signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>An OTFS-based Random Access Scheme for GNSS Independent Operation in NTN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the random access procedure for non-terrestrial networks operating without global navigation satellite system (GNSS) support. In such scenarios, positioning uncertainties can reach several kilometers, which directly impacts the open-loop compensation mechanisms employed by the user equipment. To ensure that the resulting time and carrier frequency offsets can be handled by the network, the robustness of the standardized random access signal design and detection scheme must be enhanced. To extend radio access capabilities, identical Zadoff Chu (ZC) sequences are concatenated and then modulated into the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation. Thanks to the specific characteristics of the OTFS-based random access signal, the received sequences are coherently combined, thereby maximizing the desired signal strength. Additionally, the proposed preamble minimizes the overhead associated with the cyclic prefix (CP) transmission. Numerical evaluations in a regenerative low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite scenario show that, despite significant positioning errors, the proposed OTFS random access design attains comparable peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and missed detection probability (MDP) to OFDM-based solutions, while improving spectral confinement and reducing overhead. These results demonstrate that the proposed OTFS-based random access design offers a robust and spectrally efficient alternative to OFDM for GNSS-independent NTN access.</description>

      <title>SVD-Based Graph Fractional Fourier Transform on Directed Graphs and Its Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT) is an extension of graph Fourier transform (GFT) that provides an additional fractional analysis tool for graph signal processing (GSP) by generalizing temporal-vertex domain Fourier analysis to fractional orders. In recent years, a large number of studies on GFRFT based on undirected graphs have emerged, but there are very few studies on directed graphs. Therefore, in this paper, one of our main contributions is to introduce two novel GFRFTs defined on Cartesian product graph of two directed graphs, by performing singular value decomposition on graph fractional Laplacian matrices. We prove that two proposed GFRFTs can effectively express spatial-temporal data sets on directed graphs with strong correlation. Moreover, we extend the theoretical results to a generalized Cartesian product graph, which is constructed by $m$ directed graphs. Finally, the denoising performance of our proposed two GFRFTs are testified through simulation by processing hourly temperature data sets collected from 32 weather stations in the Brest region of France.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of phase retrieval from offset linear canonical transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical phase retrieval refers to the recovery of an unknown signal from its Fourier magnitudes, which is widely used in fields such as quantum mechanics, signal processing, optics, etc. The offset linear canonical transform (OLCT), which is a more general type of linear integral transform including Fourier transform (FT), fractional Fourier transform (FrFT), and linear canonical transform (LCT) as its special cases. Hence, in this paper, we focus on the uniqueness problem of phase retrieval in the framework of OLCT. First, we prove that all the nontrivial ambiguities in continuous OLCT phase retrieval can be represented by convolution operators, and demonstrate that a continuous compactly supported signal can be uniquely determined up to a global phase from its multiple magnitude-only OLCT measurements. Moreover, we investigate the nontrivial ambiguities in the discrete OLCT phase retrieval case. Furthermore, we demenstrate that a nonseparable function can be uniquely recovered from its magnitudes of short-time OLCT (STOLCT) up to a global phase. Finally, we show that signals which are bandlimited in FT or OLCT domain can be reconstructed from its sampled STOLCT magnitude measurements, up to a global phase, providing the ambiguity function of window function satisfies some mild conditions.</description>

      <title>MudiNet: Task-guided Disentangled Representation Learning for 5G Indoor Multipath-assisted Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the fifth-generation communication system (5G), multipath-assisted positioning (MAP) has emerged as a promising approach. With the enhancement of signal resolution, multipath component (MPC) are no longer regarded as noise but rather as valuable information that can contribute to positioning. However, existing research often treats reflective surfaces as ideal reflectors, while being powerless in the face of indistinguishable multipath caused by diffuse reflectors. This study approaches diffuse reflectors from the perspective of uncertainty, investigating the statistical distribution characteristics of indoor diffuse and specular reflectors. Based on these insights, a task-guided disentangled representation learning method leveraging multi-time channel impulse response (CIR) observations is designed to directly map CIRs to positions, while mitigating the adverse effects of components that contribute minimally to localization accuracy (e.g., diffuse multipath).In this semi-supervised learning framework, a global feature extraction architecture based on self-attention is proposed to capture location-independent wireless environmental information, while an MLP is employed to extract the time-varying features related to user equipment (UE) positions. Variational inference based on a latent variable model (LVM) is applied to separate independent features within the CIR, with position labels guiding the LVM to express components more beneficial for localization. Additionally, we provide a feasibility proof for the separability of diffuse and specular environmental features in CIRs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher localization accuracy compared to conventional search-based localization methods, with enhanced robustness against indistinguishable multipath from diffuse reflectors.</description>

      <title>Model Splitting Enhanced Communication-Efficient Federated Learning for CSI Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements have introduced federated machine learning-based channel state information (CSI) compression before the user equipments (UEs) upload the downlink CSI to the base transceiver station (BTS). However, most existing algorithms impose a high communication overhead due to frequent parameter exchanges between UEs and BTS. In this work, we propose a model splitting approach with a shared model at the BTS and multiple local models at the UEs to reduce communication overhead. Moreover, we implant a pipeline module at the BTS to reduce training time. By limiting exchanges of boundary parameters during forward and backward passes, our algorithm can significantly reduce the exchanged parameters over the benchmarks during federated CSI feedback training.</description>

      <title>Identification of RIS-Assisted Paths for Wireless Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distinguishing between reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted paths and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) paths is a fundamental problem for RIS-assisted integrated sensing and communication. In this work, we propose a pattern alternation scheme for the RIS response that uses part of the RIS as a dynamic part to modulate the estimated channel power, which can considerably help the user equipments (UEs) to identify the RIS-assisted paths. Under such a dynamic setup, we formulate the detection framework for a single UE, where we develop a statistical model of the estimated channel power, allowing us to analytically evaluate the performance of the system. We investigate our method under two critical factors: the number of RIS elements allocated for the dynamic part and the allocation of RIS elements among different users. Simulation results verify the accuracy of our analysis.</description>

      <title>Causal Discovery in Dynamic Fading Wireless Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic causal discovery in wireless networks is essential due to evolving interference, fading, and mobility, which complicate traditional static causal models. This paper addresses causal inference challenges in dynamic fading wireless environments by proposing a sequential regression-based algorithm with a novel application of the NOTEARS acyclicity constraint, enabling efficient online updates. We derive theoretical lower and upper bounds on the detection delay required to identify structural changes, explicitly quantifying their dependence on network size, noise variance, and fading severity. Monte Carlo simulations validate these theoretical results, demonstrating linear increases in detection delay with network size, quadratic growth with noise variance, and inverse-square dependence on the magnitude of structural changes. Our findings provide rigorous theoretical insights and practical guidelines for designing robust online causal inference mechanisms to maintain network reliability under nonstationary wireless conditions.</description>

      <title>Relay Selection and User Equipment Admission in Resource-Efficient NextG Sidelink Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 5G/6G sidelink communications addresses the challenge of connecting outer UEs, which are unable to directly access a base station (gNodeB), through inner UEs that act as relays to connect to the gNodeB. The key performance indicators include the achievable rates, the number of outer UEs that can connect to a gNodeB, and the latency experienced by outer UEs in establishing connections. We consider problem of determining the assignment of outer UEs to inner UEs based on the channel, interference, and traffic characteristics. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize a weighted sum rate of UEs, where weights can represent priority, waiting time, and queue length. This optimization accommodates constraints related to channel and interference characteristics that influence the rates at which links can successfully carry assigned traffic. While an exhaustive search can establish an upper bound on achievable rates by this non-convex optimization problem, it becomes impractical for larger number of outer UEs due to scalability issues related to high computational complexity. To address this, we present a greedy algorithm that incrementally selects links to maximize the sum rate, considering already activated links. This algorithm, although effective in achieving high sum rates, may inadvertently overlook some UEs, raising concerns about fairness. To mitigate this, we introduce a fairness-oriented algorithm that adjusts weights based on waiting time or queue length, ensuring that UEs with initially favorable conditions do not unduly disadvantage others over time. We show that this strategy not only improves the average admission ratio of UEs but also ensures a more equitable distribution of service among them, thereby providing a balanced and fair solution to sidelink communications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Logistic regression is a fundamental and widely used statistical method for modeling binary outcomes based on covariates. However, the presence of missing data, particularly in settings involving hybrid covariates (a mix of discrete and continuous variables), poses significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel Expectation-Maximization based algorithm tailored for parameter estimation in logistic regression models with missing hybrid covariates. The proposed method is specifically designed to handle these complexities, delivering efficient parameter estimates. Through comprehensive simulations and real-world application, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms traditional methods, achieving superior accuracy and reliability.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Distribution Release of Gaussian Mixture Models via KL-Divergence Minimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are widely used statistical models for representing multi-modal data distributions, with numerous applications in data mining, pattern recognition, data simulation, and machine learning. However, recent research has shown that releasing GMM parameters poses significant privacy risks, potentially exposing sensitive information about the underlying data. In this paper, we address the challenge of releasing GMM parameters while ensuring differential privacy (DP) guarantees. Specifically, we focus on the privacy protection of mixture weights, component means, and covariance matrices. We propose to use Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as a utility metric to assess the accuracy of the released GMM, as it captures the joint impact of noise perturbation on all the model parameters. To achieve privacy, we introduce a DP mechanism that adds carefully calibrated random perturbations to the GMM parameters. Through theoretical analysis, we quantify the effects of privacy budget allocation and perturbation statistics on the DP guarantee, and derive a tractable expression for evaluating KL divergence. We formulate and solve an optimization problem to minimize the KL divergence between the released and original models, subject to a given $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP constraint. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves strong privacy guarantees while maintaining high utility.</description>

      <title>BitTTS: Highly Compact Text-to-Speech Using 1.58-bit Quantization and Weight Indexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a highly compact, lightweight text-to-speech (TTS) model for on-device applications. To reduce the model size, the proposed model introduces two techniques. First, we introduce quantization-aware training (QAT), which quantizes model parameters during training to as low as 1.58-bit. In this case, most of 32-bit model parameters are quantized to ternary values {-1, 0, 1}. Second, we propose a method named weight indexing. In this method, we save a group of 1.58-bit weights as a single int8 index. This allows for efficient storage of model parameters, even on hardware that treats values in units of 8-bit. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieved 83 % reduction in model size, while outperforming the baseline of similar model size without quantization in synthesis quality.</description>

      <title>Tone recognition in low-resource languages of North-East India: peeling the layers of SSL-based speech models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the use of self-supervised learning (SSL) models for tone recognition in three low-resource languages from North Eastern India: Angami, Ao, and Mizo. We evaluate four Wav2vec2.0 base models that were pre-trained on both tonal and non-tonal languages. We analyze tone-wise performance across the layers for all three languages and compare the different models. Our results show that tone recognition works best for Mizo and worst for Angami. The middle layers of the SSL models are the most important for tone recognition, regardless of the pre-training language, i.e. tonal or non-tonal. We have also found that the tone inventory, tone types, and dialectal variations affect tone recognition. These findings provide useful insights into the strengths and weaknesses of SSL-based embeddings for tonal languages and highlight the potential for improving tone recognition in low-resource settings.

      <description>arXiv:2506.03622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the physical layer security of rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-aided integrated communication and sensing (ISAC) systems. The ISAC base station (BS) transmits signals to communicate with users in an eavesdropped scenario and to estimate the parameters of the sensed targets. The research considers different sensing signals under RSMA technology and the Cram{\'{e}}r-Rao bound of the parameter estimation is utilized as the sensing metric. With the channel state information (CSI) of eavesdroppers known, the transmitting beam of the BS is optimized to maximize the energy efficiency in terms of the minimum user rate and secrecy capacity, considering the fairness among users and ensuring the sensing performance and communication security. With the CSI of eavesdroppers unknown, the transmitting beam of the BS is designed to minimize the energy consumption for sensing and communication, and the residual power is utilized for artificial noise, which is isotropically emitted to achieve interference with potential eavesdroppers. To solve the non-convex problems, three iterative algorithms based on successive convex approximation and penalty function are proposed. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Resource Allocation in Multi-Channel Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the number of mobile devices continues to grow, interference has become a major bottleneck in improving data rates in wireless networks. Efficient joint channel and power allocation (JCPA) is crucial for managing interference. In this paper, we first propose an enhanced WMMSE (eWMMSE) algorithm to solve the JCPA problem in multi-channel wireless networks. To reduce the computational complexity of iterative optimization, we further introduce JCPGNN-M, a graph neural network-based solution that enables simultaneous multi-channel allocation for each user. We reformulate the problem as a Lagrangian function, which allows us to enforce the total power constraints systematically. Our solution involves combining this Lagrangian framework with GNNs and iteratively updating the Lagrange multipliers and resource allocation scheme. Unlike existing GNN-based methods that limit each user to a single channel, JCPGNN-M supports efficient spectrum reuse and scales well in dense network scenarios. Simulation results show that JCPGNN-M achieves better data rate compared to eWMMSE. Meanwhile, the inference time of JCPGNN-M is much lower than eWMMS, and it can generalize well to larger networks.</description>

      <title>Control Signaling for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: How Many Bits are Needed?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can greatly improve the signal quality of future communication systems by reflecting transmitted signals toward the receiver. However, even when the base station (BS) has perfect channel knowledge and can compute the optimal RIS phase-shift configuration, implementing this configuration requires feedback signaling over a control channel from the BS to the RIS. This feedback must be kept minimal, as it is transmitted wirelessly every time the channel changes. In this paper, we examine how the feedback load, measured in bits, affects the performance of an RIS-aided system. Specifically, we investigate the trade-offs between codebook-based and element-wise feedback schemes, and how these influence the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We propose a novel quantization codebook tailored for line-of-sight (LoS) that guarantees a minimal SNR loss using a number of feedback bits that scale logarithmically with the number of RIS elements. We demonstrate the codebook's usefulness over Rician fading channels and how to extend it to handle a non-zero static path. Numerical simulations and analytical analysis are performed to quantify the performance degradation that results from a reduced feedback load, shedding light on how efficiently RIS configurations can be fed back in practical systems.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations for Sequential Tests of Statistical Sequence Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of statistical sequence matching initiated by Unnikrishnan (TIT 2015) and derive theoretical performance guarantees for sequential tests that have bounded expected stopping times. Specifically, in this problem, one is given two databases of sequences and the task is to identify all matched pairs of sequences. In each database, each sequence is generated i.i.d. from a distinct distribution and a pair of sequences is said matched if they are generated from the same distribution. The generating distribution of each sequence is \emph{unknown}. We first consider the case where the number of matches is known and derive the exact exponential decay rate of the mismatch (error) probability, a.k.a. the mismatch exponent, under each hypothesis for optimal sequential tests. Our results reveal the benefit of sequentiality by showing that optimal sequential tests have larger mismatch exponent than fixed-length tests by Zhou \emph{et al.} (TIT 2024). Subsequently, we generalize our achievability result to the case of unknown number of matches. In this case, two additional error probabilities arise: false alarm and false reject probabilities. We propose a corresponding sequential test, show that the test has bounded expected stopping time under certain conditions, and characterize the tradeoff among the exponential decay rates of three error probabilities. Furthermore, we reveal the benefit of sequentiality over the two-step fixed-length test by Zhou \emph{et al.} (TIT 2024) and propose an one-step fixed-length test that has no worse performance than the fixed-length test by Zhou \emph{et al.} (TIT 2024). When specialized to the case where either database contains a single sequence, our results specialize to large deviations of sequential tests for statistical classification, the binary case of which was recently studied by Hsu, Li and Wang (ITW 2022).</description>

Abstract: In the context of single-base station (BS) non-line-of-sight (NLoS) single-epoch localization with the aid of a reflective reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), this paper introduces a novel three-step algorithm that jointly estimates the position and velocity of a mobile user equipment (UE), while compensating for the Doppler effects observed in near-field (NF) at the RIS elements over the short transmission duration of a sequence of downlink (DL) pilot symbols. First, a low-complexity initialization procedure is proposed, relying in part on far-field (FF) approximation and a static user assumption. Then, an alternating optimization procedure is designed to iteratively refine the velocity and position estimates, as well as the channel gain. The refinement routines leverage small angle approximations and the linearization of the RIS response, accounting for both NF and mobility effects. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm through extensive simulations under diverse operating conditions with regard to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), UE mobility, uncontrolled multipath and RIS-UE distance. Our results reveal remarkable performance improvements over the state-of-the-art (SoTA) mobility-agnostic benchmark algorithm, while indicating convergence of the proposed algorithm to respective theoretical bounds on position and velocity estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12815v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study we introduce Logarithmic Frequency Shift Keying (Log-FSK), a novel frequency modulation for over-the-air computation (AirComp). Log-FSK leverages non-linear signal processing to produce AirComp in the frequency domain, this is, the maximum frequency of the received signal corresponds to the sum of the individual transmitted frequencies. The demodulation procedure relies on the inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and the extraction of the maximum frequency component. Log-FSK enables the computation of functions beyond the sum by incorporating nomographic function representation. Furthermore, unlike existing AirComp modulations, Log-FSK allows to compute several functions in a single transmission. We evaluate the capabilities of the scheme in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and flat-fading channels. To demonstrate its practicality, we present specific applications and experimental results showcasing the effectiveness of Log-FSK AirComp within linear Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). Our numerical results show that Log-FSK outperform linear analog modulations in terms of MSE and power consumption.</description>

      <title>Feedback-Free Resource Scheduling for Flexible Multi-BS Cooperation in FD-RAN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flexible cooperation among base stations (BSs) is critical to improve resource utilization efficiency and meet personalized user demands. However, its practical implementation is hindered by the current radio access network (RAN), which relies on the coupling of uplink and downlink transmissions and channel state information feedback with inherent issues such as overheads and delays. To overcome these limitations, we consider the fully-decoupled RAN (FD-RAN), in which uplink and downlink functionalities are independent, and feedback-free MIMO transmission is adopted at the physical layer. To further deliver flexible cooperation in FD-RAN, we study feedback-free downlink multi-BS resource scheduling under the practical scheduling process. The problem is considered based on network load conditions. In heavy-load states where it is impossible for all user demands to be met, an optimal greedy algorithm is proposed, maximizing the weighted sum of user demand satisfaction rates. In light-load states where at least one solution exists to satisfy all user demands, an optimal two-stage resource allocation algorithm is designed to further minimize network energy consumption by leveraging the flexibility of cooperation. Extensive simulations validate the superiority of proposed algorithms in performance and running time, and highlight the potential for realizing flexible cooperation in practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter presents a method for synthesizing equiripple MIMO transmit beampatterns using Chebyshev approximation. The MIMO beampattern is represented as a non-negative real-valued trigonometric polynomial where the $\ell^{\text{th}}$ order polynomial coefficient is the sum of the $\ell^{\text{th}}$ order diagonal of the waveform correlation matrix. The optimal coefficients for a given equiripple beampattern design is then posed as a Chebyshev approximation problem which is efficiently solved using the Parks-McClellan algorithm from optimal Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design theory. The unique advantage of this synthesis method is that it provides a closed form method to generating MIMO correlation matrices that realize the desired equiripple beampattern. This correspondingly facilitates the design of waveform sets that closely approximate those correlation matrices. This method is demonstrated via two illustrative design examples; the first using traditional partial signal correlation methods and the second using transmit beamspace processing. Both examples realize equiripple beampatterns using constant envelope and spectrally compact waveform sets.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Distributed Mismatch Tracking Algorithm for Constraint-Coupled Resource Allocation Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.07330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers privacy-concerned distributed constraint-coupled resource allocation problems over an undirected network, where each agent holds a private cost function and obtains the solution via only local communication. With privacy concerns, we mask the exchanged information with independent Laplace noise against a potential attacker with potential access to all network communications. We propose a differentially private distributed mismatch tracking algorithm (diff-DMAC) to achieve cost-optimal distribution of resources while preserving privacy. Adopting constant stepsizes, the linear convergence property of diff-DMAC in mean square is established under the standard assumptions of Lipschitz gradients and strong convexity. Moreover, it is theoretically proven that the proposed algorithm is {\epsilon}-differentially private.And we also show the trade-off between convergence accuracy and privacy level. Finally, a numerical example is provided for verification.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Autoencoder Network for Robust Heart Rate Extraction from Noisy Photoplethysmogram: Applying Blind Source Separation to Biosignal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biosignals can be viewed as mixtures measuring particular physiological events, and blind source separation (BSS) aims to extract underlying source signals from mixtures. This paper proposes a self-supervised multi-encoder autoencoder (MEAE) to separate heartbeat-related source signals from photoplethysmogram (PPG), enhancing heart rate (HR) detection in noisy PPG data. The MEAE is trained on PPG signals from a large open polysomnography database without any pre-processing or data selection. The trained network is then applied to a noisy PPG dataset collected during the daily activities of nine subjects. The extracted heartbeat-related source signal significantly improves HR detection as compared to the original PPG. The absence of pre-processing and the self-supervised nature of the proposed method, combined with its strong performance, highlight the potential of MEAE for BSS in biosignal analysis.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Audio Deepfake Detection Robustness in Real-world Communication Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing Audio Deepfake Detection (ADD) systems often struggle to generalise effectively due to the significantly degraded audio quality caused by audio codec compression and channel transmission effects in real-world communication scenarios. To address this challenge, we developed a rigorous benchmark to evaluate the performance of the ADD system under such scenarios. We introduced ADD-C, a new test dataset to evaluate the robustness of ADD systems under diverse communication conditions, including different combinations of audio codecs for compression and packet loss rates. Benchmarking three baseline ADD models on the ADD-C dataset demonstrated a significant decline in robustness under such conditions. A novel Data Augmentation (DA) strategy was proposed to improve the robustness of ADD systems. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach significantly enhances the performance of ADD systems on the proposed ADD-C dataset. Our benchmark can assist future efforts towards building practical and robustly generalisable ADD systems.</description>

      <title>Nonconvex Linear System Identification with Minimal State Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-order linear System IDentification (SysID) addresses the challenge of estimating the parameters of a linear dynamical system from finite samples of observations and control inputs with minimal state representation. Traditional approaches often utilize Hankel-rank minimization, which relies on convex relaxations that can require numerous, costly singular value decompositions (SVDs) to optimize. In this work, we propose two nonconvex reformulations to tackle low-order SysID (i) Burer-Monterio (BM) factorization of the Hankel matrix for efficient nuclear norm minimization, and (ii) optimizing directly over system parameters for real, diagonalizable systems with an atomic norm style decomposition. These reformulations circumvent the need for repeated heavy SVD computations, significantly improving computational efficiency. Moreover, we prove that optimizing directly over the system parameters yields lower statistical error rates, and lower sample complexities that do not scale linearly with trajectory length like in Hankel-nuclear norm minimization. Additionally, while our proposed formulations are nonconvex, we provide theoretical guarantees of achieving global optimality in polynomial time. Finally, we demonstrate algorithms that solve these nonconvex programs and validate our theoretical claims on synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Statistical Channel Based Low-Complexity Rotation and Position Optimization for 6D Movable Antennas Enabled Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is a promising technology to fully exploit spatial variation in wireless channels by allowing flexible adjustment of three-dimensional (3D) positions and rotations of antennas at the transceiver. In this paper, we investigate the practical low-complexity design of 6DMA-enabled communication systems, including transmission protocol, statistical channel information (SCI) acquisition, and joint position and rotation optimization of 6DMA surfaces based on the SCI of users. Specifically, an orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-based algorithm is proposed for the estimation of SCI of users at all possible position-rotation pairs of 6DMA surfaces based on the channel measurements at a small subset of position-rotation pairs. Then, the average sum logarithmic rate of all users is maximized by jointly designing the positions and rotations of 6DMA surfaces based on their SCI acquired. Different from prior works on 6DMA which adopt alternating optimization to design 6DMA positions/rotations with iterations, we propose a new sequential optimization approach that first determines 6DMA rotations and then finds their feasible positions to realize the optimized rotations subject to practical antenna placement constraints. Simulation results show that the proposed sequential optimization significantly reduces the computational complexity of conventional alternating optimization, while achieving comparable communication performance. It is also shown that the proposed SCI-based 6DMA design can effectively enhance the communication throughput of wireless networks over existing fixed (position and rotation) antenna arrays, yet with a practically appealing low-complexity implementation.</description>

      <title>Exploring Sparsity for Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning Using Wavelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently adapting large foundation models is critical, especially with tight compute and memory budgets. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA offer limited granularity and effectiveness in few-parameter regimes. We propose Wavelet Fine-Tuning (WaveFT), a novel PEFT method that learns highly sparse updates in the wavelet domain of residual matrices. WaveFT allows precise control of trainable parameters, offering fine-grained capacity adjustment and excelling with remarkably low parameter count, potentially far fewer than LoRA's minimum, ideal for extreme parameter-efficient scenarios. Evaluated on personalized text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion XL as baseline, WaveFT significantly outperforms LoRA and other PEFT methods, especially at low parameter counts; achieving superior subject fidelity, prompt alignment, and image diversity.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Impact of Accent on English Speech: Acoustic and Articulatory Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in AI-driven speech-based applications have transformed diverse industries ranging from healthcare to customer service. However, the increasing prevalence of non-native accented speech in global interactions poses significant challenges for speech-processing systems, which are often trained on datasets dominated by native speech. This study investigates accented English speech through articulatory and acoustic analysis, identifying simpler coordination patterns and higher average pitch than native speech. Using eigenspectra and Vocal Tract Variable-based coordination features, we establish an efficient method for quantifying accent strength without relying on resource-intensive phonetic transcriptions. Our findings provide a new avenue for research on the impacts of accents on speech intelligibility and offer insights for developing inclusive, robust speech processing systems that accommodate diverse linguistic communities.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Biomarkers for Schizophrenia: Towards Individual Symptom Severity Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studies on schizophrenia assessments using deep learning typically treat it as a classification task to detect the presence or absence of the disorder, oversimplifying the condition and reducing its clinical applicability. This traditional approach overlooks the complexity of schizophrenia, limiting its practical value in healthcare settings. This study shifts the focus to individual symptom severity estimation using a multimodal approach that integrates speech, video, and text inputs. We develop unimodal models for each modality and a multimodal framework to improve accuracy and robustness. By capturing a more detailed symptom profile, this approach can help in enhancing diagnostic precision and support personalized treatment, offering a scalable and objective tool for mental health assessment.</description>
