      <title>2D BAO vs 3D BAO: Hints for new physics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of tensions, when precision cosmology is blooming, numerous new theoretical models are emerging. However, it's crucial to pause and question the extent to which the observational data we rely on are model-dependent. In this work, we study the comoving position of the acoustic peak, a cornerstone standard ruler in cosmology. We considered BAO observational datasets from two distinct teams and calculated the product $hr_d$ with the help of each BAO data set along with SN I-a data from the Pantheon Plus sample. Our conclusion at present is that 2D and 3D BAO datasets are compatible with each other. Considering, no systematics in BAO, interpreting $\Omega_{m0}-hr_d$ plane may require physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM not just while using observational BAO data but also while observing it.</description>

      <title>The History of Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We overview the history of primordial black hole (PBH) research from the first papers around 50 years ago to the present epoch. The history may be divided into four periods, the dividing lines being marked by three key developments: inflation on the theoretical front and the detection of microlensing events by the MACHO project and gravitational waves by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA project on the observation front. However, they are also characterised by somewhat different focuses of research. The period 1967-1980 covered the groundbreaking work on PBH formation and evaporation. The period 1980-1996 mainly focussed on their formation, while the period 1996-2016 consolidated the work on formation but also collated the constraints on the PBH abundance. In the period 2016-2024 there was a shift of emphasis to the search for evidence for PBHs and - while opinions about the strength of the purported evidence vary - this has motivated more careful studies of some aspects of the subject. Certainly the soaring number of papers on PBHs in this last period indicates a growing interest in the topic.</description>

      <title>GANSky -- fast curved sky weak lensing simulations using Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting non-Gaussian information from the next generation weak lensing surveys will require fast and accurate full-sky simulations. This is difficult to achieve in practice with existing simulation methods: ray-traced $N$-body simulations are computationally expensive, and approximate simulation methods (such as lognormal mocks) are not accurate enough. Here, we present GANSky, an interpretable machine learning method that uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to produce fast and accurate full-sky tomographic weak lensing maps. The input to our GAN are lognormal maps that approximately describe the late-time convergence field of the Universe. Starting from these lognormal maps, we use GANs to learn how to locally redistribute mass to achieve simulation-quality maps. This can be achieved using remarkably small networks ($\approx 10^3$ parameters). We validate the GAN maps by computing a number of summary statistics in both simulated and GANSky maps. We show that GANSky maps correctly reproduce both the mean and $\chi^2$ distribution for several statistics, specifically: the 2-pt function, 1-pt PDF, peak and void counts, and the equilateral, folded and squeezed bispectra. These successes makes GANSky an attractive tool to compute the covariances of these statistics. In addition to being useful for rapidly generating large ensembles of artificial data sets, our method can be used to extract non-Gaussian information from weak lensing data with field-level or simulation-based inference.</description>

      <title>Fisher's Mirage: Noise Tightening of Cosmological Constraints in Simulation-Based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically analyze the implications of statistical noise within numerical derivatives on simulation-based Fisher forecasts for large scale structure surveys. Noisy numerical derivatives resulting from a finite number of simulations, $N_{sims}$, act to bias the associated Fisher forecast such that the resulting marginalized constraints can be significantly tighter than the noise-free limit. We show the source of this effect can be traced to the influence of the noise on the marginalization process. Parameters such as the neutrino mass, $\M$, for which higher-order forward differentiation schemes are commonly used, are more prone to noise; the predicted constraints can be akin to those purely from a random instance of statistical noise even using $(1\mathrm{Gpc}/h)^{3}$ simulations with $N_{sims}=500$ realizations. We demonstrate how derivative noise can artificially reduce parameter degeneracies and seemingly null the effects of adding nuisance parameters to the forecast, such as HOD fitting parameters. We mathematically characterize these effects through a full statistical analysis, and demonstrate how confidence intervals for the true noise-free, $N_{sims} \rightarrow \infty$, Fisher constraints can be recovered even when noise comprises a consequential component of the measured signal. The findings and approaches developed here are important for ensuring simulation-based analyses can be accurately used to assess upcoming survey capabilities.</description>

      <title>Probing vector chirality in the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential of detecting parity violation in primordial vector fossils using late-time galaxy spins. Utilizing $N$-body simulations, we use halo spins as a reliable proxy for galaxy spins to investigate how effectively such primordial vectorial parity asymmetry remains in galaxy spins at low redshifts. We develop a novel approach to generate initial conditions with substantial parity asymmetry, while maintaining the initial matter power spectrum unchanged. From the parity broken initial condition and halos evolved from it, we construct the initial spin and halo spin fields, respectively. Focusing on the helicity of these vector fields, we detect substantial asymmetry in the initial spin field as a consequence of parity violation in the primordial vector fossil. In addition, we discover that over $50\%$ of the primordial asymmetry in the initial spin field remains in the late-time halo spin field on a range of scales. Given the tight correlation between halo spins and observable galaxy spins, we expect to detect the current amplitude of vectorial parity asymmetry potentially up to $16\sigma$-level in observation, when utilizing galaxy samples from DESI BGS. Our findings demonstrate that the primordial imprints of vectorial parity violation persist through non-linear gravitational evolution, highlighting the reliability of galaxy spin as a sensitive probe for testing the vectorial parity-invariance in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Fiducial-Cosmology-dependent systematics for the DESI 2024 BAO Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When measuring the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) scale from galaxy surveys, one typically assumes a fiducial cosmology when converting redshift measurements into comoving distances and also when defining input parameters for the reconstruction algorithm. A parameterised template for the model to be fitted is also created based on a (possibly different) fiducial cosmology. This model reliance can be considered a form of data compression, and the data is then analysed allowing that the true answer is different from the fiducial cosmology assumed. In this study, we evaluate the impact of the fiducial cosmology assumed in the BAO analysis of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey Data Release 1 (DR1) on the final measurements in DESI 2024 III. We utilise a suite of mock galaxy catalogues with survey realism that mirrors the DESI DR1 tracers: the bright galaxy sample (BGS), the luminous red galaxies (LRG), the emission line galaxies (ELG) and the quasars (QSO), spanning a redshift range from 0.1 to 2.1. We compare the four secondary AbacusSummit cosmologies against DESI's fiducial cosmology (Planck 2018). The secondary cosmologies explored include a lower cold dark matter density, a thawing dark energy universe, a higher number of effective species, and a lower amplitude of matter clustering. The mocks are processed through the BAO pipeline by consistently iterating the grid, template, and reconstruction reference cosmologies. We determine a conservative systematic contribution to the error of $0.1\%$ for both the isotropic and anisotropic dilation parameters $\alpha_{\rm iso}$ and $\alpha_{\rm AP}$. We then directly test the impact of the fiducial cosmology on DESI DR1 data.</description>

      <title>Exploring the rich geometrical information in cosmic drift signals with covariant cosmography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time measurements are becoming feasible in cosmology, where the next generation of telescopes will detect the temporal change of redshifts and sky positions of individual sources with a precision that will allow a direct detection of the cosmic expansion rate. These detections of cosmic drifts of redshifts and positions are likely to become cornerstones in modern cosmology, where one has otherwise relied on the indirect inference of cosmic expansion by estimation of the slope of the fitted distance-redshift relation. Because of their ability to directly detect the cosmic time-evolution, real-time measurements are powerful as model-independent probes. We develop a cosmographic framework for analysing cosmological redshift drift and position drift signals without knowledge of the space-time geometry. The framework can be applied to analyse data from surveys such as the Gaia observatory, the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), and the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). The drift effects are distorted by the regional kinematics and tidal effects in the cosmic neighbourhood of the observer, giving rise to non-trivial corrections to the well known Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) results. We discuss how one may concretely implement the framework in the statistical analysis of real-time data, along with assumptions and limitations that come with such an analysis. We also discuss the geometrical information that can ideally be extracted from ideal high-resolution data of cosmic drifts in combination with distance-redshift data.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2: Evidence of Changing Dust Distributions With Redshift Using Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernova (SNIa) are excellent probes of local distance, and the increasing sample sizes of SNIa have driven an increased need to study the associated systematic uncertainties and improve the standardisation methods in preparation for the next generation of cosmological surveys into the dark energy equation-of-state $w$. We aim to probe the potential change in the SNIa standardisation parameter $c$ with redshift and the host-galaxy of the supernova. Improving the standardisation of SNIa brightnesses will require accounting for the relationship between the host and the SNIa, and potential shifts in the SNIa standardisation parameters with redshift will cause biases in the recovered cosmology. Here, we assemble a volume-limited sample of ~3000 likely SNIa across a redshift range of $z = 0.015$ to $z = 0.36$. This sample is fitted with changing mass and redshift bins to determine the relationship between intrinsic properties of SNe Ia and their redshift and host galaxy parameters. We then investigate the colour-luminosity parameter $\beta$ as a further test of the SNIa standardisation process. We find that the changing colour distribution of SNe Ia with redshift is driven by dust at a confidence of $&gt;4\sigma$. Additionally, we show a strong correlation between the host galaxy mass and the colour-luminosity coefficient $\beta$ ($&gt; 4\sigma$), even when accounting for the quantity of dust in a host galaxy.</description>

      <title>Relativistic and wide-angle corrections to galaxy power spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy surveys contain information on the largest scales via wide-angle and relativistic contributions. By combining two different galaxy populations, we can suppress the strong cosmic variance on ultra-large scales and thus enhance the detectability of the signals. The relativistic Doppler and Sachs-Wolfe effects are of a similar magnitude to the leading wide-angle corrections, so that it is important to treat them together, especially since they can partially cancel. The power spectra depend on the choice of line of sight for each galaxy pair and we present results for a general line of sight. Then we estimate the detection significance of the auto- and cross-power spectra for a variety of cases. We use two futuristic galaxy samples based on a `beyond-DESI' survey and a SKA Phase 2 survey, covering 15,000\,deg$^2$ up to $z=1$. We find a detection significance for the total relativistic wide-angle effects that ranges from $\sim 5\sigma$ to $&gt;15\sigma$, depending on the line-of-sight configuration.</description>

      <title>Exploring the discrepancy between Planck PR3 and ACT DR4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the scales and the extent of disagreement between $Planck$ PR3 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR4 data. $Planck$ and ACT data have substantial overlap in the temperature anisotropy data between scales corresponding to multipoles $\ell\simeq 600-2500$ with complementing coverage of larger angular scales by $Planck$ and smaller angular scales by ACT. Since the same cosmology should govern the anisotropy spectrum at all scales, we probe this disagreement in the primordial power spectrum. We use a parametric form of power law primordial spectrum that allows changes in the spectral tilt. We also reconstruct the primordial spectrum with a non-parametric method from both $Planck$ and ACT temperature data. We find the disagreement exists within scales 0.08 - 0.16 ${\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ where ACT temperature data prefers a scale invariant/blue spectrum. At scales larger and smaller than this window, ACT data strongly prefers a red tilt, which is consistent with $Planck$. This change in the spectral tilt can be identified in the ACT data at 2$\sigma$ C.L. without using $Planck$ data, indicating that the tension is driven by different preferences for tilts within the ACT data. The addition of $Planck$ data up to intermediate scales ($\ell\le650$) increases this significance to 3$\sigma$. Given the large overlap between $Planck$ and ACT within 0.08 - 0.16 ${\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and considering the internal consistency between different $Planck$ temperature and polarization spectra, the scope of new physics as a solution to the tension remains limited. Our results -- a strong preference for an intermediate transition in spectral tilt and the variation of this preference in different data combinations -- indicate that systematic effects can be misperceived as new physics emerging from different non-standard cosmological processes.</description>

      <title>Implications of DES 5YR SNe Dataset for $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark Energy Survey five-year supernovae data (DES 5YR SNe) in conjunction with Planck CMB and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) BAO data has detected a strong dynamical dark energy deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model. Here, we shift the focus of DES data to the pressureless matter sector in the $\Lambda$CDM model by studying the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$. Employing frequentist profile likelihoods, we demonstrate that $\Omega_m$ increases with effective redshift in the DES dataset at up to $2.5 \sigma$ level. At the highest redshifts, one encounters negative dark energy densities $\Omega_m &gt; 1$. Our findings corroborate earlier observations in Pantheon and Pantheon+ datasets with an independent SNe dataset with a higher effective redshift. In an appendix, we confirm that curvature $\Omega_k$ decreases with effective redshift disfavouring a flat Universe in higher redshift DES SNe at $&gt; 3 \sigma$. Our choice of $\Omega_k$ prior leads to an underestimation of the tension with a flat Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino masses and quantum gravity are strong reasons to extend the standard model of particle physics. A large extra dimension can be motivated by quantum gravity and can explain the small neutrino masses with new singlet states that propagate in the bulk. In such a case, a Kaluza-Klein tower of sterile neutrinos emerges. We revisit constraints on towers of sterile neutrinos that come from cosmological observables such as the effective number of noninteracting relativistic species and the dark matter density. These limits generically rule out micron-sized extra dimensions. We explore the weakening of these constraints to accommodate an extra dimension close to the micron size by assuming that the universe reheated after inflation to a low temperature. We discuss how such a possibility can be distinguished in the event of a positive signal in a cosmological observable.</description>

      <title>Black hole in a generalized Chaplygin-Jacobi dark fluid: shadow and light deflection angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a generalized Chaplygin-like gas with an anisotropic equation of state, characterizing a dark fluid within which a static spherically symmetric black hole is assumed. By solving the Einstein equations for this black hole spacetime, we explicitly derive the metric function. The spacetime is parametrized by two critical parameters, $\mathcal{B}$ and $\alpha$, which measure the deviation from the Schwarzschild black hole and the extent of the dark fluid's anisotropy, respectively. We explore the behavior of light rays in the vicinity of the black hole by calculating its shadow and comparing our results with the Event Horizon Telescope observations. This comparison constrains the parameters to $0 \leq \mathcal{B} &lt; 0.03$ and $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 0.1$. Additionally, we calculate the deflection angles to determine the extent to which light is bent by the black hole. These calculations are further utilized to formulate possible Einstein rings, estimating the angular radius of the rings to be approximately $37.6\,\mathrm{\mu as}$. Throughout this work, we present analytical solutions wherever feasible, and employ reliable approximations where necessary to provide comprehensive insights into the spacetime characteristics and their observable effects.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) may form before cosmological first-order phase transitions, leading to inevitable collisions between PBHs and bubble walls. In this Letter, we have simulated for the first time the co-evolution of an expanding scalar wall passing through a black hole with full numerical relativity. This black hole-bubble wall collision yields multiple far-reaching phenomena including the PBH mass growth, gravitational wave radiations, and momentum recoil that endows PBHs with additional velocities, approximately doubling the formation rate for PBH binaries and hence strengthening the observational constraints on the PBH abundances.</description>

      <title>Cosmography of the minimally extended Varying Speed of Light Model</title>

Abstract: Cosmography, as an integral branch of cosmology, strives to characterize the Universe without relying on pre-determined cosmological models. This model-independent approach utilizes Taylor series expansions around the current epoch, providing a direct correlation with cosmological observations and the potential to constrain theoretical models. Cosmologists can describe many measurable aspects of cosmology by using various combinations of cosmographic parameters. The varying speed of light model can be naturally implemented, provided that we do not make any further assumptions from the Robertson-Walker metric for cosmological time dilation. Therefore, we apply cosmography to the so-called minimally extended varying speed of light model. In this case, other cosmographic parameters can be used to construct the Hubble parameter for both the standard model and the varying speed-of-light model. On the other hand, distinct combinations of cosmographic values for the luminosity distance indicate the two models. Hence, luminosity distance might provide a method to constrain the parameters in varying speed-of-light models.</description>

      <title>Multi-Generational Black Hole Population Analysis with an Astrophysically Informed Mass Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the population statistics of black holes in the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA GWTC-3 catalog using a parametric mass function derived from simulations of massive stars experiencing pulsational pair-instability supernovae (PPISN). Our formalism enables us to separate the black hole mass function into sub-populations corresponding to mergers between objects formed via different astrophysical pathways, allowing us to infer the properties of black holes formed from stellar collapse and black holes formed via prior mergers separately. Applying this formalism, we find that this model fits the data better than the powerlaw+peak model with Bayes factor $ 9.7\pm0.1$. We measure the location of the lower edge of the upper black hole mass gap to be $M_{\rm BHMG}=84.05_{-12.88}^{+17.19}{\rm M}_{\odot}$, providing evidence that the $35{\rm M}_{\odot}$ Gaussian peak detected in the data using other models is not associated with the PPISN pile-up predicted to precede this gap. Incorporating spin, we find that the normalized spins of stellar remnant black holes are close to zero while those of higher generation black holes tend to larger values. All of these results are in accordance with the predictions of stellar structure theory and black hole merger scenarios. Finally, we combine our mass function with the spectral siren method for measuring the Hubble constant to find $H_0=36.19_{-10.91}^{17.50}$ km/s/Mpc and discuss potential explanations of this low value. Our results demonstrate how astrophysically-informed mass functions can facilitate the interpretation of gravitational wave catalog data to provide information about black hole formation and cosmology. Future data releases will improve the precision of our measurements.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the appearance of topological structures from the spontaneous breaking of $E_6$ to the Standard Model via its maximal subgroup $SO(10) \times U(1)_\psi$. They include dumbbells, metastable strings, as well as domain walls bounded by necklaces. We provide a novel scenario for producing metastable strings based on the symmetry breaking $U(1)_\psi \longrightarrow Z_8 \longrightarrow Z_4$. The metastable string arises from the merger of $Z_8$ strings that bound a domain wall. An unbroken gauge $Z_2$ symmetry from $SO(10)$ breaking yields viable stable dark matter candidates as well as topologically stable strings. We discuss the gravitational wave emission from two varieties of cosmic strings, namely the superheavy metastable ones and the intermediate scale topologically stable cosmic strings.</description>

      <title>Navigating Unknowns: Deep Learning Robustness for Gravitational Wave Signal Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a rapid and reliable deep learning-based method for gravitational wave signal reconstruction from elusive, generic binary black hole mergers in LIGO data. We demonstrate that our model, \texttt{AWaRe}, effectively recovers gravitational waves with parameters it has not encountered during training. This includes features like higher black hole masses, additional harmonics, eccentricity, and varied waveform systematics, which introduce complex modulations in the waveform's amplitudes and phases. The accurate reconstructions of these unseen signal characteristics demonstrates \texttt{AWaRe}'s ability to handle complex features in the waveforms. By directly incorporating waveform reconstruction uncertainty estimation into the \texttt{AWaRe} framework, we show that for real gravitational wave events, the uncertainties in \texttt{AWaRe}'s reconstructions align closely with those achieved by benchmark algorithms like BayesWave and coherent WaveBurst. The robustness of our model to real gravitational wave events and its ability to extrapolate to unseen data open new avenues for investigations in various aspects of gravitational wave astrophysics and data analysis, including tests of General Relativity and the enhancement of current gravitational wave search methodologies.</description>

      <title>Galaxy lens reconstruction based on strongly lensed gravitational waves: similarity transformation degeneracy and mass-sheet degeneracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) galaxy lens reconstruction is a crucial step for many GW lensing science applications. However, dark siren GW lensing (i.e. lensed GW without observed electromagnetic (EM) counterpart) suffers from similarity transformation degeneracy and mass-sheet degeneracy. We review these two degeneracies and discuss their implications on GW-based lens reconstruction and two well-known GW lensing science cases: the Hubble constant measurement and test for modified GW propagation. Building upon previous works, our conclusions are:1) GWs can only infer the scale-free lens mass model parameters, the dimensionless source position, the GW luminosity distance and the time delay scaling (a combination of Einstein radius, lens redshift, and cosmology).2) Lens reconstruction (of singular isothermal ellipsoid lens) with only two GW signals is unlikely to yield a complete lens model, while four (three) signals can measure all the above parameters accurately (with large uncertainties).3) The similarity transformation degeneracy causes the lens redshift/Einstein radius/cosmology to be degenerate in dark siren measurements. Breaking the degeneracy can be achieved by supplementing the GWs with EM observation of lens redshifts/Einstein radius (source redshift is not required).4) The mass-sheet degeneracy causes the GW luminosity distance to be entirely degenerate with a constant mass sheet.5) Contrary to expectation, the Hubble constant is degenerate with the mass-sheet even when supplemented with lens reconstruction/redshift/Einstein radius and can only be lifted with lens galaxy velocity dispersion measurement, while modified GW propagation test discussed in prior literature is unaffected by the degeneracy. These properties highlight the need for GW observations to be supplemented by EM observations, which could become accessible through a lens archival search or a rapid EM follow-up.</description>

      <title>An Analytic Hybrid Halo + Perturbation Theory Model for Small-scale Correlators: Baryons, Halos, and Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.10676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We update Halo Zeldovich Perturbation Theory (HZPT), an analytic model for the two-point statistics of dark matter, to describe halo and galaxy clustering, and galaxy-matter cross-correlation on nonlinear scales. The model correcting Zeldovich has an analytic Fourier transform, and therefore is valid in both configuration space and Fourier space. The model is accurate at the $2\%$-level or less for $P_{mm}$ (k &lt; 1 h/Mpc), $P_{hm}$ (k &lt; 1 h/Mpc), $P_{hh}$ (k &lt; 2 h/Mpc), $P_{gm}$ (k &lt; 1 h/Mpc), $P_{gg}$ (k &lt; 1 h/Mpc), $\xi_{mm}$ (r &gt; 1 Mpc/h), $\xi_{hm}$ (r &gt; 2 Mpc/h), $\xi_{hh}$ (r &gt; 2 Mpc/h), $\xi_{gm}$ (r &gt; 1 Mpc/h), $\xi_{gg}$ (r &gt; 2 Mpc/h), for LRG-like mock galaxies. We show that the HZPT model for matter correlators can account for the effects of a wide range of baryonic feedback models and provide extended dark matter models which are of $1\% ~(3\%)$ accuracy for k &lt; 10 (8) h/Mpc. We explicitly model the non-perturbative features of halo exclusion for the halo-halo and galaxy-galaxy correlators, as well as the presence of satellites for galaxy-matter and galaxy-galaxy correlation functions. We perform density estimation using N-body simulations and a wide range of HOD galaxy mocks to obtain correlations of model parameters with the cosmological parameters $\Omega_{m}$ and $\sigma_{8}$. HZPT can provide a fast, interpretable, and analytic model for combined-probe analyses of redshift surveys using scales well into the non-linear regime.</description>

Abstract: Neutrino mass constraints are a primary focus of current and future large-scale structure (LSS) surveys. Non-linear LSS models rely heavily on cosmological simulations -- the impact of massive neutrinos should therefore be included in these simulations in a realistic, computationally tractable, and controlled manner. A recent proposal to reduce the related computational cost employs a symmetric neutrino momentum sampling strategy in the initial conditions. We implement a modified version of this strategy into the Hardware/Hybrid Accelerated Cosmology Code (HACC) and perform convergence tests on its internal parameters. We illustrate that this method can impart $\mathcal{O}(1\%)$ numerical artifacts on the total matter field on small scales, similar to previous findings, and present a method to remove these artifacts using Fourier-space filtering of the neutrino density field. Moreover, we show that the converged neutrino power spectrum does not follow linear theory predictions on relatively large scales at early times at the $15\%$ level, prompting a more careful study of systematics in particle-based neutrino simulations. We also present an improved method for backscaling linear transfer functions for initial conditions in massive neutrino cosmologies that is based on achieving the same relative neutrino growth as computed with Boltzmann solvers. Our self-consistent backscaling method yields sub-percent accuracy in the total matter growth function. Comparisons for the non-linear power spectrum with the Mira-Titan emulator at a neutrino mass of $m_{\nu}=0.15~\mathrm{eV}$ are in very good agreement with the expected level of errors in the emulator and in the direct N-body simulation.</description>

      <title>Learning to Concentrate: Multi-tracer Forecasts on Local Primordial Non-Gaussianity with Machine-Learned Bias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local primordial non-Gaussianity (LPNG) is predicted by many non-minimal models of inflation, and creates a scale-dependent contribution to the power spectrum of large-scale structure (LSS) tracers, whose amplitude is characterized by $b_{\phi}$. Knowledge of $b_{\phi}$ for the observed tracer population is therefore crucial for learning about inflation from LSS. Recently, it has been shown that the relationship between linear bias $b_1$ and $b_{\phi}$ for simulated halos exhibits significant secondary dependence on halo concentration. We leverage this fact to forecast multi-tracer constraints on $f_{NL}^{\mathrm{loc}}$. We train a machine learning model on observable properties of simulated Illustris-TNG galaxies to predict $b_{\phi}$ for samples constructed to approximate DESI emission line galaxies (ELGs) and luminous red galaxies (LRGs). We find $\sigma(f_{NL}^{\mathrm{loc}}) = 2.3$, and $\sigma(f_{NL}^{\mathrm{loc}}) = 3.7$, respectively. These forecasted errors are roughly factors of 3, and 35\% improvements over the single-tracer case for each sample, respectively. When considering both ELGs and LRGs in their overlap region, we forecast $\sigma(f_{NL}^{\mathrm{loc}}) = 1.5$ is attainable with our learned model, more than a factor of 3 improvement over the single-tracer case, while the ideal split by $b_{\phi}$ could reach $\sigma(f_{NL}^{\mathrm{loc}}) &lt;1$. We also perform multi-tracer forecasts for upcoming spectroscopic surveys targeting LPNG (MegaMapper, SPHEREx) and show that splitting tracer samples by $b_{\phi}$ can lead to an order-of-magnitude reduction in projected $\sigma(f_{NL}^{\mathrm{loc}})$ for these surveys.</description>

      <title>Sesame: A power spectrum emulator pipeline for beyond-$\Lambda$CDM models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mysterious nature of the dark sector of the $\Lambda$CDM model is one of the main motivators behind the study of alternative cosmological models. A central quantity of interest for these models is the matter power spectrum, which quantifies structure formation on various scales and can be cross-validated through theory, simulations, and observations. We present a tool that can be used to create emulators for the non-linear matter power spectrum, and similar global clustering statistics, for models beyond $\Lambda$CDM with very little computation effort and without the need for supercomputers. We use fast approximate N-body simulations to emulate the boost, $B(k,z)=P_{\text{beyond}-\Lambda \rm CDM}(k,z) / P_{\Lambda \rm CDM}(k, z)$, and then rely on existing high-quality emulators made for $\Lambda$CDM to isolate $P_{\text{beyond}-\Lambda \rm CDM}(k,z)$. Since both the $\Lambda$CDM and beyond-$\Lambda$CDM models are simulated in our approach, some of the lack of power on small scales is factored out, allowing us to extend the emulator to $k \sim 3-5\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and still maintain good accuracy. In addition, errors from the simulation and emulation process can be estimated and factored into the covariance when using the emulator on data. As an example of using the pipeline, we create an emulator for the well-studied $f(R)$ model with massive neutrinos, using approximately 3000 CPU hours of computation time. Provided with the paper is a fully functioning pipeline that generates parameter samples, runs a Boltzmann solver to produce initial conditions, runs the simulations, and then gathers all the data and runs it through a machine learning module to develop the emulator. This tool, named Sesame, can be used by anyone to generate a power spectrum emulator for the cosmological model of their choice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present XMM-Newton observations of a representative X-ray selected sample of 31 galaxy clusters at moderate redshift $(0.4&lt;z&lt;0.6)$, spanning the mass range $10^{14} &lt; M_{\textrm 500} &lt; 10^{15}$~M$_\odot$. This sample, EXCPRES (Evolution of X-ray galaxy Cluster Properties in a Representative Sample), is used to test and validate a new method to produce optimally-binned cluster X-ray temperature profiles. The method uses a dynamic programming algorithm, based on partitioning of the soft-band X-ray surface brightness profile, to obtain a binning scheme that optimally fulfils a given signal-to-noise threshold criterion out to large radius. From the resulting optimally-binned EXCPRES temperature profiles, and combining with those from the local REXCESS sample, we provide a generic scaling relation between the relative error on the temperature and the [0.3-2] keV surface brightness signal-to-noise ratio, and its dependence on temperature and redshift. We derive an average scaled 3D temperature profile for the sample. Comparing to the average scaled 3D temperature profiles from REXCESS, we find no evidence for evolution of the average profile shape within the redshift range that we probe.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the growth index $\gamma$ with Gaussian Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alternative cosmological models have been proposed to alleviate the tensions reported in the concordance cosmological model, or to explain the current accelerated phase of the universe. One way to distinguish between General Relativity and modified gravity models is using current astronomical data to measure the growth index $\gamma$, a parameter related to the growth of matter perturbations, which behaves differently in different metric theories. We propose a model independent methodology for determining $\gamma$, where our analyses combine diverse cosmological data sets, namely $\{ f(z_i) \}$, $\{ [f\sigma_8](z_i) \}$, and $\{ H(z_i) \}$, and use Gaussian Processes, a non-parametric approach suitable to reconstruct functions. This methodology is a new consistency test for $\gamma$ constant. Our results show that, for the redshift interval $0 &lt; z &lt; 1$, $\gamma$ is consistent with the constant value $\gamma = 0.55$, expected in General Relativity theory, within $2 \sigma$ confidence level (CL). Moreover, we find $\gamma(z=0)$ = 0.311 $\pm 0.144 $ and $\gamma(z=0) = 0.609 \pm 0.200$ for the reconstructions using the $\{ f(z_i) \}$ and $\{ [f\sigma_8](z_i) \}$ data sets, respectively, values that also agree at a 2$\sigma$ CL with $\gamma = 0.55$. Our methodology and analyses can be considered as an alternative approach in light of the current discussion in the literature that suggests a possible evidence for the growth index evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the information content of 21cm intensity maps in redshift space using the 1-loop Effective Field Theory power spectrum model and the bispectrum at tree level. The 21cm signal contains signatures of dark matter, dark energy and the growth of large-scale structure in the Universe. These signatures are typically analyzed via the 2-point correlation function or power spectrum. However, adding the information from the 3-point correlation function or bispectrum will be crucial to exploiting next-generation intensity mapping experiments. The bispectrum could offer a unique opportunity to break key parameter degeneracies that hinder the measurement of cosmological parameters and improve on the precision. We use a Fisher forecast analysis to estimate the constraining power of the HIRAX survey on cosmological parameters, dark energy and modified gravity.</description>

Abstract: We present forecasts for constraints on the Hu \&amp; Sawicki $f(R)$ modified gravity model using realistic mock data representative of future cluster and weak lensing surveys. We create mock thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect selected cluster samples for SPT-3G and CMB-S4 and the corresponding weak gravitational lensing data from next-generation weak-lensing (ngWL) surveys like Euclid and Rubin. We employ a state-of-the-art Bayesian likelihood approach that includes all observational effects and systematic uncertainties to obtain constraints on the $f(R)$ gravity parameter $\log_{10}|f_{R0}|$. In this analysis we vary the cosmological parameters $[\Omega_{\rm m}, \Omega_\nu h^2, h^2, A_s, n_s, \log_{10}|f_{R0}|]$, which allows us to account for possible degeneracies between cosmological parameters and $f(R)$ modified gravity. The analysis accounts for $f(R)$ gravity via its effect on the halo mass function which is enhanced on cluster mass scales compared to the expectations within general relativity (GR). Assuming a fiducial GR model, the upcoming cluster dataset SPT-3G$\times$ngWL is expected to obtain an upper limit of $\log_{10}|f_{R0}| &lt; -5.95$ at $95\,\%$ credibility, which significantly improves upon the current best bounds. The CMB-S4$\times$ngWL dataset is expected to improve this even further to $\log_{10}|f_{R0}| &lt; -6.23$. Furthermore, $f(R)$ gravity models with $\log_{10}|f_{R0}| \geq -6$, which have larger numbers of clusters, would be distinguishable from GR with both datasets. We also report degeneracies between $\log_{10}|f_{R0}|$ and $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ as well as $\sigma_8$ for $\log_{10}|f_{R0}| &gt; -6$ and $\log_{10}|f_{R0}| &gt; -5$ respectively. Our forecasts indicate that future cluster abundance studies of $f(R)$ gravity will enable substantially improved constraints that are competitive with other cosmological probes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the second release of the Meta-catalogue of X-Ray detected Clusters of galaxies (hereafter MCXC-II). The MCXC-II has been compiled from publicly available ROSAT All Sky Survey-based (NORAS, REFLEX, BCS, SGP, NEP, MACS, CIZA, RXGCC) and serendipitous (160SD, 400SD, SHARC, WARPS, and EMSS) cluster catalogues. Redshifts were systematically checked and updated if necessary, and additional redshift information (type and origin) added. The X-ray data were standardised to an overdensity of 500 using a new procedure based on the use of the original flux and aperture measurements available in the input catalogues. MCXC-II contains 2221 entries, essentially completing the census of ROSAT cluster detections by including objects from the REFLEX-II and RXGCC surveys, in addition to providing a complete and fully-homogenised sub-catalogue of all published MACS clusters. Duplicate entries from overlaps between the survey areas of the individual input catalogues were carefully handled. For each cluster the MCXC-II provides three identifiers, a redshift, coordinates, membership in the original catalogue, and standardised [0.1-2.4] keV band luminosity $L_{500}$, total mass $M_{500}$, and radius $R_{500}$. Uncertainties on $L_{500}$ were computed from the flux errors in the original catalogues. MCXC-II additionally furnishes information on overlaps between the input catalogues, gives the luminosity and its uncertainty when measurements from different surveys are available, and provides notes on individual objects.</description>

      <title>Optimization of foreground moment deprojection for semi-blind CMB polarization reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upcoming Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments, aimed at measuring primordial CMB B-modes, require exquisite control of Galactic foreground contamination. Minimum-variance techniques, like the Needlet Internal Linear Combination (NILC), have proven effective in reconstructing the CMB polarization signal and mitigating foregrounds across diverse sky models without suffering from mismodelling errors. Still, residual contamination may bias the recovered CMB polarization at large angular scales when confronted with the most complex foreground scenarios. By adding constraints to NILC to deproject moments of the Galactic emission, the Constrained Moment ILC (cMILC) method has proven to enhance foreground subtraction, albeit with an associated increase in overall noise variance. Faced with this trade-off between foreground bias reduction and overall variance minimization, there is still no recipe on which moments to deproject and which are better suited for blind variance minimization. To address this, we introduce the optimized cMILC (ocMILC) pipeline, which performs full optimization of the required number and set of foreground moments to deproject, pivot parameter values, and deprojection coefficients across the sky and angular scales, depending on the actual sky complexity, available frequency coverage, and experiment sensitivity. The optimal number of deprojected moments, before paying significant noise penalty, is determined through a data diagnosis inspired by the Generalized NILC (GNILC) method. Validated on B-mode simulations of the PICO space mission concept with four challenging foreground models, ocMILC exhibits lower foreground contamination compared to NILC and cMILC at all angular scales, with limited noise penalty. This multi-layer optimization enables the ocMILC pipeline to achieve unbiased posteriors of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, regardless of foreground complexity.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on the Dark Energy with a Quadratic Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel late-time effective dark energy model characterized by a quadratic equation of state (EoS) and rigorously examine its observational constraints. Initially, we delve into the background dynamics of this model, tracing the evolution of fluctuations in linear order. Our approach involves substituting the conventional cosmological constant with a dynamically effective dark energy fluid. Leveraging a diverse array of observational datasets encompassing the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Type Ia Supernovae (SNe), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and a prior on the Hubble constant $H_0$ (R21), we constrain the model parameters. We establish the model's consistency by comparing the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift against observational Hubble data (OHD), benchmarking its performance against the Standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Additionally, our investigation delves into studies of the model's dynamical behavior by computing cosmological parameters such as the deceleration parameter, relative Hubble parameter, and the evolution of the Hubble rate. Furthermore, employing Bayesian analysis, we determine the Bayesian Evidence for our proposed model compared to the reference $\Lambda$CDM model. While our analysis unveils the favorable behavior of the model in various observational tests, the well-known cosmological tensions persist when the full dataset combination is explored.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on phenomenological emergent dark energy and barotropic dark matter characterized by a constant equation of state parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new cosmological model that considers dark matter as a barotropic fluid with a constant equation of state parameter and interprets dark energy as the phenomenological emergent dark energy rather than a cosmological constant. This proposal is based on extensive research on the extended properties of dark matter in the context of a cosmological constant and the intriguing findings that have emerged from our exploration of dark matter properties within the context of PEDE in our previous studies. We then place constraints on this model in light of the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, the Pantheon compilation of Type Ia supernovae, a prior on $H_0$ that based on the latest local measurement by Riess et al., and the combination of KiDS and the VISTA Kilo-Degree Infrared Galaxy Survey (KiDS+VIKING-450). The results indicate a preference for a positive dark matter equation of state parameter at 68\% confidence level for CMB+BAO, CMB+BAO+Pantheon and CMB+BAO+Pantheon+$H_0$ datasets. Furthermore, the Hubble tension between all of the datasets we used with R22 is very close to those of the PEDE, and the $S_8$ tension between Planck 2018 and KiDS+VIKING-450 is reduced from 2.3$\sigma$ in the PEDE model to 0.4$\sigma$ in the new model. However, Bayesian evidence indicates that PEDE favors our new model with very strong evidence from all the datasets considered in this study. Consequently, we conclude that the PEDE+$w_{\rm dm}$ model is not a viable alternative to the PEDE model.</description>

Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBH) could dominate in the early universe and, evaporating before Big bang Nucleosynthesis, can provide new freeze in mechanism of dark matter (DM) production. The proposed scenario is considered for two possible mechanisms of PBH formation and the corresponding continuous PBH mass spectra so that the effect of non-single PBH mass spectrum is taken into account in the results of PBH evaporation, by which PBH dominance in the early universe ends. We specify the conditions under which the proposed scenario can explain production of dark matter in very early Universe.</description>

      <title>BCS in the Sky: Signatures of Inflationary Fermion Condensation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-like model in the inflationary background. We show that with an axial chemical potential, the attractive quartic fermion self-interaction can lead to a BCS-like condensation. In the rigid-de Sitter (dS) limit of inflation where backreaction from the inflaton and graviton is neglected, we perform the first computation of the non-perturbative effective potential that includes the full spacetime curvature effects in the presence of the chemical potential, subject to the mean-field approximation whose validity has been checked via the Ginzburg criterion. The corresponding BCS phase transition is always first-order, when the varying Hubble is interpreted as an effective Gibbons-Hawking temperature of dS spacetime. In the condensed phase, the theory can be understood from UV and IR sides as fermionic and bosonic, respectively. This leads to distinctive signatures in the primordial non-Gaussianity of curvature perturbations. Namely, the oscillatory cosmological collider signal is smoothly turned off at a finite momentum ratio, since different momentum ratios effectively probe different energy scales. In addition, such BCS phase transitions can also source stochastic gravitational waves, which are feasible for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Correlators Through the Looking Glass: Reality, Parity, and Factorisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the evolution of quantum fields during inflation, and show that the total-energy singularities appearing in the perturbative expansion of the late-time Wavefunction of the Universe are purely real when the external states are massless scalars and massless gravitons. Our proof relies on the tree-level approximation, Bunch-Davies initial conditions, and exact scale invariance (IR-convergence), but without any assumptions on invariance under de Sitter boosts. We consider all $n$-point functions and allow for the exchange of additional states of any mass and integer spin. Our proof makes use of a decomposition of the inflationary bulk-bulk propagator of massive spinning fields which preserves UV-convergence and ensures that the time-ordered contributions are purely real after we rotate to Euclidean time. We use this reality property to show that the maximally-connected parts of wavefunction coefficients, from which total-energy singularities originate, are purely real. In a theory where all states are in the complementary series, this reality extends to the full wavefunction coefficient. We then use our reality theorem to show that parity-odd correlators (correlators that are mirror asymmetric) are factorised and do not diverge when the total-energy is conserved. We pay special attention to the parity-odd four-point function (trispectrum) of inflationary curvature perturbations and use our reality/factorisation theorems to show that this observable is factorised into a product of cubic diagrams thereby enabling us to derive exact shapes. We present examples of couplings between the inflaton and massive spin-1 and spin-2 fields, with the parity-violation in the trispectrum driven by Chern-Simons corrections to the spinning field two-point function, or from parity-violating cubic interactions which we build within the Effective Field Theory of Inflation.</description>

      <title>Constraining tensor-to-scalar ratio based on VLBI observations: PGWs induced-incoherence approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we show that the background of primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) predicted by the inflationary scenario induce a decrease of the spatial coherence length of an electromagnetic field propagating over cosmological distances, leading the van Citter-Zernike correlations to eventually be unobservable, an affect called as blurring. Since this spatial correlation is actually observed in VLBI measurements of distant quasars, it imposes a constraint on the level of the primordial gravitational waves background. In this paper, we precisely evaluate this blurring effect by considering the primordial gravitational waves background to be in the so-called two-mode squeezed state, which is the standard quantum state predicted by the simplest scenario of inflation. We then exploit a sample of compact radio quasars located at redshift range $0.46\leq z \leq 2.73$ observed by very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) means. These quasars constitute a standard ruler and the angular size-distance $\theta-z$ relation is determined thanks to the measurement of their spatial coherence. These spatial coherence observations set an upper limit on the squeezing parameters of the PGWs background, which turns into an upper limit for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $\text{r}_{k_0}$. One finds $\text{r}_{k_0} &lt; 10^{-7}$, five orders of magnitude better than present constraints on this parameter with the CMB. This result is nevertheless compatible with the possible detection of a cosmic background by the pulsar timing array measurement. Further issues and caveats that potentially affect the results are reviewed. In particular, the possible effect of quantum-to-classical transition of PGWs is discussed. Ultimately, we promote the idea of using high-precision VLBI measurement of angular size-redshift of distant sources as a new possible way of constraining the background of primordial tensor perturbations.</description>

      <title>Schwarzschild black hole and redshift rapidity: A new approach towards measuring cosmic distances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent achievements of a full general relativistic method in estimating the mass-to-distance ratio of supermassive black holes hosted at the core of active galactic nuclei, we introduce the new concept redshift rapidity in order to express the Schwarzschild black hole mass and its distance from the Earth just in terms of observational quantities. The redshift rapidity is also an observable relativistic invariant that represents the evolution of the frequency shift with respect to proper time in the Schwarzschild spacetime. We extract concise and elegant analytic formulas that allow us to disentangle mass and distance to black holes in the Schwarzschild background and estimate these parameters separately. This procedure is performed in a completely general relativistic way with the aim of improving the precision in measuring cosmic distances to astrophysical compact objects. Our exact formulas are valid on the midline and close to the line of sight, having direct astrophysical applications for megamaser systems, whereas the general relations can be employed in black hole parameter estimation studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the presence of axion dark matter, fermion spins experience an "axion wind" torque and an "axioelectric" force. We investigate new experimental probes of these effects and find that magnetized analogs of multilayer dielectric haloscopes can explore orders of magnitude of new parameter space for the axion-electron coupling. We also revisit the calculation of axion absorption into in-medium excitations, showing that axioelectric absorption is screened in spin-polarized targets, and axion wind absorption can be characterized in terms of a magnetic energy loss function. Finally, our detailed theoretical treatment allows us to critically examine recent claims in the literature. We find that axioelectric corrections to electronic energy levels are smaller than previously estimated and that the purported electron electric dipole moment due to a constant axion field is entirely spurious.</description>

Abstract: We propose a model of uniform rate inflation on the brane. The potential is given by a hyperbolic cosine function plus a negative cosmological constant. The equation of motion is solved analytically without using slow-roll approximation. The result is that the inflaton field is rolling at a constant speed. The prediction for cosmological perturbations depends on the field value at the end of inflation. The experimental constraints could be satisfied in the parameter space.</description>

      <title>A Novel Model for the MeV Emission Line in GRB 221009A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have long been considered potential sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs; with energy $\gtrsim 10^{18} {\rm~eV}$). In this work, we propose a novel model generating MeV emission lines in GRB, which can constrain the properties of heavy nuclei that potentially exist in GRB jets. Specifically, we find that relativistic hydrogen-like high-atomic-number ions originating from the $\beta$ decay of unstable nuclei and/or the recombination entrained in the GRB jet can generate narrow MeV emission lines through the de-excitation of excited-electrons. This model can successfully explain the MeV emission line observed in the most luminous GRB ever recorded, GRB~221009A, with suitable parameters including a Lorentz factor $\gamma \sim 820-1700$ and a total mass of heavy nuclei $M_{\rm tot} \sim 10^{23} - 10^{26}$~g. Especially, the emission line broadening can be reasonably attributed to both the expansion of the jet shell and the thermal motion of nuclei, naturally resulting in a narrow width ($\sigma_{\rm line} / E_{\rm line} \lesssim 0.2$) consistent with the observation. Furthermore, we predict that different GRBs can exhibit lines in different bands with various evolving behaviors, which might be confirmed with further observations. Finally, our model provides indirect evidence that GRBs may be one of the sources of UHECRs.</description>

      <title>WST -- Widefield Spectroscopic Telescope: Motivation, science drivers and top-level requirements for a new dedicated facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the wide-field spectroscopic survey telescope (WST) project. WST is a 12-metre wide-field spectroscopic survey telescope with simultaneous operation of a large field-of-view (3 sq. degree), high-multiplex (20,000) multi-object spectrograph (MOS), with both a low and high-resolution modes, and a giant 3x3 arcmin2 integral field spectrograph (IFS). In scientific capability, these specifications place WST far ahead of existing and planned facilities. In only 5 years of operation, the MOS would target 250 million galaxies and 25 million stars at low spectral resolution, plus 2 million stars at high resolution. Without need for pre-imaged targets, the IFS would deliver 4 billion spectra offering many serendipitous discoveries. Given the current investment in deep imaging surveys and noting the diagnostic power of spectroscopy, WST will fill a crucial gap in astronomical capability and work in synergy with future ground and space-based facilities. We show how it can address outstanding scientific questions in the areas of cosmology; galaxy assembly, evolution, and enrichment, including our own Milky Way; the origin of stars and planets; and time domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. WST's uniquely rich dataset may yield unforeseen discoveries in many of these areas. The telescope and instruments are designed as an integrated system and will mostly use existing technology, with the aim to minimise the carbon footprint and environmental impact. We will propose WST as the next European Southern Observatory (ESO) project after completion of the 39-metre ELT.</description>

      <title>The formation and survival of cold gas in a magnetized cool-core galaxy cluster</title>

Abstract: Filaments of cold gas ($T\leq 10^{4}$ K) are found in the inner regions of many cool-core clusters. These structures are thought to play a major role in the regulation of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN). We study the morphology of the filaments, their formation, and their impact on the propagation of the outflowing AGN jets. We present a set of GPU-accelerated 3D (magneto)hydrodynamical simulations of an idealized Perseus-like cluster using the performance portable code AthenaPK. We include radiative cooling, and a self-regulated AGN feedback model that redistributes accreted material through kinetic, thermal and magnetic feedback. We confirm that magnetic fields play an important role in both the formation and evolution of the cold material. These suppress the formation of massive cold disks and favor magnetically supported filaments over clumpy structures. Achieving resolutions of $25-50$ pc, we find that filaments are not monolithic as they contain numerous and complex magnetically--supported substructures. We find that the mass distribution of these clumps follows a power law for all investigated filaments, consistent with previous cloud-crushing simulations of individual clumps. Studying the evolution of individual filaments, we find that their formation pathways can be diverse. We find examples of filaments forming through a combination of cold gas uplifting and condensation, as well as systems of purely infalling clumps condensing out of the intracluster medium. The density contrast between the cold gas and the outflowing hot material leads to recurring deflections of the jets, favoring inflation of bubbles.</description>

      <title>Discovery of An Apparent Red, High-Velocity Type Ia Supernova at z = 2.9 with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the JWST discovery of SN 2023adsy, a transient object located in a host galaxy JADES-GS$+53.13485$$-$$27.82088$ with a host spectroscopic redshift of $2.903\pm0.007$. The transient was identified in deep James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRCam imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program. Photometric and spectroscopic followup with NIRCam and NIRSpec, respectively, confirm the redshift and yield UV-NIR light-curve, NIR color, and spectroscopic information all consistent with a Type Ia classification. Despite its classification as a likely SN Ia, SN 2023adsy is both fairly red (E(B-V)$\sim0.9$) despite a host galaxy with low-extinction and has a high Ca II velocity ($19,000\pm2,000$km/s) compared to the general population of SNe Ia. While these characteristics are consistent with some Ca-rich SNe Ia, particularly SN 2016hnk, SN 2023adsy is intrinsically brighter than the low-z Ca-rich population. Although such an object is too red for any low-z cosmological sample, we apply a fiducial standardization approach to SN 2023adsy and find that the SN 2023adsy luminosity distance measurement is in excellent agreement ($\lesssim1\sigma$) with $\Lambda$CDM. Therefore unlike low-z Ca-rich SNe Ia, SN 2023adsy is standardizable and gives no indication that SN Ia standardized luminosities change significantly with redshift. A larger sample of distant SNe Ia is required to determine if SN Ia population characteristics at high-z truly diverge from their low-z counterparts, and to confirm that standardized luminosities nevertheless remain constant with redshift.</description>
