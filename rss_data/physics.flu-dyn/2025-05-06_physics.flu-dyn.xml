      <title>An Adaptive Framework for Autoregressive Forecasting in CFD Using Hybrid Modal Decomposition and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first generalizable and fully data-driven adaptive framework designed to stabilize deep learning (DL) autoregressive forecasting models over long time horizons, with the goal of reducing the computational cost required in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations.The proposed methodology alternates between two phases: (i) predicting the evolution of the flow field over a selected time interval using a trained DL model, and (ii) updating the model with newly generated CFD data when stability degrades, thus maintaining accurate long-term forecasting. This adaptive retraining strategy ensures robustness while avoiding the accumulation of predictive errors typical in autoregressive models. The framework is validated across three increasingly complex flow regimes, from laminar to turbulent, demonstrating from 30 \% to 95 \% reduction in computational cost without compromising physical consistency or accuracy. Its entirely data-driven nature makes it easily adaptable to a wide range of time-dependent simulation problems. The code implementing this methodology is available as open-source and it will be integrated into the upcoming release of the ModelFLOWs-app.</description>

      <title>Stratified wakes of a prolate spheroid at moderate angle of attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ocean submersibles and aerial vehicles often encounter a density-stratified environment whose effect on flow features is of interest. A 6:1 prolate spheroid of diameter $D$ with velocity $U$ and at a moderate angle of attack (AOA) of $10^\circ$ is taken as a canonical example of a submersible. Buoyancy effects are examined in a parametric LES study of the spheroid wake at $Re = UD/\nu = 5000$ where stratification is changed to cover a wide range of values of body Froude number ($Fr = U/ND$). The Froude number measures buoyancy time scale (1/$N$ where $N$ is the buoyancy frequency) relative to flow time scale ($D/U$). The simulated cases range from a baseline case without stratification, i.e. $Fr = \infty$, to the substantial stratification level of $Fr = 1$. The very near wake, just two body diameters aft of the trailing edge, is found to be substantially altered at even the relatively weak stratification of $Fr = 6$. Specifically, the coherence of the streamwise vortex pair shed from the body is weakened, the downward trajectory of the wake center is suppressed, and the mean/turbulence structure changes in the near wake. Diagnosis of the vorticity transport equation reveals that the baroclinic torque becomes an important contributor to the balance of mean streamwise vorticity in the very near wake at $Fr = 6$. With increasing stratification, the wake topology changes significantly, e.g. the $Fr =1$ case exhibits a secondary wake above the primary wake.</description>

      <title>Morphological Regimes of Rotating Moist Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moist convection is a physical process where the latent heat released by condensation acts as a buoyancy source that can enhance or even trigger an overturning convective instability. Since the saturation temperature often decreases with height, condensation releases latent heat preferentially in regions of upflow. Due to this inhomogeneous heat source, moist convection may be more sensitive to changes in flow morphology, such as those induced by rotation, than dry Rayleigh-B\'enard convection. In order to study the effects of rotation on flows driven by latent heat release, we present a suite of numerical simulations that solve the Rainy-B\'enard equations (Vallis et al. 2019). We identify three morphological regimes: a cellular regime and a plume regime broadly analogous to those found in rotating Rayleigh B\'enard convection, and a novel funnel regime that lacks a clear analog within the regimes exhibited by dry convection. We measure energy fluxes through the system and report rotational scalings of the Reynolds and moist Nusselt numbers. We find that moist static energy transport, as measured by a moist Nusselt number, is significantly enhanced in the funnel regime without a corresponding enhancement in Reynolds number, indicating that this funnel regime produces structures with more favorable correlations between the temperature and vertical velocity.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Driven Development of Turbulence Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved human-level performance in specialized tasks such as Go, image recognition, and protein folding, raising the prospect of an AI singularity-where machines not only match but surpass human reasoning. Here, we demonstrate a step toward this vision in the context of turbulence modeling. By treating a large language model (LLM), DeepSeek-R1, as an equal partner, we establish a closed-loop, iterative workflow in which the LLM proposes, refines, and reasons about near-wall turbulence models under adverse pressure gradients (APGs), system rotation, and surface roughness. Through multiple rounds of interaction involving long-chain reasoning and a priori and a posteriori evaluations, the LLM generates models that not only rediscover established strategies but also synthesize new ones that outperform baseline wall models. Specifically, it recommends incorporating a material derivative to capture history effects in APG flows, modifying the law of the wall to account for system rotation, and developing rough-wall models informed by surface statistics. In contrast to conventional data-driven turbulence modeling-often characterized by human-designed, black-box architectures-the models developed here are physically interpretable and grounded in clear reasoning.</description>

      <title>The Lagrangian kinetic energy cascade in Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection at high Rayleigh number exhibits turbulence superimposed on large-scale circulation. While buoyancy forces drive the flow at certain scales, how kinetic energy is transfers across the scales is not understood. Here, utilizing a Lagrangian description of the kinetic energy flux, we present experimental evidence of a split cascade where energy flows downwscale at small scales and upscale at large scales. The flow topology of these energy transfer events differ profoundly, and the transition between them occurs gradually, over a broad range of scales.</description>

      <title>Coalescence of viscoelastic sessile drops: the small and large contact angle limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coalescence and breakup of drops are classic examples of flows that feature singularities. The behavior of viscoelastic fluids near these singularities is particularly intriguing - not only because of their added complexity, but also due to the unexpected responses they often exhibit. In particular, experiments have shown that the coalescence of viscoelastic sessile drops can differ significantly from their Newtonian counterparts, sometimes resulting in a sharply defined interface. However, the mechanisms driving these differences in dynamics, as well as the potential influence of the contact angle, remain largely qualitative or unknown. Here, we study two different flow regimes effectively induced by varying the contact angle and demonstrate how that leads to markedly different coalescence behaviors. We show that the coalescence dynamics is effectively unaltered by viscoelasticity at small contact angles. The Deborah number, which is the ratio of the relaxation time of the polymer to the timescale of coalescence, scales as $\theta^3$ for $\theta \ll 1$, thus rationalizing the near-Newtonian response. On the other hand, it has been shown previously that viscoelasticity alters the shape of the interface during coalescence at large contact angles but does not affect the temporal evolution of the shape. We study this large contact angle limit using experiments and 2D numerical simulations of the equation of motion, using the Oldroyd-B model for the constitutive representation. We show that the departure of the coalescence dynamics from the Newtonian case is a function of the Deborah number and the elastocapillary number.</description>

      <title>Sloshing suppression with a controlled elastic baffle via deep reinforcement learning and SPH simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employed smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) as the numerical environment, integrated with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) real-time control algorithms to optimize the sloshing suppression in a tank with a centrally positioned vertical elastic baffle. Compared to rigid baffle movement and active strain control methods, the active-controlled movable elastic baffle, which remains undeformed at its base, achieved the best performance with an 81.63% reduction in mean free surface amplitude. A cosine-based expert policy derived from DRL data is also extracted, resulting in a comparable 76.86% reduction in a three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulation. Energy analyses showed that elastic baffle motion effectively decreased system energy by performing negative work on the fluid, reducing kinetic and potential energy. The DRL-based and expert policies also demonstrated robust performance across varying excitation frequencies and water depths. Specifically, rigid baffles proved more effective at frequencies below the system's first natural frequency, while elastic baffles exhibited superior performance at higher frequencies. Changes in water depth minimally affected the effectiveness of control policies, though they significantly influenced elastic baffle deformation behavior. Overall, the sloshing suppression efficiency consistently ranged between 70% and 80%, confirming DRL-informed control methods' versatility and effectiveness under diverse operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification and Flow Dynamics in Rotating Detonation Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotating detonation engines (RDEs) are a critical technology for advancing combustion engines, particularly in applications requiring high efficiency and performance. Understanding the supersonic detonation structure and how various parameters influence these phenomena is essential for optimizing RDE design. In this study, we perform detailed simulations of detonations in an RDE and analyze how the flow patterns are affected by key parameters associated with the droplet arrangement within the engine. To further explore the system's sensitivity, we apply polynomial chaos expansion to investigate the propagation of uncertainties from input parameters to quantities of interest (QoIs). Additionally, we develop a framework to accurately characterize the joint distributions of QoIs with a limited number of simulations. Our findings indicate that the strategic arrangement of droplets is crucial for sustaining continuous detonation waves in the engine, and high-order chaos expansion is essential to accurately capture the dependence between QoIs and input uncertainties. These insights provide a strong foundation for further optimization of RDE designs.</description>

      <title>A Numerical Investigation of the Aeroelastic Interaction between Transonic Buffet and Structural Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transonic shock buffet is a nonlinear, unsteady aerodynamic phenomenon characterized by self-sustained, periodic shock oscillations that can critically affect aircraft structural integrity. While the aerodynamic aspects of shock buffet have been widely studied, its interaction with nonlinear structural dynamics remains largely unexplored. This paper presents, for the first time, a numerical investigation of aeroelastic interactions arising from the coupling of shock buffet with a nonlinear structural model featuring pitch freeplay. Using unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations coupled with a two-degree-of-freedom heave-pitch airfoil model, the study reveals that structural nonlinearity can induce aerodynamic lock-in to superharmonics of the heave natural frequency, resulting in 2:1 and 3:1 resonance mechanisms and large-amplitude heave limit cycles. These newly identified resonance behaviors expand the current understanding of transonic aeroelastic instabilities. The influence of key parameters such as structural-to-fluid mass ratio and structural damping on these phenomena is also systematically examined. This work introduces a novel class of aeroelastic lock-in mechanisms with significant implications for transonic flight dynamics and aircraft design.</description>

      <title>Temperature and pressure reconstruction in turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection by Lagrangian velocities using PINN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Velocity, pressure, and temperature are the key variables for understanding thermal convection, and measuring them all is a complex task. In this paper, we demonstrate a method to reconstruct temperature and pressure fields based on given Lagrangian velocity data. A physics-informed neural network (PINN) based on a multilayer perceptron architecture and a periodic sine activation function is used to reconstruct both the temperature and the pressure for two cases of turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (Pr = 6.9, Ra = $10^9$). The first dataset is generated with DNS and it includes Lagrangian velocity data of 150000 tracer particles. The second contains a PTV experiment with the same system parameters in a water-filled cubic cell, and we observed about 50000 active particle tracks per time step with the open-source framework proPTV. A realistic temperature and pressure field could be reconstructed in both cases, which underlines the importance of PINNs also in the context of experimental data. In the case of the DNS, the reconstructed temperature and pressure fields show a 90\% correlation over all particles when directly validated against the ground truth. Thus, the proposed method, in combination with particle tracking velocimetry, is able to provide velocity, temperature, and pressure fields in convective flows even in the hard turbulence regime. The PINN used in this paper is compatible with proPTV and is part of an open source project. It is available on request at https://github.com/DLR_AS_BOA/RBC_PINN.</description>

      <title>Polarity transitions induced by symmetry-breaking outer boundary heat flux in rapidly rotating dynamos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates, analytically and numerically, the role of an equatorially anti-symmetric lateral variation in heat flux at the outer boundary in polarity transitions in rapidly rotating dynamos. In an unstably stratified fluid, the frequencies of vertical and horizontal (lateral) buoyancy complement each other such that a polarity transition is induced by the boundary anti-symmetry through the suppression of the slow magnetic-Archimedean-Coriolis (MAC) waves at relatively small vertical buoyant forcing. A dipole-dominated dynamo in the low-inertia limit transitions to polarity reversing and multipolar states in succession as the relative intensity of horizontal buoyancy is progressively increased for a fixed vertical buoyancy. In the same parameter space, an equatorially symmetric heat flux variation does not induce a polarity transition. A composite boundary heterogeneity consisting of comparable magnitudes of symmetric and anti-symmetric variations induces the polarity transition at a horizontal buoyancy of the same order as that for the transition induced by a purely anti-symmetric variation. This makes the analysis relevant to Earth's core, which convects in response to a composite heat flux variation in the lowermost mantle. A heterogeneity with a dominant symmetric part inhibits polarity transitions, likely producing long periods in Earth's history without reversals. The fact that compositional buoyancy is much stronger than thermal buoyancy, together with the known order of magnitude of the peak field intensity in the inertia-free limit, indicates that the core can operate under a large lower-mantle heat flux heterogeneity, of O(10) times the mean heat flux at the core--mantle boundary.</description>

      <title>Flow induced intermittent transport shapes colloid filtration in complex media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The macroscopic phenomenon of filtration is the separation between suspended and liquid phases and it takes place in natural environments (e.g. groundwater, soil, hyporheic zone) and industrial systems (e.g. filtration plants, pharmaceutical industry, hospital care). Porous materials represent excellent filters since they are characterized by a large solid surface to which flowing particles can attach and be retained. Colloidal filtration by porous media is governed by a complex interplay between transport dynamics through intricate pore structures and surface-mediated retention. Yet, classical approaches fail to capture key properties (such as filter spatial heterogeneity) and experimental observations--e.g. non-exponential deposition profiles. A key limitation of such approaches lies in the assumption that particle attachment to solid surfaces occurs at a constant rate over a given length scale, neglecting the intrinsic heterogeneity of the medium, i.e. pore size variability. Here, we develop a multiscale microfluidic model system to directly observe colloidal transport and deposition over more than three orders of magnitude in length--from tens of microns to a meter--within a porous architecture with controlled heterogeneity. By tracking individual colloidal particles within the pores, we reveal intermittent dynamics along each trajectory: particles alternate between long-range "flights" through pore channels and short-range localized "dives" near grain surfaces. During the dives, attachment can occur at a constant rate, but the distributed flight sizes, during which attachment cannot occur, produce anomalous filtration. This is quantified by deposition profiles and breakthrough curves. A stochastic model based on a continuous time random walk (CTRW), constrained by experimental data, captures this behavior and links pore structure with macroscopic filtration.</description>

      <title>Characterization of sea ice kinematics over oceanic eddies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eddies within the meso/submeso-scale range are prevalent throughout the Arctic Ocean, playing a pivotal role in regulating freshwater budget, heat transfer, and sea ice transport. While observations have suggested a strong connection between the dynamics of sea ice and the underlying turbulent flows, quantifying this relationship remains an ambitious task due to the challenges of acquiring concurrent sea ice and ocean measurements. Recently, an innovative study using a unique algorithm to track sea ice floes showed that ice floes can be used as vorticity meters of the ocean. Here, we present a numerical and analytical evaluation of this result by estimating the kinematic link between free-drifting ice floes and underlying ocean eddies using idealized vortex models. These analyses are expanded to explore local eddies in quasi-geostrophic turbulence, providing a more realistic representation of eddies in the Arctic Ocean. We find that in both flow fields, the relationship between floe rotation rates and ocean vorticity depends on the relative size of the ice floe to the eddy. As the floe size approaches and exceeds the eddy size, the floe rotation rates depart from half of the ocean vorticity. Finally, the effects of ice floe thickness, atmospheric winds, and floe-floe collisions on floe rotations are investigated. The derived relations and floe statistics set the foundation for leveraging remote sensing observations of floe motions to characterize eddy vorticity at small to moderate scales. This innovative approach opens new possibilities for quantifying Arctic Ocean eddy characteristics, providing valuable inputs for more accurate climate projections.</description>

      <title>Weak-Strong Uniqueness and Extreme Wall Events at High Reynolds Number</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00994v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Singular or weak solutions of the incompressible Euler equations have been hypothesized to account for anomalous dissipation at very high Reynolds numbers and, in particular, to explain the d'Alembert paradox of non-vanishing drag. A possible objection to this explanation is the mathematical property called ``weak-strong uniqueness'', which requires that any admissable weak solution of the Euler equations must coincide with the smooth Euler solution for the same initial data. As an application of the Josephson-Anderson relation, we sketch a proof of conditional weak-strong uniqueness for the potential Euler solution of d'Alembert within the class of strong inviscid limits. We suggest that the mild conditions required for weak-strong uniqueness are, in fact, physically violated by violent eruption of very thin boundary layers. We discuss observational signatures of these extreme events and explain how the small length-scales involved could threaten the validity of a hydrodynamic description.</description>

Abstract: Reduced order models (ROMs) play a critical role in fluid mechanics by providing low-cost predictions, making them an attractive tool for engineering applications. However, for ROMs to be widely applicable, they must not only generalise well across different regimes, but also provide a measure of confidence in their predictions. While recent data-driven approaches have begun to address nonlinear reduction techniques to improve predictions in transient environments, challenges remain in terms of robustness and parametrisation. In this work, we present a nonlinear reduction strategy specifically designed for transient flows that incorporates parametrisation and uncertainty quantification. Our reduction strategy features a variational auto-encoder (VAE) that uses variational inference for confidence measurement. We use a latent space transformer that incorporates recent advances in attention mechanisms to predict dynamical systems. Attention's versatility in learning sequences and capturing their dependence on external parameters enhances generalisation across a wide range of dynamics. Prediction, coupled with confidence, enables more informed decision making and addresses the need for more robust models. In addition, this confidence is used to cost-effectively sample the parameter space, improving model performance a priori across the entire parameter space without requiring evaluation data for the entire domain.</description>
