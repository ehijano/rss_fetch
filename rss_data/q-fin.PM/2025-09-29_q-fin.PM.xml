      <title>Optimal Consumption-Investment with Epstein-Zin Utility under Leverage Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study optimal portfolio choice under Epstein-Zin recursive utility in the presence of general leverage constraints. We first establish that the optimal value function is the unique viscosity solution to the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, by developing a new dynamic programming principle under constraints. We further demonstrate that the value function admits smoothness and characterize the optimal consumption and investment strategies. In addition, we derive explicit solutions for the optimal strategy and explicitly delineate the constrained and unconstrained regions in several special cases of the leverage constraint. Finally, we conduct a comparative analysis, highlighting the differences relative to the classical time-separable preferences and to the setting without leverage constraints.</description>

      <title>Factor-Based Conditional Diffusion Model for Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel conditional diffusion model for portfolio optimization that learns the cross-sectional distribution of next-day stock returns conditioned on asset-specific factors. The model builds on the Diffusion Transformer with token-wise conditioning, linking each asset's return to its own factor vector while capturing cross-asset dependencies. Generated return samples are used for daily mean-variance optimization under realistic constraints. Empirical results on the Chinese A-share market show that our approach consistently outperforms benchmark methods based on standard empirical and shrinkage-based estimators across multiple metrics.</description>

      <title>Impact IRR: Leveraging Modern Portfolio Theory to Define Impact Investments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact investment market has an estimated value of almost $1.6 trillion. Significant progress has been made in determining the financial returns of impact investing. Investors are still, however, in the early stages of determining impact return. In this study, the author proposes the use of impact internal rate of return (impact IRR) to evaluate and monitor impact investments. This approach, which utilizes components of modern portfolio theory, adapted financial tools, and existing datasets, is demonstrated herein through initial use cases and examples showing how it can be employed to optimize impact.</description>

      <title>Design and hedging of unit linked life insurance with environmental factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of designing and hedging unit-linked life policies whose benefits depend on an investment fund that incorporates environmental criteria in its selection process. Offering these products poses two key challenges: constructing a green investment fund and developing a hedging strategy for policies written on that fund. We address these two problems separately. First, we design a portfolio selection rule driven by firms' carbon intensity that endogenously selects assets and avoids ad hoc pre-screens based on ESG scores. The effectiveness of our new portfolio selection method is tested using real market data. Second, we adopt the perspective of an insurance company issuing unit-linked policies written on this fund. Such contracts are exposed to market, carbon, and mortality risk, which the insurer seeks to hedge. Due to market incompleteness, we address the hedging problem via a quadratic approach aimed at minimizing the tracking error. We also make a numerical analysis to assess the performance of the hedging strategy. For our simulation study, we use an efficient weak second-order scheme that allows for variance reduction.</description>
