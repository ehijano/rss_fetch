      <title>Privacy-preserving recommender system using the data collaboration analysis for distributed datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to provide high-quality recommendations for users, it is desirable to share and integrate multiple datasets held by different parties. However, when sharing such distributed datasets, we need to protect personal and confidential information contained in the datasets. To this end, we establish a framework for privacy-preserving recommender systems using the data collaboration analysis of distributed datasets. Numerical experiments with two public rating datasets demonstrate that our privacy-preserving method for rating prediction can improve the prediction accuracy for distributed datasets. This study opens up new possibilities for privacy-preserving techniques in recommender systems.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study of Excitation and Aggregation Design Adaptions in CLIP4Clip for Video-Text Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CLIP4Clip model transferred from the CLIP has been the de-factor standard to solve the video clip retrieval task from frame-level input, triggering the surge of CLIP4Clip-based models in the video-text retrieval domain. In this work, we rethink the inherent limitation of widely-used mean pooling operation in the frame features aggregation and investigate the adaptions of excitation and aggregation design for discriminative video representation generation. We present a novel excitationand-aggregation design, including (1) The excitation module is available for capturing non-mutuallyexclusive relationships among frame features and achieving frame-wise features recalibration, and (2) The aggregation module is applied to learn exclusiveness used for frame representations aggregation. Similarly, we employ the cascade of sequential module and aggregation design to generate discriminative video representation in the sequential type. Besides, we adopt the excitation design in the tight type to obtain representative frame features for multi-modal interaction. The proposed modules are evaluated on three benchmark datasets of MSR-VTT, ActivityNet and DiDeMo, achieving MSR-VTT (43.9 R@1), ActivityNet (44.1 R@1) and DiDeMo (31.0 R@1). They outperform the CLIP4Clip results by +1.2% (+0.5%), +4.5% (+1.9%) and +9.5% (+2.7%) relative (absolute) improvements, demonstrating the superiority of our proposed excitation and aggregation designs. We hope our work will serve as an alternative for frame representations aggregation and facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>SymTax: Symbiotic Relationship and Taxonomy Fusion for Effective Citation Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Citing pertinent literature is pivotal to writing and reviewing a scientific document. Existing techniques mainly focus on the local context or the global context for recommending citations but fail to consider the actual human citation behaviour. We propose SymTax, a three-stage recommendation architecture that considers both the local and the global context, and additionally the taxonomical representations of query-candidate tuples and the Symbiosis prevailing amongst them. SymTax learns to embed the infused taxonomies in the hyperbolic space and uses hyperbolic separation as a latent feature to compute query-candidate similarity. We build a novel and large dataset ArSyTa containing 8.27 million citation contexts and describe the creation process in detail. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness and design choice of each module in our framework. Also, combinatorial analysis from our experiments shed light on the choice of language models (LMs) and fusion embedding, and the inclusion of section heading as a signal. Our proposed module that captures the symbiotic relationship solely leads to performance gains of 26.66% and 39.25% in Recall@5 w.r.t. SOTA on ACL-200 and RefSeer datasets, respectively. The complete framework yields a gain of 22.56% in Recall@5 wrt SOTA on our proposed dataset. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/goyalkaraniit/SymTax</description>

      <title>Recent advances in text embedding: A Comprehensive Review of Top-Performing Methods on the MTEB Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text embedding methods have become increasingly popular in both industrial and academic fields due to their critical role in a variety of natural language processing tasks. The significance of universal text embeddings has been further highlighted with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) applications such as Retrieval-Augmented Systems (RAGs). While previous models have attempted to be general-purpose, they often struggle to generalize across tasks and domains. However, recent advancements in training data quantity, quality and diversity; synthetic data generation from LLMs as well as using LLMs as backbones encourage great improvements in pursuing universal text embeddings. In this paper, we provide an overview of the recent advances in universal text embedding models with a focus on the top performing text embeddings on Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). Through detailed comparison and analysis, we highlight the key contributions and limitations in this area, and propose potentially inspiring future research directions.</description>

      <title>Detecting Deceptive Dark Patterns in E-commerce Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark patterns are deceptive user interfaces employed by e-commerce websites to manipulate user's behavior in a way that benefits the website, often unethically. This study investigates the detection of such dark patterns. Existing solutions include UIGuard, which uses computer vision and natural language processing, and approaches that categorize dark patterns based on detectability or utilize machine learning models trained on datasets. We propose combining web scraping techniques with fine-tuned BERT language models and generative capabilities to identify dark patterns, including outliers. The approach scrapes textual content, feeds it into the BERT model for detection, and leverages BERT's bidirectional analysis and generation abilities. The study builds upon research on automatically detecting and explaining dark patterns, aiming to raise awareness and protect consumers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally in the domain of legal research, the retrieval of pertinent citations from intricate case descriptions has demanded manual effort and keyword-based search applications that mandate expertise in understanding legal jargon. Legal case descriptions hold pivotal information for legal professionals and researchers, necessitating more efficient and automated approaches. We propose a methodology that combines natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to enhance the organization and utilization of legal case descriptions. This approach revolves around the creation of textual embeddings with the help of state-of-art embedding models. Our methodology addresses two primary objectives: unsupervised clustering and supervised citation retrieval, both designed to automate the citation extraction process. Although the proposed methodology can be used for any dataset, we employed the Supreme Court of The United States (SCOTUS) dataset, yielding remarkable results. Our methodology achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 90.9%. By automating labor-intensive processes, we pave the way for a more efficient, time-saving, and accessible landscape in legal research, benefiting legal professionals, academics, and researchers.</description>

      <title>System-2 Recommenders: Disentangling Utility and Engagement in Recommendation Systems via Temporal Point-Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems are an important part of the modern human experience whose influence ranges from the food we eat to the news we read. Yet, there is still debate as to what extent recommendation platforms are aligned with the user goals. A core issue fueling this debate is the challenge of inferring a user utility based on engagement signals such as likes, shares, watch time etc., which are the primary metric used by platforms to optimize content. This is because users utility-driven decision-processes (which we refer to as System-2), e.g., reading news that are relevant for them, are often confounded by their impulsive decision-processes (which we refer to as System-1), e.g., spend time on click-bait news. As a result, it is difficult to infer whether an observed engagement is utility-driven or impulse-driven. In this paper we explore a new approach to recommender systems where we infer user utility based on their return probability to the platform rather than engagement signals. Our intuition is that users tend to return to a platform in the long run if it creates utility for them, while pure engagement-driven interactions that do not add utility, may affect user return in the short term but will not have a lasting effect. We propose a generative model in which past content interactions impact the arrival rates of users based on a self-exciting Hawkes process. These arrival rates to the platform are a combination of both System-1 and System-2 decision processes. The System-2 arrival intensity depends on the utility and has a long lasting effect, while the System-1 intensity depends on the instantaneous gratification and tends to vanish rapidly. We show analytically that given samples it is possible to disentangle System-1 and System-2 and allow content optimization based on user utility. We conduct experiments on synthetic data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>FinEmbedDiff: A Cost-Effective Approach of Classifying Financial Documents with Vector Sampling using Multi-modal Embedding Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate classification of multi-modal financial documents, containing text, tables, charts, and images, is crucial but challenging. Traditional text-based approaches often fail to capture the complex multi-modal nature of these documents. We propose FinEmbedDiff, a cost-effective vector sampling method that leverages pre-trained multi-modal embedding models to classify financial documents. Our approach generates multi-modal embedding vectors for documents, and compares new documents with pre-computed class embeddings using vector similarity measures. Evaluated on a large dataset, FinEmbedDiff achieves competitive classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines while significantly reducing computational costs. The method exhibits strong generalization capabilities, making it a practical and scalable solution for real-world financial applications.</description>

      <title>RecDiff: Diffusion Model for Social Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social recommendation has emerged as a powerful approach to enhance personalized recommendations by leveraging the social connections among users, such as following and friend relations observed in online social platforms. The fundamental assumption of social recommendation is that socially-connected users exhibit homophily in their preference patterns. This means that users connected by social ties tend to have similar tastes in user-item activities, such as rating and purchasing. However, this assumption is not always valid due to the presence of irrelevant and false social ties, which can contaminate user embeddings and adversely affect recommendation accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a novel diffusion-based social denoising framework for recommendation (RecDiff). Our approach utilizes a simple yet effective hidden-space diffusion paradigm to alleivate the noisy effect in the compressed and dense representation space. By performing multi-step noise diffusion and removal, RecDiff possesses a robust ability to identify and eliminate noise from the encoded user representations, even when the noise levels vary. The diffusion module is optimized in a downstream task-aware manner, thereby maximizing its ability to enhance the recommendation process. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the efficacy of our framework, and the results demonstrate its superiority in terms of recommendation accuracy, training efficiency, and denoising effectiveness. The source code for the model implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/RecDiff.</description>

      <title>An LLM-based Recommender System Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained popularity in the realm of recommender systems due to its ability to optimize long-term rewards and guide users in discovering relevant content. However, the successful implementation of RL in recommender systems is challenging because of several factors, including the limited availability of online data for training on-policy methods. This scarcity requires expensive human interaction for online model training. Furthermore, the development of effective evaluation frameworks that accurately reflect the quality of models remains a fundamental challenge in recommender systems. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive framework for synthetic environments that simulate human behavior by harnessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We complement our framework with in-depth ablation studies and demonstrate its effectiveness with experiments on movie and book recommendations. By utilizing LLMs as synthetic users, this work introduces a modular and novel framework for training RL-based recommender systems. The software, including the RL environment, is publicly available.</description>

      <title>On Overcoming Miscalibrated Conversational Priors in LLM-based Chatbots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the use of Large Language Model (LLM-based) chatbots to power recommender systems. We observe that the chatbots respond poorly when they encounter under-specified requests (e.g., they make incorrect assumptions, hedge with a long response, or refuse to answer). We conjecture that such miscalibrated response tendencies (i.e., conversational priors) can be attributed to LLM fine-tuning using annotators -- single-turn annotations may not capture multi-turn conversation utility, and the annotators' preferences may not even be representative of users interacting with a recommender system.
  We first analyze public LLM chat logs to conclude that query under-specification is common. Next, we study synthetic recommendation problems with configurable latent item utilities and frame them as Partially Observed Decision Processes (PODP). We find that pre-trained LLMs can be sub-optimal for PODPs and derive better policies that clarify under-specified queries when appropriate. Then, we re-calibrate LLMs by prompting them with learned control messages to approximate the improved policy. Finally, we show empirically that our lightweight learning approach effectively uses logged conversation data to re-calibrate the response strategies of LLM-based chatbots for recommendation tasks.</description>

      <title>Session Context Embedding for Intent Understanding in Product Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is often noted that single query-item pair relevance training in search does not capture the customer intent. User intent can be better deduced from a series of engagements (Clicks, ATCs, Orders) in a given search session. We propose a novel method for vectorizing session context for capturing and utilizing context in retrieval and rerank. In the runtime, session embedding is an alternative to query embedding, saved and updated after each request in the session, it can be used for retrieval and ranking. We outline session embedding's solution to session-based intent understanding and its architecture, the background to this line of thought in search and recommendation, detail the methodologies implemented, and finally present the results of an implementation of session embedding for query product type classification. We demonstrate improvements over strategies ignoring session context in the runtime for user intent understanding.</description>

      <title>Auto-Encoding or Auto-Regression? A Reality Check on Causality of Self-Attention-Based Sequential Recommenders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The comparison between Auto-Encoding (AE) and Auto-Regression (AR) has become an increasingly important topic with recent advances in sequential recommendation. At the heart of this discussion lies the comparison of BERT4Rec and SASRec, which serve as representative AE and AR models for self-attentive sequential recommenders. Yet the conclusion of this debate remains uncertain due to: (1) the lack of fair and controlled environments for experiments and evaluations; and (2) the presence of numerous confounding factors w.r.t. feature selection, modeling choices and optimization algorithms. In this work, we aim to answer this question by conducting a series of controlled experiments. We start by tracing the AE/AR debate back to its origin through a systematic re-evaluation of SASRec and BERT4Rec, discovering that AR models generally surpass AE models in sequential recommendation. In addition, we find that AR models further outperforms AE models when using a customized design space that includes additional features, modeling approaches and optimization techniques. Furthermore, the performance advantage of AR models persists in the broader HuggingFace transformer ecosystems. Lastly, we provide potential explanations and insights into AE/AR performance from two key perspectives: low-rank approximation and inductive bias.

      <title>Robust Interaction-based Relevance Modeling for Online E-Commerce and LLM-based Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic relevance calculation is crucial for e-commerce search engines, as it ensures that the items selected closely align with customer intent. Inadequate attention to this aspect can detrimentally affect user experience and engagement. Traditional text-matching techniques are prevalent but often fail to capture the nuances of search intent accurately, so neural networks now have become a preferred solution to processing such complex text matching. Existing methods predominantly employ representation-based architectures, which strike a balance between high traffic capacity and low latency. However, they exhibit significant shortcomings in generalization and robustness when compared to interaction-based architectures. In this work, we introduce a robust interaction-based modeling paradigm to address these shortcomings. It encompasses 1) a dynamic length representation scheme for expedited inference, 2) a professional terms recognition method to identify subjects and core attributes from complex sentence structures, and 3) a contrastive adversarial training protocol to bolster the model's robustness and matching capabilities. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate the superior robustness and effectiveness of our approach, and online A/B testing confirms its ability to improve relevance in the same exposure position, resulting in more clicks and conversions. To the best of our knowledge, this method is the first interaction-based approach for large e-commerce search relevance calculation. Notably, we have deployed it for the entire search traffic on alibaba.com, the largest B2B e-commerce platform in the world.</description>

      <title>Pairwise Ranking Loss for Multi-Task Learning in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02163v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) plays a crucial role in real-world advertising applications such as recommender systems, aiming to achieve robust representations while minimizing resource consumption. MTL endeavors to simultaneously optimize multiple tasks to construct a unified model serving diverse objectives. In online advertising systems, tasks like Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR) are often treated as MTL problems concurrently. However, it has been overlooked that a conversion ($y_{cvr}=1$) necessitates a preceding click ($y_{ctr}=1$). In other words, while certain CTR tasks are associated with corresponding conversions, others lack such associations. Moreover, the likelihood of noise is significantly higher in CTR tasks where conversions do not occur compared to those where they do, and existing methods lack the ability to differentiate between these two scenarios. In this study, exposure labels corresponding to conversions are regarded as definitive indicators, and a novel task-specific loss is introduced by calculating a \textbf{p}air\textbf{wise} \textbf{r}anking (PWiseR) loss between model predictions, manifesting as pairwise ranking loss, to encourage the model to rely more on them. To demonstrate the effect of the proposed loss function, experiments were conducted on different MTL and Single-Task Learning (STL) models using four distinct public MTL datasets, namely Alibaba FR, NL, US, and CCP, along with a proprietary industrial dataset. The results indicate that our proposed loss function outperforms the BCE loss function in most cases in terms of the AUC metric.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Make Sample-Efficient Recommender Systems</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in the field of natural language processing (NLP), demonstrating remarkable abilities in producing text that resembles human language for various tasks. This opens up new opportunities for employing them in recommender systems (RSs). In this paper, we specifically examine the sample efficiency of LLM-enhanced recommender systems, which pertains to the model's capacity to attain superior performance with a limited quantity of training data. Conventional recommendation models (CRMs) often need a large amount of training data because of the sparsity of features and interactions. Hence, we propose and verify our core viewpoint: Large Language Models Make Sample-Efficient Recommender Systems. We propose a simple yet effective framework (i.e., Laser) to validate the viewpoint from two aspects: (1) LLMs themselves are sample-efficient recommenders; and (2) LLMs, as feature generators and encoders, make CRMs more sample-efficient. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that Laser requires only a small fraction of training samples to match or even surpass CRMs that are trained on the entire training set, demonstrating superior sample efficiency.</description>

      <title>XRec: Large Language Models for Explainable Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems help users navigate information overload by providing personalized recommendations aligned with their preferences. Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a widely adopted approach, but while advanced techniques like graph neural networks (GNNs) and self-supervised learning (SSL) have enhanced CF models for better user representations, they often lack the ability to provide explanations for the recommended items. Explainable recommendations aim to address this gap by offering transparency and insights into the recommendation decision-making process, enhancing users' understanding. This work leverages the language capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to push the boundaries of explainable recommender systems. We introduce a model-agnostic framework called XRec, which enables LLMs to provide comprehensive explanations for user behaviors in recommender systems. By integrating collaborative signals and designing a lightweight collaborative adaptor, the framework empowers LLMs to understand complex patterns in user-item interactions and gain a deeper understanding of user preferences. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of XRec, showcasing its ability to generate comprehensive and meaningful explanations that outperform baseline approaches in explainable recommender systems. We open-source our model implementation at https://github.com/HKUDS/XRec.</description>

      <title>GRAM: Generative Retrieval Augmented Matching of Data Schemas in the Context of Data Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schema matching constitutes a pivotal phase in the data ingestion process for contemporary database systems. Its objective is to discern pairwise similarities between two sets of attributes, each associated with a distinct data table. This challenge emerges at the initial stages of data analytics, such as when incorporating a third-party table into existing databases to inform business insights. Given its significance in the realm of database systems, schema matching has been under investigation since the 2000s. This study revisits this foundational problem within the context of large language models. Adhering to increasingly stringent data security policies, our focus lies on the zero-shot and few-shot scenarios: the model should analyze only a minimal amount of customer data to execute the matching task, contrasting with the conventional approach of scrutinizing the entire data table. We emphasize that the zero-shot or few-shot assumption is imperative to safeguard the identity and privacy of customer data, even at the potential cost of accuracy. The capability to accurately match attributes under such stringent requirements distinguishes our work from previous literature in this domain.</description>

      <title>ProGEO: Generating Prompts through Image-Text Contrastive Learning for Visual Geo-localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual Geo-localization (VG) refers to the process to identify the location described in query images, which is widely applied in robotics field and computer vision tasks, such as autonomous driving, metaverse, augmented reality, and SLAM. In fine-grained images lacking specific text descriptions, directly applying pure visual methods to represent neighborhood features often leads to the model focusing on overly fine-grained features, unable to fully mine the semantic information in the images. Therefore, we propose a two-stage training method to enhance visual performance and use contrastive learning to mine challenging samples. We first leverage the multi-modal description capability of CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) to create a set of learnable text prompts for each geographic image feature to form vague descriptions. Then, by utilizing dynamic text prompts to assist the training of the image encoder, we enable the image encoder to learn better and more generalizable visual features. This strategy of applying text to purely visual tasks addresses the challenge of using multi-modal models for geographic images, which often suffer from a lack of precise descriptions, making them difficult to utilize widely. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy on several large-scale visual geo-localization datasets, and our method achieves competitive results on multiple visual geo-localization datasets. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/Chain-Mao/ProGEO.</description>

      <title>Description Boosting for Zero-Shot Entity and Relation Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot entity and relation classification models leverage available external information of unseen classes -- e.g., textual descriptions -- to annotate input text data. Thanks to the minimum data requirement, Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) methods have high value in practice, especially in applications where labeled data is scarce. Even though recent research in ZSL has demonstrated significant results, our analysis reveals that those methods are sensitive to provided textual descriptions of entities (or relations). Even a minor modification of descriptions can lead to a change in the decision boundary between entity (or relation) classes. In this paper, we formally define the problem of identifying effective descriptions for zero shot inference. We propose a strategy for generating variations of an initial description, a heuristic for ranking them and an ensemble method capable of boosting the predictions of zero-shot models through description enhancement. Empirical results on four different entity and relation classification datasets show that our proposed method outperform existing approaches and achieve new SOTA results on these datasets under the ZSL settings. The source code of the proposed solutions and the evaluation framework are open-sourced.</description>

      <title>Evaluating ChatGPT as a Recommender System: A Rigorous Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown impressive abilities in handling various natural language-related tasks. Among different LLMs, current studies have assessed ChatGPT's superior performance across manifold tasks, especially under the zero/few-shot prompting conditions. Given such successes, the Recommender Systems (RSs) research community have started investigating its potential applications within the recommendation scenario. However, although various methods have been proposed to integrate ChatGPT's capabilities into RSs, current research struggles to comprehensively evaluate such models while considering the peculiarities of generative models. Often, evaluations do not consider hallucinations, duplications, and out-of-the-closed domain recommendations and solely focus on accuracy metrics, neglecting the impact on beyond-accuracy facets. To bridge this gap, we propose a robust evaluation pipeline to assess ChatGPT's ability as an RS and post-process ChatGPT recommendations to account for these aspects. Through this pipeline, we investigate ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 performance in the recommendation task under the zero-shot condition employing the role-playing prompt. We analyze the model's functionality in three settings: the Top-N Recommendation, the cold-start recommendation, and the re-ranking of a list of recommendations, and in three domains: movies, music, and books. The experiments reveal that ChatGPT exhibits higher accuracy than the baselines on books domain. It also excels in re-ranking and cold-start scenarios while maintaining reasonable beyond-accuracy metrics. Furthermore, we measure the similarity between the ChatGPT recommendations and the other recommenders, providing insights about how ChatGPT could be categorized in the realm of recommender systems. The evaluation pipeline is publicly released for future research.</description>

      <title>Data-efficient Fine-tuning for LLM-based Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommendation has recently garnered considerable attention, where fine-tuning plays a key role in LLMs' adaptation. However, the cost of fine-tuning LLMs on rapidly expanding recommendation data limits their practical application. To address this challenge, few-shot fine-tuning offers a promising approach to quickly adapt LLMs to new recommendation data. We propose the task of data pruning for efficient LLM-based recommendation, aimed at identifying representative samples tailored for LLMs' few-shot fine-tuning. While coreset selection is closely related to the proposed task, existing coreset selection methods often rely on suboptimal heuristic metrics or entail costly optimization on large-scale recommendation data.
  To tackle these issues, we introduce two objectives for the data pruning task in the context of LLM-based recommendation: 1) high accuracy aims to identify the influential samples that can lead to high overall performance; and 2) high efficiency underlines the low costs of the data pruning process. To pursue the two objectives, we propose a novel data pruning method based on two scores, i.e., influence score and effort score, to efficiently identify the influential samples. Particularly, the influence score is introduced to accurately estimate the influence of sample removal on the overall performance. To achieve low costs of the data pruning process, we use a small-sized surrogate model to replace LLMs to obtain the influence score. Considering the potential gap between the surrogate model and LLMs, we further propose an effort score to prioritize some hard samples specifically for LLMs. Empirical results on three real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. In particular, the proposed method uses only 2% samples to surpass the full data fine-tuning, reducing time costs by 97%.</description>

      <title>Generating Query Recommendations via LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Query recommendation systems are ubiquitous in modern search engines, assisting users in producing effective queries to meet their information needs. However, these systems require a large amount of data to produce good recommendations, such as a large collection of documents to index and query logs. In particular, query logs and user data are not available in cold start scenarios. Query logs are expensive to collect and maintain and require complex and time-consuming cascading pipelines for creating, combining, and ranking recommendations. To address these issues, we frame the query recommendation problem as a generative task, proposing a novel approach called Generative Query Recommendation (GQR). GQR uses an LLM as its foundation and does not require to be trained or fine-tuned to tackle the query recommendation problem. We design a prompt that enables the LLM to understand the specific recommendation task, even using a single example. We then improved our system by proposing a version that exploits query logs called Retriever-Augmented GQR (RA-GQR). RA-GQr dynamically composes its prompt by retrieving similar queries from query logs. GQR approaches reuses a pre-existing neural architecture resulting in a simpler and more ready-to-market approach, even in a cold start scenario. Our proposed GQR obtains state-of-the-art performance in terms of NDCG@10 and clarity score against two commercial search engines and the previous state-of-the-art approach on the Robust04 and ClueWeb09B collections, improving on average the NDCG@10 performance up to ~4% on Robust04 and ClueWeb09B w.r.t the previous best competitor. RA-GQR further improve the NDCG@10 obtaining an increase of ~11%, ~6\% on Robust04 and ClueWeb09B w.r.t the best competitor. Furthermore, our system obtained ~59% of user preferences in a blind user study, proving that our method produces the most engaging queries.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Future of Federated Recommendation Systems with Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the integration of federated learning (FL) and recommendation systems (RS), known as Federated Recommendation Systems (FRS), has attracted attention for preserving user privacy by keeping private data on client devices. However, FRS faces inherent limitations such as data heterogeneity and scarcity, due to the privacy requirements of FL and the typical data sparsity issues of RSs. Models like ChatGPT are empowered by the concept of transfer learning and self-supervised learning, so they can be easily applied to the downstream tasks after fine-tuning or prompting. These models, so-called Foundation Models (FM), fouce on understanding the human's intent and perform following their designed roles in the specific tasks, which are widely recognized for producing high-quality content in the image and language domains. Thus, the achievements of FMs inspire the design of FRS and suggest a promising research direction: integrating foundation models to address the above limitations. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive review of FRSs with FMs. Specifically, we: 1) summarise the common approaches of current FRSs and FMs; 2) review the challenges posed by FRSs and FMs; 3) discuss potential future research directions; and 4) introduce some common benchmarks and evaluation metrics in the FRS field. We hope that this position paper provides the necessary background and guidance to explore this interesting and emerging topic.</description>

      <title>DisCo: Towards Harmonious Disentanglement and Collaboration between Tabular and Semantic Space for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender systems play important roles in various applications such as e-commerce, social media, etc. Conventional recommendation methods usually model the collaborative signals within the tabular representation space. Despite the personalization modeling and the efficiency, the latent semantic dependencies are omitted. Methods that introduce semantics into recommendation then emerge, injecting knowledge from the semantic representation space where the general language understanding are compressed. However, existing semantic-enhanced recommendation methods focus on aligning the two spaces, during which the representations of the two spaces tend to get close while the unique patterns are discarded and not well explored. In this paper, we propose DisCo to Disentangle the unique patterns from the two representation spaces and Collaborate the two spaces for recommendation enhancement, where both the specificity and the consistency of the two spaces are captured. Concretely, we propose 1) a dual-side attentive network to capture the intra-domain patterns and the inter-domain patterns, 2) a sufficiency constraint to preserve the task-relevant information of each representation space and filter out the noise, and 3) a disentanglement constraint to avoid the model from discarding the unique information. These modules strike a balance between disentanglement and collaboration of the two representation spaces to produce informative pattern vectors, which could serve as extra features and be appended to arbitrary recommendation backbones for enhancement. Experiment results validate the superiority of our method against different models and the compatibility of DisCo over different backbones. Various ablation studies and efficiency analysis are also conducted to justify each model component.</description>

      <title>FourierKAN-GCF: Fourier Kolmogorov-Arnold Network -- An Effective and Efficient Feature Transformation for Graph Collaborative Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Collaborative Filtering (GCF) has achieved state-of-the-art performance for recommendation tasks. However, most GCF structures simplify the feature transformation and nonlinear operation during message passing in the graph convolution network (GCN). We revisit these two components and discover that a part of feature transformation and nonlinear operation during message passing in GCN can improve the representation of GCF, but increase the difficulty of training.
  In this work, we propose a simple and effective graph-based recommendation model called FourierKAN-GCF. Specifically, it utilizes a novel Fourier Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to replace the multilayer perceptron (MLP) as a part of the feature transformation during message passing in GCN, which improves the representation power of GCF and is easy to train. We further employ message dropout and node dropout strategies to improve the representation power and robustness of the model. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of FourierKAN-GCF over most state-of-the-art methods. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/Jinfeng-Xu/FKAN-GCF.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative Retrieval (GR) is an emerging paradigm in information retrieval that leverages generative models to directly map queries to relevant document identifiers (DocIDs) without the need for traditional query processing or document reranking. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of GR, highlighting key developments, indexing and retrieval strategies, and challenges. We discuss various document identifier strategies, including numerical and string-based identifiers, and explore different document representation methods. Our primary contribution lies in outlining future research directions that could profoundly impact the field: improving the quality of query generation, exploring learnable document identifiers, enhancing scalability, and integrating GR with multi-task learning frameworks. By examining state-of-the-art GR techniques and their applications, this survey aims to provide a foundational understanding of GR and inspire further innovations in this transformative approach to information retrieval. We also make the complementary materials such as paper collection publicly available at https://github.com/MiuLab/GenIR-Survey/</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a prominent instance of vandalism edits, Wiki search poisoning for illicit promotion is a cybercrime in which the adversary aims at editing Wiki articles to promote illicit businesses through Wiki search results of relevant queries. In this paper, we report a study that, for the first time, shows that such stealthy blackhat SEO on Wiki can be automated. Our technique, called MAWSEO, employs adversarial revisions to achieve real-world cybercriminal objectives, including rank boosting, vandalism detection evasion, topic relevancy, semantic consistency, user awareness (but not alarming) of promotional content, etc. Our evaluation and user study demonstrate that MAWSEO is capable of effectively and efficiently generating adversarial vandalism edits, which can bypass state-of-the-art built-in Wiki vandalism detectors, and also get promotional content through to Wiki users without triggering their alarms. In addition, we investigated potential defense, including coherence based detection and adversarial training of vandalism detection, against our attack in the Wiki ecosystem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and investigate the problem of $\textit{c-approximate window search}$: approximate nearest neighbor search where each point in the dataset has a numeric label, and the goal is to find nearest neighbors to queries within arbitrary label ranges. Many semantic search problems, such as image and document search with timestamp filters, or product search with cost filters, are natural examples of this problem. We propose and theoretically analyze a modular tree-based framework for transforming an index that solves the traditional c-approximate nearest neighbor problem into a data structure that solves window search. On standard nearest neighbor benchmark datasets equipped with random label values, adversarially constructed embeddings, and image search embeddings with real timestamps, we obtain up to a $75\times$ speedup over existing solutions at the same level of recall.</description>

      <title>C-RAG: Certified Generation Risks for Retrieval-Augmented Language Models</title>

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) across diverse applications, they still suffer from trustworthiness issues, such as hallucinations and misalignments. Retrieval-augmented language models (RAG) have been proposed to enhance the credibility of generations by grounding external knowledge, but the theoretical understandings of their generation risks remains unexplored. In this paper, we answer: 1) whether RAG can indeed lead to low generation risks, 2) how to provide provable guarantees on the generation risks of RAG and vanilla LLMs, and 3) what sufficient conditions enable RAG models to reduce generation risks. We propose C-RAG, the first framework to certify generation risks for RAG models. Specifically, we provide conformal risk analysis for RAG models and certify an upper confidence bound of generation risks, which we refer to as conformal generation risk. We also provide theoretical guarantees on conformal generation risks for general bounded risk functions under test distribution shifts. We prove that RAG achieves a lower conformal generation risk than that of a single LLM when the quality of the retrieval model and transformer is non-trivial. Our intensive empirical results demonstrate the soundness and tightness of our conformal generation risk guarantees across four widely-used NLP datasets on four state-of-the-art retrieval models.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Conversational Dense Retrieval via LLM-Cognition Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conversational search utilizes muli-turn natural language contexts to retrieve relevant passages. Existing conversational dense retrieval models mostly view a conversation as a fixed sequence of questions and responses, overlooking the severe data sparsity problem -- that is, users can perform a conversation in various ways, and these alternate conversations are unrecorded. Consequently, they often struggle to generalize to diverse conversations in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a framework for generalizing Conversational dense retrieval via LLM-cognition data Augmentation (ConvAug). ConvAug first generates multi-level augmented conversations to capture the diverse nature of conversational contexts. Inspired by human cognition, we devise a cognition-aware process to mitigate the generation of false positives, false negatives, and hallucinations. Moreover, we develop a difficulty-adaptive sample filter that selects challenging samples for complex conversations, thereby giving the model a larger learning space. A contrastive learning objective is then employed to train a better conversational context encoder. Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets, under both normal and zero-shot settings, demonstrate the effectiveness, generalizability, and applicability of ConvAug. The code is released at https://github.com/haon-chen/ConvAug.</description>

      <title>ARL2: Aligning Retrievers for Black-box Large Language Models via Self-guided Adaptive Relevance Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating relevant information from external knowledge sources. This enables LLMs to adapt to specific domains and mitigate hallucinations in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing retrievers are often misaligned with LLMs due to their separate training processes and the black-box nature of LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose ARL2, a retriever learning technique that harnesses LLMs as labelers. ARL2 leverages LLMs to annotate and score relevant evidence, enabling learning the retriever from robust LLM supervision. Furthermore, ARL2 uses an adaptive self-training strategy for curating high-quality and diverse relevance data, which can effectively reduce the annotation cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ARL2, achieving accuracy improvements of 5.4% on NQ and 4.6% on MMLU compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, ARL2 exhibits robust transfer learning capabilities and strong zero-shot generalization abilities. Our code will be published at \url{https://github.com/zhanglingxi-cs/ARL2}.</description>

      <title>RAM-EHR: Retrieval Augmentation Meets Clinical Predictions on Electronic Health Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present RAM-EHR, a Retrieval AugMentation pipeline to improve clinical predictions on Electronic Health Records (EHRs). RAM-EHR first collects multiple knowledge sources, converts them into text format, and uses dense retrieval to obtain information related to medical concepts. This strategy addresses the difficulties associated with complex names for the concepts. RAM-EHR then augments the local EHR predictive model co-trained with consistency regularization to capture complementary information from patient visits and summarized knowledge. Experiments on two EHR datasets show the efficacy of RAM-EHR over previous knowledge-enhanced baselines (3.4% gain in AUROC and 7.2% gain in AUPR), emphasizing the effectiveness of the summarized knowledge from RAM-EHR for clinical prediction tasks. The code will be published at \url{https://github.com/ritaranx/RAM-EHR}.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Convolutional Forecasting Network Based on Time Series Feature-Driven</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series data in real-world scenarios contain a substantial amount of nonlinear information, which significantly interferes with the training process of models, leading to decreased prediction performance. Therefore, during the time series forecasting process, extracting the local and global time series patterns and understanding the potential nonlinear features among different time observations are highly significant. To address this challenge, we introduce multi-resolution convolution and deformable convolution operations. By enlarging the receptive field using convolution kernels with different dilation factors to capture temporal correlation information at different resolutions, and adaptively adjusting the sampling positions through additional offset vectors, we enhance the network's ability to capture potential nonlinear features among time observations. Building upon this, we propose ACNet, an adaptive convolutional network designed to effectively model the local and global temporal dependencies and the nonlinear features between observations in multivariate time series. Specifically, by extracting and fusing time series features at different resolutions, we capture both local contextual information and global patterns in the time series. The designed nonlinear feature adaptive extraction module captures the nonlinear features among different time observations in the time series. We evaluated the performance of ACNet across twelve real-world datasets. The results indicate that ACNet consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks with favorable runtime efficiency.</description>
