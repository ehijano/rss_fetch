      <title>Benchmarking vibrational spectra: 5000 accurate eigenstates of acetonitrile using tree tensor network states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate vibrational spectra are essential for understanding how molecules behave, yet their computation remains challenging and benchmark data to reliable compare different methods are sparse. Here, we present high-accuracy eigenstate computations for the six-atom, 12-dimensional acetonitrile molecule, a prototypical, strongly coupled, anharmonic system. Using a density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm with a tree-tensor-network-state (TTNS) ansatz, a refinement using TTNSs as basis set, and reliable procedures to estimate energy errors, we compute up to 5,000 vibrational states with error estimates below 0.0007 $\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Our analysis reveals that previous works underestimated the energy error by up to two orders of magnitude. Our data serve as a benchmark for future vibrational spectroscopy methods and our new method offers a path toward similarly precise computations of large, complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Defect chemistry of mixed ionic-electronic conductors under light: halide perovskites as master example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shining light on a mixed ionic-electronic conductor induces variations in both its electronic and ionic behaviors. While optoelectronic processes in semiconductors with negligible ionic conductivities are well understood, the role of mobile ions in photo-active mixed conductors, such as hybrid halide perovskites, is largely unexplored. Here, we propose a model addressing this problem, relating optoelectronics and optoionics. Using methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) as model material, we discuss the expected influence of optical bias on the material's charge carrier chemistry under steady-state conditions. We show that changes in the concentration of ionic defects under light with respect to the dark case are a direct consequence of their coupling to electrons and holes through the component chemical potential (here iodine) and the electroneutrality condition. Based on the trend in the quasi-Fermi level splitting in MAPI, we emphasize implications of controlling point defect chemistry for the function and performance optimization of solar energy conversion devices based on halide perovskites. Lastly, we show that in the presence of multiple redox reactions mediating the iodine quasi-equilibrium, either positive or negative changes in the ionic defect pair chemical potential can be obtained. These findings indicate the intriguing possibility to increase or to reduce ionic defect concentrations in mixed conductors through exposure to light.</description>

      <title>Core-Excited States of Linear and Bent Uranyl Complexes: Insights from High-Energy Resolution X-ray Spectroscopy and Relativistic Quantum Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced X-ray spectroscopic techniques are widely recognized as state-of-the-art tools for probing the electronic structure, bonding, and chemical environments of the heaviest elements in the periodic table. In this study, we employ X-ray absorption near-edge structure measurements in high-energy resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD-XANES) mode to investigate the core states arising from excitations out of the U 3d${_{3/2}}$ (M$_4$ edge) levels for molecular complexes in which the uranyl moiety deviates from linearity to varying degrees, and in particular systems containing the UO$_2$Cl$_2$ group such as UO$_2$Cl$_2$.n(H$_2$O) and UO$_2$Cl$_2$(phen)$_2$, which in the latter case exhibits a pronounced O-U-O bending angle. These U M$_4$ edge HERFD-XANES spectra are compared to those of other linear (Cs$_2$UO$_2$Cl$_4$) or pseudo-linear ([UO$_2$(NO$_3$)$_2$.n(H$_2$O)]) uranyl complexes. This evaluation is complemented by ab initio relativistic quantum chemistry simulations using 2-component Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) with the CAM-B3LYP functional, employing the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (2c-TDA). Our 2c-TDA simulations show modest deviations from the HERFD-XANES data, with peak splittings differing by less than 1 eV from experimental values. These core-excited states were further characterized by Natural Transition Orbital (NTO) analysis. Overall, our results highlight the influence of equatorial ligands on the spectroscopic signatures, particularly pronounced in UO$_2$Cl$_2$(phen)$_2$, where the U 3d${_{3/2}} \rightarrow$ $5f$ $\sigma{_u}^{*}$ satellite transition appears at lower energies compared to the other systems studied.</description>

      <title>Thawed Gaussian Ehrenfest dynamics at conical intersections: When can a single mean-field trajectory capture internal conversion?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thawed Gaussian Ehrenfest dynamics is a single-trajectory method that partially includes both nuclear quantum and electronically nonadiabatic effects by combining the thawed Gaussian wavepacket dynamics with Ehrenfest dynamics. First, we demonstrate the improvement over the parent methods in a multidimensional system consisting of vertically displaced harmonic potentials with constant diabatic couplings, for which the thawed Gaussian Ehrenfest dynamics is exact. Then, we show that single-trajectory mean-field methods completely fail to capture electronic population transfer in the vicinity of conical intersections between potential energy surfaces associated with electronic states of different symmetry (i.e., belonging to different irreducible representations of the molecular point group). The underlying cause of this limitation suggests that the thawed Gaussian Ehrenfest dynamics can be useful for studying nonadiabatic dynamics close to conical intersections of electronic states of the same symmetry, which have been understudied owing to the difficulty in locating them. Using a model of this type of intersection, we compare the thawed Gaussian Ehrenfest dynamics with exact quantum dynamics and find that the approximate mean-field approach yields a molecular wavefunction that remains qualitatively similar to the exact one even after crossing and recrossing the conical intersection.</description>

      <title>Have you tried turning it off and on again? Stochastic resetting for enhanced sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are widely used across chemistry, physics, and biology, providing quantitative insight into complex processes with atomic detail. However, their limited timescale of a few microseconds is a significant obstacle in describing phenomena such as conformational transitions of biomolecules and polymorphism in molecular crystals. Recently, stochastic resetting, i.e., randomly stopping and restarting the simulations, emerged as a powerful enhanced sampling approach, which is collective variable-free, highly parallelized, and easily implemented in existing molecular dynamics codes. Resetting expedites sampling rare events while enabling the inference of kinetic observables of the underlying process. It can be employed as a standalone tool or in combination with other enhanced sampling methods, such as Metadynamics, with each technique compensating for the drawbacks of the other. Here, we comprehensively describe resetting and its theoretical background, review recent developments in stochastic resetting for enhanced sampling, and provide instructive guidelines for practitioners.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An optimization method for the expectation value of a self-adjoint operator under a finite number of expectation-value constraints based on imaginary-time evolution is introduced. It is formulated for finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and uses linearly independent and commuting self-adjoint operators for the constraints. The method is applied to the problem of finding the universal functional of density-functional theory and allows theoretical insights into the density-potential mapping.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Molecular Dynamics and TEM Analysis of Platinum Crystal Growth on Graphene and Reactive Hydrogen-Sensing Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pt-functionalized graphene harnesses graphene's exceptional carrier mobility with Pt's catalytic activity for hydrogen sensing, yet the mechanisms of Pt crystal growth, its interaction with graphene, and the consequent impact on hydrogen sensitivity remain incompletely understood. We develop a high-fidelity equivariant machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP) to perform large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with near-density functional theory (DFT) accuracy. Our simulations capture key growth stages-including Pt nucleation, coalescence, and the formation of either polycrystalline clusters or epitaxial thin films-under varying deposition loadings and rates. Transmission electron microscopy and Raman measurements validate the predicted morphologies, revealing small approximately spherical clusters at lower Pt loadings that evolve into slightly thicker, more planar domains with increased loading. Reactive MD shows hydrogen dissociates predominantly on Pt nanostructures at room temperature, with minimal spillover onto pristine graphene. Furthermore, hydrogen uptake increases with Pt loading at a diminishing rate, while reaction kinetics are significantly faster at lower coverages and rapidly decline with increasing loading. DFT calculations indicate undercoordinated Pt clusters induce $n$-type doping in graphene, which is diminished when hydrogen adsorption depletes Pt electron density, thereby transducing the adsorption events from Pt-surfaces to the Pt-graphene interface. By correlating deposition conditions, nanostructure morphology, and hydrogen sensing dynamics, our findings suggest that moderate Pt loadings can effectively balance sufficient doping with a pronounced Pt-mediated electronic response to graphene. These insights underscore the importance of combining DFT and MLIP simulations with experiments to guide next-generation chemiresistive gas sensor design.</description>

      <title>Infinite Boundary Terms and Pairwise Interactions: A Unified Framework for Periodic Coulomb Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of the infinite boundary terms and the pairwise interactions [J. Chem. Theory Comput., 10, 5254, (2014)] enables a physically intuitive approach for deriving electrostatic energy and pressure for both neutral and non-neutral systems under the periodic boundary condition. For a periodic system consisting of $N$ point charges (with charge $q_j$ located at ${\mathbf r}_j$ where $j=1,2,\cdots N$) and one charge distribution of density $\rho({\mathbf r})$ within a primary cell of volume $V$, the derived electrostatic energy can be expressed as, \[ {\mathcal U} = \sum_{i&lt;j}^N q_iq_j\nu({\mathbf r}_{ij} ) + \sum_{j=1}^N q_j \int_V d{\mathbf r}_0\,\rho({\mathbf r}_0) \nu({\mathbf r}_{0j} ) + \frac{1}{2}\int_V d{\mathbf r}_0 \int_V d{\mathbf r}_1\,\rho({\mathbf r}_0)\rho({\mathbf r}_1) \nu({\mathbf r}_{01}), \] where ${\mathbf r}_{ij}={\mathbf r}_i - {\mathbf r}_j$ is the relative vector and $\nu({\mathbf r})$ represents the effective pairwise interaction. The charge density $\rho({\mathbf r})$ is free of Delta-function-like divergence throughout the volume but may exhibit discontinuity. This unified formulation directly follows that of the isolated system by replacing the Coulomb interaction $1/\lvert {\mathbf r} \rvert$ or other modified Coulomb interactions with $\nu({\mathbf r})$. For a particular system of one-component plasma with a uniform neutralizing background, the implementation of various pairwise formulations clarifies the contribution of the background and subsequently reveals criteria for arbitrary volume-dependent potentials that preserve the simple relation between energy and pressure.</description>

      <title>Accurate Ab-initio Neural-network Solutions to Large-Scale Electronic Structure Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present finite-range embeddings (FiRE), a novel wave function ansatz for accurate large-scale ab-initio electronic structure calculations. Compared to contemporary neural-network wave functions, FiRE reduces the asymptotic complexity of neural-network variational Monte Carlo (NN-VMC) by $\sim n_\text{el}$, the number of electrons. By restricting electron-electron interactions within the neural network, FiRE accelerates all key operations -- sampling, pseudopotentials, and Laplacian computations -- resulting in a real-world $10\times$ acceleration in now-feasible 180-electron calculations. We validate our method's accuracy on various challenging systems, including biochemical compounds, conjugated hydrocarbons, and organometallic compounds. On these systems, FiRE's energies are consistently within chemical accuracy of the most reliable data, including experiments, even in cases where high-accuracy methods such as CCSD(T), AFQMC, or contemporary NN-VMC fall short. With these improvements in both runtime and accuracy, FiRE represents a new `gold-standard' method for fast and accurate large-scale ab-initio calculations, potentially enabling new computational studies in fields like quantum chemistry, solid-state physics, and material design.</description>

      <title>Hydroxide Mobility in Aqueous Systems: Ab Initio Accuracy with Millisecond Timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multiscale simulation approach for hydroxide transport in aqueous solutions of potassium hydroxide, combining ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations with force field ensemble averaging and lattice Monte Carlo techniques. This method achieves near ab initio accuracy by capturing the femtosecond scale dielectric relaxation dynamics of the aqueous hydrogen bonding network, while extending the simulation capability to millisecond diffusion timescales. This extraordinary extension of the available length and time scales enables future studies of hydroxide mobility in functional materials such as nanostructured anion-exchange membranes, where hydroxide ions migrate through nanometer-sized channels. Remarkably, our approach demonstrates that a single AIMD trajectory is sufficient to predict hydroxide conductivity over a range of concentrations, underscoring its computational efficiency and relevance to the design of advanced energy materials.</description>

      <title>Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) motivated mixed basis sets for small molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08493v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success behind many pseudopotential methods, such as the Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) and the Phillips-Kleinman pseudopotential methods, is that these methods are nearly all electron methods in disguise. For the Phillips-Kleinman and PAW pseudopotential methods we show that there is an explicit all electron reformulation (which is nearly equivalent). In the all electron reformulation, as part of the basis set, there are regular low wavevector basis wave functions (plane waves) and several, specially chosen, high wavevector basis wave functions that are specialized to the atomic environment relevant to nuclei of the substances studied. Using this as motivation, here we propose a new, PAW method motivated, basis set for small molecules, where we use the LO or lo (Localized Orbitals) basis wave functions, and pair them with a Gaussian basis, e.g. Gaussian Type Orbitals (GTO), for a hybrid basis for small molecules. Contracted Gaussian functions are also possible (CGFs). Several different, but related, LO (lo) basis wave functions are considered. We also show how to extend this idea to Slater basis set, Slater type orbitals (STO), instead of GTO orbitals, combined with LO or lo orbitals. This is done using shape functions.</description>

      <title>Classifying fermionic states via many-body correlation measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the structure of quantum correlations in a many-body system is key to its computational treatment. For fermionic systems, correlations can be defined as deviations from Slater determinant states. The link between fermionic correlations and efficient computational physics methods is actively studied but remains ambiguous. We make progress in establishing this connection mathematically. In particular, we find a rigorous classification of states relative to $k$-fermion correlations, which admits a computational physics interpretation. Correlations are captured by a measure $\omega_k$, a function of $k$-fermion reduced density matrix that we call twisted purity. A condition $\omega_k=0$ for a given $k$ puts the state in a class $G_k$ of correlated states. Sets $G_k$ are nested in $k$, and Slater determinants correspond to $k = 1$. Classes $G_{k=O(1)}$ are shown to be physically relevant, as $\omega_k$ vanishes or nearly vanishes for truncated configuration-interaction states, perturbation series around Slater determinants, and some nonperturbative eigenstates of the 1D Hubbard model. For each $k = O(1)$, we give an explicit ansatz with a polynomial number of parameters that covers all states in $G_k$. Potential applications of this ansatz and its connections to the coupled-cluster wavefunction are discussed.</description>

      <title>Spectral signatures of the Markovian to Non-Markovian transition in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach for investigating the Markovian to non-Markovian transition in quantum aggregates strongly coupled to a vibrational bath through the analysis of linear absorption spectra. Utilizing hierarchical algebraic equations in the frequency domain, we elucidate how these spectra can effectively reveal transitions between Markovian and non-Markovian regimes, driven by the complex interplay of dissipation, aggregate-bath coupling, and intra-aggregate dipole-dipole interactions. Our results demonstrate that reduced dissipation induces spectral peak splitting, signaling the emergence of bath-induced non-Markovian effects. The spectral peak splitting can also be driven by enhanced dipole-dipole interactions, although the underlying mechanism differs from that of dissipation-induced splitting. Additionally, with an increase in aggregate-bath coupling strength, initially symmetric or asymmetric peaks with varying spectral amplitudes may merge under weak dipole-dipole interactions, whereas strong dipole-dipole interactions are more likely to cause peak splitting. Moreover, we find that spectral features serve as highly sensitive indicators for distinguishing the geometric structures of aggregates, while also unveiling the critical role geometry plays in shaping non-Markovian behavior. This study not only deepens our understanding of the Markovian to non-Markovian transition but also provides a robust framework for optimizing and controlling quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: We find a design principle for tailoring thermal expansion properties in molecular networks. Using 2D fullerene networks as a representative system, we realize positive thermal expansion along intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition bonds and negative thermal expansion along intermolecular C$-$C single bonds by varying the structural frameworks of molecules. The microscopic mechanism originates from a combination of the framework's geometric flexibility and its transverse vibrational characteristics. Based on this insight, we find molecular networks beyond C$_{60}$ with tunable thermal expansion. These findings shed light on the fundamental mechanisms governing thermal expansion in molecular networks towards rational materials design.</description>
