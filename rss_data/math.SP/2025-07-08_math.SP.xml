      <title>On a magneto-spectral invariant on finite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a magneto-spectral invariant for finite graphs. This invariant vanishes on trees and is maximized by complete graphs. We compute this invariant for cycles, complete graphs, wheel graphs and suspensions of trees and derive various lower and upper bounds. We discuss the behaviour of this invariant under various graph operations and investigate relations to the spectral gap.</description>

      <title>P\'olya's conjecture up to $\epsilon$-loss and quantitative estimates for the remainder of Weyl's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be a bounded Lipschitz domain. For any $\epsilon\in (0,1)$ we show that for any Dirichlet eigenvalue $\lambda_k(\Omega)&gt;\Lambda(\epsilon,\Omega)$, it holds \begin{align*} k&amp;\le (1+\epsilon)\frac{|\Omega|\omega(n)}{(2\pi)^n}\lambda_k(\Omega)^{n/2}, \end{align*} where $\Lambda(\epsilon,\Omega)$ is given explicitly. This reduces the $\epsilon$-loss version of P\'olya's conjecture to a computational problem. This estimate is based on a uniform estimate on the remainder of the Weyl law on Lipschitz domains, which appears to be the first quantitative estimate for the remainder of Weyl's law since Weyl's seminal work in the year 1911. We also provide in all dimensions $n\ge 2$, a class of domains that may even have rather irregular shapes or boundaries but satisfy P\'olya's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions of $k$-leaf-connected graphs and spanning trees with bounded total $k$-excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chv\'{a}tal and Erd\"{o}s [Discrete Math. 2 (1972) 111-113] stated that, for an $m$-connected graph $G$, if its independence number $\alpha(G)\leq m-1$, then $G$ is Hamilton-connected. Note that $k$-leaf-connectedness is a natural generalization of Hamilton-connectedness of a graph. Ozeki and Yamashita [Graphs Combin. 27 (2011) 1-26] posed an open problem: What is the sufficient condition based on the independence number for an $m$-connected graph to be $k$-leaf-connected? In this paper, we prove that if $\alpha(G)\leq m-k+1,$ then an $m$-connected graph $G$ is $k$-leaf-connected. This not only answers the open problem of Ozeki and Yamashita, but also extends Chv\'{a}tal-Erd\"{o}s Theorem. As applications, we present sufficient spectral conditions for an $m$-connected graph to be $k$-leaf-connected.
  Let $k\geq 2$ be an integer and $T$ be a spanning tree of a connected graph. The total $k$-excess $te(T,k)$ is the summation of the $k$-excesses of all vertices in $T$, namely, $te(T,k)=\sum_{v\in V(T)}\mbox{max}\{0, d_{T}(v)-k\}.$ One can see that $T$ is a spanning $k$-tree if and only if $te(T,k)=0$. Fan, Goryainov, Huang and Lin [Linear Multilinear Algebra 70 (2022) 7264-7275] presented sufficient spectral conditions for a connected graph to contain a spanning $k$-tree. We in this paper propose sufficient conditions in terms of the spectral radius for a connected graph to contain a spanning tree with $te(T,k)\leq b$, where $b\geq0$ is an integer.</description>

      <title>On the nodal domain count under metric perturbations, Courant sharpness and boundary intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we investigate the effects of metric perturbations of closed surfaces on the number of nodal domains. In particular, we show that the nodal domain count for Laplace eigenfunctions is (locally) maximised for non-generic metrics. We also investigate localised perturbations and showcase some interesting applications regarding Courant sharp metrics on closed surfaces and associated boundary nodal-data prescription problems.</description>

      <title>New matrices for the spectral theory of mixed graphs, Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of the integrated adjacency matrix for mixed graphs was first introduced in [9], where its spectral properties were analyzed in relation to the structural characteristics of the mixed graph. Building upon this foundation, this paper introduces the integrated Laplacian matrix, the integrated signless Laplacian matrix, and the normalized integrated Laplacian matrix for mixed graphs. We further explore how the spectra of these matrices relate to the structural properties of the mixed graph.</description>

      <title>Unconditional wave decay in dimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Burq's logarithmic decay rate [Bur98] to general compactly supported scatterers in dimension two. The main novelty is using recent results on low-frequency expansions to remove the requirement that the spectrum be regular at zero. This allows us to include, among other examples, arbitrary smooth obstacles with variable boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Steklov vs. Steklov: A Fourth-Order Affair Related to the Babu\v{s}ka Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss two fourth-order Steklov problems and highlight a Babu\v{s}ka paradox appearing in their approximations on convex domains via sequences of convex polygons. To do so, we prove that the eigenvalues of one of the two problems depend with continuity upon domain perturbation in the class of convex domains, extending a result known in the literature for the first eigenvalue. This is obtained by examining in detail a nonlocal, second-order problem for harmonic functions introduced by Ferrero, Gazzola, and Weth. We further review how this result is connected to diverse variants of the classical Babu\v{s}ka paradox for the hinged plate and to a degeneration result by Maz'ya and Nazarov.</description>

      <title>Ballistic Transport for Discrete Multi-Dimensional Schr\"odinger Operators With Decaying Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the discrete Schr\"odinger operator $H = -\Delta + V$ on $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z}^d)$ with a decaying potential, in arbitrary lattice dimension $d\in\mathbb{N}^*$, where $\Delta$ is the standard discrete Laplacian and $V_n = o(|n|^{-1})$ as $|n| \to \infty$. We prove that the unitary evolution $e^{-i tH}$ exhibits ballistic transport in the sense that, for any $r &gt; 0$, the weighted $\ell^2-$norm $$\|e^{-i tH}u\|_r:=\left(\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}^d} (1+|n|^2)^{r} |(e^{-i tH}u)_n|^2\right)^\frac12 $$ grows at rate $\simeq t^r$ as $t\to \infty$, provided that the initial state $u$ is in the absolutely continuous subspace and satisfies $\|u\|_r&lt;\infty$.
  The proof relies on commutator methods and a refined Mourre estimate, which yields quantitative lower bounds on transport for operators with purely absolutely continuous spectrum over appropriate spectral intervals. Compactness arguments and localized spectral projections are used to extend the result to perturbed operators, extending the classical result for the free Laplacian to a broader class of decaying potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce three biharmonic Steklov problems on differential forms with Neumann boundary conditions and show that they are elliptic. We prove the existence of a discrete spectrum for each of those problems and give associated variational characterizations for their eigenvalues. We establish eigenvalue estimates known as Kuttler-Sigillito inequalities, relating the eigenvalues of these problems with the eigenvalues of the Steklov, Dirichlet and Neumann standard problems as well as the biharmonic Steklov problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions on differential forms.</description>

      <title>Schr{\"o}dinger eigenfunctions sharing the same modulus and applications to the control of quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate when linearly independent eigenfunctions of the Schr\''odinger operator may have the same modulus. General properties are established and the one-dimensional case is treated in full generality. The study is motivated by its application to the bilinear control of the Schr{\"o}dinger equation. By assuming that the potentials of interaction satisfy a saturation property and by adapting a strategy recently proposed by Duca and Nersesyan, we discuss when the system can be steered arbitrarily fast between energy levels. Extensions of the previous results to quantum graphs are finally presented.</description>

      <title>Ricci curvature, diameter and eigenvalues of amply regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21055v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Amply regular graphs are graphs with local distance-regularity constraints. In this paper, we prove a weaker version of a conjecture proposed by Qiao, Park, and Koolen on diameter bounds of amply regular graphs and make new progress on Terwilliger's conjecture on finiteness of amply regular graphs. Terwilliger's conjecture can be considered as a natural extension of the Bannai-Ito conjecture about distance-regular graphs confirmed by Bang, Dubickas, Koolen, and Moulton. As a consequence, we show that there are only finitely many amply regular graphs with parameters $(n,d,\alpha,\beta)$ satisfying $\alpha\leq 6\beta-9$. We achieve these results by a significantly improved Lin--Lu--Yau curvature estimate and new Bakry--\'Emery curvature estimates. We further discuss applications of our curvature estimates to bounding eigenvalues, isoperimetric constants, and expansion properties. In addition, we obtain a volume estimate, which is sharp for hypercubes.</description>

      <title>Consistency of augmentation graph and network approximability in contrastive learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning leverages data augmentation to develop feature representation without relying on large labeled datasets. However, despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of contrastive learning remain incomplete, with many essential guarantees left unaddressed, particularly the realizability assumption concerning neural approximability of an optimal spectral contrastive loss solution. In this work, we overcome these limitations by analyzing pointwise and spectral consistency of the augmentation graph Laplacian. We establish that, under specific conditions for data generation and graph connectivity, as the augmented dataset size increases, the augmentation graph Laplacian converges to a weighted Laplace-Beltrami operator on the natural data manifold. These consistency results ensure that the graph Laplacian spectrum effectively captures the manifold geometry. Consequently, they give way to a robust framework for establishing neural approximability, directly resolving the realizability assumption in a current paradigm.</description>
