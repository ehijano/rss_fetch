      <title>Temperley-Lieb categories with coloured regions and Jones-Wenzl projectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalised Temperley-Lieb categories with regions labelled by elements of a commutative algebra were introduced by M. Khovanov and the second author in [Pure Appl. Math. Q. 19 (2023), no. 5]. We consider the case where the regions are labelled by colours, corresponding to a complete set of orthogonal idempotents of a semisimple commutative algebra. We determine when these generalised Temperley-Lieb categories are semisimple and find the direct sum decompositions of tensor products of simple objects. As the main tool we introduce two-variable versions of Chebychev polynomials and construct analogues of Jones-Wenzl projectors. As a consequence, we prove a conjecture of M. Khovanov and the second author on Gram determinants and non-degeneracy of trace pairings for the associated Temperley-Lieb algebras with coloured regions.</description>

      <title>Analytical Traces on Coulomb Branches of Quiver Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an explicit construction of twisted traces for quantum Coulomb branches of conical theories. We develop an operator representation of the Coulomb branch algebra and use it to derive integral formulas for the twisted trace. Our construction provides a concrete realization of twisted traces that arise as the correlation functions of a conformal field theory, particularly in the work of Beem, Peelaers, and Rastelli. This complements recent developments in the study of twisted traces on quantum Higgs branches and offers new mathematical insights into the structure of quantum Coulomb branches.</description>

      <title>A Drinfeld type presentation of twisted Yangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a Gauss decomposition approach to establish a Drinfeld type current presentation for Olshanski's twisted Yangians associated to the orthogonal Lie algebras (also called twisted Yangians of type AI), settling a longstanding open problem. We expect that this will open the door for finding current presentations for other twisted Yangians.</description>

      <title>In Search of a Hidden Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been noticed since around 2007 that certain enumeration problems can be solved when an analytic or algebraic curve is identified. This curve is the key to the problem. In these lectures, a few such examples are presented. One is a detailed account on counting simple Hurwitz numbers, explaining how the problem was solved by discovering this key curve. The formula for the curve allows us to write the generating functions of Hurwitz numbers in terms of polynomials. This unexpected polynomiality produces, as a byproduct, straightforward and short proofs of the Witten-Kontsevich theorem and the $\lambda_g$-theorem of Faber-Pandharipande. An analogous enumeration problem associated with Catalan numbers is also presented, which has a simpler feature in terms of analysis. The asymptotic behavior of counting leads this time to the Euler characteristic of the moduli spaces of smooth curves. We then discuss another enumeration problem, the Ap\'ery sequences. The quest of identifying the hidden curve for this case remains open.
  These curves, also known as spectral curves, are discovered via solving ordinary differential equations. The counting problem of geometric origin associated with the genus 0, one marked point case is encoded in the spectral curve. It is explained that going from the $(g,n)=(0,1)$-case to arbitrary $(g,n)$ is a process of quantization of the spectral curve.
  This perspective of quantization is discussed in a geometric setting, when the differential equations are linear with holomorphic coefficients, in terms of Higgs bundles, opers, and Gaiotto's conformal limit construction. In this context, however, there are no counting problems behind the scene.</description>
