      <title>Spatially-bounded rogue waves in the Davey-Stewartson I equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatially-bounded rogue waves, i.e., rogue waves that arise in a limited region of a multi-dimensional space, are interesting and important from both theoretical and applied points of view. In this paper, we determine spatially-bounded rogue waves in the Davey-Stewartson I equation. We show that these rogue waves can be obtained when a single or multiple internal parameters in the higher-order rational solution of the Davey-Stewartson I equation are real and large, and the order-index vector of this higher-order rational solution has even length and comprises pairs of the form (2n, 2n+1), where n is a positive integer. Under these conditions and another nondegeneracy condition on the root curve of a certain double-real-variable polynomial, the higher-order rational solution will exhibit spatially-bounded rogue waves that arise from a uniform background with some time-varying lumps on it, reach high amplitude in limited space, and then disappear into the same background again. The crests of these rogue waves form a single or multiple closed curves that are generically disconnected from each other on the spatial plane, and are analytically predicted by the root curve mentioned above. We also derive uniformly-valid asymptotic approximations for these spatially-bounded rogue waves in the large-parameter regime. Near the crests of these rogue waves, these asymptotic approximations reduce to simple expressions. Our asymptotic approximations of these rogue waves are compared to true solutions and good agreement is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Fully localised three-dimensional solitary water waves on Beltrami flows with strong surface tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fully localised three-dimensional solitary waves are steady water waves which are evanescent in every horizontal direction. This paper presents an existence theory for such waves under the assumptions that the relative vorticity and velocity fields are parallel (`Beltrami flows'), that the free surface of the water takes the form $\{z=\eta(x,y)\}$ for some function $\eta: {\mathbb R}^2\rightarrow{\mathbb R}$, and that the influence of surface tension is sufficiently strong. The governing equations are formulated as a single equation for $\eta$, which is then reduced to a perturbation of the KP-I equation. This equation has recently been shown to have a family of nondegenerate localised solutions, and an application of a suitable variant of the implicit-function theorem shows that they persist under perturbations.</description>
