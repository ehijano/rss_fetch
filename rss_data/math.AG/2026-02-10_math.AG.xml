      <title>H-Instanton Bundles on Three-Dimensional Smooth Toric Varieties with Picard Number Two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $H$-instanton bundles on the infinite family of smooth three-dimensional varieties $X_e=\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^2} \oplus \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^2}(e))$, for $e \geq 0$. We provide two distinct monadic descriptions of $H$-instanton bundles on $X_e$, generalizing the classical monads on $\mathbb P^3$. We then characterize $H$-instanton bundles with second Chern class supported in a single degree, and investigate their existence and moduli spaces. Finally, for $e\leq 3$, we prove the existence of $H$-instanton bundles for all admissible second Chern classes. These results extend previous constructions on specific cases and contribute to the study of instanton bundles on threefolds with higher Picard number.</description>

      <title>The Prym-canonical Clifford index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two new invariants of Prym curves, the Prym-canonical Clifford index and the Prym-canonical Clifford dimension. The former is a nonnegative integer (according to Prym-Clifford's theorem), while the latter is a pair of nonnegative ordered integers. We classify Prym curves with Prym-canonical Clifford index equal to 0,1,2. By specialization to hyperelliptic curves, we compute the Prym-canonical Clifford index of a general Prym curve and show that its Prym-canonical Clifford dimension is (0,0).</description>

      <title>Failure of the invariant cycle theorem over $\mathbb Z$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a counterexample to both the local and global invariant cycle theorems with integral coefficients. The example is a semistable one-parameter family of elliptic surfaces with $p_g=q=1$ and constant period map. The smooth fibers have the smallest possible discriminant, and are associated with Vinberg's most algebraic K3 surface. Our construction generalizes the Shioda-Inose construction for rational double covers of K3 surfaces.</description>

      <title>Flips for spaces of quadrics on del Pezzo varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a cubic hypersurface $X$, work of Galkin--Shinder and Voisin shows the existence of a birational map relating the Hilbert scheme of two points $X^{[2]}$ with a certain projective bundle over $X$. Belmans--Fu--Raedschelders show that this is a standard flip, a particularly nice type of birational map inducing decompositions of derived categories. We show that this geometric construction extends to produce standard flips for Hilbert schemes of quadrics on various higher-dimensional del Pezzo varieties of degree at least 3, including cubics, intersections of two quadrics, and linear sections of $\mathrm{Gr}(2, 5)$. The resulting construction also generalizes results of Chung--Hong--Lee for quintic del Pezzo varieties. As an application, we produce a conjectural semiorthogonal decompositions for orthogonal Grassmannians of lines.</description>

      <title>Fundamental groups of compact Kahler varieties with nef anti canonical bundle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is proved by M. Paun (1997, 2017) that the fundamental group of a compact Kahler manifold X is almost Abelian if the anti-canonical bundle -KX is nef. In this paper, we apply the recent geometric analytic theory of Kahler spaces developed by Guo-Phong-Song-Sturm to study fundamental groups of mildly singular compact Kahler varieties. We first extend Paun's result to log canonical pairs (X,Delta) with smooth X and nef -(KX+Delta) as well as to compact Kahler manifolds X with pseudo-effective -KX under a suitable assumption on the singularities of c1(-KX). We further prove that, for a 3-dimensional log canonical pair (X,\Delta) with X being klt, pi 1(X) is almost Abelian if -(KX+\Delta) is nef. Moreover, as one of the main ingredients for the proof of these results, we establish the surjectivity of the Albanese maps of compact normal complex varieties X in Fujiki class C that admits an effective R-divisor \Delta such that the pair (X,\Delta) is log canonical with nef anti-log canonical divisor -(KX+\Delta).This generalizes the corresponding theorems for projective varieties (Zhang, 2005), for klt pairs (Matsumura-Wang-Wu-Zhang, 2025) and for log smooth case (Fu-Han-Zou, 2025)</description>

      <title>Global smoothing of singular Fano and Calabi-Yau varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of smoothing Fano and Calabi-Yau varieties with isolated rational lci singularities. For Fano varieties we show that any such $Y$ admits a deformation to a Fano variety with only $1$-rational singularities, and if all the singularities of $Y$ are not $1$-rational, then $Y$ is smoothable. For Calabi-Yau varieties, we show first that any such $Y$ deforms to a Calabi-Yau variety with only $1$-Du Bois singularities. Moreover, if all the singularities of $Y$ are not $1$-Du Bois then $Y$ is smoothable. When allowing $1$-liminal singularities, we give a global criterion in terms of the Hodge-Du Bois numbers of $Y$ which ensures $Y$ is smoothable. These theorems recover and generalize results for threefolds of Friedman, Namikawa, Namikawa-Steenbrink, Gross, and Friedman-Laza. In higher dimensions, our results provide alternative smoothing conditions and also extend the work of Friedman-Laza from the case of hypersurface singularities to lci singularities.</description>

      <title>Motivic invariants of moduli stacks of Higgs bundles and bundles with connections: results and speculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review some results and techniques from our papers devoted to the computation of motivic classes of stacks of parabolic Higgs budles and bundles with connections on a curve. In the last section we present some directions for future work, as well as some speculations. The latter include a generalization of the P=W conjecture inspired by the work of Maxim Kontsevich and the third author on the Riemann--Hilbert correspondence for complex symplectic manifolds as well as our running project on the motivic classes of the moduli stacks of nilpotent pairs on the formal disk and geometric Satake correspondence for double affine Grassmannians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a structure theorem for the connected automorphism groups of smooth complete toroidal horospherical varieties, that is, toric fibrations over rational homogeneous spaces. A key ingredient is an extension of the notion of Demazure roots from toric varieties to toroidal horospherical varieties. In particular, we provide a criterion for the reductivity of the connected automorphism groups of such varieties. As an application, we prove the K-unstability of certain $\mathbb{P}^1$-bundles over rational homogeneous spaces.</description>

      <title>Vafa-Witten invariants from wall-crossing for framed sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the refined $\mathrm{SU}(r)$ Vafa-Witten partition function of a smooth projective surface with non-zero holomorphic 2-form. This partition function has a vertical contribution, expressible in terms of nested Hilbert schemes.
  First, we write the vertical contribution in terms of $\chi_y$-genera of moduli spaces of framed sheaves on ${\mathbb P}^2$.
  Then, we state two wall-crossing identities for moduli spaces of framed sheaves: a blow-up formula due to Kuhn-Leigh-Tanaka and a new stable/co-stable wall-crossing formula. We prove the latter using the theory of mixed Hodge modules.
  We apply these identities to obtain constraints on Vafa-Witten invariants predicted by conjectures of G\"ottsche and the second- and third-named authors. For $r=2$, we obtain a proof of the vertical part of a celebrated formula by Vafa-Witten.</description>

      <title>Counter-examples to a conjecture of Karpenko via truncated Brown-Peterson cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a split semisimple linear algebraic group and let $X$ denote the generically twisted variety of Borel subgroups in $G$. Nikita Karpenko conjectured that the map from the Chow ring of $X$ to the associated graded ring of the topological filtration on the Grothendieck ring of $X$ is an isomorphism. After having been verified for many $G$, the conjecture was disproved by Nobuaki Yagita for some spinor groups. Later, other counter-examples were constructed by Baek-Karpenko and Baek-Devyatov. We present a new method for constructing counter-examples that is based on the connection of the truncated Brown-Peterson cohomology with the connective K-theory. Using this method, we disprove the conjecture for new groups, including $\mathrm{Spin}_{15}$, which is now the smallest known spinor group for which the conjecture fails.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study modularity properties of generating series of logarithmic Gromov-Witten invariants of elliptic fibrations relative to singular fibers. Motivated by predictions from Vafa-Witten theory, we conjecture that such generating series are mock modular forms. We prove this conjecture for a large class of invariants of the rational elliptic surface mirror to $\mathbb{P}^2$, relative to a cycle of nine rational curves. The proof uses a correspondence between log Gromov-Witten invariants of the mirror and Vafa-Witten invariants of $\mathbb{P}^2$ established in previous work joint with Bousseau, together with known mock modularity results on the Vafa-Witten side.</description>

      <title>Finite generation of Noether-Lefschetz divisors and the slope of the moduli space of cubic fourfolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study divisors on moduli spaces of cubic fourfolds with simple singularities and of quasi-polarized K3 surfaces of degree $2d$. For the moduli space of cubic fourfolds, we introduce a slope quantity to characterize the effective cone and prove an explicit bound for it. For the K3 moduli spaces, we give an explicit finite presentation of the rational Picard group by showing that it is generated by Noether-Lefschetz divisors of discriminant less than or equal to $4d$. As a byproduct, we obtain two explicit expressions for the Hodge class in terms of Noether-Lefschetz divisors, and we indicate analogous results for higher-codimension Noether-Lefschetz cycles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce minimal Richardson orbits and pseudo-polarizations for nilpotent orbits in classical Lie algebras of types B, C, and D. For any nilpotent orbit, we classify all minimal Richardson orbits containing it and thereby determine the associated pseudo-polarizations. We prove that the corresponding Spaltenstein varieties are smooth and pure dimensional, with iterated orthogonal/isotropic Grassmannian fibrations. As an application, we extend the seesaw property and duality of Fu-Ruan-Wen from Richardson orbits to all special orbits in types B and C.</description>

      <title>Lifts of cycles in tropical hypersurfaces and the Gamma conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a complex hypersurface of dimension $d \geq 1$ in a toric variety, we construct lifts of tropical $(p, q)$-cycles with $p+q=d$ in the associated tropical hypersurface. The tropical cycles we consider are described by Minkowski weights, and their lifts are realized as topological cycles admitting a torus fibration structure over the tropical cycles. The intersection numbers of these lifted cycles are computed in terms of tropical intersection theory. We further derive the asymptotic formulas for the period integrals of the lifts in the tropical limit, which are closely related to the mirror symmetric Gamma conjecture. Throughout the paper, we assume that the tropicalization is dual to a unimodular triangulation of the Newton polytope.</description>

      <title>Derived algebras on formal stacks and prismatic gauges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies how the theory of derived algebras (in the sense of Bhatt-Mathew and Raksit) interacts with formal derived geometry, specifically the formal derived stacks which show up in the theory of prismatization. As an application we prove some classification theorems for derived algebras in quasi-coherent sheaves on a certain class of filtered \emph{formal} stacks, which includes those whose quasi-coherent sheaves are prismatic gauges over a perfectoid ring. Along the way, among other things, we study the behavior of derived algebras along schematic quasi-affine morphisms in derived geometry, and for example, classify derived algebras on the source as precisely those derived algebras on the target which receive a map from the pushforward of the structure sheaf of the source. We also indicate how to extend some of our results to (formal) classifying stacks of diagonalizable group schemes. As an aside, we also show some classification theorems even for quasi-coherent sheaves on formal stacks which (to our knowledge) weren't available in the literature on derived geometry previously. These results are motivated by forthcoming work of the author but hoped to be generally useful.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Newton polygons and Ekedahl-Oort types of reductions of abelian covers of the projective line branched at three points modulo a prime. We study the natural density of primes where these covers give supersingular and superspecial curves and show they appear much more often than expected. We also show that unlikely Newton polygons and Ekedahl-Oort types in the moduli space of curves appear frequently. Finally, we prove a theorem that provides evidence of Oort's Conjecture about Newton polygons in certain cases and gives new constructions of supersingular curves.</description>

      <title>Certified surface approximations using the interval Krawczyk test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm to construct a certified approximation of a surface by generalizing the Krawczyk test. The Krawczyk test is based on interval arithmetic, and confirms the existence and uniqueness of a solution to a square system of analytic equations in a region. By generalizing this test, we extend the reach of this technique to non-square systems and higher-dimensional varieties. We provide a prototype implementation and illustrate its use on several examples.</description>

      <title>Irreducible objects in the Gaiotto category at roots of unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theorem of R. Travkin and R. Yang, initially conjectured by D. Gaiotto, states that for a generic (not a root of unity) $q$ the category of $q$-twisted D-modules on the affine Grassmannian $Gr_{GL_N}$ which are equivariant with respect to a certain subgroup (defined by a choice of $0 \le M &lt;N$) of $GL_N$ is equivalent to the category of representations of the quantum supergroup $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(M|N))$. We aim to see whether this equivalence should hold when $q$ is a root of unity. We begin by asking if there is a natural bijection between the sets of irreducible objects. In this note we make an observation that suggests this should be the case: we show that there is a natural bijection between irreducible objects in the Gaiotto category and in the category of representations of a supergroup $GL(M|N)$ in positive characteristic. The proof is based on the version of the Serganova's algorithm formulated by J. Brundan and J. Kujawa in arXiv:math/0210108.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Properties of the Ideal of Spectral Invariants for the Discrete Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma=q_1\mathbb{Z}\oplus q_2 \mathbb{Z}\oplus\cdots\oplus q_d\mathbb{Z}$, with $q_j\in \mathbb{Z}^+$ for each $j\in \{1,\ldots,d\}$, and denote by $\Delta$ the discrete Laplacian on $\ell^2\left( \mathbb{Z}^d\right)$. We describe various algebraic properties of the ideal of spectral invariants for the discrete Laplacian when $d=1$, including a construction of a Gr\"obner basis. We also present various collections of complex $\Gamma$-periodic potentials $V$ that are such that $\Delta$ and $\Delta + V$ are Floquet isospectral. We end with a discussion of the general setting, where the $q_i$ are taken to be vectors in $\mathbb{Z}^d$.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm for Diagonalizing Matrices of Formal Power Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the unitary diagonalization of matrices over formal power series rings. Our main result shows that a normal matrix is unitarily diagonalizable if and only if its minimal polynomial completely splits over the ring and the associated spectral projections have entries in the ring. Building on this characterization, we develop an algorithm for deciding the unitary diagonalizability of matrices over regular local rings of algebraic varieties. A central ingredient of the algorithm is a decision procedure for determining whether a polynomial splits over a formal power series ring; we establish this using techniques from prime decomposition and the relative smoothness of integral closures in ramification theory.</description>

      <title>Some notes on tensor triangular geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These are notes from the lectures I gave at the Oberwolfach seminar `Tensor Triangular Geometry and Interactions' which was held in October 2025.
  The aim of these notes is to give an introduction to tensor triangular geometry, for both small and large categories, through the lens of lattice theory. We do not try to be exhaustive and this is reflected in both the content and the bibliography. For instance we are quite light on triangulated preliminaries, especially for compactly generated categories.
  The first three sections treat the essentially small case and conclude with a tensor triangular proof of Thomason's theorem computing the spectrum of the perfect complexes on a quasi-compact and quasi-separated scheme. The last section treats the compactly generated case. This final section is somewhat experimental and contains some new thoughts.</description>

      <title>Three lectures on tropical algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This document is a slightly expanded version of a series of talks given by J. Giansiracusa at the workshop `Geometry over semirings' at Universitat Aut\`{o}noma de Barcelona in July 2025. In the first lecture we introduce tropical polynomials, ideals, congruences, and how the connection with tropical geometry is made via congruences of bend relations. Tropical geometry and matroid theory are telling us that we should focus attention on a narrow slice of the world of tropical algebra, and this leads to the theory of tropical ideals (as developed by Maclagan and Rinc\'{o}n) and an abundance of interesting open questions. In the second lecture we examine the relationship between Berkovich analytification and tropicalization from the perspective of bend relations, giving a refinement of Payne's influential limit theorem. In the third lecture we set aside geometry and focus on tropicalization via bend relations as a construction in commutative and non-commutative algebra. Constructions such as symmetric algebras, exterior algebras, matrix algebras, and Clifford algebras can be tropicalized. In the case of exterior algebras, the resulting tropical notion beautifully completes the picture of the Pl\"{u}cker embedding and gives a new perspective on the tropical Pl\"{u}cker relations. For matrix algebras and Clifford algebras, Morita theory becomes an interesting topic.</description>

      <title>Homotopy types of finite \'etale spaces and generalized inflations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflation of a simplicial complex $K$ is a construction well known in combinatorial topology. It replaces each vertex $i$ of $K$ with a finite number $n_i$ of its copies, and each simplex $\{i_0,\ldots,i_k\}$ with $n_{i_0}n_{i_1}\cdots n_{i_k}$ many copies so that the collection of vertex-copies is spanned by a simplex in the inflation if and only if their originals were spanned by a simplex in the original complex. The celebrated poset fiber theorem of Bj\"{o}rner, Wachs, and Welker describes the homotopy type of such inflation in terms of homotopy types of $K$ and its links. In the current paper, we introduce more general inflations over simplicial posets: we replace each simplex with an arbitrary finite set of copies. The way how these sets patch together is specified by a commutative diagram, or, equivalently, a sheaf on the corresponding finite topology. The generalized inflation can be understood as \'etale space of such sheaf. We prove that, whenever this inflation sheaf is flabby, the poset fiber theorem still applies. We prove all results similar to those known for vertex inflations. We also cover the previous result of the first author about homotopy types of clique complexes of multigraphs.</description>

      <title>Towards resurgence of Joyce structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a Joyce structure, we show that the associated $\mathbb{C}^*$-family of non-linear connections $\mathcal{A}^{\epsilon}$ can be gauged to a standard form $\mathcal{A}^{\epsilon,\text{st}}$ by a gauge transformation $\hat{g}$, formal in $\epsilon$. We show that the corresponding infinitesimal gauge transformation $\dot{g}=\log(\hat{g})$ has a convergent Borel transform, provided $\dot{g}$ vanishes on the base of the Joyce structure. This establishes the first step in showing that such a $\dot{g}$ is resurgent. We also use $\hat{g}$ to produce formal twistor Darboux coordinates for the complex hyperk\"{a}hler structure associated to the Joyce structure, and show a similar result about convergence of the Borel transform of the formal twistor Darboux coordinates.</description>

Abstract: Luna's etale slice theorem is a useful theorem for the local study of quotients by reductive algebraic groups. In this article, we show that the slice theorem can also be used to study local structures of invariant Hilbert schemes. By using this method, we show some results on smoothness of invariant Hilbert schemes at closed orbits.</description>

Abstract: We prove that, under certain conditions, the existence of a curve of $(m+2)$-secants to the Kummer variety of an indecomposable principally polarized abelian variety $X$, represents $m$-times the minimal cohomological class in $X$. In the case of $m=2$, we find an involution of such curve which proves that \(X\) is a Prym variety by results of Krichever-Grushevsky. This continues the work of Beauville and Debarre, who asked about the relation between some geometric properties of abelian varieties in a way to obtain a stratification of its moduli space.</description>

      <title>Stable sheaf cohomology on flag varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an effective stabilization result for the sheaf cohomology groups of line bundles on flag varieties parametrizing complete flags in k^n, as well as for the sheaf cohomology groups of polynomial functors applied to the cotangent sheaf Omega on projective space. In characteristic zero, these are natural consequences of the Borel-Weil-Bott theorem, but in characteristic p&gt;0 they are non-trivial. Unlike many important contexts in modular representation theory, where the prime characteristic p is assumed to be large relative to n, in our study we fix p and let n go to infinity. We illustrate the general theory by providing explicit stable cohomology calculations in a number of cases of interest. Our examples yield cohomology groups where the number of indecomposable summands has super-polynomial growth, and also show that the cohomological degrees where non-vanishing occurs do not form a connected interval. In the case of polynomial functors of Omega, we prove a Kunneth formula for stable cohomology, and show the invariance of stable cohomology under Frobenius, which combined with the Steinberg tensor product theorem yields calculations of stable cohomology for an interesting class of simple polynomial functors arising in the work of Doty. The results in the special case of symmetric powers of Omega provide a nice application to commutative algebra, yielding a sharp vanishing result for Koszul modules of finite length in all characteristics.</description>

      <title>The Weakly Special Conjecture contradicts orbifold Mordell, and hence the abc conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06643v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from an Enriques surface over $\mathbb{Q}(t)$ considered by Lafon, we give the first examples of smooth projective weakly special threefolds which fibre over the projective line in Enriques surfaces (resp. K3 surfaces) with nowhere reduced, but non-divisible, fibres and general type orbifold base. We verify that these families of Enriques surfaces (resp. K3 surfaces) are non-isotrivial and compute their fundamental groups by studying the behaviour of local points along certain \'etale covers. The existence of the above threefolds implies that the Weakly Special Conjecture formulated in 2000 contradicts the Orbifold Mordell Conjecture, and hence the abc conjecture. Using these examples, we can also easily disprove several complex-analytic analogues of the Weakly Special Conjecture. Finally, the existence of such threefolds shows that Enriques surfaces and K3 surfaces can have non-divisible but nowhere reduced degenerations, thereby answering a question raised in 2005.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometric Manin's conjecture predicts that components of the moduli space of curves on a Fano variety parametrizing non-free curves are pathological and arise from "accumulating" morphisms that increase the Fujita invariant. By passing to positive characteristic and employing a higher genus generalization of the circle method, we prove a converse to this conjecture for general hypersurfaces $X$ in $\mathbb{P}^{n}$ of degree $d\le n/4+3/2$, namely that there are no such accumulating maps to $X$. One consequence of this is a version of Poincar\'e duality for these moduli spaces in a range.</description>

Abstract: EPW cubes are polarized hyper-K\"ahler varieties of K$3^{[3]}$-type that carry an anti-symplectic involution. We study the geometry of the fixed locus $\sW_A$ of this involution and prove that it is a \emph{rigid} atomic Lagrangian submanifold. Our proof is based on a detailed description of certain singular degenerations of EPW cubes and the degeneration methods of Flappan--Macr\`i--O'Grady--Sacc\`a.</description>

Abstract: The Brian\c{c}on-Iarrobino conjecture predicts the maximum singularity of the Hilbert scheme of a tetrahedral number of points. As for the maximal singularities of the Hilbert scheme of a non-tetrahedral number of points, the second named author gave some separate conjectural necessary and sufficient conditions. In this paper, we provide a conjectural sufficient condition for the necessary condition, and propose a monotonicity conjecture which predicts that for a fixed colength $l$, the maximal dimension of the tangent space over all the Borel-fixed ideals of colength $l$ is increasing with respect to the smallest pure exponent of the ideal.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Categories of Nori Motivic Sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that two different possible theories of Nori motivic sheaves, introduced by Ivorra--Morel and by Ayoub, respectively, are canonically equivalent. The proof of this result, which exploits the six functor formalism systematically, is based on the Tannakian theory of motivic local systems. As a consequence, we obtain a system of realization functors of Voevodsky motivic sheaves into Nori motivic sheaves compatible with the six operations, previously constructed by Tubach using different methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the geometry and topology of real analytic maps $\mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C}^k$, where $n &gt; k$, regarded as mixed maps, defined below. Firstly, we give two natural families of mixed isolated complete intersection singularities, called mixed ICIS, which are interesting on their own. We consider the notion of (partial) non-degeneracy for mixed maps; we prove that these define mixed ICIS and that, under suitable conditions, admit a local Milnor fibration. Then, building on previous constructions due to Oka, we obtain natural contact structures and adapted open books on a particular class of mixed links. Finally, we look at mixed links that are diffeomorphic to holomorphic ones, and we address the problem of comparing different contact structures.</description>

Abstract: This paper continues the study initiated in [ISZ25] on the moduli of surfaces admitting lc-trivial fibrations. Using the techniques developed in [ISZ25], we
  (1) provide a classification of the surfaces appearing on the boundary of the KSBA-moduli space of elliptic surfaces with a bisection
  (2) recover the results of a series of papers on the moduli stacks of elliptic surfaces with a section [AB22, Inc20, Bru15]. Notably, our proof of (2) avoids the use of explicit steps of an MMP, such as the "La Nave flip" from [LN02], which plays a central role in [AB22,Inc20]. As an application, we compactify the moduli stack of hyperelliptic K3 surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (FTA) asserts that every complex polynomial has as many complex roots, counted with multiplicities, as its degree. A probabilistic analogue of this theorem for real roots of real polynomials, sometimes referred to as the Kac theorem, was found between 1938 and 1943 by J. Littlewood, A. Offord, and M. Kac. In this paper, we present several more versions of FTA: Kac type FTA for Laurent polynomials in one and many variables, Kac type FTA for polynomials on complex reductive groups arising in the context of compact group representations (similar to Laurent polynomials arising in torus representation theory), and FTA for exponential sums in one and many variables. In the case of Laurent polynomials, the result, even in the one-dimensional case, is unexpected: most of the zeros of a real Laurent polynomial are real. This text is a supplemented and more detailed version of \cite{arx}.</description>

Abstract: For a nondegenerate projective variety $X$, the Eisenbud-Goto conjecture asserts that $\operatorname{reg}X\leq\operatorname{deg}X-\operatorname{codim}X+1$. Despite the existence of counterexamples, identifying the classes of varieties for which the conjecture holds remains a major open problem. In this paper, we prove that the Eisenbud-Goto conjecture holds for $2$-very ample projectively normal varieties with factorial, rational, hypersurface singularities and isolated Gorenstein singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the Dolgachev-Nikulin-Pinkham mirror symmetry for lattice-polarized K3 surfaces, we study its analogue for abelian surfaces. In this paper, we introduce lattice-polarized abelian surfaces and construct their coarse moduli spaces. We then construct stringy K\"ahler moduli spaces for abelian surfaces and show that these two spaces are naturally identified for mirror pairs. We also introduce a natural involution on stringy K\"ahler moduli spaces which, under mirror symmetry, pairs abelian surfaces and their duals. Finally, we determine conditions for the existence of mirror partners and classify self-mirror abelian surfaces via their N\'eron-Severi lattices.</description>

      <title>The Ideal Membership Problem and Abelian Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.05218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given polynomials $f_0,\dots, f_k$ the Ideal Membership Problem, IMP for short, asks if $f_0$ belongs to the ideal generated by $f_1,\dots, f_k$. In the search version of this problem the task is to find a proof of this fact. The IMP is a well-known fundamental problem with numerous applications. For instance, it underlies many proof systems based on polynomials such as Nullstellensatz, Polynomial Calculus, and Sum-of-Squares. Although the IMP is in general intractable, in many important cases it can be efficiently solved.
  Mastrolilli [SODA'19] initiated a systematic study of IMPs for ideals arising from Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs), parameterized by constraint languages, denoted IMP($\Gamma$). The ultimate goal of this line of research is to classify all such IMPs accordingly to their complexity. Mastrolilli achieved this goal for IMPs arising from CSP($\Gamma$) where $\Gamma$ is a Boolean constraint language, while Bulatov and Rafiey [STOC'22] advanced these results to several cases of CSPs over finite domains. In this paper we consider IMPs arising from CSPs over `affine' constraint languages, in which constraints are subgroups (or their cosets) of direct products of Abelian groups. This kind of CSPs include systems of linear equations and are considered one of the most important types of tractable CSPs. Some special cases of the problem have been considered before by Bharathi and Mastrolilli [MFCS'21] for linear equation modulo 2, and by Bulatov and Rafiey [STOC'22] to systems of linear equations over $GF(p)$, $p$ prime. Here we prove that if $\Gamma$ is an affine constraint language then IMP($\Gamma$) is solvable in polynomial time assuming the input polynomial has bounded degree.</description>

      <title>Bethe subalgebras in antidominantly shifted Yangians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.04700v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The loop group $G((z^{-1}))$ of a simple complex Lie group $G$ has a natural Poisson structure. We introduce a natural family of Poisson commutative subalgebras $\overline{{\mathbf{B}}}(C) \subset \mathcal{O}(G((z^{-1}))$ depending on the parameter $C\in G$ called classical universal Bethe subalgebras. To every antidominant cocharacter $\mu$ of the maximal torus $T \subset G$ one can associate the closed Poisson subspace $\mathcal{W}_\mu$ of $G((z^{-1}))$ (the Poisson algebra $\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{W}_\mu)$ is the classical limit of so-called shifted Yangian $Y_\mu(\mathfrak{g})$). We consider the images of $\overline{{\mathbf{B}}}(C)$ in $\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{W}_\mu)$, that we denote by $\overline{B}_\mu(C)$, that should be considered as classical versions of (not yet defined in general) Bethe subalgebras in shifted Yangians. For regular $C$ centralizing $\mu$, we compute the Poincar\'e series of these subalgebras. For $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{gl}_n$, we define the natural quantization ${\mathbf{Y}}^{\mathrm{rtt}}(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ of $\mathcal{O}(\operatorname{Mat}_n((z^{-1}))))$ and universal Bethe subalgebras ${\mathbf{B}}(C) \subset {\mathbf{Y}}^{\mathrm{rtt}}(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$. Using the RTT realization of $Y_\mu(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ (invented by Frassek, Pestun, and Tsymbaliuk), we obtain the natural surjections ${\mathbf{Y}}^{\mathrm{rtt}}(\mathfrak{gl}_n) \twoheadrightarrow Y_\mu(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ which quantize the embedding $\mathcal{W}_\mu \subset \operatorname{Mat}_n((z^{-1}))$). Taking the images of ${\mathbf{B}}(C)$ in $Y_\mu(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ we recover Bethe subalgebras $B_\mu(C) \subset Y_\mu(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ proposed by Frassek, Pestun and Tsymbaliuk.</description>

Abstract: We prove a descent result for finite projective modules, motivated by a question in perfectoid geometry. Given a commutative ring $A$, we formulate a descent problem for descending a finite projective module over the Novikov ring with coefficients in $A$ to a finite projective module over $A$. The main theorem of this paper is that all such descent data are effective. As an application, we prove for every perfect $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra $A$, a vector bundle on $\operatorname{Spd} A$ always descends to a vector bundle on $\operatorname{Spec} A$.</description>

      <title>Fay identities for polylogarithms on higher-genus Riemann surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11476v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent construction of polylogarithms on Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus in arXiv:2306.08644 is based on a flat connection assembled from single-valued non-holomorphic integration kernels that depend on two points on the Riemann surface. In this work, we construct and prove infinite families of bilinear relations among these integration kernels that are necessary for the closure of the space of higher-genus polylogarithms under integration over the points on the surface. Our bilinear relations generalize the Fay identities among the genus-one Kronecker-Eisenstein kernels to arbitrary genus. The multiple-valued meromorphic kernels in the flat connection of Enriquez are conjectured to obey higher-genus Fay identities of exactly the same form as their single-valued non-holomorphic counterparts. We initiate the applications of Fay identities to derive functional relations among higher-genus polylogarithms involving either single-valued or meromorphic integration kernels.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth rigid space with an action of a finite group $G$ satisfying that $X/G$ is represented by a rigid space. We construct sheaves of $p$-adic Cherednik algebras on the small \'etale site of the quotient $X/G$, and study some of their properties. The sheaves of $p$-adic Cherednik algebras are sheaves of Fr\'echet-Stein $K$-algebras on $X/G$, which can be regarded as $p$-adic analytic versions of the sheaves of Cherednik algebras associated to the action of a finite group on a smooth algebraic variety defined by P. Etingof.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a formalism of Hochschild (co)-homology for $\mathcal{D}$-cap modules on smooth rigid analytic spaces based on the homological tools of Ind-Banach $\mathcal{D}$-cap modules. We introduce several categories of $\mathcal{D}$-cap bimodules for which this theory is well-behaved. Among these, the most important example is the category of diagonal $\mathcal{C}$-complexes. We give an explicit calculation of the Hochschild complex for diagonal $\mathcal{C}$-complexes, and show that the Hochschild complex of $\mathcal{D}$-cap is canonically isomorphic to the de Rham complex of $X$. In particular, we obtain a Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence converging to the Hochschild cohomology groups of $\mathcal{D}$-cap. We obtain explicit formulas relating the Hochschild cohomology and homology of a given diagonal $\mathcal{C}$-complex.</description>

Abstract: Let $I_A \subset K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ be a toric ideal. In this paper, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the toric variety $V(I_A)$, over an algebraically closed field, to be expressed as the set-theoretic intersection of other toric varieties. We also introduce the radical splitting number of $I_A$, denoted by ${\rm Split}_{\rm rad}(I_A)$, and compute its exact value in several cases, with particular emphasis on toric ideals arising from graphs. In particular, we show that ${\rm Split}_{\rm rad}(I_A)=3$ for toric ideals of complete bipartite graphs. Additionally, we prove that ${\rm Split}_{\rm rad}(I_A)$ coincides with the binomial arithmetical rank of $I_A$ when the height of $I_A$ is equal to 2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00954v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For each endotrivial complex arising from Bredon homology of a representation sphere, we construct $p$-local quasi-isomorphisms, called forerunners, enabling us to extend Balmer--Gallauer's results in arXiv:2307.04398 Part II concerning the tensor-triangular geometry of permutation modules for elementary abelian $p$-groups to all $p$-groups. We construct an open cover of the Balmer spectrum under which all endotrivials are line bundles, that is, every endotrivial is locally isomorphic to a shifted tensor unit. We define a 'remixed' permutation twisted cohomology ring for which the canonical comparison map from the Balmer spectrum to the homogeneous spectrum of the twisted cohomology ring is injective. If the twisted cohomology ring is Noetherian, the comparison map is an open immersion, and the open cover endows the Balmer spectrum with Dirac scheme structure. We prove Noetherianity holds for Dedekind groups and all $p$-groups of order at most $p^3$, and conjecture Noetherianity holds for all finite $p$-groups.</description>

Abstract: We compute certain strict Picard spectra of $K(1)$-local $K$-theory spectra of schemes in terms of Brauer groups, using the map that takes an Azumaya algebra to its $K(1)$-local $K$-theory and proving a K\"unneth formula in that setting. For example, we prove that for semi-local rings of characteristic $\neq p$, $\mathbf{Br}(R)[p^\infty]\simeq \mathbb{G}_{\mathrm{pic}}(L_{K(1)}K(R)\otimes\mathbb{S}_{W(\overline{\mathbb F}_p)})[p^\infty]$, where $\mathbb{G}_{\mathrm{pic}}$ is Carmeli's strict Picard spectrum. We prove the same result for $R[\frac{1}{p}]$, when $R$ is $p$-henselian.</description>

Abstract: Given a number field $k$ with the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_k$ and a matrix $M\in \mathrm{M}_{n}(\mathcal{O}_k)$. We prove that if $\mathcal{O}_k$ is a principal ideal domain, the local-global principle for triangularizability and diagonalizability of $M$ holds. To explain the possible failures of the local-global principle, we prove that the stratified Brauer--Manin obstruction is the only obstruction to the local-global principle for triangularizability and diagonalizability of $M$ in some special cases.</description>
