      <title>Effects of gravity on supersolid order in bubble-trapped bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unveiling the principles behind self-organization in quantum systems is of paramount importance, both intrinsically and practically, in view of foreseeable technological applications. Recently, increasing attention is being paid to atomic systems in curved geometries, which are a promising platform for the discovery of new emergent phenomena. A notable example is that of a gas of ultracold atoms loaded into a thin spherical shell, according to a protocol introduced by Zobay and Garraway more than twenty years ago. However, gravity prevents a dilute assembly of atoms from uniformly spreading throughout the shell, which explains why experiments on the condensation and superfluidity of bubble-trapped gases are usually conducted in space under microgravity conditions. In this paper, we focus instead on strongly-interacting quantum particles in a bubble trap, choosing the cluster supersolid of soft-core bosons as testbed. To study the impact of gravity on supersolid order, we consider a gedanken experiment in which the strength of gravity relative to the core repulsion is gradually enhanced. Using path integral Monte Carlo simulations, we trace the parallel evolution of system structure and superfluidity at low temperature, finding that the latter is sizeable only when gravity is a small perturbation or, at the other extreme, so strong that particles are all gathered in one cluster at the bottom of the trap. Finally, we assess the relevance of gravity for the equilibrium behavior of ultracold Rydberg-dressed atoms in a bubble trap, concluding that in some cases clues of the supersolid phase in the absence of gravity could be found even in a laboratory on Earth.</description>

      <title>Divergence of thermalization rates driven by the competition between finite temperature and quantum coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermalization of an isolated quantum system is described by quantum mechanics and thermodynamics, while these two subjects are still not fully consistent with each other. This leaves a less-explored region where both quantum and thermal effects cannot be neglected, and the ultracold atom platform provides a suitable and versatile testbed to experimentally investigate these complex phenomena. Here we perform experiments based on ultracold atoms in optical lattices and observe a divergence of thermalization rates of quantum matters when the temperature approaches zero. By ramping an external parameter in the Hamiltonian, we observe the time delay between the internal relaxation and the external ramping. This provides us with a direct comparison of the thermalization rates of different quantum phases. We find that the quantum coherence and bosonic stimulation of superfluid induces the divergence while the finite temperature and the many-body interactions are suppressing the divergence. The quantum coherence and the thermal effects are competing with each other in this isolated thermal quantum system, which leads to the transition of thermalization rate from divergence to convergence.</description>

      <title>Quantum Turbulence in a Three-Dimensional Holographic Superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report real-time simulations of far-from-equilibrium dynamics of a holographic superfluid in three dimensions. The holographic duality maps a strongly coupled superfluid to a weakly coupled theory with gravity in a higher-dimensional curved space which we study numerically. Starting from configurations of dense tangles of quantized vortex lines, the superfluid exhibits turbulent behavior during its evolution towards thermal equilibrium. Specifically, we observe two subsequent universal regimes of quasi-stationary scaling in the occupation number spectrum, the first of which is Kolmogorov-like. Indications for the strongly dissipative nature of vortex dynamics in the three-dimensional holographic superfluid are found in the rapid shrinking and annihilation of small vortex rings that emerge from frequent reconnections of vortex lines during the evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of future quantum devices requires understanding the dynamics of driven many-body systems, in which the Floquet-induced interactions play a central role. This understanding is crucial for coherently controlling quantum states, minimising errors, and benchmarking the performance of these devices. In this thesis, we analyse the enhancement on the Floquet-induced interactions by many-body correlations, and develop an advanced Floquet method to understand the Floquet-induced interactions relevant for future quantum devices.</description>

      <title>On the density-density correlations of the non-interacting finite temperature electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The density-density correlations of the non-interacting finite temperature electron gas are discussed in detail. Starting from the ideal linear density response function and utilizing general relations from linear response theory, known and novel expressions are derived for the pair correlation function, static structure factor, dynamic structure factor, thermal structure factor and imaginary time correlation function. Applications of these expressions in the classical mapping approach, self-consistent dielectric formalism and equation-of-state construction are analyzed in depth.</description>

      <title>Anderson Localization in Photonic Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solutions of the wave equations for time-independent disordered media can exhibit Anderson localization where instead of wave propagation we observe their localization around different points in space. Photonic time crystals are spatially homogeneous media in which the refractive index changes periodically in time, leading to the formation of bands in the wave number domain. By analogy to Anderson localization in space, one might expect that the presence of temporal disorder in photonic time crystals would lead to Anderson localization in the time domain. Here, we show that indeed periodic modulations of the refractive index with the addition of temporal disorder lead to Anderson localization in time, where an electromagnetic field can emerge from the temporally modulated medium at a certain moment in time and then decay exponentially over time. Thus, we are dealing with a situation where, in a fluctuating three-dimensional medium, the birth and death of waves can occur, and the mechanism of this phenomenon corresponds to Anderson localization.</description>

      <title>Fragile non-Bloch spectrum and unconventional Green's function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In non-Hermitian systems, it is a counterintuitive feature of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) that the energy spectrum and eigenstates can be totally different under open or periodic boundary conditions, suggesting that non-Hermitian spectra can be extremely sensitive to non-local perturbations. Here, we show that a wide range of non-Hermitian models with NHSE can even be highly sensitive to local perturbation under open boundary conditions. The spectrum of these models is so fragile that it can be significantly modified by adding only exponentially small perturbations on boundaries. Intriguingly, we show that such fragile spectra are quantified by the Green's function exhibiting unconventional V-shape asymptotic behaviors. Accordingly, bi-directional exponential amplification can be observed. As an interesting consequence, we find a real-to-complex transition of the bulk spectrum induced by exponentially small boundary perturbations. Finally, we reveal a hierarchy of the asymptotic behaviors of non-Hermitian Green's functions, which restricts the frequency range for the presence of unconventional Green's functions.</description>

      <title>Chapman-Enskog theory for nearly integrable quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrable systems feature an infinite number of conserved charges and on hydrodynamic scales are described by generalised hydrodynamics (GHD). This description breaks down when the integrability is weakly broken and sufficiently large space-time-scales are probed. The emergent hydrodynamics depends then on the charges conserved by the perturbation. We focus on nearly-integrable Galilean-invariant systems with conserved particle number, momentum and energy. Basing on the Boltzmann collision approach to integrability breaking we describe dynamics of the system with GHD equation supplemented with collision term. The limit of large space-time-scales is addressed using Chapman-Enskog expansion adapted to the GHD equation. We recover Navier-Stokes equations and find transport coefficients: viscosity and thermal conductivity, which are given by generalizations of Chapman-Enskog integral equations. We also observe that the diffusion of quasiparticles introduces an additional small parameter enriching the structure of the expansion as compared to the standard Boltzmann equation.</description>

      <title>Symmetry oscillations in strongly interacting one-dimensional mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multicomponent quantum mixtures in one dimension can be characterized by their symmetry under particle exchange. For a strongly interacting Bose-Bose mixture, we show that the time evolution of the momentum distribution from an initially symmetry-mixed state is quasiconstant for a SU(2) symmetry conserving Hamiltonian, while it displays large oscillations in time for the symmetry-breaking case where inter- and intraspecies interactions are different. Using the property that the momentum distribution operator at strong interactions commutes with the class-sum operator, the latter acting as a symmetry witness, we show that the momentum distribution oscillations correspond to symmetry oscillations, with a mechanism analogous to neutrino flavor oscillations.</description>

      <title>Collective excitations and universal coarsening dynamics of a spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the collective excitation spectrum of a Raman-induced spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a quasi-one-dimensional harmonic trap while varying either the Raman coupling or quadratic Zeeman term by using the Bogoliubov approach. A few low-lying modes, which can be used to delineate the phase boundaries, are identified by exciting them with suitable perturbations. We also investigate the coarsening dynamics of a homogeneous quasi-two-dimensional spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 condensate by quenching from the zero-momentum into the plane wave phase through a sudden change in Raman coupling strength. We demonstrate that the correlation function of the order parameter displays dynamic scaling during the late-time dynamics, allowing us to determine the dynamic critical exponent.</description>
