      <title>VCSEL-based CPO for Scale-Up in A.I. Datacenter. Status and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The drastic increase of bandwidth demands in AI datacenters requires new solutions with low power consumption and high bandwidth densities. Further increasing the total bandwidth with copper interconnects is challenging, thus it is crucial to introduce optics into the scale-up network. For this purpose, the most important metrics are the energy efficiency of the total link in addition to the spatial bandwidth-density and reach. With the inefficiency of copper traces at high speeds, transitioning to co-packaged optics is no longer optional but essential. Here, we show that the mature VCSEL technology offers the ideal combination of low-cost, low-latency, high-reliability, and energy efficiency at all bitrates, thanks to their unique versatility and high wall-plug-efficiency.

      <title>Self-Aligned Heterogeneous Quantum Photonic Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated quantum photonics holds significant promise for scalable photonic quantum information processing, quantum repeaters, and quantum networks, but its development is hindered by the mismatch between materials hosting high-quality quantum emitters and those compatible with mature photonic technologies. Heterogeneous integration offers a potential solution to this challenge, yet practical implementations have been limited by inevitable insertion losses at material interfaces. Here, we present a self-aligned heterogeneous quantum photonic integration approach that can deterministically achieve near-unity coupling efficiency at the interface. To showcase our approach, we demonstrate Purcell enhancement of a silicon vacancy (SiV) center in diamond induced by a heterogeneous photonic crystal cavity defined by titanium dioxide (TiO2), as well as optical spin control and readout via a TiO2 photonic circuit. We further show that, when combined with inverse photonic design, our approach enables efficient and broadband collection of single photons from a color center into a heterogeneous waveguide. Our approach is not restricted to SiV centers or TiO2; it can be broadly applied to integrate diverse solid-state quantum emitters with thin-film photonic devices where conformal deposition is possible. Together, these results establish a practical route to scalable quantum photonic integrated circuits that combine high-quality quantum emitters with technologically mature photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Paraxial diffusion-field retrieval. II. Fokker-Planck generalization of the transport-of-intensity equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport-of-intensity equation (TIE) has been very widely employed for phase retrieval. In particular, the TIE is an elliptic second-order partial differential equation which may be solved for the phase of a coherent paraxial field such as a monochromatic scalar optical beam, given the intensity and longitudinal intensity derivative in a plane perpendicular to the optical axis. We show how the coherent flow associated with the TIE may be augmented by a diffusive flow associated with a scalar or tensor diffusion field. Such diffusive flow can arise via scattering from unresolved spatially random microstructure within an illuminated sample, the blurring effects of an extended chaotic source that illuminates the sample, the resolution-reducing effect of shot noise in detected intensity images of the sample, and the sharpening effect (negative diffusion) associated with scattering from sharp sample edges. Augmenting the TIE's modeling of coherent flow with a diffuse-flow channel leads to a Fokker-Planck extension to this equation. Two different TIE augmentations are obtained, using three different derivations. The inverse problems of phase retrieval and diffusion-field retrieval are then studied, for both defocus-based imaging and mask-based imaging (structured-illumination imaging). When symmetric overfocus and underfocus images are employed for the purposes of phase retrieval, the diffusive term drops out and our Fokker-Planck formalism implies that any ensuing TIE-based phase-retrieval method needs no modification in light of our formalism. However, the same focal-series dataset -- which is typically an infocus image, a weakly overfocused image, and a weakly underfocused image -- may also be employed to access the additional channel of information associated with the Fokker-Planck diffusion field. Our formalism is applicable to visible light, x-rays, electrons, and neutrons.</description>

      <title>Transient Pauli blocking in a InN film as a mechanism for broadband ultrafast optical switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transient Pauli blocking effect offers a promising route for achieving ultrafast optical switching in semiconductors, enabling a rapid switching from an initially opaque state to a relatively transparent state upon photoexcitation. Herein, we demonstrate broadband ultrafast optical switching in degenerate InN thin films, spanning the visible to near-infrared spectral range, using pump-probe transient transmittance measurements. To elucidate the underlying physical mechanism, we perform probe-energy-resolved analysis for ultrafast dynamics, and develop a theoretical model based on a quasi-equilibrium Fermi-Dirac distribution. The model successfully captures the experimental transients and yields an electron-phonon coupling constant of $1.0\times10^{17}\,\mathrm{W\,m^{-3}\,K^{-1}}$, along with an electronic specific heat coefficient ranging from 1.52 to 2.02 $\mathrm{mJ\,mol^{-1}\,K^{-2}}$, which allow direct prediction of the spectral switching window. Notably, we demonstrate that the Pauli blocking effect can be induced solely by a laser-excitation driven rise in electronic temperature, without requiring significant carrier injection into the conduction band in degenerate semiconductors. These findings offer new insights for designing ultrafast optical modulators, shutters, and photonic devices for next-generation communication and computing technologies.</description>

      <title>In-Situ Inverse Design of a Plasma Metamaterial Beam Steering Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse design is a commonly used methodology for creating devices that manipulate electromagnetic (EM) waves by algorithmically modifying device parameters to achieve a desired functionality. Utilizing plasma, a dynamically tunable medium, allows the optimization of the design process to be conducted directly on the experimental hardware (in-situ). A key advantage of this method is the creation of devices that are inherently switchable and dynamically reconfigurable. Bayesian optimization is used to tune the plasma density of 91 independent discharges that make up a plasma metamaterial (PMM) device to steer incoming EM waves to desired exit waveguides. Measurements were conducted in an automated loop where a vector network analyzer records the PMM transmission characteristics for each device setting. By relying only on measured scattering parameters, this gradient-free approach is robust to experimental drift and noise and does not require complex full-wave models. Significant performance improvements over traditional simulation-based (in-silico) inverse design are demonstrated, with in-situ Bayesian optimization achieving up to 10,000x higher isolation between ports than the best in-silico design at the same target frequency. This work also presents guidelines for applying Bayesian optimization to noisy, high-dimensional physical systems.</description>

      <title>Kerr-enhanced amplification of three-wave mixing and emergent masing regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated optical microresonators exploiting either second-order ($\chi^{(2)}$) or third-order ($\chi^{(3)}$) nonlinearities have become key platforms for frequency conversion, low-noise microwave photonics, and quantum entanglement generation. Here, we present an analytic theory of Kerr-enhanced three-wave mixing amplification in an electro-optic microresonator with both $\chi^{(2)}$ and $\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinearities. We demonstrate that Kerr dressing hybridizes the optical sidebands, renormalizing the $\chi^{(2)}$ couplings and detunings. As a result the system exhibits gain in regions where analogous bare $\chi^{(2)}$ or $\chi^{(3)}$ amplifiers are subthreshold. Time-domain Langevin simulations confirm this threshold reduction, mapping a practical design window for experiments.</description>

      <title>Ho3+-doped CALGO crystals for high-power ultrafast 2.1-{\mu}m lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ho3+-doped disordered CaAlGdO4 (CALGO) crystals have recently emerged as a promising gain material platform for next-generation high-power ultrafast 2.1-{\mu}m laser systems. This laser gain material offers a unique combination of high-gain, small quantum defect, inhomogeneously broadened spectra, and good thermal conductivity, enabling ultrashort pulse generation and amplification at high-average power and high pulse energy. Many systems, including mode-locked oscillators and amplifiers with state-of-the-art performance, have been demonstrated in the last few years that promise to meet growing application demands for efficient ultrafast laser technology in this wavelength region. In this review paper, we summarize recent achievements using this gain material both in oscillators and amplifiers and place these results in the state-of-the-art of 2-{\mu}m ultrafast laser technology, present detailed spectroscopic characterization of this material, and discuss future perspectives of further performance scaling of Ho:CALGO lasers.</description>

      <title>Solution-derived barium titanate waveguides for integrated electro-optic modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal oxides with strong nonlinear optical properties and wide transparency window are key materials for the development of compact and efficient photonic integrated circuits used for electro-optic modulators and entangled photon sources. Among them, barium titanate (BaTiO$_{3}$) is particularly attractive due to its large Pockels coefficient. However, its use has been limited by challenges in material synthesis and in nanopatterning, owing to its chemical stability and inertness. Here, we demonstrate a monolithic electro-optic modulator entirely based on solution-deposited BaTiO$_{3}$, fabricated through a bottom-up soft nanoimprinting lithography process. Fine-tuning the synthesis and nanofabrication enhances the optical properties of the polycrystalline material. By optimizing the process parameters, we achieve a reduction in propagation losses of two orders of magnitude, enabling efficient electro-optic modulation. This scalable, etch-free approach enables direct patterning of high-quality BaTiO$_{3}$ structures, establishing a new route for low-cost, large-scale integrated electro-optic devices entirely based on oxide material compatible with a wide range of substrates.</description>

      <title>Illustrating Special-Relativity Phenomena via Gaussian Ray Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We highlight the correspondence between one-dimensional Lorentz transformations, which relate events observed from two distinct inertial reference frames, and ray transfer transformations in Gaussian optics. Specifically, we identify optical systems whose transfer matrices reproduce the mathematical structure of the Lorentz transformation. Within this framework, we show that fundamental effects of special relativity as time dilatation, length contraction and loss of synchronicity find a direct counterpart in the behavior of light rays deviated by a diverging lens, thereby providing a novel and illustrative optical equivalence of relativistic phenomena. This article is intended for a broad audience of physicists. The correspondence described is general and may interest students with a moderate background in special relativity and optics, as well as teachers in the corresponding fields.</description>

      <title>Enhanced posterior sampling via diffusion models for efficient metasurfaces inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15210v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse design of metasurfaces faces inherent challenges due to the nonlinear and highly complex relationship between geometric configurations and their electromagnetic behavior. Traditional optimization approaches often suffer from excessive computational demands and a tendency to converge to suboptimal solutions. This study presents a diffusion-based generative framework that incorporates a dedicated consistency constraint and advanced posterior sampling methods to ensure adherence to desired electromagnetic specifications. Through rigorous validation on small-scale metasurface configurations, the proposed approach demonstrates marked enhancements in both accuracy and reliability of the generated designs. Furthermore, we introduce a scalable methodology that extends inverse design capabilities to large-scale metasurfaces, validated for configurations of up to $98 \times 98$ nanopillars. Notably, this approach enables rapid design generation completed in minute by leveraging models trained on substantially smaller arrays ($23 \times 23$). These innovations establish a robust and efficient framework for high-precision metasurface inverse design.</description>

      <title>Single Pixel Imaging and Compressive Sensing: A Practical Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single Pixel Imaging is an emerging imaging technique that employs a bucket detector (photodiode) to sample a spatially modulated light field, rather than measuring the spatial distribution with an array of detectors. This approach provides a low-cost alternative for imaging at unconventional wavelengths and enables improved signal collection in noisy measurement environments. Furthermore, it allows the application of compressive sensing to reduce the amount of acquired data and measurement time, facilitating live or in vivo imaging applications. This tutorial presents the experimental implementation of measurement bases and compressive sensing reconstruction methods, including both deterministic algorithms and deep learning approaches. Accompanying Python notebooks guide readers through the reproduction of the presented results and support the application of the methods to their own work.</description>

      <title>Orbital angular momentum of spatiotemporal vortices: a ray-mechanical analogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal vortex pulses (STVPs) are wavepackets that carry transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM), whose proper quantification has been the subject of recent debate. In this work, we introduce a simplified mechanical model of STVPs, consisting of a loop of non-interacting point particles traveling at a uniform constant speed but at slightly di!erent angles. We examine di!erent initial conditions for the particle loop, including configurations that are elliptic in space at a given time and configurations that are elliptic in spacetime at a fixed propagation distance. Furthermore, employing a non-uniform mass distribution allows the particle loop to mimic the STVP not only in configuration space but also in momentum space. Remarkably, when supplemented by a semiclassical vorticity quantization condition, our mechanical model exactly reproduces di!erent wave-based OAM results previously reported for paraxial STVPs.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Torque Without Anisotropy: Switchable Casimir Torque Between Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Casimir torque is conventionally associated with explicit breaking of rotational symmetry, arising from material dielectric anisotropy, geometric asymmetry, or externally applied fields that themselves break rotational invariance. Here we demonstrate a fundamentally different mechanism: an axially symmetric magnetic field can generate a Casimir torque by inducing an axially asymmetric Casimir energy - and can even reverse the torque's sign. Focusing on two-dimensional altermagnets, we show that a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the plane - while preserving in-plane rotational symmetry - activates an orientation-dependent vacuum interaction through the combined crystalline symmetry $\mathrm{C_n T}$ inherent to altermagnetic order. The resulting torque emerges continuously and scales quadratically with the magnetic field strength. We further analyze its temperature and distance dependence, revealing scaling behaviors that are qualitatively different from those found in uniaxial bulk materials. Our results identify time-reversal symmetry breaking as a powerful route for engineering both the sign and strength of Casimir torque and establish altermagnets as an exciting platform for exploring phenomena driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Nanoscopy of Excitons in Atomically Thin In-Plane Heterostructures with Nanointerfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomically sharp 2D in-plane heterostructures with nanoscale interfaces provide a powerful platform for tailoring optical and electrical properties at the nanoscale, enabling novel device engineering and the exploration of new physical phenomena. However, direct experimental correlation between local dielectric response and excitonic properties across such interfaces has remained elusive. Here, we probed the nanoscale complex dielectric function and the corresponding localized photoluminescence (PL) modulations in heterostructure domains of lateral monolayer MoxW1-xS2 - WxMo1-xS2, synthesized using a liquid-phase precursor-assisted approach. Near-field nano imaging across the visible-near-infrared range enables real space mapping of sharp amplitude and phase changes at the heterointerface, resolving the local complex dielectric function with nano-meter scale spatial resolution. Excitation energy-dependent nano spectroscopy reveals a reversal of dielectric contrast between Mo-rich and W-rich domains at their respective excitonic resonances, consistent with Lorentz-oscillator fits. Complementary hyperspectral nano-PL mapping resolves the evolution of excitonic emission across the lateral heterointerface, with neutral-exciton intensities varying continuously from W-rich to Mo-rich regions. Effective-medium theory modeling of the imaginary part of the effective dielectric function of the heterostructure as a function of photon energy and Mo filling fraction reproduces the observed excitonic trends, linking the PL evolution to a composition-dependent dielectric response. Together, these results provide direct nanoscale correlation between dielectric and excitonic boundaries in laterally stitched monolayer heterostructures and establish a multimodal near-field spectroscopy framework for probing excitonic phenomena at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Programming Quantum Measurements of Time inside a Complex Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The temporal degree-of-freedom of light is incredibly powerful for modern quantum technologies, enabling large-scale quantum computing architectures and record key-rates in quantum key distribution. However, the generalized measurement of large and complex quantum superpositions of the time-of-arrival of a photon remains a unique experimental challenge. Conventional methods based on unbalanced Franson-type interferometers scale poorly with dimension, requiring multiple cascaded devices and active phase stabilization. In addition, these are limited by construction to a restricted set of phase-only superposition measurements. Here we show how the coupling of spatial and temporal information inside a single multi-mode fiber can be harnessed to program completely generalized measurements for high-dimensional superpositions of photonic time-bin. Using the multi-spectral transmission matrix of the fiber, we find special sets of spatial modes that experience distinct dispersive delays through the fiber. By exciting coherent superpositions of these spatial modes, we engineer the equivalent of large, unbalanced multi-mode interferometers inside the fiber and use them to perform high-quality measurements of arbitrary time-bin superpositions in up to dimension 11. The single fiber functions as a scalable, common-path interferometer for time-bin qudits that significantly eases the experimental overheads of standard approaches based on unbalanced Franson-type interferometers, serving as an essential tool for quantum technologies that harness the temporal properties of light.</description>

      <title>Scaling Enhancement in Distributed Quantum Sensing via Causal Order Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensing networks underpin applications from fundamental physics to real-world engineering. Recently, distributed quantum sensing (DQS) has been investigated to boost the sensing performance, yet current schemes typically rely on entangled probes that are fragile to noise and difficult to scale. Here, we propose a DQS protocol that incorporates a causal-order switch into a cyclic network, enabling a single probe to sequentially query N independent sensors in a coherent superposition or a probabilistic mixture of opposite causal orders. By exploiting the noncommutativity between propagation and sensing processes, our scheme achieves a 1/N^2-scaling precision limit without involving entangled probes. Importantly, our approach utilizes a classical mixture of causal orders rather than a quantum switch, making it more feasible for practical realization. We experimentally implement this scheme for distributed beam tilts sensing in a free-space quantum optical network comprising up to 9 sensors, achieving picoradian-scale precision in estimating tilt angle. Our results demonstrate a robust and scalable DQS protocol that surpasses the conventional 1/N Heisenberg scaling in precision, advancing the practical deployment of quantum sensing networks.</description>

      <title>Light propagation in atomic stratified media: breakdown of the transfer-matrix method at high density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transfer-matrix method is a standard approach to wave propagation in stratified media. With the advent of cold-atom-based quantum and photonic technologies, several experiments and many proposals consider light propagation in one-dimensional optical lattices, using the transfer matrices as the main tool for the simulation. Here, we study the validity of this method by comparing its results to the microscopic coupled-dipole model, which is exact in the linear-optics regime. We show that the transfer-matrix method works very well at low density, even for thin disordered slices, and breaks down at high density because the dipole-dipole interaction induces a collective response from the atoms such that the properties of one layer are influenced by the others. We determine the boundary values of atomic densities for which this method is still applicable for describing experiments. Our findings are relevant for experimental realizations using ultra-cold atoms.</description>

      <title>Resonant Excitation Induced Vibronic Mollow Triplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mollow triplet is the definitive spectral signature of an optically dressed quantum emitter. We predict that for emitters coupled to localized phonons, this signature is not confined to the zero-phonon line. Under a strong resonant drive, we show that Mollow triplets are strikingly replicated on the associated phonon sidebands -a surprising result, given that phonon sidebands are typically viewed as incoherent, inelastic scattering pathways. These vibronic Mollow triplets are a direct fingerprint of dynamically generated dressed states that hybridize the emitter's electronic, photonic, and vibrational degrees of freedom. We develop a scalable analytical formalism to model this effect in complex, multi-mode molecular systems, such as dibenzoterrylene. Our work provides the precise driving conditions for observing these novel spectral features, establishing a new signature of coherence in vibronically coupled systems.</description>

      <title>Purcell enhanced electroluminescence of a unipolar light emitting quantum device at 10 micron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient generation of radiation in the mid- and far- infrared relies primarily on lasers and coherent nonlinear optical phenomena driven by lasers. This wavelength range lacks of luminescent devices because the spontaneous emission rate becomes much longer than the nonradiative energy relaxation processes and therefore emitters have to count on stimulated emission produced by linear or non-linear optical gain. However, spontaneous emission is not a fundamental property of the emitter. By engineering metamaterials composed of arrays of nano-emitters into microcavities coupled to patch antennas, we have demonstrated mid-infrared electroluminescent devices emitting a collimated beam with excellent spatial properties and a factor 100 increase in the collected power, compared to standard devices. Our results illustrate that by reshaping the photonic environment around emitting dipoles, as in the Purcell effect, it is possible to enhance the spontaneous emission and conceive efficient optoelectronic light emitting devices that operate close to the thermodynamical equilibrium as LEDs in the visible range.</description>

      <title>On photonic band gaps in two-dimensional photonic crystal fibres. Analysis in the vicinity of the low-dielectric light line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider `off-axis' electromagnetic wave propagation down the homogeneous direction of a low-loss two-dimensional periodic dielectric (or photonic crystal fibre) near the light line of the low-dielectric material constituent. Numerous physical and numerical experiments demonstrate the presence of photonic band gaps in the vicinity of this `critical' light line. We mathematically analyse the existence of photonic band gaps near the line and characterise them in terms of frequency gaps in the spectrum of the Maxwell equations restricted to the line. We apply the results to both one-dimensional photonic crystal fibres, and a genuinely two-dimensional photonic crystal fibres with `thin' inclusions, namely ``ARROW'' fibres. In the case of ARROW fibres, by an asymptotic analysis, in terms of the small inclusion parameter, we demonstrate the existence of low frequency photonic band gaps. It is important to note that our analysis does not assume any specific ratio between the dielectric contrasts; as a result, moderate or even low contrast models are fully encompassed. Similarly, no limiting assumptions are imposed on the wave propagation constant along the fibre.</description>
