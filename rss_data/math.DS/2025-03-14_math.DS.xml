      <title>Constructive Approaches to QP-Time-Dependent KAM Theory for Lagrangian Tori in Hamiltonian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a KAM theorem in a-posteriori format, using the parameterization method to look invariant tori in non-autonomous Hamiltonian systems with $n$ degrees of freedom that depend periodically or quasi-periodically (QP) on time, with $\ell$ external frequencies. Such a system is described by a Hamiltonian function in the $2n$-dimensional phase space, $\mathscr{M}$, that depends also on $\ell$ angles, $\varphi\in \mathbb{T}^\ell$. We take advantage of the fibbered structure of the extended phase space $\mathscr{M} \times \mathbb{T}^\ell$. As a result of our approach, the parameterization of tori requires the last $\ell$ variables, to be precise $\varphi$, while the first $2n$ components are determined by an invariance equation. This reduction decreases the dimension of the problem where the unknown is a parameterization from $2(n+\ell)$ to $2n$. We employ a quasi-Newton method, in order to prove the KAM theorem. This iterative method begins with an initial parameterization of an approximately invariant torus, meaning it approximately satisfies the invariance equation. The approximation is refined by applying corrections that reduce quadratically the invariance equation error. This process converges to a torus in a complex strip of size $\rho_\infty$, provided suitable Diophantine $(\gamma,\tau)$ conditions and a non-degeneracy condition on the torsion are met. Given the nature of the proof, this provides a numerical method that can be effectively implemented on a computer, the details are given in the companion paper [CHP25]. This approach leverages precision and efficiency to compute invariant tori.</description>

      <title>Shadowing property and entropy on hyperspace of continua induced by Morse gradient system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that Morse-Smale diffeomorpshisms have the shadowing property; however, the question of whether $C(f)$ also has the shadowing property when $f$ is Morse-Smale remains open and has been resolved only in a few specific cases~\cite{AB}. We prove that if $f:M\to M$ is a time-one-map of Morse gradient flow, the induced map $C(f):C(M)\to C(M)$ on the hyperspace of subcontiuna does not have the shadowing property. Besides, we provide a simple criterion for $f$ that implies $C(f)$ has infinite topological entropy.</description>

      <title>Singularity of compound stationary measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the product or convex combination of two Markov operators with equivalent stationary measures need not have a stationary measure from the same measure class. More specifically, we exhibit examples of a hitherto undescribed phenomenon: maximal entropy random walks for which the resulting compound random walks no longer have maximal entropy. The underlying group in these examples is $PSL(2,\mathbb Z)\cong{{\mathbb Z}_2}*{{\mathbb Z}_3}$, and the associated harmonic measures belong to the canonical Minkowski and Denjoy measure classes on the boundary. These examples also demonstrate that a number of other natural families of random walks are not closed under convolutions or convex combinations of step distributions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a compactification of the space of invariant probability measures for a transitive countable Markov shift. We prove that it is affine homeomorphic to the Poulsen simplex. Furthermore, we establish that, depending on a combinatorial property of the shift space, the compactification contains either a single new ergodic measure or a dense set of them. As an application of our results, we prove that the space of ergodic probability measures of a transitive countable Markov shift is homeomorphic to $\ell_2$, extending to the non-compact setting a known result for subshifts of finite type. Additionally, we explore implications for thermodynamic formalism, including a version of the dual variational principle for transitive countable Markov shifts with uniformly continuous potentials.</description>

      <title>The Computation of the Disguised Toric Locus of Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical models of reaction networks can exhibit very complex dynamics, including multistability, oscillations, and chaotic dynamics. On the other hand, under some additional assumptions on the network or on parameter values, these models may actually be toric dynamical systems, which have remarkably stable dynamics. The concept of disguised toric dynamical system" was introduced in order to describe the phenomenon where a reaction network generates toric dynamics without actually being toric; such systems enjoy all the stability properties of toric dynamical systems but with much fewer restrictions on the networks and parameter values. The \emph{disguised toric locus} is the set of parameter values for which the corresponding dynamical system is a disguised toric system. Here we focus on providing a generic and efficient method for computing the dimension of the disguised toric locus of reaction networks. Additionally, we illustrate our approach by applying it to some specific models of biological interaction networks, including Brusselator-type networks, Thomas-type networks, and circadian clock networks.</description>

      <title>Threshold dynamics in a within host infection model with Crowley Martin functional response considering periodic effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mathematical model for within host viral infections that incorporates the Crowley Martin functional response, focusing on the dynamics influenced by periodic effects. This study establishes key properties of the model, including the existence, uniqueness, positivity, and boundedness of periodic orbits within the non-autonomous system. We demonstrate that the global dynamics are governed by the basic reproduction number, denoted as $\mathcal{R}_0$, which is calculated using the spectral radius of an integral operator. Our findings reveal that $\mathcal{R}_0$ serves as a threshold parameter: when $\mathcal{R}_0 &lt; 1$, the virus-free periodic solution is globally asymptotically stable, indicating that the infection will die out. Conversely, if $\mathcal{R}_0 &gt; 1$, at least one positive periodic solution exists, and the disease persists uniformly, with trajectories converging to a limit cycle. Additionally, we provide numerical simulations that support and illustrate our theoretical results, enhancing the understanding of threshold dynamics in within-host infection models.</description>

      <title>Zeta function and entropy for non-archimedean subhyperbolic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a complete non-archimedean field equipped with a discrete valuation. We establish the rationality of the Artin-Mazur zeta function on the Julia set for any subhyperbolic rational map defined over $K$ with a compact Julia set. Furthermore, we conclude that the topological entropy on the Julia set of such a map is given by the logarithm of a weak Perron number. Conversely, we construct a (sub)hyperbolic rational map defined over $K$ with compact Julia set whose topological entropy on the Julia set equals the logarithm of a given weak Perron number. This extends Thurston's work on the entropy for postcritically finite interval self-maps to the non-Archimedean setting.</description>

      <title>Periodic points in the $\beta$-transformation with a hole at 0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $\beta\in(1,2]$ let $T_\beta: [0,1)\to[0,1); x\mapsto \beta x\pmod 1$. In this paper we study the periodic points in the open dynamical system $([0,1), T_\beta)$ with a hole $[0,t)$. For $p\in\mathbb{N}$ we characterize the largest $t$, denoted by $S_\beta(p)$, in which the survivor set $K_\beta(t)$ has a periodic point of smallest period $p$. More precisely, we give precise formulae for this critical value $S_\beta(p)$ when $\beta=2$, $\beta=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ and $\beta$ being the tribonacci number. We show that for $\beta=2$ the critical value $S_2(p)$ converges to $1/2$ as $p\to \infty$. When $\beta=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$, the critical value $S_\beta(p)\to \frac{1}{\beta^3-\beta}$. While $\beta$ is the tribinacci number, the critical value $S_\beta(p)\to \frac{\beta^{2}+1}{\beta^4-\beta}$.</description>

      <title>Fractal Structure of Parametric Cantor Sets With a Common Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $\lambda&gt;0$, let $E_{\lambda}$ be the self-similar set generated by the iterated function system (IFS) $\left \{ \frac{x}{3}, \frac{x+\lambda}{3} \right \}$. In this paper we study the structure of parameters $\lambda$ in which $E_\lambda$ contains a common point. $E_{\lambda}$. More precisely, for a given point $x&gt;0$ we consider the topology of the parameter set $\Lambda \left ( x \right ) =\left \{ \lambda &gt;0:x\in E_{\lambda } \right \}$. We show that $\Lambda \left ( x \right )$ is a Lebesgue null set contains neither interior points nor isolated points, and the Hausdorff dimension of $\Lambda \left ( x \right ) $ is $ \log 2/ \log 3 $. Furthermore, we consider the set $\Lambda_{\mathrm {not}}(x)$ which consists of all parameters $\lambda$ that the digit frequency of $x$ in base $\lambda$ does not exist. We also consider the set $\Lambda_p(x)$ consisting of all $\lambda$ in which the digit frequency of $2$ in the base $\lambda$ expansion of $x$ is $p$. We show that the Hausdorff dimension of $ \Lambda _{\mathrm {not}} \left( x \right) $ is $\log2 /\log 3$ and the lower bound Hausdorff dimension of $ \Lambda _{p} \left( x \right) $ is $-p\log_3 p-(1-p)\log_3(1-p)$.</description>

      <title>On Dirichlet non-improvable numbers and shrinking target problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In one-dimensional Diophantine approximation, the Diophantine properties of a real number are characterized by its partial quotients, especially the growth of its large partial quotients. Notably, Kleinbock and Wadleigh [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 2018] made a seminal contribution by linking the improvability of Dirichlet's theorem to the growth of the product of consecutive partial quotients. In this paper, we extend the concept of Dirichlet non-improvable sets within the framework of shrinking target problems. Specifically, consider the dynamical system $([0,1), T)$ of continued fractions. Let $\{z_n\}_{n \ge 1}$ be a sequence of real numbers in $[0,1]$ and let $B &gt; 1$. We determine the Hausdorff dimension of the following set:
  \[
  \begin{split}
  \{x\in[0,1):|T^nx-z_n||T^{n+1}x-Tz_n|&lt;B^{-n}\text{ infinitely often}\}.
  \end{split}

      <title>Cyclicity of sliding cycles with singularities of regularized piecewise smooth visible-invisible two-folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the cyclicity of sliding cycles for regularized piecewise smooth visible-invisible two-folds, in the presence of singularities of the Filippov sliding vector field located away from two-folds. We obtain a slow-fast system after cylindrical blow-up and use a well-known connection between the divergence integral along orbits and transition maps for vector fields. Since properties of the divergence integral depend on the location and multiplicity of singularities, we divide the sliding cycles into different classes, which can then produce different types of cyclicity results. As an example, we apply our results to regularized piecewise linear systems.</description>

      <title>Elementary fractal geometry. 6. The dynamical interior of self-similar sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the one hand, the dynamical interior of a self-similar set with open set condition is the complement of the dynamical boundary. On the other hand, the dynamical interior is the recurrent set of the magnification flow. For a finite type self-similar set, both boundary and interior are described by finite automata. The neighbor graph defines the boundary. The neighborhood graph, based on work by Thurston, Lalley, Ngai and Wang, defines the interior. If local views are considered up to similarity, the interior obtains a discrete manifold structure, and the magnification flow is discretized by a Markov chain. This leads to new methods for the visualization and description of finite type attractors.</description>

      <title>Optimizing AUV speed dynamics with a data-driven Koopman operator approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) play an essential role in modern ocean exploration, and their speed control systems are fundamental
  to their efficient operation. Like many other robotic systems, AUVs exhibit multivariable nonlinear dynamics and face various constraints,
  including state limitations, input constraints, and constraints on the increment input, making controller design challenging
  and requiring significant effort and time. This paper addresses these challenges by employing a data-driven Koopman operator theory combined
  with Model Predictive Control (MPC), which takes into account the aforementioned constraints. The proposed approach not only ensures
  the performance of the AUV under state and input limitations but also considers the variation in incremental input to prevent
  rapid and potentially damaging changes to the vehicle's operation. Additionally, we develop a platform based on ROS2 and Gazebo
  to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, providing new control strategies for underwater vehicles against the complex and dynamic nature of underwater environments.</description>

      <title>PI-Controlled Variable Time-Step Power System Simulation Using an Adaptive Order Differential Transformation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic simulation plays a crucial role in power system transient stability analysis, but traditional numerical integration-based methods are time-consuming due to the small time step sizes. Other semi-analytical solution methods, such as the Differential Transformation method, often struggle to select proper orders and steps, leading to slow performance and numerical instability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel adaptive dynamic simulation approach for power system transient
  stability analysis. The approach adds feedback control and optimization to selecting the step and order, utilizing the Differential Transformation method and a proportional-integral control strategy to control truncation errors. Order selection is formulated as an optimization problem resulting in a variable-step-optimal-order method that achieves significantly larger time step sizes without violating numerical stability. It is applied to three systems: the IEEE 9-bus, 3-generator system, IEEE 39-bus, 10-generator system, and a Polish 2383-bus, 327-generator system, promising computational efficiency and numerical robustness for large-scale power system is demonstrated in comprehensive case studies.</description>

Abstract: In studies on complex network systems using graph theory, eigen-analysis is typically performed on an undirected graph model of the network. However, when analyzing cascading failures in a power system, the interactions among failures suggest the need for a directed graph beyond the topology of the power system to model directions of failure propagation. To accurately quantify failure interactions for effective mitigation strategies, this paper proposes a stochastic interaction graph model and associated eigen-analysis. Different types of modes on failure propagations are defined and characterized by the eigenvalues of a stochastic interaction matrix, whose absolute values are unity, zero, or in between. Finding and interpreting these modes helps identify the probable patterns of failure propagation, either local or widespread, and the participating components based on eigenvectors. Then, by lowering the failure probabilities of critical components highly participating in a mode of widespread failures, cascading can be mitigated. The validity of the proposed stochastic interaction graph model, eigen-analysis and the resulting mitigation strategies is demonstrated using simulated cascading failure data on an NPCC 140-bus system.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Q-Learning Dynamics in Random Networks: Convergence due to Exploration and Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond specific settings, many multi-agent learning algorithms fail to converge to an equilibrium solution, and instead display complex, non-stationary behaviours such as recurrent or chaotic orbits. In fact, recent literature suggests that such complex behaviours are likely to occur when the number of agents increases. In this paper, we study Q-learning dynamics in network polymatrix games where the network structure is drawn from classical random graph models. In particular, we focus on the Erdos-Renyi model, a well-studied model for social networks, and the Stochastic Block model, which generalizes the above by accounting for community structures within the network. In each setting, we establish sufficient conditions under which the agents' joint strategies converge to a unique equilibrium. We investigate how this condition depends on the exploration rates, payoff matrices and, crucially, the sparsity of the network. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through numerical simulations and demonstrate that convergence can be reliably achieved in many-agent systems, provided network sparsity is controlled.</description>

      <title>The multifractal nature of a parametrized family of von Koch functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a famous paper published in 1904, Helge von Koch introduced the curve that still serves nowadays as an iconic representation of fractal shapes. In fact, von Koch's main goal was the construction of a continuous but nowhere differentiable function, very similar to the snowflake, using elementary geometric procedures, and not analytical formulae. We prove that a parametrized family of functions (including and) generalizing von Koch's example enjoys a rich multifractal behavior, thus enriching the class of historical mathematical objects having surprising regularity properties. The analysis relies on the study of the orbits of an underlying dynamical system and on the introduction of self-similar measures and non-trivial iterated functions systems adapted to the problem.</description>

      <title>Once bitten, twice shy: A modeling framework for incorporating heterogeneous mosquito biting into transmission models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The potential for outbreaks of mosquito-borne disease is linked to the frequency at which mosquitoes feed on blood, also known as the biting rate. But standard models of mosquito-borne disease transmission inherently assume that mosquitoes bite only once per reproductive cycle, an assumption commonly violated in nature. Drivers of multiple biting, like host defensive behaviors or climate factors, also affect the mosquito gonotrophic cycle duration, a quantity used to estimate the biting rate. Here, we present a novel framework for incorporating complex mosquito biting behaviors into transmission models. This framework accounts for heterogeneity in and linkages between biting rates and multiple biting. We provide formulas for the basic offspring number, $\mathcal{N}_0$, and basic reproduction number, $\mathcal{R}_0$, threshold measures for mosquito population and pathogen transmission persistence, respectively. To exhibit its flexibility, we expand on models derived from the framework that arise from empirical, phenomenological, or mechanistic perspectives. Using the GCD as a standard quantity to make comparisons among the models, we show that assumptions about the biting process affect the relationship between GCD and $\mathcal{R}_0$. While under standard assumptions, $\mathcal{R}_0$ is an increasing linear function of the inverse of the GCD, other models of the biting process exhibit saturating or concave relationships. Through sensitivity analysis of the mechanistic model, we determine that parameters related to probing and ingesting success are the most important targets for disease control. This work highlights the importance of incorporating the behavioral dynamics of mosquitoes into transmission models and provides methods for evaluating how individual-level interventions against mosquito biting scale up to determine population-level mosquito-borne disease risk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Feldman-Katok pseudometric (FK-pseudometric for short) for flows. We then provide a characterization of zero entropy loosely Bernoulli measures for continuous flows via the FK-pseudometric extending the result known for discrete-time dynamical systems. We also provide a purely topological characterization of uniquely ergodic continuous flows whose unique invariant measure is zero entropy loosely Bernoulli.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider continuous maps of the interval which preserve the Lebesgue measure.  Except for the identity map or $1 - \id$ all such maps have topological entropy at least $\log2/2$ and generically they have infinite topological entropy.  In this article we show that thegeneric map has zero measure-theoreticentropy. This implies that there are dramatic differences inthe topological versus measure-theoretic behavior both for injectivity  as well as for the structure of thelevel sets of generic maps. As a consequence we get a surprising corollary for a family of planar attractors homeomorphic to the pseudo-arcs.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Rigid Motions and Relative Equilibria in the N-Body Problem on the Two-Sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between rigid motions and relative equilibria in the N-body problem on the two-dimensional sphere, S2. We prove that any rigid motion of the N-body system on S2 must be a relative equilibrium. Our approach extends the classical study of rigid body dynamics by Euler and utilizes a rotating frame attached to the particles to derive the corresponding equations of motion. We further show that our results can be extended to the N-body gravitational system in R3. The results are oriented to a broader understanding of the dynamics of N-body systems on curved surfaces.</description>

      <title>On the structure of the Birkhoff-irregular set for subshifts of finite type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the set of irregular points for topologically mixing subshifts of finite type. It is well known that despite the irregular set having zero measure for every invariant measure, it has full topological entropy and full Hausdorff dimension. We establish that for these systems the irregular set is not only abundant in terms of its dimensional properties, but also contains uncountably many pairwise disjoint invariant subsets, each of them dense and carrying full topological entropy and Hausdorff dimension. This results deepens our understanding of the complexity of irregular points in dynamical systems, highlighting their intricate structure and suggesting avenues for further explorations in related areas.</description>

      <title>Baby Mandelbrot sets and Spines in some one-dimensional subspaces of the parameter space for generalized McMullen Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the family of complex rational functions of the form $R_{n,c,a}(z) = z^n + \dfrac{a}{z^n}+c$,
  known as ``Generalized McMullen maps'', for $a\neq 0$ and $n \geq 3$ fixed, we study the boundedness locus in some one-dimensional slices of the $(a,c)$-parameter space, by fixing a parameter or imposing a relation.
  First, if we fix $c$ with $|c|\geq 6$ while allowing $a$ to vary, assuming a modest lower bound on $n$ in terms of $|c|$, we establish the location in the $a$-plane of $n$ ``baby" Mandelbrot sets, that is, homeomorphic copies of the original Mandelbrot set. We use polynomial-like maps, introduced by Douady and Hubbard and applied for the subfamily $R_{n,a,0}$ by Devaney.
  Second, for slices in which $c=ta$, we again observe what look like baby Mandelbrot sets within these slices, and begin the study of this subfamily by establishing a neighborhood containing the boundedness locus.</description>

      <title>Rigorous enclosure of Lyapunov exponents of stochastic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a powerful and general method to provide rigorous and accurate upper and lower bounds for Lyapunov exponents of stochastic flows. Our approach is based on computer-assisted tools, the adjoint method and established results on the ergodicity of diffusion processes. We do not require any structural assumptions on the stochastic system, work under mild hypoellipticity conditions and outside of perturbative regimes. Therefore, our method allows for the treatment of systems that were so far out of reach from existing mathematical tools. We demonstrate our method to exhibit the chaotic nature of three different systems. Finally, we show the robustness of our approach by combining it with continuation methods to produce bounds on Lyapunov exponents over large parameter regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider domino tilings of 3D cubiculated regions. The tilings have two invariants, flux and twist, often integer-valued, which are given in purely combinatorial terms. These invariants allow one to classify the tilings with respect to certain elementary moves, flips and trits. In this paper we present a construction associating a divergence-free vector field $\xi_t$ to any domino tiling $t$, such that the flux of the tiling $t$ can be interpreted as the (relative) rotation class of the field $\xi_t$, while the twist of $t$ is proved to be the relative helicity of the field $\xi_t$.</description>

      <title>Coalescing Force of Group Pressure: Consensus in Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work extends the recent opinion dynamics model from Cheng et al., emphasizing the role of group pressure in consensus formation. We generalize the findings to incorporate social influence algorithms with general time-varying, opinion-dependent weights and multidimensional opinions, beyond bounded confidence dynamics. We demonstrate that, with uniformly positive conformity levels, group pressure consistently drives consensus and provide a tighter estimate for the convergence rate. Unlike previous models, the common public opinion in our framework can assume arbitrary forms within the convex hull of current opinions, offering flexibility applicable to real-world scenarios such as opinion polls with random participant selection. This analysis provides deeper insights into how group pressure mechanisms foster consensus under diverse conditions.</description>
