      <title>A Decoupled LOB Representation Framework for Multilevel Manipulation Detection with Supervised Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial markets are critical to global economic stability, yet trade-based manipulation (TBM) often undermines their fairness. Spoofing, a particularly deceptive TBM strategy, exhibits multilevel anomaly patterns that have not been adequately modeled. These patterns are usually concealed within the rich, hierarchical information of the Limit Order Book (LOB), which is challenging to leverage due to high dimensionality and noise. To address this, we propose a representation learning framework combining a cascaded LOB representation pipeline with supervised contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently improves detection performance across diverse models, with Transformer-based architectures achieving state-of-the-art results. In addition, we conduct systematic analyses and ablation studies to investigate multilevel anomalies and the contributions of key components, offering broader insights into representation learning and anomaly detection for complex sequential data. Our code will be released later at this URL.</description>

      <title>FinReflectKG: Agentic Construction and Evaluation of Financial Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The financial domain poses unique challenges for knowledge graph (KG) construction at scale due to the complexity and regulatory nature of financial documents. Despite the critical importance of structured financial knowledge, the field lacks large-scale, open-source datasets capturing rich semantic relationships from corporate disclosures. We introduce an open-source, large-scale financial knowledge graph dataset built from the latest annual SEC 10-K filings of all S and P 100 companies - a comprehensive resource designed to catalyze research in financial AI. We propose a robust and generalizable knowledge graph (KG) construction framework that integrates intelligent document parsing, table-aware chunking, and schema-guided iterative extraction with a reflection-driven feedback loop. Our system incorporates a comprehensive evaluation pipeline, combining rule-based checks, statistical validation, and LLM-as-a-Judge assessments to holistically measure extraction quality. We support three extraction modes - single-pass, multi-pass, and reflection-agent-based - allowing flexible trade-offs between efficiency, accuracy, and reliability based on user requirements. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the reflection-agent-based mode consistently achieves the best balance, attaining a 64.8 percent compliance score against all rule-based policies (CheckRules) and outperforming baseline methods (single-pass and multi-pass) across key metrics such as precision, comprehensiveness, and relevance in LLM-guided evaluations.</description>

      <title>Sizing the Risk: Kelly, VIX, and Hybrid Approaches in Put-Writing on Index Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines systematic put-writing strategies applied to S&amp;P 500 Index options, with a focus on position sizing as a key determinant of long-term performance. Despite the well-documented volatility risk premium, where implied volatility exceeds realized volatility, the practical implementation of short-dated volatility-selling strategies remains underdeveloped in the literature. This study evaluates three position sizing approaches: the Kelly criterion, VIX-based volatility regime scaling, and a novel hybrid method combining both. Using SPXW options with expirations from 0 to 5 days, the analysis explores a broad design space, including moneyness levels, volatility estimators, and memory horizons. Results show that ultra-short-dated, far out-of-the-money options deliver superior risk-adjusted returns. The hybrid sizing method consistently balances return generation with robust drawdown control, particularly under low-volatility conditions such as those seen in 2024. The study offers new insights into volatility harvesting, introducing a dynamic sizing framework that adapts to shifting market regimes. It also contributes practical guidance for constructing short-dated option strategies that are robust across market environments. These findings have direct applications for institutional investors seeking to enhance portfolio efficiency through systematic exposure to volatility premia.</description>

      <title>Risk-Neutral Pricing of Random-Expiry Options Using Trinomial Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random-expiry options are nontraditional derivative contracts that may expire early based on a random event. We develop a methodology for pricing these options using a trinomial tree, where the middle path is interpreted as early expiry. We establish that this approach is free of arbitrage, derive its continuous-time limit, and show how it may be implemented numerically in an efficient manner.</description>

      <title>Fast reliable pricing and calibration of the rough Heston model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper is an extended and modified version of the preprint S.Boyarchenko and S.Levendorski\u{i} ``Correct implied volatility shapes and reliable pricing in the rough Heston model". We combine a modification of the Adams method with the SINH-acceleration method S.Boyarchenko and S.Levendorskii (IJTAF 2019, v.22) of Fourier inversion (iFT) to price vanilla options under the rough Heston model. For moderate or long maturities and strikes near spot, thousands of prices are computed in several milliseconds (ms) in Matlab on a Mac with moderate specs, with relative errors $\lesssim 10^{-4}$. Even for options close to expiry and far-OTM, the pricing takes a few tens or hundreds of ms. We show that, for the calibrated parameters in El Euch and Rosenbaum (Math.Finance 2019, v.29), the model implied vol surface is much flatter and fits the market data poorly; thus the calibration in op.cit. is a case of ``ghost calibration'' (M.Boyarchenko and S.Levendorski\u{i}, Quant. Finance 2015, v.15): numerical error and model specification error offset each other, creating an apparently good fit that vanishes when a more accurate pricer is used. We explain how such errors arise in popular iFT implementations that use fixed numerical parameters, yielding spurious smiles/skews, and provide numerical evidence that SINH acceleration is faster and more accurate than competing methods. Robust error control is ensured by a general Conformal Bootstrap principle that we formulate; the principle is applicable to many Fourier-pricing methods. We outline how this principle and our method enable accurate calibration procedures that are hundreds of times faster than approaches commonly used in the industry.
