      <title>$^{11}$B states above the $\alpha$-decay threshold studied via $^{10}$B$(d,p){}^{11}$B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resonance region of $^{11}$B covering excitation energies from 8.4 MeV to 13.6 MeV was investigated with the $(d,p)$ reaction performed on an enriched $^{10}$B target at the Florida State University Super-Enge Split-Pole Spectrograph of the John D. Fox Superconducting Linear Accelerator Laboratory. Complementary measurements were performed with a target enriched in $^{11}$B to identify possible $^{12}$B contaminants in the $(d,p)$ reaction. Four strongly populated $^{11}$B states were observed above the $\alpha$-decay threshold. Angular distributions were measured and compared to DWBA calculations to extract angular momentum transfers and $^{10}\mathrm{B}\left(3^+\right)+n$ spectroscopic factors. The recently observed and heavily discussed resonance at 11.4 MeV in $^{11}$B was not observed in this work. This result is consistent with the interpretation that it is predominantly a $^{10}\mathrm{Be}\left(0^+\right)+p$ resonance with a possible additional $^{7}\mathrm{Li}+\alpha$ contribution. The predicted $^{10}\mathrm{B}\left(3^+\right)+n$ resonance at 11.6 MeV, analogous to the 11.4-MeV proton resonance, was not observed either. Upper limits for the $^{10}\mathrm{B}\left(3^+\right)+n$ spectroscopic factors of the 11.4-MeV and 11.6-MeV states were determined. In addition, supporting configuration interaction shell model calculations with the effective WBP interaction are presented.</description>

      <title>Proton removal from $^{73,75}$Br to $^{72,74}$Se at intermediate energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report new experimental data for excited states of $^{72,74}$Se obtained from proton removal from $^{73,75}$Br secondary beams on a proton target. The experiments were performed with the Ursinus-NSCL Liquid Hydrogen Target and the combined GRETINA+S800 setup at the Coupled Cyclotron Facility of the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University. Within uncertainties, the inclusive cross sections for proton removal from $^{73,75}$Br on a proton target are identical suggesting that the same single-particle orbitals contribute to the proton-removal reaction. In addition, details of the partial cross section fragmentation are discussed. The data might suggest that $l = 1, 2, 3$, and 4 angular momentum transfers are important to understand the population of excited states of $^{72,74}$Se in proton removal. Available data for excited states of $^{74}$Ge populated through the $^{75}$As$(d,{}^{3}{\mathrm{He}}){}^{74}$Ge proton-removal reaction in normal kinematics suggest indeed that the $fp$ and $sd$ shell as well as the $1g_{9/2}$ orbital contribute. A comparison to data available for odd-$A$ nuclei supports that the bulk of the spectroscopic strengths could be found at lower energies in the even-even Se isotopes than in, for instance, the even-even Ge isotopes. In addition, the population of high-$J$ states seems to indicate that multi-step processes contribute to proton-removal reactions at intermediate energies in these collective nuclei.</description>

      <title>Amplitude Analysis of $\omega\pi^0$ Photoproduction at GlueX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excited meson states can often lie hidden within mass spectra beneath more dominant resonances, making it difficult to extract their physical properties. We can unveil these states through amplitude analysis, which disentangles the overlapping states via fits to their unique production and decay angular distributions. Understanding the light-meson spectrum is essential for confirming Lattice QCD predictions, especially in regards to the search for possible hybrid mesons. The Gluonic Excitation (GlueX) experiment at Jefferson Lab aids this search by studying the production of excited light mesons in $\gamma p$ interactions in the 8.2 - 8.8 GeV photon-beam energy range. We show in these proceedings preliminary results of an amplitude analysis of a large $\omega\pi^0$ dataset, concentrating on measuring the interference between the $b_1(1235)$ and an excited $J^{PC}=1^{--}$ vector resonance.</description>

      <title>Study of the $in ^{34}$Ar($\alpha,p$)$^{37}$K reaction rate via proton scattering on $^{37}$K, and its impact on properties of modeled X-Ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Type I X-Ray bursts (XRBs) are energetic stellar explosions that occur on the surface of a neutron star in an accreting binary system with a low-mass H/He-rich companion. The rate of the $^{34}$Ar($\alpha,p$)$^{37}$K reaction may influence features of the light curve that results from the underlying thermonuclear runaway, as shown in recent XRB stellar modelling studies.
  Purpose: In order to reduce the uncertainty of the rate of this reaction, properties of resonances in the compound nucleus $^{38}$Ca, such as resonance energies, spins, and particle widths, must be well constrained.
  Method: This work discusses a study of resonances in the $^{38}$Ca compound nucleus produced in the $^{34}$Ar($\alpha,p$) reaction. The experiment was performed at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, with the ReA3 facility by measuring proton scattering using an unstable $^{37}$K beam. The kinematics were designed specifically to identify and characterize resonances in the Gamow energy window for the temperature regime relevant to XRBs.
  Results: The spins and proton widths of newly identified and previously known states in $^{38}$Ca in the energy region of interest for the $^{34}$Ar($\alpha,p$)$^{37}$K reaction have been constrained through an R-Matrix analysis of the scattering data.
  Conclusions: Using these constraints, a newly estimated rate is applied to an XRB model built using Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), to examine its impact on observables, including the light curve. It is found that the newly determined reaction rate does not substantially affect the features of the light curve.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Dependence of Beam Normal Single Spin Asymmetry in Elastic Scattering from Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to measure the beam normal single spin asymmetry in elastic scattering of transversely polarized electron from target nuclei with 12 $\leq Z \leq$ 90 at Q$^2$ = 0.0092 GeV$^2$ to study its nuclear dependence. While the theoretical calculations based on two-photon exchange suggest no nuclear dependence at this kinematics, the results of 208Pb from Jefferson Lab show a striking disagreement from both theoretical predictions and light nuclei measurements. The proposed measurements will provide new data for intermediate to heavy nuclei where no data exists for $Z \geq$ 20 in the kinematics of previous high-energy experiments. It will allow one to investigate the missing contributions that are not accounted in the current theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Fragmentation Functions Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the notion of nuclear parton-to-pion fragmentation functions at next-to-leading order accuracy as an effective description of hadroproduction in nuclear environments such as in semi-inclusive lepton-nucleus deep-inelastic scattering and in single inclusive proton-nucleus collisions. We assess their viability in the face of very precise data collected for the latter at the CERN-LHC over the past decade as well as recent measurements of the former carried out by the CLAS experiment at JLab.</description>

      <title>Imaging the Femtoscopic Freeze-out Source in Heavy Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By combining the femtoscopic interferometry and the optical deblurring algorithm, we implement a novel method to image the source formed in HICs, while the interaction strength between the particle pair can be simultaneously determined. The spatial distribution of the emission source has been reconstructed for protons ($p$) and antiprotons ($\bar{p}$) from the respective $pp$ and $\bar{p}\bar{p}$ correlation functions in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{S_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV. Within experimental uncertainties, protons and antiprotons share the same freeze-out distribution showing higher density in the center compared to the widely assumed Gaussian shape. The results evidence the matter-antimatter symmetry in coordinate space at the moment of freeze-out before the nucleons are fully randomized in the collisions.</description>

      <title>The hyperfine anomaly in mercury and test of the Moskowitz-Lombardi rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Moskowitz-Lombardi rule gives a simple relation between the magnetic moment of an atomic nucleus and the effect of its radial distribution on the hyperfine structure - the magnetic hyperfine anomaly or "Bohr-Weisskopf" effect. It was originally formulated for mercury, for which experimental data for nuclear magnetic moments and hyperfine constants were available for a number of isotopes. While the relation for the differential effect between isotopes may be completely determined experimentally, the value for the additive constant that is needed to give the Bohr-Weisskopf (BW) effect for a single isotope has remained untested. In this work, we determine the BW effect in singly-ionized and neutral mercury from experimental muonic Hg-199 data together with our atomic calculations. We check this result by directly extracting the BW effect from the hyperfine constant for singly-ionized Hg-199 using state-of-the-art atomic many-body calculations. From this we deduce an empirical value for the additive constant in the Moskowitz-Lombardi rule, which differs significantly from the values advocated previously.</description>

      <title>Studying charm hadronisation into baryons with azimuthal correlations of $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}$ with charged particles in pp collisions at $\mathbf{\sqrt{s} = 13}$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution of angular correlations between prompt charm hadrons and primary charged particles in pp collisions is sensitive to the charm-quark hadronisation process. In this letter, charm-baryon correlations are measured for the first time by studying the azimuthal-angle difference between charged particles and prompt $\Lambda_{\rm c}^+$ baryons produced in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, with the ALICE detector. $\Lambda_{\rm c}^+$ baryons are reconstructed at midrapidity ($|y| &lt; 0.5$) in the transverse-momentum interval $3 &lt; p_{\rm T} &lt; 16$ GeV/$c$, and correlated with charged particles with $p_{\rm T} &gt; 0.3$ GeV/$c$ and pseudorapidity $|\eta| &lt; 0.8$. For $3 &lt; p_{\rm T}^{\Lambda_{\rm c}^+,{\rm D}} &lt; 5$ GeV/$c$, the comparison with published measurements of D-meson and charged-particle correlations in the same collision system hints at a larger number of low-momentum particles associated with $\Lambda_{\rm c}^+$-baryon triggers than with D-meson triggers, both in the collinear and opposite directions with respect to the trigger particle. These differences can be quantified by the comparison of the properties of the near- and away-side correlation peaks, and are not reproduced by predictions of various Monte Carlo event generators, generally underpredicting the associated particle yields at $p_{\rm T}^{\rm assoc} &lt; 1$ GeV/$c$. This tension between $\Lambda_{\rm c}^+$-baryon and D-meson associated peak yields could suggest a modified fragmentation of the charm quark, or a different hadronisation process, when a charm baryon is produced in the final state.</description>

      <title>Revealing the nature of yrast states in neutron-rich polonium isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03839v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polonium isotopes having two protons above the shell closure at $Z=82$ show a wide variety of low-lying high-spin isomeric states across the whole chain. The structure of neutron-deficient isotopes up to $^{210}$Po ($N=126$) is well established as they are easily produced through various methods. However, there is not much information available for the neutron-rich counterparts for which only selective techniques can be used for their production. We report on the first fast-timing measurements of yrast states up to the 8$^+$ level in $^{214,216,218}$Po isotopes produced in the $\beta^-$ decay of $^{214,216,218}$Bi at ISOLDE, CERN. In particular, our new half-life value of 607(14) ps for the 8$_1^+$ state in $^{214}$Po is nearly 20 times shorter than the one available in literature and comparable with the newly measured half-lives of 409(16) and 628(25) ps for the corresponding 8$_1^+$ states in $^{216,218}$Po, respectively. The measured $B(E2;8_1^+ \to 6_1^+)$ transition probability values follow an increasing trend relative to isotope mass, reaching a maximum for $^{216}$Po. The increase contradicts the previous claims of isomerism for the $8^+$ yrast states in neutron-rich $^{214}$Po and beyond. Together with the other measured yrast transitions, the $B(E2)$ values provide a crucial test of the different theoretical approaches describing the underlying configurations of the yrast band. The new experimental results are compared to shell-model calculations using the KHPE and H208 effective interactions and their pairing modified versions, showing an increase in configuration mixing when moving towards the heavier isotopes.</description>

      <title>Neutron skin impurity from Coulomb core polarization in $^{208}\text{Pb}$: Insights from PREX-II and validation via the $(^{3}\text{He}, t)$ isobaric analog state reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I investigate the effect of Coulomb core-polarization in $^{208}\text{Pb}$, highlighting its impact on uncertainties in neutron distribution measurements due to the discrepancy between neutron excess and neutron skin regions at the surface. This effect is validated using the $(^{3}\text{He}, t)$ isobaric analog state (IAS) reaction at 420 MeV. My findings reveal that the Coulomb boundary radius, where core-polarization becomes negligible, is critical for accurately probing the neutron skin region in the target nucleus. Consequently, I propose extending the $^{208}\text{Pb}(^{3}\text{He}, t)$IAS reaction experiment conducted by Zegers et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 202501 (2007)] to measure cross sections up to 3$^\circ$ angles to more precisely determine the neutron skin thickness in $^{208}\text{Pb}$ from theoretical reaction analysis. Additionally, I observe that, under the assumption of a large neutron skin in $^{208}\text{Pb}$, as suggested by the PREX-II result, the core-polarization effect introduces impurity into the neutron skin region.</description>

Initially, we confine light atoms within the laser pulse envelope due to longitudinal polarization forces, allowing them to acquire kinetic energies of several GeV. Subsequently, an external electric field separates the nuclei at the cathode, concentrating helium nuclei in a small area. The kinetic energy of the 1.88 GeV impacts, exceeding the alpha particle binding energy (28 MeV) by two orders of magnitude, induces powerful gamma radiation and neutron emission from decay processes. This experiment marks a demonstration of a laser-induced decay method for helium nuclei for the first time. Moreover, helium isotopes or deuterium nuclei trapped on the cathode show significantly reduced Coulomb repulsion, enabling subsequent nuclear fusion reactions and substantial nuclear energy release.</description>

Abstract: We have developed a neutrino detector with threshold energies from ~0.115 to 105 MeV in a clean detection mode almost completely void of accidental backgrounds. It was initially developed for the NASA $\nu$SOL project to put a solar neutrino detector very close to the Sun with 1,000 to 10,000 times higher solar neutrino flux than on Earth. Similar interactions have been found for anti-neutrinos, which were initially intended for Beta decay neutrinos from reactors, geological sources, or for nuclear security applications. These techniques work at the 1 to 100 MeV region for neutrinos from the ORNL Spallation Neutron Source or low energy accelerator neutrino and anti-neutrino production targets less than $\sim$100 MeV. The identification process is clean, with a double pulse detection signature within a time window between the first interaction producing the conversion electron or positron and the secondary gamma emission 100 ns to ~1 $\mu$s, which removes most accidental backgrounds. These new modes for neutrino and anti-neutrino detection of low energy neutrinos and anti-neutrinos could allow improvements to neutrino interaction measurements from an accelerator beam on a target.</description>
