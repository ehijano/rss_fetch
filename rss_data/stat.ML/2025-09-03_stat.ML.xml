      <title>Simulation-based inference of yeast centromeres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chromatin folding and the spatial arrangement of chromosomes in the cell play a crucial role in DNA replication and genes expression. An improper chromatin folding could lead to malfunctions and, over time, diseases. For eukaryotes, centromeres are essential for proper chromosome segregation and folding. Despite extensive research using de novo sequencing of genomes and annotation analysis, centromere locations in yeasts remain difficult to infer and are still unknown in most species. Recently, genome-wide chromosome conformation capture coupled with next-generation sequencing (Hi-C) has become one of the leading methods to investigate chromosome structures. Some recent studies have used Hi-C data to give a point estimate of each centromere, but those approaches highly rely on a good pre-localization. Here, we present a novel approach that infers in a stochastic manner the locations of all centromeres in budding yeast based on both the experimental Hi-C map and simulated contact maps.</description>

      <title>Assessing One-Dimensional Cluster Stability by Extreme-Point Trimming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a probabilistic method for assessing the tail behavior and geometric stability of one-dimensional n i.i.d. samples by tracking how their span contracts when the most extreme points are trimmed. Central to our approach is the diameter-shrinkage ratio, that quantifies the relative reduction in data range as extreme points are successively removed. We derive analytical expressions, including finite-sample corrections, for the expected shrinkage under both the uniform and Gaussian hypotheses, and establish that these curves remain distinct even for moderate number of removal. We construct an elementary decision rule that assigns a sample to whichever theoretical shrinkage profile it most closely follows. This test achieves higher classification accuracy than the classical likelihood-ratio test in small-sample or noisy regimes, while preserving asymptotic consistency for large n. We further integrate our criterion into a clustering pipeline (e.g. DBSCAN), demonstrating its ability to validate one-dimensional clusters without any density estimation or parameter tuning. This work thus provides both theoretical insight and practical tools for robust distributional inference and cluster stability analysis.</description>

      <title>Probit Monotone BART</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) of Chipman et al. (2010) has proven to be a powerful tool for nonparametric modeling and prediction. Monotone BART (Chipman et al., 2022) is a recent development that allows BART to be more precise in estimating monotonic functions. We further these developments by proposing probit monotone BART, which allows the monotone BART framework to estimate conditional mean functions when the outcome variable is binary.</description>

      <title>The Nondecreasing Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article the notion of the nondecreasing (ND) rank of a matrix or tensor is introduced. A tensor has an ND rank of r if it can be represented as a sum of r outer products of vectors, with each vector satisfying a monotonicity constraint. It is shown that for certain poset orderings finding an ND factorization of rank $r$ is equivalent to finding a nonnegative rank-r factorization of a transformed tensor. However, not every tensor that is monotonic has a finite ND rank. Theory is developed describing the properties of the ND rank, including typical, maximum, and border ND ranks. Highlighted also are the special settings where a matrix or tensor has an ND rank of one or two. As a means of finding low ND rank approximations to a data tensor we introduce a variant of the hierarchical alternating least squares algorithm. Low ND rank factorizations are found and interpreted for two datasets concerning the weight of pigs and a mental health survey during the COVID-19 pandemic.</description>

      <title>Partial Functional Dynamic Backdoor Diffusion-based Causal Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Partial Functional Dynamic Backdoor Diffusion-based Causal Model (PFD-BDCM), specifically designed for causal inference in the presence of unmeasured confounders with spatial heterogeneity and temporal dependency. The proposed PFD-BDCM framework addresses the restrictions of the existing approaches by uniquely integrating models for complex spatio-temporal dynamics with the analysis of multi-resolution variables. Specifically, the framework systematically mitigates confounding bias by integrating valid backdoor adjustment sets into a diffusion-based sampling mechanism. Moreover, it accounts for the intricate dynamics of unmeasured confounders through the deployment of region-specific structural equations and conditional autoregressive processes, and accommodates variables observed at heterogeneous resolutions via basis expansions for functional data. Our theoretical analysis establishes error bounds for counterfactual estimates of PFD-BDCM, formally linking reconstruction accuracy to counterfactual fidelity under monotonicity assumptions of structural equation and invertibility assumptions of encoding function. Empirical evaluations on synthetic datasets and real-world air pollution data demonstrate PFD-BDCM's superiority over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Identifying Causal Direction via Dense Functional Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of determining the causal direction between two univariate, continuous-valued variables, X and Y, under the assumption of no hidden confounders. In general, it is not possible to make definitive statements about causality without some assumptions on the underlying model. To distinguish between cause and effect, we propose a bivariate causal score based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, using functions that possess the density property on a compact real interval. We prove the identifiability of these causal scores under specific conditions. These conditions can be easily tested. Gaussianity of the noise in the causal model equations is not assumed, only that the noise is low. The well-studied class of cubic splines possesses the density property on a compact real interval. We propose LCUBE as an instantiation of the MDL-based causal score utilizing cubic regression splines. LCUBE is an identifiable method that is also interpretable, simple, and very fast. It has only one hyperparameter. Empirical evaluations compared to state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that LCUBE achieves superior precision in terms of AUDRC on the real-world Tuebingen cause-effect pairs dataset. It also shows superior average precision across common 10 benchmark datasets and achieves above average precision on 13 datasets.</description>

      <title>Beyond Universal Approximation Theorems: Algorithmic Uniform Approximation by Neural Networks Trained with Noisy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At its core, machine learning seeks to train models that reliably generalize beyond noisy observations; however, the theoretical vacuum in which state-of-the-art universal approximation theorems (UATs) operate isolates them from this goal, as they assume noiseless data and allow network parameters to be chosen freely, independent of algorithmic realism. This paper bridges that gap by introducing an architecture-specific randomized training algorithm that constructs a uniform approximator from $N$ noisy training samples on the $d$-dimensional cube $[0,1]^d$. Our trained neural networks attain the minimax-optimal quantity of \textit{trainable} (non-random) parameters, subject to logarithmic factors which vanish under the idealized noiseless sampling assumed in classical UATs.
  Additionally, our trained models replicate key behaviours of real-world neural networks, absent in standard UAT constructions, by: (1) exhibiting sub-linear parametric complexity when fine-tuning on structurally related and favourable out-of-distribution tasks, (2) exactly interpolating the training data, and (3) maintaining reasonable Lipschitz regularity (after the initial clustering attention layer). These properties bring state-of-the-art UATs closer to practical machine learning, shifting the central open question from algorithmic implementability with noisy samples to whether stochastic gradient descent can achieve comparable guarantees.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Bayesian GANs with Log-Signatures for Uncertainty-Aware Credit Card Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel deep generative semi-supervised framework for credit card fraud detection, formulated as time series classification task. As financial transaction data streams grow in scale and complexity, traditional methods often require large labeled datasets, struggle with time series of irregular sampling frequencies and varying sequence lengths. To address these challenges, we extend conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for targeted data augmentation, integrate Bayesian inference to obtain predictive distributions and quantify uncertainty, and leverage log-signatures for robust feature encoding of transaction histories. We introduce a novel Wasserstein distance-based loss to align generated and real unlabeled samples while simultaneously maximizing classification accuracy on labeled data. Our approach is evaluated on the BankSim dataset, a widely used simulator for credit card transaction data, under varying proportions of labeled samples, demonstrating consistent improvements over benchmarks in both global statistical and domain-specific metrics. These findings highlight the effectiveness of GAN-driven semi-supervised learning with log-signatures for irregularly sampled time series and emphasize the importance of uncertainty-aware predictions.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Topic-Semantic Labeling and Graph Embeddings for Unsupervised Legal Document Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Legal documents pose unique challenges for text classification due to their domain-specific language and often limited labeled data. This paper proposes a hybrid approach for classifying legal texts by combining unsupervised topic and graph embeddings with a supervised model. We employ Top2Vec to learn semantic document embeddings and automatically discover latent topics, and Node2Vec to capture structural relationships via a bipartite graph of legal documents. The embeddings are combined and clustered using KMeans, yielding coherent groupings of documents. Our computations on a legal document dataset demonstrate that the combined Top2Vec+Node2Vec approach improves clustering quality over text-only or graph-only embeddings. We conduct a sensitivity analysis of hyperparameters, such as the number of clusters and the dimensionality of the embeddings, and demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance against baseline Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) models. Key findings indicate that while the pipeline presents an innovative approach to unsupervised legal document analysis by combining semantic topic modeling with graph embedding techniques, its efficacy is contingent upon the quality of initial topic generation and the representational power of the chosen embedding models for specialized legal language. Strategic recommendations include the exploration of domain-specific embeddings, more comprehensive hyperparameter tuning for Node2Vec, dynamic determination of cluster numbers, and robust human-in-the-loop validation processes to enhance legal relevance and trustworthiness. The pipeline demonstrates potential for exploratory legal data analysis and as a precursor to supervised learning tasks but requires further refinement and domain-specific adaptation for practical legal applications.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz-Guided Design of Interpolation Schedules in Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the design of interpolation schedules in the stochastic interpolants framework for flow and diffusion-based generative models. We show that while all scalar interpolation schedules achieve identical statistical efficiency under Kullback-Leibler divergence in path space after optimal diffusion coefficient tuning, their numerical efficiency can differ substantially. This observation motivates focusing on numerical properties of the resulting drift fields rather than statistical criteria for schedule design. We propose averaged squared Lipschitzness minimization as a principled criterion for numerical optimization, providing an alternative to kinetic energy minimization used in optimal transport approaches. A transfer formula is derived that enables conversion between different schedules at inference time without retraining neural networks. For Gaussian distributions, our optimized schedules achieve exponential improvements in Lipschitz constants over standard linear schedules, while for Gaussian mixtures, they reduce mode collapse in few-step sampling. We also validate our approach on high-dimensional invariant distributions from stochastic Allen-Cahn equations and Navier-Stokes equations, demonstrating robust performance improvements across resolutions.</description>

      <title>Preconditioned Regularized Wasserstein Proximal Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider sampling from a Gibbs distribution by evolving finitely many particles. We propose a preconditioned version of a recently proposed noise-free sampling method, governed by approximating the score function with the numerically tractable score of a regularized Wasserstein proximal operator. This is derived by a Cole--Hopf transformation on coupled anisotropic heat equations, yielding a kernel formulation for the preconditioned regularized Wasserstein proximal. The diffusion component of the proposed method is also interpreted as a modified self-attention block, as in transformer architectures. For quadratic potentials, we provide a discrete-time non-asymptotic convergence analysis and explicitly characterize the bias, which is dependent on regularization and independent of step-size. Experiments demonstrate acceleration and particle-level stability on various log-concave and non-log-concave toy examples to Bayesian total-variation regularized image deconvolution, and competitive/better performance on non-convex Bayesian neural network training when utilizing variable preconditioning matrices.</description>

      <title>The Price of Sparsity: Sufficient Conditions for Sparse Recovery using Sparse and Sparsified Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering the support of a sparse signal using noisy projections. While extensive work has been done on the dense measurement matrix setting, the sparse setting remains less explored. In this work, we establish sufficient conditions on the sample size for successful sparse recovery using sparse measurement matrices. Bringing together our result with previously known necessary conditions, we discover that, in the regime where $ds/p \rightarrow +\infty$, sparse recovery in the sparse setting exhibits a phase transition at an information-theoretic threshold of $n_{\text{INF}}^{\text{SP}} = \Theta\left(s\log\left(p/s\right)/\log\left(ds/p\right)\right)$, where $p$ denotes the signal dimension, $s$ the number of non-zero components of the signal, and $d$ the expected number of non-zero components per row of measurement. This expression makes the price of sparsity explicit: restricting each measurement to $d$ non-zeros inflates the required sample size by a factor of $\log{s}/\log\left(ds/p\right)$, revealing a precise trade-off between sampling complexity and measurement sparsity. Additionally, we examine the effect of sparsifying an originally dense measurement matrix on sparse signal recovery. We prove in the regime of $s = \alpha p$ and $d = \psi p$ with $\alpha, \psi \in \left(0,1\right)$ and $\psi$ small that a sample of size $n^{\text{Sp-ified}}_{\text{INF}} = \Theta\left(p / \psi^2\right)$ is sufficient for recovery, subject to a certain uniform integrability conjecture, the proof of which is work in progress.</description>

      <title>Design of Experiment for Discovering Directed Mixed Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of experimental design for accurately identifying the causal graph structure of a simple structural causal model (SCM), where the underlying graph may include both cycles and bidirected edges induced by latent confounders. The presence of cycles renders it impossible to recover the graph skeleton using observational data alone, while confounding can further invalidate traditional conditional independence (CI) tests in certain scenarios. To address these challenges, we establish lower bounds on both the maximum number of variables that can be intervened upon in a single experiment and the total number of experiments required to identify all directed edges and non-adjacent bidirected edges. Leveraging both CI tests and do see tests, and accounting for $d$ separation and $\sigma$ separation, we develop two classes of algorithms, i.e., bounded and unbounded, that can recover all causal edges except for double adjacent bidirected edges. We further show that, up to logarithmic factors, the proposed algorithms are tight with respect to the derived lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Model-Based Sequential Decision-Making in Agriculture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential decision-making is central to sustainable agricultural management and precision agriculture, where resource inputs must be optimized under uncertainty and over time. However, such decisions must often be made with limited observations, whereas classical bandit and reinforcement learning approaches typically rely on either linear or black-box reward models that may misrepresent domain knowledge or require large amounts of data. We propose a family of nonlinear, model-based bandit algorithms that embed domain-specific response curves directly into the exploration-exploitation loop. By coupling (i) principled uncertainty quantification with (ii) closed-form or rapidly computable profit optima, these algorithms achieve sublinear regret and near-optimal sample complexity while preserving interpretability. Theoretical analysis establishes regret and sample complexity bounds, and extensive simulations emulating real-world fertilizer-rate decisions show consistent improvements over both linear and nonparametric baselines (such as linear UCB and $k$-NN UCB) in the low-sample regime, under both well-specified and shape-compatible misspecified models. Because our approach leverages mechanistic insight rather than large data volumes, it is especially suited to resource-constrained settings, supporting sustainable, inclusive, and transparent sequential decision-making across agriculture, environmental management, and allied applications. This methodology directly contributes to SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) by enabling data-driven, less wasteful agricultural practices.</description>

      <title>Inference in Spreading Processes with Neural-Network Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic processes on graphs are a powerful tool for modelling complex dynamical systems such as epidemics. A recent line of work focused on the inference problem where one aims to estimate the state of every node at every time, starting from partial observation of a subset of nodes at a subset of times. In these works, the initial state of the process was assumed to be random i.i.d. over nodes. Such an assumption may not be realistic in practice, where one may have access to a set of covariate variables for every node that influence the initial state of the system. In this work, we will assume that the initial state of a node is an unknown function of such covariate variables. Given that functions can be represented by neural networks, we will study a model where the initial state is given by a simple neural network -- notably the single-layer perceptron acting on the known node-wise covariate variables.
  Within a Bayesian framework, we study how such neural-network prior information enhances the recovery of initial states and spreading trajectories. We derive a hybrid belief propagation and approximate message passing (BP-AMP) algorithm that handles both the spreading dynamics and the information included in the node covariates, and we assess its performance against the estimators that either use only the spreading information or use only the information from the covariate variables.
  We show that in some regimes, the model can exhibit first-order phase transitions when using a Rademacher distribution for the neural-network weights. These transitions create a statistical-to-computational gap where even the BP-AMP algorithm, despite the theoretical possibility of perfect recovery, fails to achieve it.</description>

      <title>Amputation-imputation based generation of synthetic tabular data for ratemaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Actuarial ratemaking depends on high-quality data, yet access to such data is often limited by the cost of obtaining new data, privacy concerns, etc. In this paper, we explore synthetic-data generation as a potential solution to these issues. In addition to discussing generative methods previously studied in the actuarial literature, we introduce to the insurance community another approach based on Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE). We present a comparative study using an open-source dataset and evaluating MICE-based models against other generative models like Variational Autoencoders and Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks. We assess how well synthetic data preserves the original marginal distributions of variables as well as the multivariate relationships among covariates. We also investigate the consistency between Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) trained on synthetic data with GLMs trained on the original data. Furthermore, we assess the ease of use of each generative approach and study the impact of augmenting original data with synthetic data on the performance of GLMs for predicting claim counts. Our results highlight the potential of MICE-based methods in creating high-quality tabular data while being more user-friendly than the other methods.</description>

      <title>Variational Uncertainty Decomposition for In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) gain popularity in conducting prediction tasks in-context, understanding the sources of uncertainty in in-context learning becomes essential to ensuring reliability. The recent hypothesis of in-context learning performing predictive Bayesian inference opens the avenue for Bayesian uncertainty estimation, particularly for decomposing uncertainty into epistemic uncertainty due to lack of in-context data and aleatoric uncertainty inherent in the in-context prediction task. However, the decomposition idea remains under-explored due to the intractability of the latent parameter posterior from the underlying Bayesian model. In this work, we introduce a variational uncertainty decomposition framework for in-context learning without explicitly sampling from the latent parameter posterior, by optimising auxiliary queries as probes to obtain an upper bound to the aleatoric uncertainty of an LLM's in-context learning procedure, which also induces a lower bound to the epistemic uncertainty. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world tasks, we show quantitatively and qualitatively that the decomposed uncertainties obtained from our method exhibit desirable properties of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Distribution estimation via Flow Matching with Lipschitz guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow Matching, a promising approach in generative modeling, has recently gained popularity. Relying on ordinary differential equations, it offers a simple and flexible alternative to diffusion models, which are currently the state-of-the-art. Despite its empirical success, the mathematical understanding of its statistical power so far is very limited. This is largely due to the sensitivity of theoretical bounds to the Lipschitz constant of the vector field which drives the ODE. In this work, we study the assumptions that lead to controlling this dependency. Based on these results, we derive a convergence rate for the Wasserstein $1$ distance between the estimated distribution and the target distribution which improves previous results in high dimensional setting. This rate applies to certain classes of unbounded distributions and particularly does not require $\log$-concavity.</description>

      <title>Wild Refitting for Model-Free Excess Risk Evaluation of Opaque ML/AI Models under Bregman Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of evaluating the excess risk of classical penalized empirical risk minimization (ERM) with Bregman losses. We show that by leveraging the recently proposed wild refitting procedure (Wainwright, 2025), one can efficiently upper bound the excess risk through the so-called "wild optimism," without relying on the global structure of the underlying function class. This property makes our approach inherently model-free. Unlike conventional analyses, our framework operates with just one dataset and black-box access to the training procedure. The method involves randomized vector-valued symmetrization with an appropriate scaling of the prediction residues and constructing artificially modified outcomes, upon which we retrain a second predictor for excess risk estimation. We establish high-probability performance guarantees both under the fixed design setting and the random design setting, demonstrating that wild refitting under Bregman losses, with an appropriately chosen wild noise scale, yields a valid upper bound on the excess risk. This work thus is promising for theoretically evaluating modern opaque ML and AI models such as deep neural networks and large language models, where the model class is too complex for classical learning theory and empirical process techniques to apply.</description>

Abstract: Probabilities of causation provide principled ways to assess causal relationships but face computational challenges due to partial identifiability and latent confounding. This paper introduces both algorithmic simplifications, significantly reducing the computational complexity of calculating tighter bounds for these probabilities, and a novel methodological framework for Root Cause Analysis that systematically employs these causal metrics to rank entire causal paths.</description>

      <title>Feature Augmentations for High-Dimensional Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional measurements are often correlated which motivates their approximation by factor models. This holds also true when features are engineered via low-dimensional interactions or kernel tricks. This often results in over parametrization and requires a fast dimensionality reduction. We propose a simple technique to enhance the performance of supervised learning algorithms by augmenting features with factors extracted from design matrices and their transformations. This is implemented by using the factors and idiosyncratic residuals which significantly weaken the correlations between input variables and hence increase the interpretability of learning algorithms and numerical stability. Extensive experiments on various algorithms and real-world data in diverse fields are carried out, among which we put special emphasis on the stock return prediction problem with Chinese financial news data due to the increasing interest in NLP problems in financial studies. We verify the capability of the proposed feature augmentation approach to boost overall prediction performance with the same algorithm. The approach bridges a gap in research that has been overlooked in previous studies, which focus either on collecting additional data or constructing more powerful algorithms, whereas our method lies in between these two directions using a simple PCA augmentation.</description>

      <title>Context-Action Embedding Learning for Off-Policy Evaluation in Contextual Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider off-policy evaluation (OPE) in contextual bandits with finite action space. Inverse Propensity Score (IPS) weighting is a widely used method for OPE due to its unbiased, but it suffers from significant variance when the action space is large or when some parts of the context-action space are underexplored. Recently introduced Marginalized IPS (MIPS) estimators mitigate this issue by leveraging action embeddings. However, these embeddings do not minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of the estimators and do not consider context information. To address these limitations, we introduce Context-Action Embedding Learning for MIPS, or CAEL-MIPS, which learns context-action embeddings from offline data to minimize the MSE of the MIPS estimator. Building on the theoretical analysis of bias and variance of MIPS, we present an MSE-minimizing objective for CAEL-MIPS. In the empirical studies on a synthetic dataset and a real-world dataset, we demonstrate that our estimator outperforms baselines in terms of MSE.</description>

      <title>Exam Readiness Index (ERI): A Theoretical Framework for a Composite, Explainable Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for an Exam Readiness Index (ERI): a composite, blueprint-aware score R in [0,100] that summarizes a learner's readiness for a high-stakes exam while remaining interpretable and actionable. The ERI aggregates six signals -- Mastery (M), Coverage (C), Retention (R), Pace (P), Volatility (V), and Endurance (E) -- each derived from a stream of practice and mock-test interactions. We formalize axioms for component maps and the composite, prove monotonicity, Lipschitz stability, and bounded drift under blueprint re-weighting, and show existence and uniqueness of the optimal linear composite under convex design constraints. We further characterize confidence bands via blueprint-weighted concentration and prove compatibility with prerequisite-admissible curricula (knowledge spaces / learning spaces). The paper focuses on theory; empirical study is left to future work.</description>

      <title>FBMS: An R Package for Flexible Bayesian Model Selection and Model Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The FBMS R package facilitates Bayesian model selection and model averaging in complex regression settings by employing a variety of Monte Carlo model exploration methods. At its core, the package implements an efficient Mode Jumping Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MJMCMC) algorithm, designed to improve mixing in multi-modal posterior landscapes within Bayesian generalized linear models. In addition, it provides a genetically modified MJMCMC (GMJMCMC) algorithm that introduces nonlinear feature generation, thereby enabling the estimation of Bayesian generalized nonlinear models (BGNLMs). Within this framework, the algorithm maintains and updates populations of transformed features, computes their posterior probabilities, and evaluates the posteriors of models constructed from them. We demonstrate the effective use of FBMS for both inferential and predictive modeling in Gaussian regression, focusing on different instances of the BGNLM class of models. Furthermore, through a broad set of applications, we illustrate how the methodology can be extended to increasingly complex modeling scenarios, extending to other response distributions and mixed effect models.</description>

      <title>Robust Deep Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization: Addressing Theoretical Risks in Neural Fictitious Self-Play</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR) has emerged as a cornerstone algorithm for solving extensive-form games, but its integration with deep neural networks introduces scale-dependent challenges that manifest differently across game complexities. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of how neural MCCFR component effectiveness varies with game scale and proposes an adaptive framework for selective component deployment. We identify that theoretical risks such as nonstationary target distribution shifts, action support collapse, variance explosion, and warm-starting bias have scale-dependent manifestation patterns, requiring different mitigation strategies for small versus large games. Our proposed Robust Deep MCCFR framework incorporates target networks with delayed updates, uniform exploration mixing, variance-aware training objectives, and comprehensive diagnostic monitoring. Through systematic ablation studies on Kuhn and Leduc Poker, we demonstrate scale-dependent component effectiveness and identify critical component interactions. The best configuration achieves final exploitability of 0.0628 on Kuhn Poker, representing a 60% improvement over the classical framework (0.156). On the more complex Leduc Poker domain, selective component usage achieves exploitability of 0.2386, a 23.5% improvement over the classical framework (0.3703) and highlighting the importance of careful component selection over comprehensive mitigation. Our contributions include: (1) a formal theoretical analysis of risks in neural MCCFR, (2) a principled mitigation framework with convergence guarantees, (3) comprehensive multi-scale experimental validation revealing scale-dependent component interactions, and (4) practical guidelines for deployment in larger games.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) algorithms are popular Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to sample a target probability distribution, which arises in many applications in machine learning. Inspired by regime-switching stochastic differential equations in the probability literature, we propose and study regime-switching Langevin dynamics (RS-LD) and regime-switching kinetic Langevin dynamics (RS-KLD). Based on their discretizations, we introduce regime-switching Langevin Monte Carlo (RS-LMC) and regime-switching kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo (RS-KLMC) algorithms, which can also be viewed as LMC and KLMC algorithms with random stepsizes. We also propose frictional-regime-switching kinetic Langevin dynamics (FRS-KLD) and its associated algorithm frictional-regime-switching kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo (FRS-KLMC), which can also be viewed as the KLMC algorithm with random frictional coefficients. We provide their 2-Wasserstein non-asymptotic convergence guarantees to the target distribution, and analyze the iteration complexities. Numerical experiments using both synthetic and real data are provided to illustrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>ART: Adaptive Resampling-based Training for Imbalanced Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional resampling methods for handling class imbalance typically uses fixed distributions, undersampling the majority or oversampling the minority. These static strategies ignore changes in class-wise learning difficulty, which can limit the overall performance of the model.
  This paper proposes an Adaptive Resampling-based Training (ART) method that periodically updates the distribution of the training data based on the class-wise performance of the model. Specifically, ART uses class-wise macro F1 scores, computed at fixed intervals, to determine the degree of resampling to be performed.
  Unlike instance-level difficulty modeling, which is noisy and outlier-sensitive, ART adapts at the class level. This allows the model to incrementally shift its attention towards underperforming classes in a way that better aligns with the optimization objective.
  Results on diverse benchmarks, including Pima Indians Diabetes and Yeast dataset demonstrate that ART consistently outperforms both resampling-based and algorithm-level methods, including Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), NearMiss Undersampling, and Cost-sensitive Learning on binary as well as multi-class classification tasks with varying degrees of imbalance.
  In most settings, these improvements are statistically significant. On tabular datasets, gains are significant under paired t-tests and Wilcoxon tests (p &lt; 0.05), while results on text and image tasks remain favorable. Compared to training on the original imbalanced data, ART improves macro F1 by an average of 2.64 percentage points across all tested tabular datasets. Unlike existing methods, whose performance varies by task, ART consistently delivers the strongest macro F1, making it a reliable choice for imbalanced classification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-cell technologies provide an unprecedented opportunity for dissecting the interplay between the cancer cells and the associated tumor microenvironment, and the produced high-dimensional omics data should also augment existing survival modeling approaches for identifying tumor cell type-specific genes predictive of cancer patient survival. However, there is no statistical model to integrate multiscale data including individual-level survival data, multicellular-level cell composition data and cellular-level single-cell omics covariates. We propose a class of Bayesian generalized promotion time cure models (GPTCMs) for the multiscale data integration to identify cell-type-specific genes and improve cancer prognosis. We demonstrate with simulations in both low- and high-dimensional settings that the proposed Bayesian GPTCMs are able to identify cell-type-associated covariates and improve survival prediction.</description>

      <title>CCE: Confidence-Consistency Evaluation for Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time Series Anomaly Detection metrics serve as crucial tools for model evaluation. However, existing metrics suffer from several limitations: insufficient discriminative power, strong hyperparameter dependency, sensitivity to perturbations, and high computational overhead. This paper introduces Confidence-Consistency Evaluation (CCE), a novel evaluation metric that simultaneously measures prediction confidence and uncertainty consistency. By employing Bayesian estimation to quantify the uncertainty of anomaly scores, we construct both global and event-level confidence and consistency scores for model predictions, resulting in a concise CCE metric. Theoretically and experimentally, we demonstrate that CCE possesses strict boundedness, Lipschitz robustness against score perturbations, and linear time complexity $\mathcal{O}(n)$. Furthermore, we establish RankEval, a benchmark for comparing the ranking capabilities of various metrics. RankEval represents the first standardized and reproducible evaluation pipeline that enables objective comparison of evaluation metrics. Both CCE and RankEval implementations are fully open-source.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Performative Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Performative prediction is an emerging paradigm in machine learning that addresses scenarios where the model's prediction may induce a shift in the distribution of the data it aims to predict. Current works in this field often rely on uncontrollable assumptions, such as bounded gradients of performative loss, and primarily focus on linear cases in their examples and evaluations to maintain consistency between theoretical guarantees and empirical validations. However, such linearity rarely holds in real-world applications, where the data usually exhibit complex nonlinear characteristics. In this paper, we relax these out-of-control assumptions and present a novel design that generalizes performative prediction to nonlinear cases while preserving essential theoretical properties. Specifically, we formulate the loss function of performative prediction using a maximum margin approach and extend it to nonlinear spaces through kernel methods. To quantify the data distribution shift, we employ the discrepancy between prediction errors on these two distributions as an indicator, which characterizes the impact of the performative effect on specific learning tasks. By doing so, we can derive, for both linear and nonlinear cases, the conditions for performative stability, a critical and desirable property in performative contexts. Building on these theoretical insights, we develop an algorithm that guarantees the performative stability of the predictive model. We validate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets with both linear and nonlinear data distributions, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>ADMP-GNN: Adaptive Depth Message Passing GNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven to be highly effective in various graph learning tasks. A key characteristic of GNNs is their use of a fixed number of message-passing steps for all nodes in the graph, regardless of each node's diverse computational needs and characteristics. Through empirical real-world data analysis, we demonstrate that the optimal number of message-passing layers varies for nodes with different characteristics. This finding is further supported by experiments conducted on synthetic datasets. To address this, we propose Adaptive Depth Message Passing GNN (ADMP-GNN), a novel framework that dynamically adjusts the number of message passing layers for each node, resulting in improved performance. This approach applies to any model that follows the message passing scheme. We evaluate ADMP-GNN on the node classification task and observe performance improvements over baseline GNN models.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous and Stochastic Distributed Resource Allocation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes and studies the distributed resource allocation problem in asynchronous and stochastic settings. We consider a distributed system with multiple workers and a coordinating server with heterogeneous computation and communication times. We explore an approximate stochastic primal-dual approach with the aim of 1) adhering to the resource budget constraints, 2) allowing for the asynchronicity between the workers and the server, and 3) relying on the locally available stochastic gradients. We analyze our Asynchronous stochastic Primal-Dual (Asyn-PD) algorithm and prove its convergence in the second moment to the saddle point solution of the approximate problem at the rate of $O(1/t)$, where $t$ is the iteration number. Furthermore, we verify our algorithm numerically to validate the analytically derived convergence results, and demonstrate the advantages of utilizing our asynchronous algorithm rather than deploying a synchronous algorithm where the server must wait until it gets update from all workers.</description>

      <title>Sampling as Bandits: Evaluation-Efficient Design for Black-Box Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce bandit importance sampling (BIS), a new class of importance sampling methods designed for settings where the target density is expensive to evaluate. In contrast to adaptive importance sampling, which optimises a proposal distribution, BIS directly designs the samples through a sequential strategy that combines space-filling designs with multi-armed bandits. Our method leverages Gaussian process surrogates to guide sample selection, enabling efficient exploration of the parameter space with minimal target evaluations. We establish theoretical guarantees on convergence and demonstrate the effectiveness of the method across a broad range of sampling tasks. BIS delivers accurate approximations with fewer target evaluations, outperforming competing approaches across multimodal, heavy-tailed distributions, and real-world applications to Bayesian inference of computationally expensive models.</description>

      <title>Effects of Distributional Biases on Gradient-Based Causal Discovery in the Bivariate Categorical Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient-based causal discovery shows great potential for deducing causal structure from data in an efficient and scalable way. Those approaches however can be susceptible to distributional biases in the data they are trained on. We identify two such biases: Marginal Distribution Asymmetry, where differences in entropy skew causal learning toward certain factorizations, and Marginal Distribution Shift Asymmetry, where repeated interventions cause faster shifts in some variables than in others. For the bivariate categorical setup with Dirichlet priors, we illustrate how these biases can occur even in controlled synthetic data. To examine their impact on gradient-based methods, we employ two simple models that derive causal factorizations by learning marginal or conditional data distributions - a common strategy in gradient-based causal discovery. We demonstrate how these models can be susceptible to both biases. We additionally show how the biases can be controlled. An empirical evaluation of two related, existing approaches indicates that eliminating competition between possible causal factorizations can make models robust to the presented biases.</description>

      <title>Efficient Transformer-Inspired Variants of Physics-Informed Deep Operator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising tool for accelerating the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). The Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) represent a pioneering framework in this area: the "vanilla" DeepONet is valued for its simplicity and efficiency, while the modified DeepONet achieves higher accuracy at the cost of increased training time. In this work, we propose a series of Transformer-inspired DeepONet variants that introduce bidirectional cross-conditioning between the branch and trunk networks in DeepONet. Query-point information is injected into the branch network and input-function information into the trunk network, enabling dynamic dependencies while preserving the simplicity and efficiency of the "vanilla" DeepONet in a non-intrusive manner. Experiments on four PDE benchmarks -- advection, diffusion-reaction, Burgers', and Korteweg-de Vries equations -- show that for each case, there exists a variant that matches or surpasses the accuracy of the modified DeepONet while offering improved training efficiency. Moreover, the best-performing variant for each equation aligns naturally with the equation's underlying characteristics, suggesting that the effectiveness of cross-conditioning depends on the characteristics of the equation and its underlying physics. To ensure robustness, we validate the effectiveness of our variants through a range of rigorous statistical analyses, among them the Wilcoxon Two One-Sided Test, Glass's Delta, and Spearman's rank correlation.</description>

      <title>Wrong Model, Right Uncertainty: Spatial Associations for Discrete Data with Misspecification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientists are often interested in estimating an association between a covariate and a binary- or count-valued response. For instance, public health officials are interested in how much disease presence (a binary response per individual) varies as temperature or pollution (covariates) increases. Many existing methods can be used to estimate associations, and corresponding uncertainty intervals, but make unrealistic assumptions in the spatial domain. For instance, they incorrectly assume models are well-specified. Or they assume the training and target locations are i.i.d. -- whereas in practice, these locations are often not even randomly sampled. Some recent work avoids these assumptions but works only for continuous responses with spatially constant noise. In the present work, we provide the first confidence intervals with guaranteed asymptotic nominal coverage for spatial associations given discrete responses, even under simultaneous model misspecification and nonrandom sampling of spatial locations. To do so, we demonstrate how to handle spatially varying noise, provide a novel proof of consistency for our proposed estimator, and use a delta method argument with a Lyapunov central limit theorem. We show empirically that standard approaches can produce unreliable confidence intervals and can even get the sign of an association wrong, while our method reliably provides correct coverage.</description>

      <title>Bouncy particle sampler with infinite exchanging parallel tempering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference is useful to obtain a predictive distribution with a small generalization error. However, since posterior distributions are rarely evaluated analytically, we employ the variational Bayesian inference or sampling method to approximate posterior distributions. When we obtain samples from a posterior distribution, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) has been widely used for the continuous variable part and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for the discrete variable part. Another sampling method, the bouncy particle sampler (BPS), has been proposed, which combines uniform linear motion and stochastic reflection to perform sampling. BPS was reported to have the advantage of being easier to set simulation parameters than HMC. To accelerate the convergence to a posterior distribution, we introduced parallel tempering (PT) to BPS, and then proposed an algorithm when the inverse temperature exchange rate is set to infinity. We performed numerical simulations and demonstrated its effectiveness for multimodal distribution.</description>

      <title>Fantastic Pretraining Optimizers and Where to Find Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AdamW has long been the dominant optimizer in language model pretraining, despite numerous claims that alternative optimizers offer 1.4 to 2x speedup. We posit that two methodological shortcomings have obscured fair comparisons and hindered practical adoption: (i) unequal hyperparameter tuning and (ii) limited or misleading evaluation setups. To address these two issues, we conduct a systematic study of ten deep learning optimizers across four model scales (0.1B-1.2B parameters) and data-to-model ratios (1-8x the Chinchilla optimum). We find that fair and informative comparisons require rigorous hyperparameter tuning and evaluations across a range of model scales and data-to-model ratios, performed at the end of training. First, optimal hyperparameters for one optimizer may be suboptimal for another, making blind hyperparameter transfer unfair. Second, the actual speedup of many proposed optimizers over well-tuned baselines is lower than claimed and decreases with model size to only 1.1x for 1.2B parameter models. Thirdly, comparing intermediate checkpoints before reaching the target training budgets can be misleading, as rankings between two optimizers can flip during training due to learning rate decay. Through our thorough investigation, we find that all the fastest optimizers such as Muon and Soap, use matrices as preconditioners -- multiplying gradients with matrices rather than entry-wise scalars. However, the speedup of matrix-based optimizers is inversely proportional to model scale, decreasing from 1.4x over AdamW for 0.1B parameter models to merely 1.1x for 1.2B parameter models.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Expectation-Maximisation and Applications to Gaussian Mixture Model Optimal Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm is a central tool in statistics and machine learning, widely used for latent-variable models such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Despite its ubiquity, EM is typically treated as a non-differentiable black box, preventing its integration into modern learning pipelines where end-to-end gradient propagation is essential. In this work, we present and compare several differentiation strategies for EM, from full automatic differentiation to approximate methods, assessing their accuracy and computational efficiency. As a key application, we leverage this differentiable EM in the computation of the Mixture Wasserstein distance $\mathrm{MW}_2$ between GMMs, allowing $\mathrm{MW}_2$ to be used as a differentiable loss in imaging and machine learning tasks. To complement our practical use of $\mathrm{MW}_2$, we contribute a novel stability result which provides theoretical justification for the use of $\mathrm{MW}_2$ with EM, and also introduce a novel unbalanced variant of $\mathrm{MW}_2$. Numerical experiments on barycentre computation, colour and style transfer, image generation, and texture synthesis illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of the proposed approach in different settings.</description>

      <title>Conditional-$t^3$VAE: Equitable Latent Space Allocation for Fair Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with global priors mirror the training set's class frequency in latent space, underrepresenting tail classes and reducing generative fairness on imbalanced datasets. While $t^3$VAE improves robustness via heavy-tailed Student's t-distribution priors, it still allocates latent volume proportionally to the class frequency.In this work, we address this issue by explicitly enforcing equitable latent space allocation across classes. To this end, we propose Conditional-$t^3$VAE, which defines a per-class \mbox{Student's t} joint prior over latent and output variables, preventing dominance by majority classes. Our model is optimized using a closed-form objective derived from the $\gamma$-power divergence. Moreover, for class-balanced generation, we derive an equal-weight latent mixture of Student's t-distributions. On SVHN-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and CelebA, Conditional-$t^3$VAE consistently achieves lower FID scores than both $t^3$VAE and Gaussian-based VAE baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance. In per-class F1 evaluations, Conditional-$t^3$VAE also outperforms the conditional Gaussian VAE across all highly imbalanced settings. While Gaussian-based models remain competitive under mild imbalance ratio ($\rho \lesssim 3$), our approach substantially improves generative fairness and diversity in more extreme regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calibration is a classical notion from the forecasting literature which aims to address the question: how should predicted probabilities be interpreted? In a world where we only get to observe (discrete) outcomes, how should we evaluate a predictor that hypothesizes (continuous) probabilities over possible outcomes? The study of calibration has seen a surge of recent interest, given the ubiquity of probabilistic predictions in machine learning. This survey describes recent work on the foundational questions of how to define and measure calibration error, and what these measures mean for downstream decision makers who wish to use the predictions to make decisions. A unifying viewpoint that emerges is that of calibration as a form of indistinguishability, between the world hypothesized by the predictor and the real world (governed by nature or the Bayes optimal predictor). In this view, various calibration measures quantify the extent to which the two worlds can be told apart by certain classes of distinguishers or statistical measures.</description>

      <title>Gaming and Cooperation in Federated Learning: What Can Happen and How to Monitor It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of Federated Learning depends on the actions that participants take out of sight. We model Federated Learning not as a mere optimization task but as a strategic system entangled with rules and incentives. From this perspective, we present an analytical framework that makes it possible to clearly identify where behaviors that genuinely improve performance diverge from those that merely target metrics. We introduce two indices that respectively quantify behavioral incentives and collective performance loss, and we use them as the basis for consistently interpreting the impact of operational choices such as rule design, the level of information disclosure, evaluation methods, and aggregator switching. We further summarize thresholds, auto-switch rules, and early warning signals into a checklist that can be applied directly in practice, and we provide both a practical algorithm for allocating limited audit resources and a performance guarantee. Simulations conducted across diverse environments consistently validate the patterns predicted by our framework, and we release all procedures for full reproducibility. While our approach operates most strongly under several assumptions, combining periodic recalibration, randomization, and connectivity-based alarms enables robust application under the variability of real-world operations. We present both design principles and operational guidelines that lower the incentives for metric gaming while sustaining and expanding stable cooperation.</description>

      <title>Top-H Decoding: Adapting the Creativity and Coherence with Bounded Entropy in Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, often struggle to balance two competing objectives in open-ended text generation: fostering diversity and creativity while preserving logical coherence. Existing truncated sampling techniques, including temperature scaling, top-\$p\$ (nucleus) sampling, and min-\$p\$ sampling, aim to manage this trade-off. However, they exhibit limitations, particularly in the effective incorporation of the confidence of the model into the corresponding sampling strategy. For example, min-\$p\$ sampling relies on a single top token as a heuristic for confidence, eventually underutilizing the information of the probability distribution. Toward effective incorporation of the confidence of the model, in this paper, we present **top-H** decoding. We first establish the theoretical foundation of the interplay between creativity and coherence in truncated sampling by formulating an **entropy-constrained minimum divergence** problem. We then prove this minimization problem to be equivalent to an **entropy-constrained mass maximization** (ECMM) problem, which is NP-hard. Finally, we present top-H decoding, a computationally efficient greedy algorithm to solve the ECMM problem. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that top-H outperforms the state-of-the-art (SoTA) alternative of min-\$p\$ sampling by up to **25.63%** on creative writing benchmarks, while maintaining robustness on question-answering datasets such as GPQA, GSM8K, and MT-Bench. Additionally, an *LLM-as-judge* evaluation confirms that top-H indeed produces coherent outputs even at higher temperatures, where creativity is especially critical.

      <title>Is RL fine-tuning harder than regression? A PDE learning approach for diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning the optimal control policy for fine-tuning a given diffusion process, using general value function approximation. We develop a new class of algorithms by solving a variational inequality problem based on the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. We prove sharp statistical rates for the learned value function and control policy, depending on the complexity and approximation errors of the function class. In contrast to generic reinforcement learning problems, our approach shows that fine-tuning can be achieved via supervised regression, with faster statistical rate guarantees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In federated learning, communication cost can be significantly reduced by transmitting the information over the air through physical channels. In this paper, we propose a new class of adaptive federated stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms that can be implemented over physical channels, taking into account both channel noise and hardware constraints. We establish theoretical guarantees for the proposed algorithms, demonstrating convergence rates that are adaptive to the stochastic gradient noise level. We also demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our algorithms through simulation studies with deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Extending Model-x Framework to Missing Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.13054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One limitation of the most statistical/machine learning-based variable selection approaches is their inability to control the false selections. A recently introduced framework, model-x knockoffs, provides that to a wide range of models but lacks support for datasets with missing values. In this work, we discuss ways of preserving the theoretical guarantees of the model-x framework in the missing data setting. First, we prove that posterior sampled imputation allows reusing existing knockoff samplers in the presence of missing values. Second, we show that sampling knockoffs only for the observed variables and applying univariate imputation also preserves the false selection guarantees. Third, for the special case of latent variable models, we demonstrate how jointly imputing and sampling knockoffs can reduce the computational complexity. We have verified the theoretical findings with two different exploratory variable distributions and investigated how the missing data pattern, amount of correlation, the number of observations, and missing values affected the statistical power.</description>

      <title>A Flexible Framework for Incorporating Patient Preferences Into Q-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In real-world healthcare settings, treatment decisions often involve optimizing for multivariate outcomes such as treatment efficacy and severity of side effects based on individual preferences. However, existing statistical methods for estimating dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) usually assume a univariate outcome, and the few methods that deal with composite outcomes suffer from limitations such as restrictions to a single time point and limited theoretical guarantees. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Utility Q-Learning (LUQ-Learning), a latent model approach that adapts Q-learning to tackle the aforementioned difficulties. Our framework allows for an arbitrary finite number of decision points and outcomes, incorporates personal preferences, and achieves asymptotic performance guarantees with realistic assumptions. We conduct simulation experiments based on an ongoing trial for low back pain as well as a well-known trial for schizophrenia. In both settings, LUQ-Learning achieves highly competitive performance compared to alternative baselines.</description>

      <title>ODTlearn: A Package for Learning Optimal Decision Trees for Prediction and Prescription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15691v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ODTLearn is an open-source Python package that provides methods for learning optimal decision trees for high-stakes predictive and prescriptive tasks based on the mixed-integer optimization (MIO) framework proposed in (Aghaei et al., 2021) and several of its extensions. The current version of the package provides implementations for learning optimal classification trees, optimal fair classification trees, optimal classification trees robust to distribution shifts, and optimal prescriptive trees from observational data. We have designed the package to be easy to maintain and extend as new optimal decision tree problem classes, reformulation strategies, and solution algorithms are introduced. To this end, the package follows object-oriented design principles and supports both commercial (Gurobi) and open source (COIN-OR branch and cut) solvers. The package documentation and an extensive user guide can be found at https://d3m-research-group.github.io/odtlearn/. Additionally, users can view the package source code and submit feature requests and bug reports by visiting https://github.com/D3M-Research-Group/odtlearn.</description>

      <title>Two-Sided Nearest Neighbors: An adaptive and minimax optimal procedure for matrix completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nearest neighbor (NN) algorithms have been extensively used for missing data problems in recommender systems and sequential decision-making systems. Prior theoretical analysis has established favorable guarantees for NN when the underlying data is sufficiently smooth and the missingness probabilities are lower bounded. Here we analyze NN with non-smooth non-linear functions with vast amounts of missingness. In particular, we consider matrix completion settings where the entries of the underlying matrix follow a latent non-linear factor model, with the non-linearity belonging to a \Holder function class that is less smooth than Lipschitz. Our results establish following favorable properties for a suitable two-sided NN: (1) The mean squared error (MSE) of NN adapts to the smoothness of the non-linearity, (2) under certain regularity conditions, the NN error rate matches the rate obtained by an oracle equipped with the knowledge of both the row and column latent factors, and finally (3) NN's MSE is non-trivial for a wide range of settings even when several matrix entries might be missing deterministically. We support our theoretical findings via extensive numerical simulations and a case study with data from a mobile health study, HeartSteps.</description>

      <title>Gradient-free stochastic optimization for additive models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02131v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of zero-order optimization from noisy observations for an objective function satisfying the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz or the strong convexity condition. Additionally, we assume that the objective function has an additive structure and satisfies a higher-order smoothness property, characterized by the H\"older family of functions. The additive model for H\"older classes of functions is well-studied in the literature on nonparametric function estimation, where it is shown that such a model benefits from a substantial improvement of the estimation accuracy compared to the H\"older model without additive structure. We study this established framework in the context of gradient-free optimization. We propose a randomized gradient estimator that, when plugged into a gradient descent algorithm, allows one to achieve minimax optimal optimization error of the order $dT^{-(\beta-1)/\beta}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the problem, $T$ is the number of queries and $\beta\ge 2$ is the H\"older degree of smoothness. We conclude that, in contrast to nonparametric estimation problems, no substantial gain of accuracy can be achieved when using additive models in gradient-free optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A modern paradigm for generalization in machine learning and AI consists of pre-training a task-agnostic foundation model, generally obtained using self-supervised and multimodal contrastive learning. The resulting representations can be used for prediction on a downstream task for which no labeled data is available. We present a theoretical framework to better understand this approach, called zero-shot prediction. We identify the target quantities that zero-shot prediction aims to learn, or learns in passing, and the key conditional independence relationships that enable its generalization ability.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models for Time Series Forecasting: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models, initially developed for image synthesis, demonstrate remarkable generative capabilities. Recently, their application has expanded to time series forecasting (TSF), yielding promising results. Existing surveys on time series primarily focus on the application of diffusion models to time series tasks or merely provide model-by-model introductions of diffusion-based TSF models, without establishing a systematic taxonomy for existing diffusion-based TSF models. In this survey, we firstly introduce several standard diffusion models and their prevalent variants, explaining their adaptation to TSF tasks. Then, we provide a comprehensive review of diffusion models for TSF, paying special attention to the sources of conditional information and the mechanisms for integrating this conditioning within the models. In analyzing existing approaches using diffusion models for TSF, we provide a systematic categorization and a comprehensive summary of them in this survey. Furthermore, we examine several foundational diffusion models applied to TSF, alongside commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss the progress and limitations of these approaches, as well as potential future research directions for diffusion-based TSF. Overall, this survey offers a comprehensive overview of recent progress and future prospects for diffusion models in TSF, serving as a valuable reference for researchers in the field.</description>

      <title>Debiased maximum-likelihood estimators for hazard ratios under machine-learning adjustment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous studies have shown that hazard ratios between treatment groups estimated with the Cox model are uninterpretable because the indefinite baseline hazard of the model fails to identify temporal change in the risk set composition due to treatment assignment and unobserved factors among multiple, contradictory scenarios. To alleviate this problem, especially in studies based on observational data with uncontrolled dynamic treatment and real-time measurement of many covariates, we propose abandoning the baseline hazard and using machine learning to explicitly model the change in the risk set with or without latent variables. For this framework, we clarify the context in which hazard ratios can be causally interpreted, and then develop a method based on Neyman orthogonality to compute debiased maximum-likelihood estimators of hazard ratios. Numerical simulations confirm that the proposed method identifies the ground truth with minimal bias. These results lay the foundation for developing a useful, alternative method for causal inference with uncontrolled, observational data in modern epidemiology.</description>

      <title>In-Context Learning as Nonparametric Conditional Probability Estimation: Risk Bounds and Optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the expected excess risk of in-context learning (ICL) for multiclass classification. We formalize each task as a sequence of labeled examples followed by a query input; a pretrained model then estimates the query's conditional class probabilities. The expected excess risk is defined as the average truncated Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the predicted and true conditional class distributions over a specified family of tasks. We establish a new oracle inequality for this risk, based on KL divergence, in multiclass classification. This yields tight upper and lower bounds for transformer-based models, showing that the ICL estimator achieves the minimax optimal rate (up to logarithmic factors) for conditional probability estimation. From a technical standpoint, our results introduce a novel method for controlling generalization error via uniform empirical entropy. We further demonstrate that multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) can also perform ICL and attain the same optimal rate (up to logarithmic factors) under suitable assumptions, suggesting that effective ICL need not be exclusive to transformer architectures.</description>

Abstract: Machine unlearning work assumes a static, i.i.d training environment that doesn't truly exist. Modern ML pipelines need to learn, unlearn, and predict continuously on production streams of data. We translate batch unlearning to the online setting using notions of regret, sample complexity, and deletion capacity. We tighten regret bounds to a logarithmic $\mathcal{O}(\ln{T})$, a first for a certified unlearning algorithm. When fitted with an online variant of L-BFGS optimization, the algorithm achieves state of the art regret with a constant memory footprint. Such changes extend the lifespan of an ML model before expensive retraining, making for a more efficient unlearning process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.00422v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider stochastic gradient descents on the space of large symmetric matrices of suitable functions that are invariant under permuting the rows and columns using the same permutation. We establish deterministic limits of these random curves as the dimensions of the matrices go to infinity while the entries remain bounded. Under a ``small noise'' assumption the limit is shown to be the gradient flow of functions on graphons whose existence was established in Oh, Somani, Pal, and Tripathi, \texit{J Theor Probab 37, 1469--1522 (2024)}. We also consider limits of stochastic gradient descents with added properly scaled reflected Brownian noise. The limiting curve of graphons is characterized by a family of stochastic differential equations with reflections and can be thought of as an extension of the classical McKean-Vlasov limit for interacting diffusions to the graphon setting. The proofs introduce a family of infinite-dimensional exchangeable arrays of reflected diffusions and a novel notion of propagation of chaos for large matrices of diffusions converging to such arrays in a suitable sense.</description>

      <title>Distance and Kernel-Based Measures for Global and Local Two-Sample Conditional Distribution Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.08149v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Testing the equality of two conditional distributions is crucial in various modern applications, including transfer learning and causal inference. Despite its importance, this fundamental problem has received surprisingly little attention in the literature, with existing works focusing exclusively on global two-sample conditional distribution testing. Based on distance and kernel methods, this paper presents the first unified framework for both global and local two-sample conditional distribution testing. To this end, we introduce distance and kernel-based measures that characterize the homogeneity of two conditional distributions. Drawing from the concept of conditional U-statistics, we propose consistent estimators for these measures. Theoretically, we derive the convergence rates and the asymptotic distributions of the estimators under both the null and alternative hypotheses. Utilizing these measures, along with a local bootstrap approach, we develop global and local tests that can detect discrepancies between two conditional distributions at global and local levels, respectively. Our tests demonstrate reliable performance through simulations and real data analysis.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Mirror Gradient Flow as the limit of the Sinkhorn Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the sequence of marginals obtained from the iterations of the Sinkhorn algorithm or the iterative proportional fitting procedure (IPFP) on joint densities, converges to an absolutely continuous curve on the $2$-Wasserstein space, as the regularization parameter $\varepsilon$ goes to zero and the number of iterations is scaled as $1/\varepsilon$ (and other technical assumptions). This limit, which we call the Sinkhorn flow, is an example of a Wasserstein mirror gradient flow, a concept we introduce here inspired by the well-known Euclidean mirror gradient flows. In the case of Sinkhorn, the gradient is that of the relative entropy functional with respect to one of the marginals and the mirror is half of the squared Wasserstein distance functional from the other marginal. Interestingly, the norm of the velocity field of this flow can be interpreted as the metric derivative with respect to the linearized optimal transport (LOT) distance. An equivalent description of this flow is provided by the parabolic Monge-Amp\`{e}re PDE whose connection to the Sinkhorn algorithm was noticed by Berman (2020). We derive conditions for exponential convergence for this limiting flow. We also construct a Mckean-Vlasov diffusion whose marginal distributions follow the Sinkhorn flow.</description>

Abstract: Across a wide array of disciplines, many researchers use machine learning (ML) algorithms to identify a subgroup of individuals who are likely to benefit from a treatment the most (``exceptional responders'') or those who are harmed by it. A common approach to this subgroup identification problem consists of two steps. First, researchers estimate the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) using an ML algorithm. Next, they use the estimated CATE to select those individuals who are predicted to be most affected by the treatment, either positively or negatively. Unfortunately, CATE estimates are often biased and noisy. In addition, utilizing the same data to both identify a subgroup and estimate its group average treatment effect results in a multiple testing problem. To address these challenges, we develop uniform confidence bands for estimation of the group average treatment effect sorted by generic ML algorithm (GATES). Using these uniform confidence bands, researchers can identify, with a statistical guarantee, a subgroup whose GATES exceeds a certain effect size, regardless of how this effect size is chosen. The validity of the proposed methodology depends solely on randomization of treatment and random sampling of units. Importantly, our method does not require modeling assumptions and avoids a computationally intensive resampling procedure. A simulation study shows that the proposed uniform confidence bands are reasonably informative and have an appropriate empirical coverage even when the sample size is as small as 100. We analyze a clinical trial of late-stage prostate cancer and find a relatively large proportion of exceptional responders.</description>

      <title>Combining Evidence Across Filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09698v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In sequential anytime-valid inference, any admissible procedure must be based on e-processes: generalizations of test martingales that quantify the accumulated evidence against a composite null hypothesis at any stopping time. This paper proposes a method for combining e-processes constructed in different filtrations but for the same null. Although e-processes in the same filtration can be combined effortlessly (by averaging), e-processes in different filtrations cannot because their validity in a coarser filtration does not translate to a finer filtration. This issue arises in sequential tests of randomness and independence, as well as in the evaluation of sequential forecasters. We establish that a class of functions called adjusters can lift arbitrary e-processes across filtrations. The result yields a generally applicable "adjust-then-combine" procedure, which we demonstrate on the problem of testing randomness in real-world financial data. Furthermore, we prove a characterization theorem for adjusters that formalizes a sense in which using adjusters is necessary. There are two major implications. First, if we have a powerful e-process in a coarsened filtration, then we readily have a powerful e-process in the original filtration. Second, when we coarsen the filtration to construct an e-process, there is a logarithmic cost to recovering validity in the original filtration.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Offline Data in Linear Latent Contextual Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging offline data is an attractive way to accelerate online sequential decision-making. However, it is crucial to account for latent states in users or environments in the offline data, and latent bandits form a compelling model for doing so. In this light, we design end-to-end latent bandit algorithms capable of handing uncountably many latent states. We focus on a linear latent contextual bandit $-$ a linear bandit where each user has its own high-dimensional reward parameter in $\mathbb{R}^{d_A}$, but reward parameters across users lie in a low-rank latent subspace of dimension $d_K \ll d_A$. First, we provide an offline algorithm to learn this subspace with provable guarantees. We then present two online algorithms that utilize the output of this offline algorithm to accelerate online learning. The first enjoys $\tilde{O}(\min(d_A\sqrt{T}, d_K\sqrt{T}(1+\sqrt{d_AT/d_KN})))$ regret guarantees, so that the effective dimension is lower when the size $N$ of the offline dataset is larger. We prove a matching lower bound on regret, showing that our algorithm is minimax optimal. The second is a practical algorithm that enjoys only a slightly weaker guarantee, but is computationally efficient. We also establish the efficacy of our methods using experiments on both synthetic data and real-life movie recommendation data from MovieLens. Finally, we theoretically establish the generality of the latent bandit model by proving a de Finetti theorem for stateless decision processes.</description>

      <title>A Law of Next-Token Prediction in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13442v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely employed across various application domains, yet their black-box nature poses significant challenges to understanding how these models process input data internally to make predictions. In this paper, we introduce a precise and quantitative law that governs the learning of contextualized token embeddings through intermediate layers in pre-trained LLMs for next-token prediction. Our findings reveal that each layer contributes equally to enhancing prediction accuracy, from the lowest to the highest layer -- a universal phenomenon observed across a diverse array of open-source LLMs, irrespective of their architectures or pre-training data. We demonstrate that this law offers new perspectives and actionable insights to inform and guide practices in LLM development and applications, including model scaling, pre-training tasks, and interpretation.</description>

      <title>Variance-reduced first-order methods for deterministically constrained stochastic nonconvex optimization with strong convergence guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09906v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of deterministically constrained stochastic optimization problems. Existing methods typically aim to find an $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point, where the expected violations of both constraints and first-order stationarity are within a prescribed accuracy $\epsilon$. However, in many practical applications, it is crucial that the constraints be nearly satisfied with certainty, making such an $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point potentially undesirable due to the risk of significant constraint violations. To address this issue, we propose single-loop variance-reduced stochastic first-order methods, where the stochastic gradient of the stochastic component is computed using either a truncated recursive momentum scheme or a truncated Polyak momentum scheme for variance reduction, while the gradient of the deterministic component is computed exactly. Under the error bound condition with a parameter $\theta \geq 1$ and other suitable assumptions, we establish that these methods respectively achieve a sample and first-order operation complexity of $\widetilde O(\epsilon^{-\max\{\theta+2, 2\theta\}})$ and $\widetilde O(\epsilon^{-\max\{4, 2\theta\}})$ for finding a stronger $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point, where the constraint violation is within $\epsilon$ with certainty, and the expected violation of first-order stationarity is within $\epsilon$. For $\theta=1$, these complexities reduce to $\widetilde O(\epsilon^{-3})$ and $\widetilde O(\epsilon^{-4})$ respectively, which match, up to a logarithmic factor, the best-known complexities achieved by existing methods for finding an $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point of unconstrained smooth stochastic optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Learning in complex action spaces without policy gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While conventional wisdom holds that policy gradient methods are better suited to complex action spaces than action-value methods, foundational work has shown that the two paradigms are equivalent in small, finite action spaces (O'Donoghue et al., 2017; Schulman et al., 2017a). This raises the question of why their computational applicability and performance diverge as the complexity of the action space increases. We hypothesize that the apparent superiority of policy gradients in such settings stems not from intrinsic qualities of the paradigm but from universal principles that can also be applied to action-value methods, enabling similar functions. We identify three such principles and provide a framework for incorporating them into action-value methods. To support our hypothesis, we instantiate this framework in what we term QMLE, for Q-learning with maximum likelihood estimation. Our results show that QMLE can be applied to complex action spaces at a computational cost comparable to that of policy gradient methods, all without using policy gradients. Furthermore, QMLE exhibits strong performance on the DeepMind Control Suite, even when compared to state-of-the-art methods such as DMPO and D4PG.</description>

Abstract: We address the issue of computing the non-linear shrinkage formulas for the weighted sample covariance in high dimension. We use theoretical properties of the asymptotic sample spectrum in order to derive the \textit{WeSpeR} algorithm and significantly speed up non-linear shrinkage in dimension higher than $1000$. Empirical tests confirm the good properties of the \textit{WeSpeR} algorithm. We provide the implementation in PyTorch for it.</description>

      <title>FIT-GNN: Faster Inference Time for GNNs that 'FIT' in Memory Using Coarsening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15001v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) remains a significant challenge. To tackle this, methods like coarsening, condensation, and computation trees are used to train on a smaller graph, resulting in faster computation. Nonetheless, prior research has not adequately addressed the computational costs during the inference phase. This paper presents a novel approach to improve the scalability of GNNs by reducing computational burden during the inference phase using graph coarsening. We demonstrate two different methods -- Extra Nodes and Cluster Nodes. Our study extends the application of graph coarsening for graph-level tasks, including graph classification and graph regression. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of our approach. Our results show that the proposed method achieves orders of magnitude improvements in single-node inference time compared to traditional approaches. Furthermore, it significantly reduces memory consumption for node and graph classification and regression tasks, enabling efficient training and inference on low-resource devices where conventional methods are impractical. Notably, these computational advantages are achieved while maintaining competitive performance relative to baseline models.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Kolmogorov Barrier: A Learnable Weighted Hybrid Autoencoder for Model Order Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18148v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.</description>

      <title>Memory Capacity of Nonlinear Recurrent Networks: Is it Informative?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The total memory capacity (MC) of linear recurrent neural networks (RNNs) has been proven to be equal to the rank of the corresponding Kalman controllability matrix, and it is almost surely maximal for connectivity and input weight matrices drawn from regular distributions. This fact questions the usefulness of this metric in distinguishing the performance of linear RNNs in the processing of stochastic signals. This work shows that the MC of random nonlinear RNNs yields arbitrary values within established upper and lower bounds depending exclusively on the scale of the input process. This confirms that the existing definition of MC in linear and nonlinear cases has no practical value.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Learning Sparse Superposed Features with Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05407v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success of deep networks is crucially attributed to their ability to capture latent features within a representation space. In this work, we investigate whether the underlying learned features of a model can be efficiently retrieved through feedback from an agent, such as a large language model (LLM), in the form of relative \tt{triplet comparisons}. These features may represent various constructs, including dictionaries in LLMs or a covariance matrix of Mahalanobis distances. We analyze the feedback complexity associated with learning a feature matrix in sparse settings. Our results establish tight bounds when the agent is permitted to construct activations and demonstrate strong upper bounds in sparse scenarios when the agent's feedback is limited to distributional information. We validate our theoretical findings through experiments on two distinct applications: feature recovery from Recursive Feature Machines and dictionary extraction from sparse autoencoders trained on Large Language Models.</description>

      <title>A Gap Between the Gaussian RKHS and Neural Networks: An Infinite-Center Asymptotic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent works have characterized the function-space inductive bias of infinite-width bounded-norm single-hidden-layer neural networks as a kind of bounded-variation-type space. This novel neural network Banach space encompasses many classical multivariate function spaces, including certain Sobolev spaces and the spectral Barron spaces. Notably, this Banach space also includes functions that exhibit less classical regularity, such as those that only vary in a few directions. On bounded domains, it is well-established that the Gaussian reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) strictly embeds into this Banach space, demonstrating a clear gap between the Gaussian RKHS and the neural network Banach space. It turns out that when investigating these spaces on unbounded domains, e.g., all of $\mathbb{R}^d$, the story is fundamentally different. We establish the following fundamental result: Certain functions that lie in the Gaussian RKHS have infinite norm in the neural network Banach space. This provides a nontrivial gap between kernel methods and neural networks by exhibiting functions that kernel methods easily represent, whereas neural networks cannot.</description>

      <title>Armijo Line-search Can Make (Stochastic) Gradient Descent Provably Faster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00229v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Armijo line-search (Armijo-LS) is a standard method to set the step-size for gradient descent (GD). For smooth functions, Armijo-LS alleviates the need to know the global smoothness constant L and adapts to the ``local'' smoothness, enabling GD to converge faster. Existing theoretical analyses show that GD with Armijo-LS (GD-LS) can result in constant factor improvements over GD with a 1/L step-size (denoted as GD(1/L)). We strengthen these results and show that if the objective function satisfies a certain non-uniform smoothness condition, GD-LS can result in a faster convergence rate than GD(1/L). In particular, we prove that for convex objectives corresponding to logistic regression and multi-class classification, GD-LS can converge to the optimum at a linear rate, and hence improves over the sublinear convergence of GD(1/L). Furthermore, for non-convex objectives satisfying gradient domination (e.g., those corresponding to the softmax policy gradient in RL or generalized linear models with a logistic link function), GD-LS can match the fast convergence of algorithms tailored for these specific settings. Finally, we analyze the convergence of stochastic GD with a stochastic line-search on convex losses under the interpolation assumption.</description>

      <title>Responsible Machine Learning via Mixed-Integer Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last few decades, Machine Learning (ML) has achieved significant success across domains ranging from healthcare, sustainability, and the social sciences, to criminal justice and finance. But its deployment in increasingly sophisticated, critical, and sensitive areas affecting individuals, the groups they belong to, and society as a whole raises critical concerns around fairness, transparency and robustness, among others. As the complexity and scale of ML systems and of the settings in which they are deployed grow, so does the need for responsible ML methods that address these challenges while providing guaranteed performance in deployment.
  Mixed-integer optimization (MIO) offers a powerful framework for embedding responsible ML considerations directly into the learning process while maintaining performance. For example, it enables learning of inherently transparent models that can conveniently incorporate fairness or other domain specific constraints. This tutorial paper provides an accessible and comprehensive introduction to this topic discussing both theoretical and practical aspects. It outlines some of the core principles of responsible ML, their importance in applications, and the practical utility of MIO for building ML models that align with these principles. Through examples and mathematical formulations, it illustrates practical strategies and available tools for efficiently solving MIO problems for responsible ML. It concludes with a discussion on current limitations and open research questions, providing suggestions for future work.</description>

      <title>Bigger Isn't Always Memorizing: Early Stopping Overparameterized Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI, yet the mechanisms underlying their generalization remain poorly understood. In fact, if these models were perfectly minimizing their training loss, they would just generate data belonging to their training set, i.e., memorize, as empirically found in the overparameterized regime. We revisit this view by showing that, in highly overparameterized diffusion models, generalization in natural data domains is progressively achieved during training before the onset of memorization. Our results, ranging from image to language diffusion models, systematically support the empirical law that memorization time is proportional to the dataset size. Generalization vs. memorization is then best understood as a competition between time scales. We show that this phenomenology is recovered in diffusion models learning a simple probabilistic context-free grammar with random rules, where generalization corresponds to the hierarchical acquisition of deeper grammar rules as training time grows, and the generalization cost of early stopping can be characterized. We summarize these results in a phase diagram. Overall, our results support that a principled early-stopping criterion - scaling with dataset size - can effectively optimize generalization while avoiding memorization, with direct implications for hyperparameter transfer and privacy-sensitive applications.</description>

      <title>General agents contain world models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01622v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Are world models a necessary ingredient for flexible, goal-directed behaviour, or is model-free learning sufficient? We provide a formal answer to this question, showing that any agent capable of generalizing to multi-step goal-directed tasks must have learned a predictive model of its environment. We show that this model can be extracted from the agent's policy, and that increasing the agents performance or the complexity of the goals it can achieve requires learning increasingly accurate world models. This has a number of consequences: from developing safe and general agents, to bounding agent capabilities in complex environments, and providing new algorithms for eliciting world models from agents.</description>

      <title>A Log-Linear Analytics Approach to Cost Model Regularization for Inpatient Stays through Diagnostic Code Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cost models in healthcare research must balance interpretability, accuracy, and parameter consistency. However, interpretable models often struggle to achieve both accuracy and consistency. Ordinary least squares (OLS) models for high-dimensional regression can be accurate but fail to produce stable regression coefficients over time when using highly granular ICD-10 diagnostic codes as predictors. This instability arises because many ICD-10 codes are infrequent in healthcare datasets. While regularization methods such as Ridge can address this issue, they risk discarding important predictors. Here, we demonstrate that reducing the granularity of ICD-10 codes is an effective regularization strategy within OLS while preserving the representation of all diagnostic code categories. By truncating ICD-10 codes from seven characters to six or fewer, we reduce the dimensionality of the regression problem while maintaining model interpretability and consistency. Mathematically, the merging of predictors in OLS leads to increased trace of the Hessian matrix, which reduces the variance of coefficient estimation. Our findings explain why broader diagnostic groupings like DRGs and HCC codes are favored over highly granular ICD-10 codes in real-world risk adjustment and cost models.</description>

      <title>Solving dynamic portfolio selection problems via score-based diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the dynamic mean-variance portfolio selection problem in a {\it model-free} manner, based on (generative) diffusion models. We propose using data sampled from the real model $\mathbb P$ (which is unknown) with limited size to train a generative model $\mathbb Q$ (from which we can easily and adequately sample). With adaptive training and sampling methods that are tailor-made for time series data, we obtain quantification bounds between $\mathbb P$ and $\mathbb Q$ in terms of the adapted Wasserstein metric $\mathcal A W_2$. Importantly, the proposed adapted sampling method also facilitates {\it conditional sampling}. In the second part of this paper, we provide the stability of the mean-variance portfolio optimization problems in $\mathcal A W _2$. Then, combined with the error bounds and the stability result, we propose a policy gradient algorithm based on the generative environment, in which our innovative adapted sampling method provides approximate scenario generators. We illustrate the performance of our algorithm on both simulated and real data. For real data, the algorithm based on the generative environment produces portfolios that beat several important baselines, including the Markowitz portfolio, the equal weight (naive) portfolio, and S\&amp;P 500.</description>

      <title>Graded Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Graded Transformer framework, a new class of sequence models that embeds algebraic inductive biases through grading transformations on vector spaces. Extending Graded Neural Networks (GNNs), we propose two architectures: the Linearly Graded Transformer (LGT) and the Exponentially Graded Transformer (EGT). These models apply parameterized scaling operators, governed by fixed or learnable grading tuples and in the case of EGT exponential factors, to encode hierarchical structure in attention and representation layers and to improve efficiency for structured data.
  We establish rigorous guarantees, including universal approximation theorems for continuous and Sobolev functions, reduced sample complexity via effective VC dimension bounds, Lipschitz continuity of graded operations, and robustness to perturbations. A graded loss ensures gradient stability and alignment with domain priors during optimization. By treating grades as differentiable parameters, the framework enables adaptive feature prioritization, overcoming limitations of fixed grades in earlier models.
  The Graded Transformer provides a mathematically principled approach to hierarchical learning and neuro-symbolic reasoning. Applications include algebraic geometry (moduli spaces and zeta functions), physics (multiscale systems), natural language processing (syntactic parsing), biological sequence analysis (variant prediction), robotics and autonomous systems (safety-critical prioritization), the automotive industry (certifiable AI for ADAS), and blockchain and financial cryptography (secure coding and structured prediction).</description>

      <title>Reduced-Order Modeling of Cyclo-Stationary Time Series Using Score-Based Generative Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many natural systems exhibit cyclo-stationary behavior characterized by periodic forcing such as annual and diurnal cycles. We present a data-driven method leveraging recent advances in score-based generative modeling to construct reduced-order models for such cyclo-stationary time series. Our approach accurately reproduces the statistical properties and temporal correlations of the original data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic trajectories. We demonstrate the performance of the method through application to the Planet Simulator (PlaSim) climate model, constructing a reduced-order model for the 20 leading principal components of surface temperature driven by the annual cycle. The resulting surrogate model accurately reproduces the marginal and joint probability distributions, autocorrelation functions, and spatial coherence of the original climate system across multiple validation metrics. The approach offers substantial computational advantages, enabling generation of centuries of synthetic climate data in minutes compared to weeks required for equivalent full model simulations. This work opens new possibilities for efficient modeling of periodically forced systems across diverse scientific domains, providing a principled framework for balancing computational efficiency with physical fidelity in reduced-order modeling applications.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Discovery of Digital Twins in Biomedical Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent technological advances have expanded the availability of high-throughput biological datasets, enabling the reliable design of digital twins of biomedical systems or patients. Such computational tools represent key reaction networks driving perturbation or drug response and can guide drug discovery and personalized therapeutics. Yet, their development still relies on laborious data integration by the human modeler, so that automated approaches are critically needed. The success of data-driven system discovery in Physics, rooted in clean datasets and well-defined governing laws, has fueled interest in applying similar techniques in Biology, which presents unique challenges. Here, we reviewed methodologies for automatically inferring digital twins from biological time series, which mostly involve symbolic or sparse regression. We evaluate algorithms according to eight biological and methodological challenges, associated to noisy/incomplete data, multiple conditions, prior knowledge integration, latent variables, high dimensionality, unobserved variable derivatives, candidate library design, and uncertainty quantification. Upon these criteria, sparse regression generally outperformed symbolic regression, particularly when using Bayesian frameworks. We further highlight the emerging role of deep learning and large language models, which enable innovative prior knowledge integration, though the reliability and consistency of such approaches must be improved. While no single method addresses all challenges, we argue that progress in learning digital twins will come from hybrid and modular frameworks combining chemical reaction network-based mechanistic grounding, Bayesian uncertainty quantification, and the generative and knowledge integration capacities of deep learning. To support their development, we further propose a benchmarking framework to evaluate methods across all challenges.</description>
