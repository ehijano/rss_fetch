      <title>surfQuake: A new Python toolbox for the workflow process of seismic sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: surfQuake is a new software designed to streamline the estimation of seismic source parameters. Its comprehensive set of toolboxes automate the determination of seismic arrival times, event association and locations, moment magnitude from P- or S- wave displacement spectra and moment tensor inversions within a Bayesian framework. surfQuake is programmed in Python 3 and offers the users the possibility of three programming levels for flexibility and customization. The core library allows users to integrate the core of surfQuake into their preexisting scripts, giving advanced users full control, while the Command Line Interface gives users access to an upper layer that simplifies the use of the core. Alternatively, surfQuake core is wrapped by a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and connected to a SQLite database making it accessible to users with little coding experience. The software has been fully tested with an earthquake cluster of more than 2000 events, that occurred in central Pyrenees in 2021-22. The source parameters retrieved from the cluster and the basic statistics associated with them are displayed using the surfQuake database toolbox. Additionally, we offer a web tutorial with the documentation of surfQuake and a set of usage examples for the three programming levels.</description>

      <title>Reformulation of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory for Non-Perturbative Dynamics: The Rabi Oscillation Problem Resolved</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rabi oscillations have long been thought to be out of reach in simulations using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), a prominent symptom of the failure of the adiabatic approximation for non-perturbative dynamics. We present a reformulation of TDDFT which requires response quantities only, thus enabling an adiabatic approximation to predict such dynamics accurately because the functional is evaluated on a domain much closer to the domain for which it was derived. Our reformulation applies to any real-time dynamics, redeeming TDDFT far from equilibrium. Examples of a resonantly-driven local excitation in a model He atom, and charge-transfer in the LiCN molecule are given.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning of Individual Kohn-Sham States: Interpretable Representations and Consequences for Downstream Predictions of Many-Body Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Representation learning for the electronic structure problem is a major challenge of machine learning in computational condensed matter and materials physics. Within quantum mechanical first principles approaches, Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) is the preeminent tool for understanding electronic structure, and the high-dimensional wavefunctions calculated in this approach serve as the building block for downstream calculations of correlated many-body excitations and related physical observables. Here, we use variational autoencoders (VAE) for the unsupervised learning of high-dimensional DFT wavefunctions and show that these wavefunctions lie in a low-dimensional manifold within the latent space. Our model autonomously determines the optimal representation of the electronic structure, avoiding limitations due to manual feature engineering and selection in prior work. To demonstrate the utility of the latent space representation of the DFT wavefunction, we use it for the supervised training of neural networks (NN) for downstream prediction of the quasiparticle bandstructures within the GW formalism, which includes many-electron correlations beyond DFT. The GW prediction achieves a low error of 0.11 eV for a combined test set of metals and semiconductors drawn from the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB), suggesting that latent space representation captures key physical information from the original data. Finally, we explore the interpretability of the VAE representation and show that the successful representation learning and downstream prediction by our model is derived from the smoothness of the VAE latent space, which also enables the generation of wavefunctions on arbitrary points in latent space. Our work provides a novel and general machine-learning framework for investigating electronic structure and many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Designing athermal disordered solids with automatic differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to control forces between sub-micron-scale building blocks offers considerable potential for designing new materials through self-assembly. A typical paradigm is to first identify a particular (crystal) structure that has some desired property, and then design building-block interactions so that this structure assembles spontaneously. While significant theoretical and experimental progress has been made in assembling complicated structures in a variety of systems, this two-step paradigm fundamentally fails for structurally disordered solids, which lack a well-defined structure to use as a target. Here we show that disordered solids can still be treated from an inverse self-assembly perspective by targeting material properties directly. Using the Poisson's ratio, $\nu$, as a primary example, we show how differentiable programming connects experimentally relevant interaction parameters with emergent behavior, allowing us to iteratively "train" the system until we find the set of interactions that leads to the Poisson's ratio we desire. Beyond the Poisson's ratio, we also tune the pressure and a measure of local 8-fold structural order, as well as multiple properties simultaneously, demonstrating the potential for nontrivial design in disordered solids. This approach is highly robust, transferable, and scalable, can handle a wide variety of model systems, properties of interest, and preparation dynamics, and can optimize over 100s or even 1000s of parameters. This result connects the fields of disordered solids and inverse self-assembly, indicating that many of the tools and ideas that have been developed to understand the assembly of crystals can also be used to control the properties of disordered solids.</description>

      <title>Identifying phase transitions in physical systems with neural networks: a neural architecture search perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of machine learning algorithms to investigate phase transitions in physical systems is a valuable way to better understand the characteristics of these systems. Neural networks have been used to extract information of phases and phase transitions directly from many-body configurations. However, one limitation of neural networks is that they require the definition of the model architecture and parameters previous to their application, and such determination is itself a difficult problem. In this paper, we investigate for the first time the relationship between the accuracy of neural networks for information of phases and the network configuration (that comprises the architecture and hyperparameters). We formulate the phase analysis as a regression task, address the question of generating data that reflects the different states of the physical system, and evaluate the performance of neural architecture search for this task. After obtaining the optimized architectures, we further implement smart data processing and analytics by means of neuron coverage metrics, assessing the capability of these metrics to estimate phase transitions. Our results identify the neuron coverage metric as promising for detecting phase transitions in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum optical classifier with superexponential speedup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum optical pattern recognition method for binary classification tasks. Without direct image reconstruction, it classifies an object in terms of the rate of two-photon coincidences at the output of a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer, where both the input and the classifier parameters are encoded into single-photon states. Our method exhibits the same behaviour of a classical neuron of unit depth. Once trained, it shows a constant $\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity in the number of computational operations and photons required by a single classification. This is a superexponential advantage over a classical neuron (that is at least linear in the image resolution). We provide simulations and analytical comparisons with analogous neural network architectures.</description>

      <title>A Python GPU-accelerated solver for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and applications to many-body cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TorchGPE is a general-purpose Python package developed for solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). This solver is designed to integrate wave functions across a spectrum of linear and non-linear potentials. A distinctive aspect of TorchGPE is its modular approach, which allows the incorporation of arbitrary self-consistent and time-dependent potentials, e.g., those relevant in many-body cavity QED models. The package employs a symmetric split-step Fourier propagation method, effective in both real and imaginary time. In our work, we demonstrate a significant improvement in computational efficiency by leveraging GPU computing capabilities. With the integration of the latter technology, TorchGPE achieves a substantial speed-up with respect to conventional CPU-based methods, greatly expanding the scope and potential of research in this field.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-Induced Transitions in Anisotropic Two-Dimensional Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) turbulence features an inverse energy cascade that produces large-scale flow structures such as large-scale vortices (LSVs) and unidirectional jets. We investigate the dynamics of such structures using extensive direct numerical simulations (DNS) of randomly forced, viscously damped 2D turbulence within a periodic rectangular (Cartesian) domain $[0,L_x]\times[0,L_y]$. LSVs form and dominate the system when the domain aspect ratio $\delta = L_x/L_y \approx 1$, while unidirectional jets predominate at $\delta \gtrsim 1.1$. At intermediate $\delta$, both structures are metastable, with noise-induced transitions between LSVs and jets. We derive and verify predictions for the dependence of kinetic energy E and flow polarity on the nondimensional control parameters. We further collect detailed statistics on the lifetimes of LSVs and jets from DNS runs that are up to 10738 viscous diffusive times long. The distribution of the lifetimes is consistent with that of a memoryless process. Our DNS show an exponential dependence of the mean lifetime on $\delta$. Mean lifetimes depend sensitively on the Reynolds number Re: as Re increases, the energy gap between LSV (lower E) and jet states (higher E) arising from anisotropic dissipation increases, leading to an approximately exponential increase in lifetimes with Re for both LSVs and jets. Similarly, as the forcing scale decreases, transitions become less frequent. We study the transitions in detail, revealing that they occur in two stages: an initial, rapid redistribution of kinetic energy by nonlinear triadic interactions deforms LSVs into jets or vice versa. In the second stage, the energy of the newly formed structure slowly adjusts to its associated equilibrium value on a longer, viscous timescale, producing hysteresis. Our findings shed new light on the dynamics of coherent large-scale structures in anisotropic turbulence.</description>

      <title>Effect of the presence of pinned particles on the structural parameters of a liquid and correlation between structure and dynamics at the local level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pinning particles at the equilibrium configuration of the liquid is expected not to affect the structure and any property that depends on the structure while slowing down the dynamics. This leads to a breakdown of the structure dynamics correlation. Here, we calculate two structural quantities, the pair excess entropy, $S_2$, and the mean field caging potential, the inverse of which is our structural order parameter (SOP). We show that when the pinned particles are treated the same way as the mobile particles, both $S_2$ and SOP of the mobile particles remain the same as that of the unpinned system, and the structure dynamics correlation decreases with an increase in pinning density, "c". However, when we treat the pinned particles as a different species, even if we consider that the structure does not change, the expression of $S_2$ and SOP changes. The microscopic expressions show that interaction between a pinned and mobile particle affects $S_2$ and SOP more than the interaction between two mobile particles. We show that a similar effect is also present in the calculation of the excess entropy and the primary reason for the well-known vanishing of the configurational entropy at high temperatures. We further show that contrary to common belief, the pinning process does change the structure. When these two effects are considered, both $S_2$ and SOP decrease with an increase in "c", and the correlation between the structural parameters and the dynamics continues even for higher values of "c".</description>

      <title>Structural complexity of snapshots of 2D Fermi-Hubbard systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of quantum gas microscopy for two-dimensional optical lattices has provided an unparalleled tool to study the Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) with ultracold atoms. Spin-resolved projective measurements, or snapshots, have played a significant role in quantifying correlation functions which uncover underlying physical phenomena such as antiferromagnetism at commensurate filling on bipartite lattices, and other charge and spin correlations, as well as dynamical properties at various densities. However, in order to interpret these results and to establish temperature scales, comparison against theory is generally needed. Here, we employ a recent concept, the {\em multi-scale structural complexity}, and show that when computed for the snapshots (of either single spin species, local moments, or total density) it can provide a theory-free property, immediately accessible to experiments. Specifically, after benchmarking results for Ising and XY models, we study the structural complexity of snapshots of the repulsive FHM in the two-dimensional square lattice as a function of doping and temperature. We generate projective measurements using determinant quantum Monte Carlo and compare their complexities against those from the experiment. We demonstrate that these complexities are linked to relevant physical observables such as the entropy and double occupancy. Their behaviors capture the development of correlations and relevant length scales in the system. We provide an open-source code in Python which can be implemented into data analysis routines in experimental settings for the square lattice.</description>

      <title>Density-Matrix Mean-Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mean-field theories have proven to be efficient tools for exploring various phases of matter, complementing alternative methods that are more precise but also more computationally demanding. Conventional mean-field theories often fall short in capturing quantum fluctuations, which restricts their applicability to systems characterized by strong quantum fluctuations. In this article, we propose a novel mean-field theory, density-matrix mean-field theory (DMMFT). DMMFT constructs effective Hamiltonians, incorporating quantum environments shaped by entanglements quantified by the reduced density matrices. Therefore, it offers a systematic and unbiased approach to account for effects of fluctuations and entanglements in quantum ordered phases. As demonstrative examples, we show that DMMFT can not only quantitatively evaluate the renormalization of order parameters induced by quantum fluctuations but can even detect the topological order of quantum phases. Additionally, we discuss the extensions of DMMFT for systems at finite temperatures and those with disorders. Our work provides a novel and efficient approach to explore phases exhibiting unconventional quantum orders, which can be particularly beneficial for investigating frustrated spin systems in high spatial dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the magnetization dynamics in nanomagnet vertices often found in artificial spin ices. Our analysis involves creating a simplified model that depicts edge magnetization using magnetic charges. We utilize the model to explore the energy landscape, its associated curvatures, and the fundamental modes. Our study uncovers specific magnonic regimes and transitions between magnetization states, marked by zero-modes, which can be understood within the framework of Landau theory. To verify our model, we compare it with micromagnetic simulations, demonstrating a noteworthy agreement.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic phonon polaritons and wave vector direction dependent dielectric tensors in anisotropic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic phonon polariton is important in precisely controlling photons at the nanoscale. It was common practice to calculate the dielectric function of the phonon polariton system with the Drude-Lorenz model. We considered the impact of LO-TO splitting while applying the Drude-Lorenz model. Then the dielectric functions become wave vector direction dependent besides electric polarization direction dependent. Our results show that considering LO-TO splitting can more accurately predict dielectric functions. Additionally, we discovered that, besides hexagonal BN, hexagonal AlN exhibits a wide hyperbolic frequency band range, while the other four materials display it scarcely. Furthermore, we found that the phonon frequency, lifetime, and the difference of infrared active transverse optical phonon frequencies with different wave vector directions are critical factors in determining the width of the hyperbolic frequency band range. We also found some dumbbell-shaped and butterfly-shaped isofrequency curves in h-AlN, h-GaP, and especially h-GaN. Our study provides a fresh perspective on understanding the dielectric properties of these materials and lays a theoretical foundation for further exploration and development of new hyperbolic phonon polariton materials.</description>

      <title>A high-fidelity finite volume scheme for ideal magnetohydrodynamics equations using boundary variation diminishing algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A high-fidelity finite volume scheme based on the BVD (boundary variation diminishing) concept is proposed in this study to solve the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. A hybrid spatial reconstruction profile, consisting of a quadratic polynomial and a steepness-adjustable hyperbolic tangent function, is adopted to reproduce the accurate solutions of the complex magnetohydrodynamics flows. The BVD principle is used to find a optimal combination of these two types of spatial reconstructions by comparing the variations of the interface values interpolated in two adjacent cells, aiming to remove the non-physical oscillations around discontinuities by switching the quadratic polynomial to a step-shaped function. Additionally, a constrained transport (CT) method is applied in this study to assure the non-divergent solution of the magnetic field. The widely used numerical tests in one and two dimensional cases were checked in this study. The numerical results can retrieve the accuracy of a $3^{rd}$-order linear scheme in the convergence test for both advection and MHD equations and capture the strong shock waves in MHD flows without spurious oscillations. In comparison with the results of a $3^{rd}$-order WENO (weighted essentially non-oscillatory) scheme, the proposed scheme gains more accurate solutions not only for the strong discontinuities but also the smooth structures across scales. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to build a high-fidelity model for ideal MHD equations by a BVD algorithm. Numerical results are competitive to those of existing advanced models and thus the BVD algorithm has promising potentials to build practical models for various MHD flows.</description>
