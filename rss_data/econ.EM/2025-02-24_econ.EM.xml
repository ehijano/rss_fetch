      <title>biastest: Testing parameter equality across different models in Stata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The biastest command in Stata is a powerful and user-friendly tool designed to compare the coefficients of different regression models, enabling researchers to assess the robustness and consistency of their empirical findings. This command is particularly valuable for evaluating alternative modeling approaches, such as ordinary least squares versus robust regression, robust regression versus median regression, quantile regression across different quantiles, and fixed effects versus random effects models in panel data analysis. By providing both variable-specific and joint tests, biastest command offers a comprehensive framework for detecting bias or significant differences in model estimates, ensuring that researchers can make informed decisions about model selection and interpretation.</description>

      <title>A Supervised Screening and Regularized Factor-Based Method for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Factor-based forecasting using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is an effective machine learning tool for dimension reduction with many applications in statistics, economics, and finance. This paper introduces a Supervised Screening and Regularized Factor-based (SSRF) framework that systematically addresses high-dimensional predictor sets through a structured four-step procedure integrating both static and dynamic forecasting mechanisms. The static approach selects predictors via marginal correlation screening and scales them using univariate predictive slopes, while the dynamic method screens and scales predictors based on time series regression incorporating lagged predictors. PCA then extracts latent factors from the scaled predictors, followed by LASSO regularization to refine predictive accuracy. In the simulation study, we validate the effectiveness of SSRF and identify its parameter adjustment strategies in high-dimensional data settings. An empirical analysis of macroeconomic indices in China demonstrates that the SSRF method generally outperforms several commonly used forecasting techniques in out-of-sample predictions.</description>

      <title>Clustered Network Connectedness: A New Measurement Framework with Application to Global Equity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network connections, both across and within markets, are central in countless economic contexts. In recent decades, a large literature has developed and applied flexible methods for measuring network connectedness and its evolution, based on variance decompositions from vector autoregressions (VARs), as in Diebold and Yilmaz (2014). Those VARs are, however, typically identified using full orthogonalization (Sims, 1980), or no orthogonalization (Koop, Pesaran, and Potter, 1996; Pesaran and Shin, 1998), which, although useful, are special and extreme cases of a more general framework that we develop in this paper. In particular, we allow network nodes to be connected in "clusters", such as asset classes, industries, regions, etc., where shocks are orthogonal across clusters (Sims style orthogonalized identification) but correlated within clusters (Koop-Pesaran-Potter-Shin style generalized identification), so that the ordering of network nodes is relevant across clusters but irrelevant within clusters. After developing the clustered connectedness framework, we apply it in a detailed empirical exploration of sixteen country equity markets spanning three global regions.</description>

      <title>Modifying Final Splits of Classification Tree for Fine-tuning Subpopulation Target in Policy Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Policymakers often use Classification and Regression Trees (CART) to partition populations based on binary outcomes and target subpopulations whose probability of the binary event exceeds a threshold. However, classic CART and knowledge distillation method whose student model is a CART (referred to as KD-CART) do not minimize the misclassification risk associated with classifying the latent probabilities of these binary events. To reduce the misclassification risk, we propose two methods, Penalized Final Split (PFS) and Maximizing Distance Final Split (MDFS). PFS incorporates a tunable penalty into the standard CART splitting criterion function. MDFS maximizes a weighted sum of distances between node means and the threshold. It can point-identify the optimal split under the unique intersect latent probability assumption. In addition, we develop theoretical result for MDFS splitting rule estimation, which has zero asymptotic risk. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that these methods predominately outperform classic CART and KD-CART in terms of misclassification error. Furthermore, in our empirical evaluations, these methods provide deeper insights than the two baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Inequality Sensitive Optimal Treatment Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The egalitarian equivalent, $ee$, of a societal distribution of outcomes with mean $m$ is the outcome level such that the evaluator is indifferent between the distribution of outcomes and a society in which everyone obtains an outcome of $ee$. For an inequality averse evaluator, $ee &lt; m$. In this paper, I extend the optimal treatment choice framework in Manski (2024) to the case where the welfare evaluation is made using egalitarian equivalent measures, and derive optimal treatment rules for the Bayesian, maximin and minimax regret inequality averse evaluators. I illustrate how the methodology operates in the context of the JobCorps education and training program for disadvantaged youth (Schochet, Burghardt, and McConnell 2008) and in Meager (2022)'s Bayesian meta analysis of the microcredit literature.</description>

      <title>Identification and estimation for matrix time series CP-factor models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method for identifying and estimating the CP-factor models for matrix time series. Unlike the generalized eigenanalysis-based method of Chang et al.(2023) for which the convergence rates may suffer from small eigengaps as the asymptotic theory is based on some matrix perturbation analysis, the proposed new method enjoys faster convergence rates which are free from any eigengaps. It achieves this by turning the problem into a joint diagonalization of several matrices whose elements are determined by a basis of a linear system, and by choosing the basis carefully to avoid near co-linearity (see Proposition 5 and Section 4.3 below). Furthermore, unlike Chang et al.(2023) which requires the two factor loading matrices to be full-ranked, the new method can handle rank-deficient factor loading matrices. Illustration with both simulated and real matrix time series data shows the advantages of the proposed new method.</description>
