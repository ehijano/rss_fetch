      <title>The evolution of cooperation with Q-learning: the impact of information perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inherent huge complexities in human beings show a remarkable diversity in response to complex surroundings, enabling us to tackle problems from different perspectives. In the realm of cooperation studies, however, existing work assumes that individuals get access to the same kind of information to make their decisions, in contrast to the facts that individuals often perceive differently. Here, within the reinforcement learning framework, we investigate the impact of information perception on the evolution of cooperation in a 2-person scenario when playing the prisoner's dilemma game. We demonstrate that distinctly different evolution processes are observed in three information perception scenarios, revealing that the structure of information significantly affects the emergence of cooperation. Notably, the asymmetric information scenario exhibits a rich dynamical process, including the cooperation emergence, breakdown, and reconstruction, akin to psychological changes in humans. Our findings indicate that the information structure is vital to the emergence of cooperation, shedding new light on establishing mutually stable cooperative relationships and understanding human behavioral complexities in general.</description>

      <title>Evolution of cooperation in the public goods game with Q-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent paradigm shifts from imitation learning to reinforcement learning (RL) is shown to be productive in understanding human behaviors. In the RL paradigm, individuals search for optimal strategies through interaction with the environment to make decisions. This implies that gathering, processing, and utilizing information from their surroundings are crucial. However, existing studies typically study pairwise games such as the prisoners' dilemma and employ a self-regarding setup, where individuals play against one opponent based solely on their own strategies, neglecting the environmental information. In this work, we investigate the evolution of cooperation with the multiplayer game -- the public goods game using the Q-learning algorithm by leveraging the environmental information. Specifically, the decision-making of players is based upon the cooperation information in their neighborhood. Our results show that cooperation is more likely to emerge compared to the case of imitation learning by using Fermi rule. Of particular interest is the observation of an anomalous non-monotonic dependence which is revealed when voluntary participation is further introduced. The analysis of the Q-table explains the mechanisms behind the cooperation evolution. Our findings indicate the fundamental role of environment information in the RL paradigm to understand the evolution of cooperation, and human behaviors in general.</description>

      <title>Bounded-Confidence Models of Opinion Dynamics with Adaptive Confidence Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People's opinions change with time as they interact with each other. In a bounded-confidence model (BCM) of opinion dynamics, individuals (which are represented by the nodes of a network) have continuous-valued opinions and are influenced by neighboring nodes whose opinions are sufficiently similar to theirs (i.e., are within a confidence bound). In this paper, we formulate and analyze discrete-time BCMs with heterogeneous and adaptive confidence bounds. We introduce two new models: (1) a BCM with synchronous opinion updates that generalizes the Hegselmann--Krause (HK) model and (2) a BCM with asynchronous opinion updates that generalizes the Deffuant--Weisbuch (DW) model. We analytically and numerically explore our adaptive BCMs' limiting behaviors, including the confidence-bound dynamics, the formation of clusters of nodes with similar opinions, and the time evolution of an "effective graph", which is a time-dependent subgraph of a network with edges between nodes that {are currently receptive to each other.} For a variety of networks and a wide range of values of the parameters that control the increase and decrease of confidence bounds, we demonstrate numerically that our adaptive BCMs result in fewer major opinion clusters and longer convergence times than the baseline (i.e., nonadaptive) BCMs. We also show that our adaptive BCMs can have adjacent nodes that converge to the same opinion but are not {receptive to each other.} This qualitative behavior does not occur in the associated baseline BCMs.</description>

      <title>Universality of critical dynamics on a complex network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of the spectral dimension $d_s$ in determining the universality of phase transitions on a complex network. Due to its structural heterogeneity, a complex network generally acts as a disordered system. Specifically, we study the synchronization and entrainment transitions in the nonequilibrium dynamics of the Kuramoto model and the phase transition of the equilibrium dynamics of the classical $XY$ model, thereby covering a broad spectrum from nonlinear dynamics to statistical and condensed matter physics. Using linear theory, we obtain a general relationship between the dynamics occurring on the network and the underlying network properties. This yields the lower critical spectral dimension of the phase synchronization and entrainment transitions in the Kuramoto model as $d_s=4$ and $d_s=2$ respectively, whereas for the phase transition in the $XY$ model it is $d_s=2$. To test our theoretical hypotheses, we employ a network where any two nodes on the network are connected with a probability proportional to a power law of the distance between the nodes; this realizes any desired $d_s\in [1, \infty)$. Our detailed numerical study agrees well with the prediction of linear theory for the phase synchronization transition in the Kuramoto model. However, it shows a clear entrainment transition in the Kuramoto model and phase transition in the $XY$ model at $d_s \gtrsim 3$, not $d_s=2$ as predicted by linear theory. Our study indicates that network disorder in the region $2 \leq d_s \lesssim 3$ introduces strong finite-size fluctuations, which makes it extremely difficult to probe the existence of the ordered phase as predicted, affecting the dynamics profoundly.</description>
