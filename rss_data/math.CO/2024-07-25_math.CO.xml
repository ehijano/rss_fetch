      <title>Noncrossing arithmetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order notions of Kreweras complementation have appeared in the literature in the works of Krawczyk, Speicher, Mastnak, Nica, Arizmendi, Vargas, and others. While the theory has been developed primarily for specific applications in free probability, it also possesses an elegant, purely combinatorial core that is of independent interest. The present article aims at offering a simple account of various aspects of higher-order Kreweras complementation on the basis of elementary arithmetic, (co)algebraic, categorical and simplicial properties of noncrossing partitions. The main idea is to see noncrossing partitions as providing an interesting noncommutative analogue of the interplay between the divisibility poset and the multiplicative monoid of positive integers. Just as the divisibility poset can be regarded as the decalage of the multiplicative monoid, we exhibit the lattice of noncrossing partitions as the decalage of a partial monoid structure on noncrossing partitions encoding higher-order Kreweras complements. While our results may be considered known, some of the viewpoints can be regarded as novel, providing an efficient approach both conceptually and computationally.</description>

      <title>New tools to study 1-11-representation of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of a $k$-11-representable graph was introduced by Jeff Remmel in 2017 and studied by Cheon et al.\ in 2019 as a natural extension of the extensively studied notion of word-representable graphs, which are precisely 0-11-representable graphs. A graph $G$ is $k$-11-representable if it can be represented by a word $w$ such that for any edge (resp., non-edge) $xy$ in $G$ the subsequence of $w$ formed by $x$ and $y$ contains at most $k$ (resp., at least $k+1$) pairs of consecutive equal letters. A remarkable result of Cheon at al.\ is that {\em any} graph is 2-11-representable, while it is unknown whether every graph is 1-11-representable. Cheon et al.\ showed that the class of 1-11-representable graphs is strictly larger than that of word-representable graphs, and they introduced a useful toolbox to study 1-11-representable graphs.
  In this paper, we introduce new tools for studying 1-11-representation of graphs. We apply them for establishing 1-11-representation of Chv\'{a}tal graph, Mycielski graph, split graphs, and graphs whose vertices can be partitioned into a comparability graph and an independent set.</description>

      <title>Eigenbasis for a weighted adjacency matrix associated with the projective geometry $B_q(n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent article "Projective geometries, $Q$-polynomial structures, and quantum groups" Terwilliger (arXiv:2407.14964) defined a certain weighted adjacency matrix, depending on a free (positive real) parameter, associated with the projective geometry, and showed (among many other results) that it is diagonalizable, with the eigenvalues and their multiplicities explicitly written down, and that it satisfies the $Q$-polynomial property (with respect to the zero subspace).
  In this note we
  (i) Write down an explicit eigenbasis for this matrix.
  (ii) Evaluate the adjacency matrix-eigenvector products, yielding a new proof for the eigenvalues and their multiplicities.
  (iii) Evaluate the dual adjacency matrix-eigenvector products and directly show that the action of the dual adjacency matrix on the eigenspaces of the adjacency matrix is block-tridiagonal, yielding a new proof of the $Q$-polynomial property.</description>

      <title>Integral Biflow Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph with four distinguished vertices, two sources $s_1, s_2$ and two sinks $t_1,t_2$, let $c:\, E \rightarrow \mathbb Z_+$ be a capacity function, and let ${\cal P}$ be the set of all simple paths in $G$ from $s_1$ to $t_1$ or from $s_2$ to $t_2$. A biflow (or $2$-commodity flow) in $G$ is an assignment $f:\, {\cal P}\rightarrow \mathbb R_+$ such that $\sum_{e \in Q \in {\cal P}}\, f(Q) \le c(e)$ for all $e \in E$, whose value is defined to be $\sum_{Q \in {\cal P}}\, f(Q)$. A bicut in $G$ is a subset $K$ of $E$ that contains at least one edge from each member of ${\cal P}$, whose capacity is $\sum_{e\in K}\, c(e)$. In 1977 Seymour characterized, in terms of forbidden structures, all graphs $G$ for which the max-biflow (integral) min-bicut theorem holds true (that is, the maximum value of an integral biflow is equal to the minimum capacity of a bicut for every capacity function $c$); such a graph $G$ is referred to as a Seymour graph. Nevertheless, his proof is not algorithmic in nature. In this paper we present a combinatorial polynomial-time algorithm for finding maximum integral biflows in Seymour graphs, which relies heavily on a structural description of such graphs.</description>

      <title>Sign patterns of principal minors of real symmetric matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a combinatorial rule satisfied by the signs of principal minors of a real symmetric matrix. The sign patterns satisfying this rule are equivalent to uniform oriented Lagrangian matroids. We first discuss their structure and symmetries and then study their asymptotics, proving that almost all of them are not representable by real symmetric matrices. We offer several conjectures and experimental results concerning representable sign patterns and the topology of their representation spaces.</description>

      <title>Strong Embeddings of 3-connected Cubic Planar Graphs on Surfaces of non-negative Euler Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whitney proved that 3-connected planar graphs can be embedded uniquely on the sphere. In general, such a graph may also have embeddings on different surfaces. Enami focused on cubic graphs and showed that a 3-connected cubic planar graph can be re-embedded on a surface of non-negative Euler characteristic if and only if the dual graph contains a specific subgraph. Motivated by applications to triangulated surfaces, we investigate strong re-embeddings and show that these are characterised by a subset of Enami's subgraphs. Additionally, we provide criteria for when a graph does not possess a strong re-embedding on the projective plane, the torus or the Klein bottle.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on the average edit distance between two random strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the average edit distance between two random strings. More precisely, we adapt a technique introduced by Lueker in the context of the average longest common subsequence of two random strings to improve the known upper bound on the average edit distance. We improve all the known upper bounds for small alphabets. We also provide a new implementation of Lueker technique to improve the lower bound on the average length of the longest common subsequence of two random strings for all small alphabets of size other than $2$ and $4$.</description>

      <title>Proof of a conjecture on isolation of graphs dominated by a vertex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A copy of a graph $F$ is called an $F$-copy. For any graph $G$, the $F$-isolation number of $G$, denoted by $\iota(G,F)$, is the size of a smallest subset $D$ of the vertex set of $G$ such that the closed neighbourhood $N[D]$ of $D$ in $G$ intersects the vertex sets of the $F$-copies contained by $G$ (equivalently, $G-N[D]$ contains no $F$-copy). Thus, $\iota(G,K_1)$ is the domination number $\gamma(G)$ of $G$, and $\iota(G,K_2)$ is the vertex-edge domination number of $G$. We prove that if $F$ is a $k$-edge graph, $\gamma(F) = 1$ (that is, a vertex of $F$ is adjacent to all the other vertices of $F$), and $G$ is a connected $m$-edge graph, then $\iota(G,F) \leq \big\lfloor \frac{m+1}{k+2} \big\rfloor$ unless $G$ is an $F$-copy or $F$ is a $3$-path and $G$ is a $6$-cycle. This was recently posed as a conjecture by Zhang and Wu, who settled the case where $F$ is a star. The result for the case where $F$ is a clique had been obtained by Fenech, Kaemawichanurat and the present author. The bound is attainable for any $m \geq 0$ unless $m = k \leq 2$. New ideas, such as the consideration of divisibility, are introduced in the proof of the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Conflict-free Hypergraph Matchings and Coverings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work showing the existence of conflict-free almost-perfect hypergraph matchings has found many applications. We show that, assuming certain simple degree and codegree conditions on the hypergraph $ \mathcal{H} $ and the conflicts to be avoided, a conflict-free almost-perfect matching can be extended to one covering all of the vertices in a particular subset of $ V(\mathcal{H}) $, by using an additional set of edges; in particular, we ensure that our matching avoids all of a further set of conflicts, which may consist of both old and new edges. This setup is useful for various applications, and our main theorem provides a black box which encapsulates many long and tedious calculations, massively simplifying the proofs of results in generalised Ramsey theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a bijection between marked bumpless pipedreams with reverse compatible pairs, which are in bijection with not-necessarily-reduced pipedreams. This directly unifies various formulas for Grothendieck polynomials in the literature. Our bijection is a generalization of a variant of the bijection of Gao and Huang in the unmarked, reduced case.</description>

Abstract: Call a finite relational structure $k$-Slupecki if its only surjective $k$-ary polymorphisms are essentially unary, and Slupecki if it is $k$-Slupecki for all $k \geq 2$. We present conditions, some necessary and some sufficient, for a reflexive digraph to be Slupecki. We prove that all digraphs that triangulate a 1-sphere are Slupecki, as are all the ordinal sums $m \oplus n$ ($m,n \geq 2$). We prove that the posets $P = m \oplus n \oplus k$ are not 3-Slupecki for $m,n,k \geq 2$, and prove there is a bound $B(m,k)$ such that $P$ is 2-Slupecki if and only if $n &gt; B(m,k)+1$; in particular there exist posets that are 2-Slupecki but not 3-Slupecki.</description>

      <title>Unimodality of the Rank on Strongly Unimodal Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\{a_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$ be a strongly unimodal positive integer sequence with peak position $k$. The rank of such sequence is defined to be $\ell-2k+1$. Let $u(m,n)$ denote the number of sequences $\{a_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$ with rank $m$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{\ell} a_i=n$. Bringmann, Jennings-Shaffer, Mahlburg and Rhoades conjectured that $\{u(m,n)\}_m$ is strongly log-concave for any fixed $n$. Motivated by this conjecture, in this paper we prove the strongly unimodality of $\{u(m,n)\}_m$, that is $u(m,n)&gt;u(m+1,n)$ for $m\ge 0$ and $n\ge \max\{6,{m+2\choose 2}\}$. This result gives supportive evidence for the above conjecture. Moreover, we find a combinatorial interpretation of $u(m,n)$, which leads to a new combinatorial interpretation of ${\rm ospt}(n)$. Furthermore, using this new combinatorial interpretation, a lower bound and an asymptotic formula on ${\rm ospt}(n)$ will be presented.</description>

      <title>Exactly-solvable self-trapping lattice walks. II. Lattices of arbitrary height</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing self-avoiding walk (GSAW) is a walk on a graph that is directed, does not visit the same vertex twice, and has a trapped endpoint. We show that the generating function enumerating GSAWs on a half-infinite strip of finite height is rational, and we give a procedure to construct a combinatorial finite state machine that allows one to compute this generating function. We then modify this procedure to compute generating functions for GSAWs under two probabilistic models. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the expected length and displacement for GSAWs on the quarter plane, half plane, full plane, and half-infinite strips of bounded height for which we cannot compute the generating function. Finally, we prove that the generating functions for Greek key tours (GSAWs on a finite grid that visit every vertex) on a half-infinite strip of fixed height are also rational, allowing us to resolve several conjectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study $\gamma$ partial correction over a $t$-user arbitrarily varying multiple-access channel (AV-MAC). We first present necessary channel conditions for the $\gamma$ partially correcting authentication capacity region to have nonempty interior. We then give a block length extension scheme which preserves positive rate tuples from a short code with zero probability of $\gamma$ partial correction error, noting that the flexibility of $\gamma$ partial correction prevents pure codeword concatenation from being successful. Finally, we offer a case study of a particular AV-MAC satisfying the necessary conditions for partial correction.</description>

      <title>A survey on big Ramsey structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been much progress in the field of structural Ramsey theory, in particular in the study of big Ramsey degrees. In all known examples of infinite structures with finite big Ramsey degrees, there is in fact a single expansion of the structure, called a big Ramsey structure, which correctly encodes the exact big Ramsey degrees of every finite substructure simultaneously. The first half of the article collects facts about this phenomenon that have appeared in the literature into a single cohesive framework, thus offering a conceptual survey of big Ramsey structures. We present some original results indicating that the standard methods of proving finite big Ramsey degrees automatically yield big Ramsey structures, often with desirable extra properties. The second half of the article is a survey in the more traditional sense, discussing numerous examples from the literature and showing how they fit into our framework. We also present some general results on how big Ramsey degrees are affected by expanding structures with unary functions.</description>

      <title>Khovanov-Rozansky homology of Coxeter knots and Schr\"oder polynomials for paths under any line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of generalized Schr\"oder polynomials $S_\tau(q,t,a)$, indexed by triangular partitions $\tau$ and prove that $S_\tau(q,t,a)$ agrees with the Poincar\'e series of the triply graded Khovanov-Rozansky homology of the Coxeter knot $K_\tau$ associated to $\tau$. For all integers $m,n,d\geq 1$ with $m,n$ relatively prime, the $(d,mnd+1)$-cable of the torus knot $T(m,n)$ appears as a special case. It is known that these knots are algebraic, and as a result we obtain a proof of the $q=1$ specialization of the Oblomkov-Rasmussen-Shende conjecture for these knots. Finally, we show that our Schr\"oder polynomial computes the hook components in the Schur expansion of the symmetric function appearing in the shuffle theorem under any line, thus proving a triangular version of the $(q,t)$-Schr\"oder theorem.</description>

Abstract: Unequal Error-Protecting (UEP) codes are error-correcting (EC) codes designed to protect some parts of the encoded data better than other parts. Here, we introduce a similar generalization of PIR codes that we call Unequal-Data-Demand (UDD) PIR codes. These codes are PIR-type codes designed for the scenario where some parts of the encoded data are in higher demand than other parts. We generalize various results for PIR codes to UDD codes. Our main contribution is a new approach to the Griesmer bound for linear EC codes involving an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem that generalizes to linear UEP codes and linear UDD PIR codes.</description>

      <title>An exact-arithmetic algorithm for spanning tree modulus</title>

Abstract: Spanning tree modulus is a generalization of effective resistance that is closely related to graph strength and fractional arboricity. The optimal edge density associated with spanning tree modulus is known to produce two hierarchical decompositions of arbitrary graphs, one based on strength and the other on arboricity. Here we introduce an exact-arithmetic algorithm for spanning tree modulus and the strength-based decomposition using Cunningham's algorithm for graph vulnerability. The algorithm exploits an interesting connection between spanning tree modulus and critical edge sets from the vulnerability problem. This paper introduces the new algorithm, describes a practical means for implementing it using integer arithmetic, and presents some examples and computational time scaling tests.</description>

      <title>Balanced independent sets and colorings of hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01940v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $k$-uniform hypergraph $H = (V, E)$ is $k$-partite if $V$ can be partitioned into $k$ sets $V_1, \ldots, V_k$ such that every edge in $E$ contains precisely one vertex from each $V_i$. We call such a graph $n$-balanced if $|V_i| = n$ for each $i$. An independent set $I$ in $H$ is balanced if $|I\cap V_i| = |I\cap V_j|$ for each $1 \leq i, j \leq k$, and a coloring is balanced if each color class induces a balanced independent set in $H$. In this paper, we provide a lower bound on the balanced independence number $\alpha_b(H)$ in terms of the average degree $D = |E|/n$, and an upper bound on the balanced chromatic number $\chi_b(H)$ in terms of the maximum degree $\Delta$. Our results recover those of recent work of Chakraborti for $k = 2$.</description>

      <title>Powers of the operator $u(z)\frac{d}{dz}$ and their connection with some combinatorial numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper the operator $A = u(z)\frac{d}{dz}$ is considered, where $u$ is an entire or meromorphic function in the complex plane. The expansion of $A^{k}$ ($k\geq1$) with the help of the powers of the differential operator $D=\frac{d}{dz}$ is obtained, and it is shown that this expansion depends on special numbers. Connections between these numbers and known combinatorial numbers are given. Some special cases of the operator $A$, corresponding to $u(z) = z$, $u(z) = e^{z}$, $u(z) = \frac{1}{z}$, are considered.</description>

      <title>Strong coalitions in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a graph $G=(V,E)$, a set $D\subset V(G)$ is a strong dominating set of $G$, if for every vertex $x\in V (G)\setminus D$ there is a vertex $y\in D$ with $xy \in E(G)$ and $deg(x)\leq deg(y)$. A strong coalition consists of two disjoint sets of vertices $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$, neither of which is a strong dominating set but whose union $V_{1}\cup V_{2}$, is a strong dominating set. A vertex partition $\Omega=\{V_1, V_2,..., V_k \}$ of vertices in $G$ is a strong coalition partition, if every set $V_i \in\Omega$ either is a strong dominating set consisting of a single vertex of degree $n-1$, or is not a strong dominating set but produces a strong coalition with another set $V_j \in \Omega$ that is not a strong dominating set. The maximum cardinality of a strong coalition partition of $G$ is the strong coalition number of $G$ and is denoted by $SC(G)$. In this paper, we study properties of strong coalitions in graphs.</description>

      <title>A closure for Hamilton-connectedness in $\{K_{1,3},\Gamma_3\}$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a closure technique for Hamilton-connectedness of $\{K_{1,3},\Gamma_3\}$-free graphs, where $\Gamma_3$ is the graph obtained by joining two vertex-disjoint triangles with a path of length $3$. The closure turns a claw-free graph into a line graph of a multigraph while preserving its (non)-Hamilton-connectedness. The most technical parts of the proof are computer-assisted.
  The main application of the closure is given in a subsequent paper showing that every $3$-connected $\{K_{1,3},\Gamma_3\}$-free graph is Hamilton-connected, thus resolving one of the two last open cases in the characterization of pairs of connected forbidden subgraphs implying Hamilton-connectedness.</description>

      <title>Shellability is hard even for balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to show that shellability is NP-hard for triangulated d-balls (this also gives hardness for triangulated d-manifolds/d-pseudomanifolds with boundary) as soon as d is at least 3. This extends our earlier work with Goaoc, Pat\'akov\'a and Wagner on hardness of shellability of 2-complexes and answers some questions implicitly raised by Danaraj and Klee in 1978 and explicitly mentioned by Santamar\'ia-Galvis and Woodroofe. Together with the main goal, we also prove that collapsibility is NP-hard for 3-complexes embeddable in the 3-space, extending an earlier work of the second author and answering an open question mentioned by Cohen, Fasy, Miller, Nayyeri, Peng and Walkington; and that shellability is NP-hard for 2-complexes embeddable in the 3-space, answering another question of Santamar\'ia-Galvis and Woodroofe (in a slightly stronger form than what is given by the main result).</description>

      <title>Categories of hypermagmas, hypergroups, and related hyperstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to diagnose the cause of some defects in the category of canonical hypergroups, we investigate several categories of hyperstructures that generalize hypergroups. By allowing hyperoperations with possibly empty products, one obtains categories with desirable features such as completeness and cocompleteness, free functors, regularity, and closed monoidal structures. We show by counterexamples that such constructions cannot be carried out within the category of canonical hypergroups. This suggests that (commutative) unital, reversible hypermagmas -- which we call mosaics -- form a worthwhile generalization of (canonical) hypergroups from the categorical perspective. Notably, mosaics contain pointed simple matroids as a subcategory, and projective geometries as a full subcategory.</description>

      <title>Efficient Combinatorial Optimization via Heat Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are widespread but inherently challenging due to their discrete nature. The primary limitation of existing methods is that they can only access a small fraction of the solution space at each iteration, resulting in limited efficiency for searching the global optimal.To overcome this challenge, diverging from conventional efforts of expanding the solver's search scope, we focus on enabling information to actively propagate to the solver through heat diffusion. By transforming the target function while preserving its optima, heat diffusion facilitates information flow from distant regions to the solver, providing more efficient navigation. Utilizing heat diffusion, we propose a framework for solving general combinatorial optimization problems.The proposed methodology demonstrates superior performance across a range of the most challenging and widely encountered combinatorial optimizations. Echoing recent advancements in harnessing thermodynamics for generative artificial intelligence, our study further reveals its significant potential in advancing combinatorial optimization.</description>
