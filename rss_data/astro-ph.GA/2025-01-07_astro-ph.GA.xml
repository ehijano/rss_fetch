      <title>Abundant Water from Early Supernovae at Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial (or Pop III) supernovae were the first nucleosynthetic engines in the Universe, forging the heavy elements required for the later formation of planets and life. Water, in particular, is thought to be crucial to the cosmic origins of life as we understand it, and recent models have shown that water can form in low-metallicity gas like that present at high redshifts. Here we present numerical simulations that show that the first water in the Universe formed in Pop III core-collapse and pair-instability supernovae at redshifts $z \sim$ 20. The primary sites of water production in these remnants are dense molecular cloud cores, which in some cases were enriched with primordial water to mass fractions that were only a factor of a few below those in the Solar System today. These dense, dusty cores are also likely candidates for protoplanetary disk formation. Besides revealing that a primary ingredient for life was already in place in the Universe 100 - 200 Myr after the Big Bang, our simulations show that water was likely a key constituent of the first galaxies.</description>

      <title>The SLACS strong lens sample, debiased. II. Lensing-only constraints on the stellar IMF and dark matter contraction in early-type galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) is the best studied sample of strong lenses to date. Much of our knowledge of the SLACS lenses has been obtained by combining strong lensing with stellar kinematics constraints. However, interpreting stellar kinematics data is difficult: it requires reconstructing the three-dimensional structure of a galaxy and the orbits of its stars. In this work we pursued an alternative approach to the study of galaxy structure with SLACS, based purely on gravitational lensing data. The primary goal of this study is to constrain the stellar population synthesis mismatch parameter $\alpha_{sps}$, quantifying the ratio between the true stellar mass of a galaxy and that obtained with a reference stellar population synthesis model, and the efficiency of the dark matter response to the infall of baryons, $\epsilon$. We combined Einstein radius measurements from the SLACS lenses with weak lensing information from their parent sample, while accounting for selection effects. The data can be fit comparatively well by a model with $\log{\alpha_{sps}}=0.22$ and $\epsilon=0$, corresponding to an IMF slightly lighter than Salpeter and no dark matter contraction, or $\log{\alpha_{sps}}=0$ and $\epsilon=0.8$, equivalent to a Chabrier IMF and almost maximal contraction. This degeneracy could be broken with lensing-only measurements of the projected density slope, but existing data are completely inconsistent with our model. We suspect systematic errors in the measurements to be at the origin of this discrepancy. Number density constraints would also help break the degeneracy. Because of selection effects, SLACS lenses have a larger velocity dispersion than galaxies with the same projected mass distribution, and their velocity dispersion is overestimated. These two biases combined produce a $5\%$ upward shift in the observed velocity dispersion.</description>

      <title>Upper Limits on the Mass of Cool Gas in the CGM of Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use HI absorption measurements to constrain the amount of cool ($\approx 10^4$ K), photoionized gas in the CGM of dwarf galaxies with $M_* = 10^{6.5-9.5}~M_\odot$ in the nearby Universe ($z&lt;0.3$). We show analytically that volume-filling gas gives an upper limit on the gas mass needed to reproduce a given HI column density profile. We introduce a power-law density profile for the gas distribution and fit our model to archival HI observations to infer the cool CGM gas mass, $M_{\rm cCGM}$, as a function of halo mass. For volume-filling ($f_V=1$) models, we find $M_{\rm cCGM} = 5 \times 10^8-2 \times 10^9~M_\odot$, constituting $\lesssim 10\%$ of the halo baryon budget. For clumpy gas, with $f_V=0.01$, the masses are a factor of $\approx 11$ lower, in agreement with our analytic approximation. Our assumption that the measured HI forms entirely in the cool CGM provides a conservative upper limit on $M_{\rm cCGM}$, and possible contributions from the IGM or warm/hot CGM will further strengthen our result. We estimate the mass uncertainties due to the range of redshifts in our sample and the unknown gas metallicity to be $\approx 15\%$ and $\approx 10\%$, respectively. Our results show that dwarf galaxies have only $\lesssim 15\%$ of their baryon budget in stars and the cool CGM, with the rest residing in the warm/hot CGM or ejected from the dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Group-Dominant Elliptical NGC 5044 in the Radio Band: Continuum Emission and Detection of HI Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new MeerKAT L-band (continuum and HI) and upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (300-850 MHz) observations of the archetypal cool-core group-dominant early-type galaxy NGC 5044. Our new continuum images reveal diffuse, steep spectrum ($\alpha_{0.99\,\rm GHz}^{1.56\,\rm GHz}=-1.53\pm0.6$) radio emission extending about 25 kpc around the unresolved radio core. The observed radio emission overlaps with the known X-ray cavities, but is not confined to them. We also find the first direct evidence of neutral atomic gas in NGC 5044, in the form of a 3.8$\sigma$ significant two-component HI absorption line seen against the emission of the active nucleus. The peak velocities are well correlated with the previously reported CO(2-1) absorption, but the HI lines are moderately broader, spanning velocities from $265\,\rm \, km\,s^{-1}$ to $305\,\rm \, km\,s^{-1}$. We do not detect HI emission, but place an upper limit of $M_{HI}&lt; 5.4 \times 10^{7} \, M_{\odot}$ in the central 15 arcsec (2.2 kpc) of the galaxy. This is significantly less than the estimated molecular gas content, and implies a molecular-to-atomic mass ratio of $\geq $1.7:1, consistent with these gas phases forming through cooling from the hot intra-group medium. We also constrain the spin temperature to $T_{\rm spin}\leq 950\,\rm K$, indicating that the detected HI is in the cold neutral phase.</description>

      <title>JOYS: The [D/H] abundance derived from protostellar outflows across the Galactic disk measured with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The total deuterium abundance [D/H] in the universe is set by just two processes: the creation of deuterium in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis at an abundance of [D/H]$=2.58\pm0.13\times10^{-5}$, and its destruction within stellar interiors. Measurements of the total [D/H] abundance can potentially provide a probe of Galactic chemical evolution, however, most measurements of [D/H] are only sensitive to the gas-phase deuterium, and the amount of deuterium sequestered in carbonaceous dust grains is debated. With the launch of JWST, it is now possible to measure the gas-phase [D/H] at unprecedented sensitivity and distances through observation of mid-IR lines of H$_2$ and HD. We employ data from the JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS) program to measure the gas-phase [D/H] abundance with a rotation diagram analysis towards 5 nearby low-mass and 5 distant high-mass protostellar outflows. The gas-phase [D/H] varies between low-mass sources by up to a factor of $\sim4$, despite these sources likely having formed in a region of the Galactic disk that would be expected to have nearly constant total [D/H]. Most measurements of gas-phase [D/H] from our work or previous studies produce [D/H] $\lesssim 1.0\times10^{-5}$, a factor of $2-4$ lower than found from local UV absorption lines and as expected from Galactic chemical evolution models. The variations in [D/H] between our low-mass sources and the low [D/H] with respect to Galactic chemical evolution models suggest that our observations are not sensitive to the total [D/H]. Significant depletion of deuterium onto carbonaceous dust grains is a possible explanation, and tentative evidence of enhanced [D/H] towards shock positions with higher gas-phase Fe abundance is seen in the HH 211 outflow. Deeper observations of HD and H$_2$ in shocked environments and modelling of dust-grain destruction are warranted to test for the effects of depletion.</description>

      <title>ALMA 0.1 pc View of Molecular Clouds Associated with High-Mass Protostellar Systems in the Small Magellanic Cloud: Are Low-Metallicity Clouds Filamentary or Not?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02190v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filamentary molecular clouds are an essential intermediate stage in the star formation process. To test whether these structures are universal throughout cosmic star formation history, it is crucial to study low-metallicity environments within the Local Group. We present an ALMA analysis of the ALMA archival data at the spatial resolution of $\sim$0.1 pc for 17 massive young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC; Z $\sim$0.2 $Z_{\odot}$). This sample represents approximately 30% of the YSOs confirmed by Spitzer spectroscopy. Early ALMA studies of the SMC have shown that the CO emission line traces an H$_2$ number density of $\gtrsim$10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$, an order of magnitude higher than in the typical Galactic environments. Using the CO($J$ = 3-2) data, we investigated the spatial and velocity distribution of molecular clouds. Our analysis shows that about 60% of the clouds have steep radial profiles from the spine of the elongated structures, while the remaining clouds have a smooth distribution and are characterized by lower brightness temperatures. We categorized the former as filaments and the latter as non-filaments. Some of the filamentary clouds are associated with YSOs with outflows and exhibit higher temperatures, likely reflecting their formation conditions, suggesting that these clouds are younger than non-filamentary ones. This indicates that even if filaments form during star formation, their steep structures may become less prominent and transit to a lower-temperature state. Such transitions in structure and temperature have not been reported in metal-rich regions, highlighting a key behavior for characterizing the evolution of the interstellar medium and star formation in low-metallicity environments.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Catalog of Emission-line Nebulae, Star Clusters, and Supergiants in M31 from the LAMOST Spectroscopic Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic observations of various tracers in nearby galaxies, such as Andromeda (M31), play a crucial role in identifying and classifying individual stellar populations and nebular objects, thereby enhancing our understanding of galactic composition, environment, and dynamics as well as stellar evolution. While the LAMOST (Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope) survey of M31 has produced extensive datasets, a comprehensive catalog of emission-line nebulae, star clusters, and supergiants is yet to be completed. In this paper, we present a final catalog of 384 emission-line nebulae, 380 star clusters, and 375 supergiants and candidates in M31, as carefully selected and identified from the LAMOST spectroscopic database. These objects were classified using a random forest algorithm, followed by thorough visual examinations of their spectral characteristics as well as morphologies revealed by archive images. For emission-line nebulae, we measured radial velocities and relative fluxes of emission lines, enabling further classification of planetary nebulae and HII regions. Additionally, we identified 245 emission-line nebulae in M33. This work lays the data foundation for the study of M31, and offers valuable tracers to investigate M31's structure and evolution.</description>

      <title>Tracking Star-Forming Cores as Mass Reservoirs in Clustered and Isolated Regions Using Numerical Passive Tracer Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the physical properties of star-forming cores as mass reservoirs for protostars, and the impact of turbulence, is crucial in star formation studies. We implemented passive tracer particles in clump-scale numerical simulations with turbulence strengths of $\mathcal{M}_{\rm rms} = 2, 10$. Unlike core identification methods used in observational studies, we identified 260 star-forming cores using a new method based on tracer particles falling onto protostars. Our findings reveal that star-forming cores do not necessarily coincide with high-density regions when nearby stars are present, as gas selectively accretes onto protostars, leading to clumpy, fragmented structures. We calculated convex hull cores from star-forming cores and defined their filling factors. Regardless of turbulence strength, convex hull cores with lower filling factors tend to contain more protostars and have larger masses and sizes, indicating that cores in clustered regions are more massive and larger than those in isolated regions. Thus, the filling factor serves as a key indicator for distinguishing between isolated and clustered star-forming regions and may provide insights into the star formation processes within clustered regions. We also found that most convex hull cores are gravitationally bound. However, in the $\mathcal{M}_{\rm rms} = 10$ model, there are more low-mass, unbound convex hull cores compared to the $\mathcal{M}_{\rm rms} = 2$ model. In the $\mathcal{M}_{\rm rms} = 10$ model, 16% of the convex hull cores are unbound, which may be explained by the inertial-inflow model. These findings highlight the influence of turbulence strength on the mass and gravitational stability of cores.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole stellar microlensing constraints: understanding their dependence on the density and velocity distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microlensing surveys of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud constrain the fraction of the Milky Way halo in Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) with mass $10^{-9} \lesssim M/M_{\odot} \lesssim 10^{4}$. Various studies have reached different conclusions on the uncertainties in these constraints due to uncertainties in the Dark Matter (DM) distribution. We therefore revisit the dependence of the microlensing differential event rate, and hence exclusion limits, on the DM density and velocity distributions. The constraints on the abundance of low- and high-mass PBHs depend, respectively, on the long- and short-duration tails of the differential event rate distribution. Long-duration events are due to PBHs moving close to the line of sight and their rate (and hence the constraints on low-mass PBHs) has a fairly weak ($\sim 10\%$) dependence on the DM density and velocity distributions. Short-duration events are due to PBHs close to the observer and their rate (and hence the constraints on moderate- and high-mass PBHs) depends much more strongly on the DM velocity distribution. An accurate calculation of the local DM velocity distribution is therefore crucial for accurately calculating PBH stellar microlensing constraints.</description>

      <title>The quest for a stable disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of disk galaxies manifest spirals and/or bars that are believed to result from dynamical instabilities. However, some galaxies have featureless disks, which are therefore inferred to be dynamically stable. Yet despite many years of effort, theorists have been unable to construct realistic models of galaxy disks that possess no instabilities and therefore could remain featureless. This conclusion has been reached through simulations for the most part, some of which have been confirmed by linear stability analyses. Toomre claimed that the Mestel disk, embedded in an equal mass halo, to be a notable counter-example, but his prediction of stability could not be reproduced in simulations due to complicated non-linear effects that caused secular growth of Poisson noise-driven disturbances until strong features emerged. Here we revisit this issue and show that simply eliminating the most nearly circular orbits from Toomre's disk model can inhibit troublesome secular growth. We also present both 2D and 3D simulations of particle disks that remain featureless for over 50 orbit periods. We report that spiral evolution naturally depletes circular orbits and that the radial velocity distribution in the featureless disks of S0 galaxies should have negative kurtosis.</description>

      <title>Probing the Merger Rates of Supermassive Black Holes and Galaxies with Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mergers of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are key drivers of galaxy evolution, contributing to the growth of both galaxies and their central black holes. Current projects like Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) and upcoming missions such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), Taiji, and Tianqin are designed to detect gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by SMBH binaries during their inspiral and merger phases. We investigate the capability to probe the merger rates of SMBHs and their host galaxies by combining current PTA detections and mock GW data for LISA-like detectors, while incorporating observational constraints from the $M_{\bullet}-M_*$ relationship and galaxy stellar mass functions. Our findings highlight the critical role of GW detections with LISA-like detectors in exploring the merger rates of galaxies and SMBHs and the timescale of SMBH mergers. Additionally, incorporating PTA constraints on the stochastic gravitational wave background further refines model parameters and reduces uncertainties. Gravitational wave detections offer an independent method for estimating galaxy merger rates, providing a valuable consistency check against rates derived from galaxy pair observations and cosmological simulations. Furthermore, comparing SMBH mass assembly through mergers with growth via accretion provides key insights into the evolutionary history of SMBHs, with the timescale of SMBH binary mergers playing a significant role in shaping their merger rates and merger mass assembly.</description>

      <title>Interactions among binary black holes in star clusters: eccentric gravitational wave captures and triple formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. Numerical simulations of star clusters with black holes find that there is only a single dynamically active binary black hole (BBH), at odds with the theoretical expectation of ~5 dynamically-formed - or, 'three-body' - BBHs in clusters with a few hundred BHs. We test the recent suggestion that this tension is because interactions among three-body BBHs were neglected in the theory.
  Methods. We use the public catalogue of Cluster Monte Carlo models to obtain a sample of strong BBH-BBH interactions, which we integrate using the 3.5PN equations of motion. We explore the nature of the BBHs involved in BBH-BBH interactions in star clusters, as well as the various outcomes: gravitational wave (GW) captures and the associated eccentricities at the frequencies of ground-based GW detectors, as well as BH triple formation and their contribution to BBH mergers via the Lidov-Kozai mechanism.
  Results. We find that almost all BBHs involved in BBH-BBH interactions are indeed three-body binaries and that BBH formation and disruption in BBH-BBH interactions occur at approximately the same rate, providing an explanation for the finding of a single dynamically-active BBH in N-body models. An important implication is that the resulting rates of GW capture and triple formation are independent of uncertain initial binary properties. We obtain a local rate of GW captures of $\mathcal{R}(z\simeq0)\rm\simeq1Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$, as well as their eccentricity distribution and redshift dependence. We find that a BBH-BBH interaction is more likely to trigger a GW merger than a BH-BBH interaction. We also find that stable triples that are assembled in BBH-BBH interactions are very wide and not likely to merge via von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations because they quickly break up in subsequent interactions with BHs and BBHs. Our results will help with the interpretation of future GW signals from eccentric BBHs</description>

      <title>The puzzle of isolated and quenched dwarf galaxies in cosmic voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report, for the first time, the detection of a sample of quenched and isolated dwarf galaxies (with 8.9 $&lt;$ log(M$_{\rm \star}$/M$_{\rm \odot}$) $&lt;$ 9.5) in the least dense regions of the cosmic web, including voids, filaments, and walls. These dwarfs have no neighbouring galaxy within 1.0~Mpc in projected distance. Based on the full spectral fitting of their central spectra using Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, these galaxies are gas-deprived, exhibit stellar mass assembly very similar to dwarfs in the central regions of galaxy clusters, and have experienced no significant star formation in the past 2 Gyr. Additionally, analysis of r-band images from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey showed that these dwarf galaxies host a central Nuclear Star Cluster (NSC). Detecting quenched, isolated dwarf galaxies in cosmic voids indicates that environmental factors are not the sole drivers of their quenching. Internal mechanisms, such as feedback from in-situ star formation, also contributing to the NSC formation, black holes, or variations in conditions during their formation, offer potential explanations for star formation suppression in these galaxies. These findings highlight the need for a significant revision in our understanding of baryonic physics, particularly concerning the formation and evolution of low-mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the S\'ersic Index up to z=2.5 from JWST and HST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is unveiling the rest-frame near-IR structure of galaxies. We measure the evolution with redshift of the rest-frame optical and near-IR S\'ersic index ($n$), and examine the dependence on stellar mass and star-formation activity across the redshift range $0.5\leq z\leq2.5$. We infer rest-frame near-IR S\'ersic profiles for $\approx 15.000$ galaxies in publicly available NIRCam imaging mosaics from the COSMOS-Web and PRIMER surveys. We augment these with rest-frame optical S\'ersic indices, previously measured from HST imaging mosaics. The median S\'ersic index evolves slowly or not at all with redshift, except for very high-mass galaxies ($M_\star &gt; 10^{11}~{\text{M}}_\odot$), which show an increase from $n\approx 2.5$ to $n\approx 4$ at $z&lt;1$. High-mass galaxies have higher $n$ than lower-mass galaxies ($M_\star=10^{9.5}~{\text{M}}_\odot$) at all redshifts, with a stronger dependence in the rest-frame near-IR than in the rest-frame optical at $z&gt;1$. This wavelength dependence is caused by star-forming galaxies that have lower optical than near-IR $n$ at z&gt;1 (but not at z&lt;1). Both at optical and near-IR wavelengths, star-forming galaxies have lower $n$ than quiescent galaxies, fortifying the connection between star-formation activity and radial stellar mass distribution. At $z&gt;1$ the median near-IR $n$ varies strongly with star formation activity, but not with stellar mass. The scatter in near-IR $n$ is higher in the green valley (0.25 dex) than on the star-forming sequence and among quiescent galaxies (0.18 dex) -- this trend is not seen in the optical because dust and young stars contribute to the variety in optical light profiles. Our newly measured rest-frame near-IR radial light profiles motivate future comparisons with radial stellar mass profiles of simulated galaxies as a stringent constraint on processes that govern galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>An accurate and simple, asymptotically matched deprojection of the Sersic law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sersic law reproduces very well the surface brightness profile of early-type galaxies, and therefore is routinely used in observational and theoretical works. Unfortunately, its deprojection can not be expressed in terms of elementary functions for generic values of the shape parameter $n$. Over the years, different families of approximate deprojection formulae have been proposed, generally based on fits of the numerical deprojection over some radial range. We searched for a very simple, accurate, and theoretically motivated deprojection formula of the Sersic law, without free parameters, not based on fits of the numerical deprojection, and holding for generic $n &gt; 1$. The formula has been found by requiring it to reproduce the analytical expressions for the inner and outer asymptotic expansions of the deprojected Sersic law of given $n$, and by matching the two expansions at intermediate radii with the request that the total luminosity coincides with that of the original Sersic profile of same $n$. The resulting formula is algebraically very simple, by construction its inner and outer parts are the exact (asymptotic) deprojection of the Sersic law, and it depends on two coefficients that are analytical functions of $n$ of immediate evaluation. The accuracy of the formula over the whole radial range is very good and increases for increasing $n$, with maximum relative deviations from the true numerical deprojection of $\simeq 8\,10^{-3}$ for the de Vaucouleurs profile. In the Appendix, the extension of the proposed formula to profiles with $n &lt;1$ is also presented and discussed. The formula obtained is a useful tool of simple use in the modeling of early-type galaxies. Its ellipsoidal generalization is immediate.</description>

      <title>Shear-gravity transition determines the steep velocity dispersion-size relation in molecular clouds: confronting analytical formula with observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The velocity dispersion-size relation is a crucial indicator of the dynamic properties of interstellar gas. Recent observations reveal a steep velocity dispersion-size relation ($\sigma_{\rm v}\sim R^{\beta}$) with the index $\beta&gt; 0.6$, which cannot be explained by a single mechanism with only gravity ($\beta\sim0.5$) or shear ($\beta \sim 1$). We present a two-component model $\sigma_{\rm v_{mixture}} = \lambda_1 \sigma_{\rm v_{g}} + \lambda_2 \sigma_{\rm v_{shear}} = A[(GM/R)^{\frac{1}{2}} + f(R/t_{\rm shear})]$ to explain the steep velocity dispersion-size relation in the observation from e.g. Miville et al. (2017) and Zhou et al. (2022). We find that the velocity dispersion of small clouds is mainly caused by self-gravity, while large clouds are primarily affected by shear, and these two regimes are linked by a gradual transition with a transition scale $\sim100$ pc. The variation of cloud velocity dispersion with the Galactocentric distance results from the variation of both cloud internal density structure and Galactic shear. Our two-component model captures how the dynamics of the molecular gas can be affected by both internal and external factors, and we expect it to be applied to data from galaxies with different physical conditions to reveal the physics.</description>

      <title>Cloudy-Maraston: Integrating nebular continuum and line emission with the Maraston stellar population synthesis models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope has ushered in an era of abundant high-redshift observations of young stellar populations characterized by strong emission lines, motivating us to integrate nebular emission into the new Maraston stellar population model which incorporates the latest Geneva stellar evolutionary tracks for massive stars with rotation. We use the photoionization code Cloudy to obtain the emergent nebular continuum and line emission for a range of modelling parameters, then compare our results to observations on various emission line diagnostic diagrams. We carry out a detailed comparison with several other models in the literature assuming different input physics, including modified prescriptions for stellar evolution and the inclusion of binary stars, and find close agreement in the H$\rm \beta$, H$\rm \alpha$, [N II]$\lambda 6583$, and [S II]$\lambda 6731$ luminosities between the models. However, we find significant differences in lines with high ionization energies, such as He II$\lambda$1640 and [O III]$\lambda 5007$, due to large variations in the hard ionizing photon production rates. The models differ by a maximum of $\hat{Q}_{\rm [O III]\lambda 5007} = \rm 6 \times 10^9 \; s^{-1} \, M_{\odot}^{-1}$, where these differences are mostly caused by the assumed stellar rotation and effective temperatures for the Wolf Rayet phase. Interestingly, rotation and uncorrected effective temperatures in our single star population models alone generate [O III] ionizing photon production rates higher than models including binary stars with ages between 1 to 8 Myr. These differences highlight the dependence of derived properties from SED fitting on the assumed model, as well as the sensitivity of predictions from cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the detection likelihood of faint peaks in interferometric data through jackknifing: Test application on finding $z&gt;10$ galaxy candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: False-positive emission-line detections bias our understanding of astronomical sources; for example, falsely identifying $z\sim3-4$ passive galaxies as $z&gt;10$ galaxies leads to incorrect number counts and flawed tests of cosmology. In this work, we provide a novel but simple tool to better quantify the detection of faint lines in interferometric data sets and properly characterize the underlying noise distribution. We demonstrate the method on three sets of archival observations of $z&gt;10$ galaxy candidates, taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). By jackknifing the visibilities using our tool, $jackknify$, we create observation-specific noise realizations of the interferometric measurement set. We apply a line-finding algorithm to both the noise cubes and the real data and determine the likelihood that any given positive peak is a real signal by taking the ratio of the two sampled probability distributions. We show that the previously reported, tentative emission-line detections of these $z&gt;10$ galaxy candidates are consistent with noise. We further expand upon the technique and demonstrate how to properly incorporate prior information on the redshift of the candidate from auxiliary data, such as from JWST. Our work highlights the need to achieve a significance of $\gtrsim 5\sigma$ to confirm an emission line when searching in broad 30 GHz bandwidths. Using our publicly available method enables the quantification of false detection likelihoods, which are crucial for accurately interpreting line detections.</description>

      <title>No evidence (yet) for increased star-formation efficiency at early times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early JWST observations have revealed substantial numbers of galaxies out to redshifts as high as $z \simeq 14$, reflecting a slow evolution of the galaxy UV luminosity function (LF) not anticipated by many models of galaxy evolution. It has also been discovered that fairly massive galaxies existed at early times, a finding again viewed as a challenge to our understanding of early galaxy growth or even ${\rm \Lambda}$CDM cosmology. Here we develop and test a simple theoretical model which shows that these observations are unsurprising, but instead are arguably as expected if one assumes a non-evolving halo-mass dependent galaxy-formation efficiency consistent with that observed today. Crucially, this simple model matches the observed galaxy UV LF over the redshift range $z \simeq 6-13$ and the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) at $z \simeq 6-8$. When combined with new constraints on Lyman continuum escape and the ionizing photon production efficiency of early galaxies, our model also predicts the progress of cosmic hydrogen reionization consistent with current observational constraints. The requirement to fit both the UV LF and the GSMF breaks the degeneracy between mass-light ratio and star-formation efficiency, and our model only works if the typical mass-to-light ratio of galaxies increases systematically with redshift beyond $z \simeq 6$. However, at present this does not require changes to the IMF, cosmic dust, or any other new astrophysics. Rather, the current data can be reproduced simply by assuming ever-younger stellar populations consistent with a formation epoch at $z \simeq 15$. A key prediction of our model is thus that there should be a more rapid drop-off in the numbers of galaxy number density beyond $z \simeq 15$, where one can no longer appeal to ever younger ages to offset the precipitous descent of the halo mass function.</description>

      <title>The Lack of RR Lyrae Variables in Ultrafaint Dwarf Galaxy Sextans II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RR Lyrae in ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxies, if found, would be valuable to constrain the distances of these UFD. In this work, we report our search of RR Lyrae in a recently discovered UFD -- Sextans II. Based on multiband ($griz$) time-series archival DECam imaging data, we do not find any RR Lyrae in Sextans II. On the contrary, the sparse multiband DECam light curves allowed recovery of a known foreground RR Lyrae, BB Sex, which happened to fall within the DECam images, and its pulsation period was correctly identified. Therefore, it is possible that Sextans II lacks RR Lyrae, similar to several other fainter UFDs (with $M_V \gtrsim -5.0$~mag) that do not have RR Lyrae.</description>

      <title>MOA-2022-BLG-033Lb, KMT-2023-BLG-0119Lb, and KMT-2023-BLG-1896Lb: Three low mass-ratio microlensing planets detected through dip signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examined the anomalies in the light curves of the lensing events MOA-2022-BLG-033, KMT-2023-BLG-0119, and KMT-2023-BLG-1896. We conducted detailed modeling of the light curves to uncover the nature of the anomalies. This modeling revealed that all signals originated from planetary companions to the primary lens. The planet-to-host mass ratios are very low: $q\sim 7.5\times 10^{-5}$ for MOA-2022-BLG-033, $q\sim 3.6\times 10^{-4}$ for KMT-2023-BLG-0119, and $q\sim 6.9\times 10^{-5}$ for KMT-2023-BLG-1896. The anomalies occurred as the source passed through the negative deviation region behind the central caustic along the planet-host axis. The solutions are subject to a common inner-outer degeneracy, resulting in variations in estimating the projected planet-host separation. For KMT-2023-BLG-1896, although the planetary scenario provides the best explanation of the anomaly, the binary companion scenario is marginally possible. We estimate the physical parameters of the planetary systems through Bayesian analyses based on the lensing observables. The analysis identifies MOA-2022-BLG-033L as a planetary system with an ice giant, approximately 12 times the mass of Earth, orbiting an early M dwarf star. The companion of KMT-2023-BLG-1896L is also an ice giant, with a mass around 16 Earth masses, orbiting a mid-K-type main-sequence star. The companion of KMT-2023-BLG-0119L, which has a mass about the mass of Saturn, orbits a mid-K-type dwarf star. The lens for MOA-2022-BLG-033 is highly likely to be located in the disk, whereas for the other events, the probabilities of the lens being in the disk or the bulge are roughly comparable.</description>

      <title>Concept camera for the next-generation mm-wave cosmological surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Past millimeter-wave galaxy surveys have probed the brightest starburst galaxies only and suffered heavily from confusion. The interpretation of existing surveys has also been hindered by the lack of reliable redshift indicators for measuring distances for the entire sample. Thanks to recent advances in mm-wave detector technologies we can now overcome these limitations, and conduct the first truly volumetric surveys of star-forming galaxies at mm-wavelengths down to the L* luminosities of typical galaxies, with ~1000 redshift slices spanning most of the Cosmic star-forming volume (z ~ 1--12) with nearly uniform mass and luminosity selection. We describe an instrument concept capable of delivering such surveys with the technologies available today, which can be built and operated on a ground-based mm-wave facility in the near future. Such spectrometer cameras can resolve and redshift identify up to to 25,000 star-forming galaxies per year even when operated on a 10-m class telescope. On a larger aperture it can do the same faster or probe even deeper. We propose a loose, open-source collaboration to design, build, and operate one or several such cameras through the shared contributions of leading experts and telescopes from around the globe.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength observations of a jet launch in real time from the post-changing-look Active Galaxy 1ES 1927+654</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results from a high cadence multi-wavelength observational campaign of the enigmatic changing look AGN 1ES 1927+654 from May 2022- April 2024, coincident with an unprecedented radio flare (an increase in flux by a factor of $\sim 60$ over a few months) and the emergence of a spatially resolved jet at $0.1-0.3$ pc scales (Meyer et al. 2024). Companion work has also detected a recurrent quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the $2-10$ keV band with an increasing frequency ($1-2$ mHz) over the same period (Masterson et al., 2025). During this time, the soft X-rays ($0.3-2$ keV) monotonically increased by a factor of $\sim 8$, while the UV emission remained near-steady with $&lt;30\%$ variation and the $2-10$ keV flux showed variation by a factor $\lesssim 2$. The weak variation of the $2-10$ keV X-ray emission and the stability of the UV emission suggest that the magnetic energy density and accretion rate are relatively unchanged, and that the jet could be launched due to a reconfiguration of the magnetic field (toroidal to poloidal) close to the black hole. Advecting poloidal flux onto the event horizon would trigger the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism, leading to the onset of the jet. The concurrent softening of the coronal slope (from $\Gamma= 2.70\pm 0.04$ to $\Gamma=3.27\pm 0.04$), the appearance of a QPO, and low coronal temperature ($kT_{e}=8_{-3}^{+8}$ keV) during the radio outburst suggest that the poloidal field reconfiguration can significantly impact coronal properties and thus influence jet dynamics. These extraordinary findings in real time are crucial for coronal and jet plasma studies, particularly as our results are independent of coronal geometry.</description>

      <title>VLT VIMOS Integral Field Spectroscopy of the nova remnant FH Ser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FH Ser experienced a slow classical nova outburst in February 1970 that was the first one observed at UV, optical, and IR wavelengths. Its nova remnant is elliptical in shape, with multiple knots, and a peculiar ring-like filament along its minor axis. This work aims at unveiling its true 3D spatio-kinematical structure to investigate the effects of early shaping and to assess its mass and kinetic energy using VLT VIMOS integral field spectroscopic observations. The data cube has been analyzed using 3D visualisations that reveal different structural components. FH Ser consists of a tilted prolate ellisoidal shell, most prominent in H-alpha, and a ring-like structure, most prominent in [N II]. The ellipsoidal shell has equatorial and polar velocities of 505 and 630 km/s, respectively, with its major axis tilted by 52 deg with respect to the line of sight. The inclination angle of the symmetry axis of the ring is similar, i.e., it can be described as an equatorial belt of the main ellipsoidal shell. The ionized mass is 2.6E-4 solar mass, with a kinetic energy of 1.6E45 erg. The presence of two different structural components in FH Ser with similar orientation can be linked to a density enhancement along a plane, most likely the orbital plane at the time of the nova event. The acquisition of integral field spectroscopic observations of nova remnants is most required to disentangle different structural components and to assess their 3D physical structure.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Redshift Evolution of Lensing Galaxy Density Slopes via Model-Independent Distance Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong lensing systems, expected to be abundantly discovered by next-generation surveys, offer a powerful tool for studying cosmology and galaxy evolution. The connection between galaxy structure and cosmology through distance ratios highlights the need to examine the evolution of lensing galaxy mass density profiles. We propose a novel, dark energy-model-independent method to investigate the mass density slopes of lensing galaxies and their redshift evolution using an extended power-law (EPL) model. We employ a non-parametric approach based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) trained on Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) data to reconstruct distance ratios of strong lensing systems. These ratios are compared with theoretical predictions to estimate the evolution of EPL model parameters. Analyses conducted at three levels, including the combined sample, individual lenses, and binned groups, ensure robust and reliable estimates. A negative trend in the mass density slope with redshift is observed, quantified as $\partial\gamma/\partial z = -0.20 \pm 0.12$ under a triangular prior for anisotropy. This study demonstrates that the redshift evolution of density slopes in lensing galaxies can be determined independently of dark energy models. Simulations based on LSST Rubin Observatory forecasts, which anticipate 100,000 strong lenses, show that spectroscopic follow-up of just 10 percent of these systems can constrain the redshift evolution coefficient with uncertainty ($\Delta\partial\gamma/\partial z$) to 0.021. This precision distinguishes evolving and non-evolving density slopes, providing new insights into galaxy evolution and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Distributions of wide binary stars in theory and in Gaia data: I. Generalized Ambartsumian (1937) approach and the family of power-law distributions of eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The orbital parameter space of wide, weakly bound binary stars has been shaped by the still poorly known circumstances of their formation, as well as by subsequent dynamical evolution in parent clusters and in the field. The advance of the Gaia mission astrometry takes statistical studies of wide stellar systems to an unprecedented level of precision and scope. On the theoretical side of the problem, the old approach proposed by Jeans and developed by Ambartsumian is revisited here. It is shown how certain simplifying assumptions about the phase density of binary systems in the framework of general copula distributions can lead to a family of analytical representations for the marginal distribution of orbital eccentricity, including accommodating and flexible power-law models. We further demonstrate the application of these models in forward Monte Carlo simulations of the measured motion angles between the relative velocity and separation vectors on the example of 170K listed Gaia binary systems, providing inference in the intrinsic distribution of orbital eccentricity.</description>

      <title>Equatorial Enhancement in the Dustiest OH/IR Stars in the Galactic Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have detected the 10 um silicate feature and the 11.3 um crystalline forsterite feature in absorption in 21 oxygen-rich AGB stars in the Galactic Bulge. The depths of the 10 um feature indicate highly-obscured circumstellar environments. The additional crystalline features may suggest either an extended envelope or dust formation in a high-density environment. We have also modeled the Spectral Energy Distributions of the sample using radiative transfer models, and compared the results to wind speeds measured using 1612 MHz circumstellar OH masers, as well as previous estimates of circumstellar properties. The sixteen sources with measured pulsation periods appear on sequence D of the mid-infrared Period-Luminosity relation, associated with the Long Secondary Period. We suspect that all of these sources are in fact fundamental mode pulsators. At least two sources appear on the fundamental mode sequence when accounting for the dust content. For the remainder, these sources are also likely fundamental mode pulsators with extended envelopes. Taken as a whole, the high optical depths, crystalline features, discrepancies between observed and modeled wind speeds, pulsation periods longer than other fundamental mode pulsators, and SED and pulsation properties similar to those with known equatorially-enhanced circumstellar envelopes (e.g. OH 26.5+0.6 and OH 30.1-0.7) lead us to believe that these sources are likely to be equatorially-enhanced.</description>

      <title>First result from tetrafluoroethane (C$_2$H$_2$F$_4$) superheated emulsion detector for dark matter search at JUSL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superheated emulsion detector consisting of the droplets of tetra-fluoroethane (C2HC$_2$H$_2$F$_4$2F4) has been fabricated at the laboratory and installed at the 555m deep underground laboratory, JUSL during July to Dec 2022. The 500ml detector ran for an effective period of 48.6 days at a threshold of 5.87 keV with an exposure of 2.47 kg-days. The acoustic signals produced due to the bubble nucleation were collected by the acoustic sensor and FPGAbased data acquisition system. The data shows a minimum sensitivity of SI-nucleon for carbon at WIMP mass of 22.81 GeV/c$^2$ and SD (p) for fluorine at 30.67 GeV/c$^2$. The threshold of WIMP mass is 5.16 GeV/c$^2$ for F and 4.44 GeV/c$^2$ for C at the operating threshold of 5.87 keV. The first result of the dark matter direct search experiment named InDEx with tetra-fluoro-ethane active liquid from JUSL underground laboratory is reported in this article.</description>

      <title>Polarimetric Study of GRS 1915+105: Estimation of Interstellar Polarization Component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GRS 1915+105 is a well-known X-ray binary system composed of a black hole with a low-mass companion star and is recognized for emitting relativistic jets. Imazato et al. (2021) performed extensive polarimetry in a near-infrared (NIR) Ks band from 2019 April through December when GRS 1915+105 experienced an X-ray low luminous state and found almost stable polarization of P=2.42% +/- 0.08%. We performed NIR polarimetry of the field stars around GRS 1915+105 in 2023 April and October, and found that the field stars that are not listed in Gaia DR3 and StarHorse2 catalogues show well aligned polarization that is consistent with GRS 1915+105' s polarization. Those suggest that the interstellar clouds existing beyond 4 kpc causes the large interstellar extinction and that the polarization the GRS 1915+105 is mostly originated from the magnetically aligned dust grains within the clouds. Therefore, the jet-origin synchrotron radiation polarization would have given only minor contribution in the NIR band in 2019 Apr-Dec.</description>

      <title>FRELLED Reloaded: Multiple techniques for astronomical data visualisation in Blender</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present version 5.0 of FRELLED, the FITS Realtime Explorer of Low Latency in Every Dimension. This is a 3D data visualisation package for the popular Blender art software, designed to allow inspection of astronomical volumetric data sets (primarily, but not exclusively, radio wavelength data cubes) in real time using a variety of visualisation techniques. The suite of Python scripts that comprise FRELLED have been almost completely recoded and many new ones added, bringing FRELLED's operating environment from Blender version 2.49 to 2.79. Principle new features include: an enormously simplified installation procedure, a more modular graphical appearance that takes advantage of Blender 2.79's improved interface, much faster loading of FITS data, support for larger data sets, options to show the data as height maps in 2D mode or isosurfaces in 3D mode, utilisation of standard astropy and other Python modules to support a greater range of FITS files (with a particular emphasis on higher-frequency radio data such as from ALMA, the Atacama Large Millimetre Array), and the capability of exporting the data to Blender 2.9+ which supports stereoscopic 3D displays in virtual reality headsets. In addition, in-built help files are accessible from each menu panel, as well as direct links to a complete wiki and set of video tutorials. Finally, the code itself is much more modular, allowing easier maintainability and, over the longer term, a far easier prospect of migrating to more recent versions of Blender.</description>

      <title>Production of linear alkanes via the solid-state hydrogenation of interstellar polyynes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly unsaturated carbon chains, including polyynes, have been detected in many astronomical regions and planetary systems. With the success of the QUIJOTE survey of the TMC-1, the community has seen a "boom" in the number of detected carbon chains. On the other hand, the Rosetta mission revealed the release of fully saturated hydrocarbons, C$_3$H$_8$, C$_4$H$_{10}$, C$_5$H$_{12}$, and (under specific conditions) C$_6$H$_{14}$ with C$_7$H$_{16}$, from the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The detection of the latter two is attributed to dust-rich events. Similarly, the analysis of samples returned from asteroid Ryugu by Hayabusa2 mission indicates the presence of long saturated aliphatic chains in Ryugu's organic matter. The surface chemistry of unsaturated carbon chains under conditions resembling those of molecular clouds can provide a possible link among these independent observations. However, laboratory-based investigations to validate such a chemistry is still lacking. In the present study, we aim to experimentally verify the formation of fully saturated hydrocarbons by the surface hydrogenation of C$_{2n}$H$_2$ ($n&gt;1$) polyynes under ultra-high vacuum conditions at 10 K. We undertook a two-step experimental technique. First, a thin layer of C$_2$H$_2$ ice was irradiated by UV-photons ($\geq$ 121 nm) to achieve a partial conversion of C$_2$H$_2$ into larger polyynes: C$_4$H$_2$ and C$_6$H$_2$. Afterwards, the obtained photoprocessed ice was exposed to H atoms to verify the formation of various saturated hydrocarbons. In addition to C$_2$H$_6$, which was investigated previously, the formation of larger alkanes, including C$_4$H$_{10}$ and (tentatively) C$_6$H$_{14}$, is confirmed by our study. A qualitative analysis of the obtained kinetic data indicates that hydrogenation of HCCH and HCCCCH triple bonds proceeds at comparable rates, given a surface temperature of 10 K.}</description>

      <title>Electrostatic instability of non-spherical dust in sub-stellar clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charged dust clouds play an important role in the evolution of sub-stellar atmospheres through electrical discharges such as lightning events or inter-grain discharges. The consequent plasma activation presents an alternative source of disequilibrium chemistry, potentially triggering a set of chemical reactions otherwise energetically unavailable. The aim of this paper is to address the problem of the electrostatic stability of charged spheroidal dust grains in sub-stellar clouds and its impact on inter-grain electrostatic discharges, the available area for atmospheric gas-phase surface chemistry, the particle eccentricity distribution function and observed polarization signatures. This paper has derived the criterion for the allowed values of dust eccentricity that are electrostatically stable as a function of grain size $a\in[0.2,1.8]~\mu$m, floating potential $\phi_{f}\in[1, 10]$~V and tensile strength $\Sigma_{s}=10^{3}$~Pa. As a consequence of electrostatic instability we also calculate the expected electric field enhancement at the spheroidal poles, the increased surface area of a dust grain, the truncation of the particle eccentricity distribution function and the resultant degree of polarization. Dust grains with an eccentricity below a critical value will be electrostatically stable; whereas, grains with an eccentricity above a critical value will be unstable. The results presented here are applicable not only to spheroidal dust grains but any non-spherical dust grains where non-uniform surface electric fields or inhomogeneous tensile strengths could be susceptible to electrostatic instability. In this context electrostatic erosion presents a mechanism that may produce bumpy, irregularly shaped or porous grains.</description>

      <title>A New Constraint on the Relative Disorder of Magnetic Fields between Neutral Interstellar Medium Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03846v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing Planck polarized dust emission maps at 353 GHz and new large-area maps of the neutral hydrogen (HI) cold neutral medium (CNM) fraction ($f_\mathrm{CNM}$), we investigate the relationship between dust polarization fraction ($p_{353}$) and $f_\mathrm{CNM}$ in the diffuse high latitude ($|b|&gt;30^{\circ}$) sky. We find that the correlation between $p_{353}$ and $f_\mathrm{CNM}$ is qualitatively distinct from the $p_{353}$-HI column density ($N_\mathrm{H\,I}$) relationship. At low column densities ($N_\mathrm{H\,I}&lt;4\times10^{20}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$) where $p_{353}$ and $N_\mathrm{H\,I}$ are uncorrelated, there is a strong positive $p_{353}$-$f_\mathrm{CNM}$ correlation. We fit the $p_{353}$-$f_{\rm CNM}$ correlation with data-driven models to constrain the degree of magnetic field disorder between phases along the line-of-sight. We argue that an increased magnetic field disorder in the warm neutral medium (WNM) relative to the CNM best explains the positive $p_{353}$-$f_\mathrm{CNM}$ correlation in diffuse regions. Modeling the CNM-associated dust column as being maximally polarized, with a polarization fraction $p_{\rm CNM} \sim$ 0.2, we find that the best-fit mean polarization fraction in the WNM-associated dust column is 0.22$p_{\rm CNM}$. The model further suggests that a significant $f_{\rm CNM}$-correlated fraction of the non-CNM column (an additional ~18.4% of the HI mass on average) is also more magnetically ordered, and we speculate that the additional column is associated with the unstable medium (UNM). Our results constitute a new large-area constraint on the average relative disorder of magnetic fields between the neutral phases of the ISM, and are consistent with the physical picture of a more magnetically aligned CNM column forming out of a disordered WNM.</description>

      <title>FORECASTOR -- II. Simulating Galaxy Surveys with the Cosmological Advanced Survey Telescope for Optical and UV Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cosmological Advanced Survey Telescope for Optical and UV Research (CASTOR) is a planned flagship space telescope, covering the blue-optical and UV part of the spectrum. Here we introduce the CASTOR image simulator, a Python GalSim package-based script capable of generating mock CASTOR images from an input catalogue. We generate example images from the CASTOR Wide, Deep, and Ultra-Deep surveys using simulated light-cones from the Santa Cruz Semi-Analytic Model. We make predictions for the performance of these surveys by comparing galaxies that are extracted from each image using Source Extractor to the input catalogue. We find that the Wide, Deep, and Ultra-Deep surveys will be 75% complete for point sources down to ~27, 29 and 30 mag, respectively, in the UV, u, and g filters, with the UV-split and u-split filters reaching a shallower depth. With a large area of ~2200 deg$^2$, the Wide survey will detect hundreds of millions of galaxies out to z~4, mostly with $M_\ast \gtrsim 10^9 M_\odot$. The Ultra-Deep survey will probe to z~5, detecting galaxies with $M_\ast \gtrsim 10^7 M_\odot$. These galaxy samples will enable precision measurements of the distribution of star formation in the cosmic web, connecting the growth of stellar mass to the assembly of dark matter halos over two thirds of the history of the Universe, and other core goals of CASTOR's legacy surveys. These image simulations and the tools developed to generate them will be a vital planning tool to estimate CASTOR's performance and iterate the telescope and survey designs prior to launch.</description>

      <title>EPOCHS IV: SED Modelling Assumptions and their impact on the Stellar Mass Function at 46.5 &lt; z &lt; 13.5$ using PEARLS and public JWST observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We utilize deep JWST NIRCam observations for the first direct constraints on the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function (GSMF) at $z&gt;10$. Our EPOCHS v1 sample includes 1120 galaxy candidates at $6.5&lt;z&lt;13.5$ taken from a consistent reduction and analysis of publicly available deep JWST NIRCam data covering the PEARLS, CEERS, GLASS, JADES GOOD-S, NGDEEP, and SMACS0723 surveys, totalling 187 arcmin$^2$. We investigate the impact of SED fitting methods, assumed star formation histories (SFH), dust laws, and priors on galaxy masses and the resultant GSMF. Whilst our fiducial GSMF agrees with the literature at $z&lt;13.5$, we find that the assumed SFH model has a large impact on the GSMF and stellar mass density (SMD), finding a 0.75~dex increase in the SMD at $z=10.5$ between a flexible non-parametric and standard parametric SFH. Overall, we find a flatter SMD evolution at $z \geq 9$ than some studies predict, suggesting a rapid buildup of stellar mass in the early Universe. We find no incompatibility between our results and those of standard cosmological models, as suggested previously, although the most massive galaxies may require a high star formation efficiency. We find that the "Little Red Dot" galaxies dominate the $z=7$ GSMF at high-masses, necessitating a better understanding of the relative contributions of AGN and stellar emission. We show that assuming a theoretically motivated top-heavy IMF reduces stellar mass by 0.5~dex without affecting fit quality, but our results remain consistent with existing cosmological models with a standard IMF.</description>

      <title>Identification of $&gt;$40 gravitationally magnified stars in a galaxy at redshift of 0.725</title>

Abstract: Strong gravitational magnifications enable to detect faint background sources, resolve their internal structures, and even identify individual stars in distant galaxies. Highly magnified individual stars allow various applications, including studies of stellar populations in distant galaxies and constraining dark matter structures in the lensing plane. However, these applications have been hampered by the small number of individual stars observed, as typically one or a few stars are identified from each distant galaxy. Here, we report the discovery of more than 40 microlensed stars in a single galaxy behind Abell 370 at redshift of 0.725 when the Universe was half of its current age (dubbed ``the Dragon arc''), using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations with the time-domain technique. These events are found near the expected lensing critical curves, suggesting that these are magnified stars that appear as transients from intracluster stellar microlenses. Through multi-wavelength photometry, we constrain stellar types and find that many of them are consistent with red giants/supergiants magnified by factors of hundreds. This finding reveals an unprecedented high occurrence of microlensing events in the Dragon arc, and proves that {\it JWST}'s time-domain observations open up the possibility of conducting statistical studies of high-redshift stars.</description>

      <title>Constraining SN Ia Progenitors from the Observed Fe-peak Elemental Abundances in the Milky Way Dwarf Galaxy Satellites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical abundances of iron-peak elements in the red giants of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFD) and dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph) are among the best diagnostics in the cosmos to probe the origin of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia). We incorporate metallicity-dependent SN Ia nucleosynthesis models for different progenitor masses in our inhomogeneous galactic chemical evolution model, {\tt{i-GEtool}}, to recreate the observed elemental abundance patterns and their spread in a sample of UFD and dSph galaxies with different average metallicities and star formation histories. Observations across different environments indicate that [Mn/Mg] increases on average with metallicity while [Ni/Mg] remains nearly constant. The average dispersion of [X/Mg] from our UFD model ranges between $0.20$ and $0.25$ for iron-peak elements, with the exception of [Sc/Mg] that has $\sigma \approx 0.39$. Chemical evolution models assuming Chandrasekhar mass (M$_{\text{Ch}}$) SN Ia progenitors produce similar [Mn/Mg]-[Fe/H] and [Ni/Mg]-[Fe/H] abundance patterns to those observed in the examined UFD and dSph galaxies, without the need to invoke a substantial fraction of sub-M$_{\text{ch}}$ progenitors that change across different environments, as claimed by some previous chemical evolution studies. Sub-M$_{\text{ch}}$ progenitors in our dSph models under produce both [Ni/Mg]-[Fe/H] and [Ni/Mg]-[Fe/H] abundance patterns, with the $1\,\text{M}_{\odot}$ sub-M$_{\text{ch}}$ model explaining a number of outliers in [Ni/Mg]-[Fe/H], while the outliers in [Mn/Mg]-[Fe/H] require higher sub-M$_{\text{ch}}$ progenitor masses.</description>

      <title>The influence of the cloud virial parameter on the initial mass function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crucial for star formation is the interplay between gravity and turbulence. The observed cloud virial parameter, $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$, which is the ratio of twice the turbulent kinetic energy to the gravitational energy, is found to vary significantly in different environments, where the scatter among individual star-forming clouds can exceed an order of magnitude. Therefore, a strong dependence of the initial mass function (IMF) on $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ may challenge the notion of a universal IMF. To determine the role of $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ on the IMF, we compare the star-particle mass functions obtained in high-resolution magnetohydrodynamical simulations including jet and heating feedback, with $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}=0.0625$, $0.125$, and $0.5$. We find that varying $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ from $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}\sim0.5$ to $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}&lt;0.1$ shifts the peak of the IMF to lower masses by a factor of $\sim2$ and increases the star formation rate by a similar factor. The dependence of the IMF and star formation rate on $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ is non-linear, with the dependence subsiding at $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}&lt;0.1$. Our study shows a systematic dependence of the IMF on $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$. Yet, it may not be measurable easily in observations, considering the uncertainties, and the relatively weak dependence found in this study.</description>

      <title>Simulating high-redshift galaxies: Enhancing UV luminosity with star formation efficiency and a top-heavy IMF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent findings from photometric and spectroscopic JWST surveys have identified examples of high-redshift galaxies at $z \gtrsim 10$. These high-$z$ galaxies appear to form much earlier and exhibit greater UV luminosity than predicted by theoretical work. In this study, our goal is to reproduce the brightness of these sources by simulating high-redshift galaxies with virial masses $M_{\rm vir} = 10^{9} - 10^{10} M_{\odot}$ at $z &gt; 10$. To achieve this, we conduct cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations, modifying baryonic sub-grid physics, and post-process our simulation results to confirm the observability of our simulated galaxies. Specifically, we enhanced star formation activity in high-redshift galaxies by either increasing the star formation efficiency up to 100\% or adopting a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF). Our simulation results indicate that both increasing star formation efficiency and adopting a top-heavy IMF play crucial roles in boosting the UV luminosity of high-redshift galaxies, potentially exceeding the limiting magnitude of JWST surveys in earlier epochs. Especially, the episodic starburst resulting from enhanced star formation efficiency may explain the high-redshift galaxies observed by JWST, as it evacuates dust from star-forming regions, making the galaxies more observable. We demonstrate this correlation between star formation activity and dust mass evolution within the simulated galaxies. Also, adopting a top-heavy IMF could enhance observability due to an overabundance of massive stars, although it may also facilitate rapid metal enrichment. Using our simulation results, we derive several observables such as effective radius, UV slope, and emission line rates, which could serve as valuable theoretical estimates for comparison with existing spectroscopic results and forthcoming data from the JWST NIRSpec and MIRI instruments.</description>

      <title>The Age-velocity Dispersion Relations of the Galactic Disk as Revealed by the LAMOST-Gaia Red Clump Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using nearly 230,000 red clump (RC) stars selected from LAMOST and Gaia, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the stellar age-velocity dispersion relations (AVRs) for various disk populations, within 5.0 $\leq$ $R$ $\leq$ 15.0 kpc and $|Z|$ $\leq$ 3.0 kpc. The AVRs of the whole RC sample stars are accurately described as $\sigma_{v}$ = $\sigma_{v,0}$ ($\tau$ + 0.1)$^{\beta_{v}}$, with $\beta_{R}$, $\beta_{\phi}$ and $\beta_{Z}$ displaying a global exponential decreasing trend with $R$, which may point to the difference in spatial distributions of various disk heating mechanisms. The measurements of $\beta$ $-$ $R$ for various disks suggest that the thin disk exhibits a radial dependence, with a global exponential decreasing trend in $\beta_{R}$ $-$ $R$ and $\beta_{Z}$ $-$ $R$, while $\beta_{\phi}$ remains a nearly constant value (around 0.20$\sim$0.25) within 8.5 $\leq$ $R$ $\leq$ 11.5 kpc. The thick disk displays a global increasing trend in $\beta_{R}$ $-$ $R$, $\beta_{\phi}$ $-$ $R$ and $\beta_{Z}$ $-$ $R$. These results indicate that the thin disk stars are likely heated by long-term heating from GMCs and spiral arms, while thick disk stars are likely heated by some violent heating process from merger and accretion, and/or formed by the inside-out and upside-down star formation scenarios, and/or born in the chaotic mergers of gas-rich systems and/or turbulent ISM. Our results also suggest that the disk perturbation by a recent minor merger from Sagittarius may have occurred within 3.0 Gyr.</description>

      <title>Variability of Central Stars of Planetary Nebulae with the Zwicky Transient Facility. I. Methods, Short-Timescale Variables, Binary Candidates, and the Unusual Nucleus of WeSb 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03589</link>

Abstract: Over the past several decades, time-series photometry of CSPNe has yielded significant results including, but not limited to, discoveries of nearly 100 binary systems, insights into pulsations and winds in young white dwarfs, and studies of stars undergoing very late thermal pulses. We have undertaken a systematic study of optical photometric variability of cataloged CSPNe, using the light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). By applying appropriate variability metrics, we arrive at a list of 94 highly variable CSPN candidates. Based on the timescales of the light-curve activity, we classify the variables broadly into short- and long-timescale variables. In this first paper in this series, we focus on the former, which is the majority class comprising 83 objects. We report periods for six sources for the first time, and recover several known periodic variables. Among the aperiodic sources, most exhibit a jitter around a median flux with a stable amplitude, and a few show outbursts. We draw attention to WeSb 1, which shows a different kind of variability: prominent deep and aperiodic dips, resembling transits from a dust/debris disk. We find strong evidence for a binary nature of WeSb 1 (possibly an F-type subgiant companion). The compactness of the emission lines and inferred high electron densities make WeSb 1 a candidate for either an EGB 6-type planetary nucleus, or a symbiotic system inside an evolved planetary nebula, both of which are rare objects. To demonstrate further promise with ZTF, we report three additional newly identified periodic sources that do not appear in the list of highly variable sources. Finally, we also introduce a two-dimensional metric space defined by the von Neumann statistics and Pearson Skew and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying unique variables of astrophysical interest, like WeSb 1.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Prediction of Strong Lensing Systems with Domain Adaptation and Uncertainty Quantification</title>

Abstract: Modeling strong gravitational lenses is computationally expensive for the complex data from modern and next-generation cosmic surveys. Deep learning has emerged as a promising approach for finding lenses and predicting lensing parameters, such as the Einstein radius. Mean-variance Estimators (MVEs) are a common approach for obtaining aleatoric (data) uncertainties from a neural network prediction. However, neural networks have not been demonstrated to perform well on out-of-domain target data successfully - e.g., when trained on simulated data and applied to real, observational data. In this work, we perform the first study of the efficacy of MVEs in combination with unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) on strong lensing data. The source domain data is noiseless, and the target domain data has noise mimicking modern cosmology surveys. We find that adding UDA to MVE increases the accuracy on the target data by a factor of about two over an MVE model without UDA. Including UDA also permits much more well-calibrated aleatoric uncertainty predictions. Advancements in this approach may enable future applications of MVE models to real observational data.</description>

      <title>Black Holes and Baryon Number Violation: Unveiling the Origins of Early Galaxies and the Low-Mass Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that modifications to the Higgs potential within a narrow atmospheric layer near the event horizon of an astrophysical black hole could significantly enhance the rate of sphaleron transitions, as well as transform the Chern-Simons number into a dynamic variable. As a result, sphaleron transitions in this region occur without suppression, in contrast to low-temperature conditions, and each transition may generate a substantially greater baryon number than would be produced by winding around the Higgs potential in Minkowski spacetime. This effect amplifies baryon number violation near the black hole horizon, potentially leading to a considerable generation of matter. Given the possibility of a departure from equilibrium during the absorption of matter and the formation of relativistic jets in supermassive black holes, we conjecture that this process could contribute to the creation of a significant amount of matter around such black holes. This phenomenon may offer an alternative explanation for the rapid growth of supermassive black holes and their surrounding galaxies in the early Universe, as suggested by recent observations from the JWST. Furthermore, this mechanism may provide insights into the low-mass gap puzzle, addressing the observed scarcity of black holes with masses near the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit.</description>
