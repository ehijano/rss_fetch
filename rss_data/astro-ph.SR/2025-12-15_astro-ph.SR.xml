      <title>Seeking Spectroscopic Binaries with Data-Driven Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven stellar classification has a long and important history in astronomy, dating as far back as Annie Jump Cannon's "by eye" classifications of stars into spectral types still used today. In recent years, data-driven spectroscopy has proven to be an effective means of deriving stellar properties for large samples of stars, sidestepping issues with computational efficiency, incomplete line lists, and radiative transfer calculations associated with physical stellar models. A logical application of these algorithms is the detection of unresolved stellar binaries, which requires accurate spectroscopic models to resolve flux contributions from a fainter secondary star in the spectrum. Here we use The Cannon to train a data-driven model on spectra from the Keck High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer. We show that our model is competitive with existing data-driven models in its ability to predict stellar properties Teff, stellar radius, [Fe/H], vsin(i), and instrumental PSF, particularly when we apply a novel wavelet-based processing step to spectra before training. We find that even with accurate estimates of star properties, our model's ability to detect unresolved binaries is limited by its approx. 3% accuracy in per-pixel flux predictions, illuminating possible limitations of data-driven model applications.</description>

      <title>The Crab Nebula Revisited Using HST/WFC3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been over 24 years since the iconic Crab Nebula has been visited by the high spatial resolution eye of the Hubble Space Telescope. The expanding nebula is dynamic on these timescales, with many of the outer filaments of the nebula known to show proper motions of 0.3'' or more per year. Over time, it has become increasingly difficult to compare the fine scale structure of the nebula with recent data at other wavelengths. We have re-observed the Crab in an HST Cycle 31 program using the WFC3 camera and filters similar to those previously used to make the existing mosaic that dates from 1999-2000 and was obtained with the WFPC2 camera. Two central fields were observed with the F487N filter, providing an uncontaminated hydrogen band for comparison. We also observed two primarily continuum band filters (F547M and F763M), allowing us to study the optical synchrotron nebula component of the Crab's emission. We compare these new data to the first epoch of WFPC2 data as well as to more contemporaneous NIR/MIR imagery from JWST. Finally, we highlight two previously unrecognized groupings of filaments with similar emission characteristics that are nearly diametrically opposed from the pulsar but whose origin remains uncertain.</description>

      <title>First Detection of an Ultracool Dwarf at 340 MHz: VLITE Observations of EI Cancri AB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetically driven phenomena such as flaring events and aurorae lead ultracool dwarfs to emit at radio frequencies. Despite decades of scrutiny, a comprehensive physical understanding of their radio emission at different frequencies remains elusive, spurring on additional study of these complex objects. The VLA Low-band Ionosphere and Transient Experiment (VLITE) is a commensal instrument operating at 340 MHz on the Very Large Array. A key advantage of 340 MHz observations is their sensitivity to circumstellar disks and planets at understudied distances from the stellar disk, intermediate between GHz and low MHz sensitivities. Hard-to-find coronal mass ejections are also predicted to be detectable at 340 MHz. However, this frequency regime is relatively unprobed in ultracool dwarf studies, with few searches and no published detections to date. Here we highlight our investigation of the nearby M7-M7 binary, EI Cancri. EI Cancri AB is magnetically active, yet has an uncharacteristically long 83-day candidate rotation period within the system. With the VLITE detection of the EI Cancri system, we present the first ever detection of ultracool dwarf emission at 340 MHz.</description>

      <title>The magnetic origin of the outer boundary of sunspots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Sunspot boundaries are commonly outlined by contours of the continuum intensity. However, their magnetic nature has not yet been fully characterised.
  Aims. We investigate the properties of the outer boundary of a long-lived sunspot to identify the magnetic property that defines it.
  Methods. We analysed the magnetic properties of AR NOAA11591 spot during its two passages across the solar disc, using SDO/HMI continuum intensity and magnetic field, and determined their contours to outline the outer boundary.
  Results. During the 1st disc passage, in which the sunspot is in its stable phase, the intensity contours at 0.9 of the mean quiet Sun intensity and isocontours of the magnetic field strength of 625G provide an almost perfect match between the two contours. With these thresholds, the time-averaged area of mismatch is minimised, yielding an average distance between the contours of 0.58 pixel, corresponding to less than 0.26 arcsec. During the 2nd disc passage, the spot shows clear signs of decay, and we find that the 0.9 intensity and 625G magnetic isocontours detach from each other, coupled to the disappearance of penumbra. In this super-equipartition area, granulation still operates.
  Conclusions. Based on a comparison with simulation data from our previous work, and in agreement with findings of other authors, we conclude that the outer boundary of stable sunspots is defined by an invariant magnetic field: the equipartition field. From the discrepancy between intensity and magnetic contours during the decaying phase of the sunspot, we surmise that alongside the well-established (magneto-)convective regimes of the photosphere - granular, penumbral, and umbral - a super-equipartition granular regime can be identified. In this regime, bright, but smaller granules occur where the magnetic field exceeds equipartition but remains sub-critical for convection suppression.</description>

      <title>Free Energy Sources of Ion-scale Waves Observed by Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observes abundant circularly polarized ion-scale waves throughout the inner heliosphere. These waves are a signature of the interplay between plasma microinstabilities and turbulent dissipation. We perform a mission-wide statistical survey of ion-scale waves observed by PSP, investigating if the waves correspond to specific free energy sources in the measured proton velocity distributions. We find that left-handed waves (LHWs) are frequently observed, with the fraction of time they are observed increasing closer to the Sun, reaching $\sim$30\%. Right-handed waves (RHWs) are less frequently observed, with the associated time fraction decreasing closer to the Sun. The observed LHWs are generally consistent with parallel propagating ion cyclotron wave (ICW) storms that occur continuously for extended periods of time. Turbulent energy spectra are consistently steeper when LHW storms are observed; these wave storms mediate the spatial transport of the free energy associated with temperature anisotropy. The observed RHWs are generally consistent with oblique and parallel fast magnetosonic waves (FMWs), and their observation is well correlated with enhanced proton parallel heat flux, which quantifies the presence of secondary proton populations. Using observations and the SAVIC machine learning instability identification algorithm, we identify a threshold on the proton heat flux beyond which FMWs are likely to be driven unstable by the proton beams. We are thus able to associate trends in the observed ion-scale waves with known sources of free energy for Encounters 3 through 24 of the PSP's prime science phase.</description>

      <title>The Response of Rotating Stellar Convection to Latitudinally-Varying Heat Flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how rotating convection responds to the imposition of a latitudinally-varying heat flux at the base of the convective layer. This study is motivated by the solar near-surface shear layer, whose flows are thought to transition from a buoyancy-dominated regime near the photosphere to a rotation-dominated regime at depth. Here, we conduct a suite of spherical 3-D, nonlinear simulations of rotating convection that operate in either the buoyancy-dominated (high-Rossby-number, high-Ro) or rotation-dominated (low-Rossby-number, low-Ro) regime. At the base of each model convection zone, we impose a heat flux whose latitudinal variation is opposite to the variation that the system would ordinarily develop. In both the low- and high-Ro regimes, a strong thermal wind balance is sustained in the absence of forcing. With a larger flux variation, this balance becomes stronger at high latitudes and weaker at low latitudes. The resulting differential rotation weakens in response and, at sufficiently high forcing, its latitudinal variation reverses for both low- and high-Ro systems. At fixed forcing, there exists a Rossby number above which the convective flows efficiently mix heat laterally, and the imposed flux variation does not imprint to the surface. At sufficiently high-Ro, thermal wind balance is no longer satisfied. We discuss these results within the context of the Sun's near-surface region, which possesses a weakened differential rotation when compared to the deep convection, along with little-to-no variation of photospheric emissivity in latitude.</description>

      <title>Varying core-envelope coupling efficiency identified from stellar rotation--activity relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core-envelope coupling provides a reasonable explanation of the spin-down stalling of stars in open clusters, which was not predicted by classical gyrochronology. However, it remains an open question whether the coupling efficiency is constant or variable. M dwarfs, possessing thicker convective envelopes and thus longer coupling timescales than other late-type stars, are ideal objects for this investigation. In this letter, we present a new analysis using LAMOST and DESI spectra to construct the rotation--activity ($R_{\rm{HK}}^{'}$--Ro) relation for M dwarfs. The new relation consists of three distinct regimes of fast, intermediate, and slow rotation, closely matching the three sequences of gyrochronology, namely the ``Convective'' sequence, ``Gap'', and ``Interface'' sequence. Our study reveals, for the first time, a variable activity decay rate in the intermediate-rotation regime (i.e., the ``Gap'' region). This implies a varying core-envelope coupling efficiency, peaking towards the end of this region. It also coincides with the well-known stage of stalled stellar spin-down.</description>

      <title>The hydrogen-free circumstellar interaction in the Type Ib supernova 2021efd: A clue to the mechanism of the helium-layer stripping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe), including Type IIb, Ib, and Ic supernovae (SNe), originate from the explosions of massive stars whose outer envelopes have been largely removed during their lifetimes. The main stripping mechanism for the hydrogen (H) envelope in the progenitors of SESNe is often considered to be interaction with a binary companion, while that for the helium (He) layer is unclear. We conducted photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type Ib SN 2021efd, which shows signs of interaction with H-free circumstellar material (CSM). Around 30 days after the r-band light curve (LC) peak, until at least ~ 770 days, its LCs display excessive luminosity compared to regular SESNe and at least three distinct peaks. The light curve evolution is similar to that of SN 2019tsf, whose previously unpublished spectrum at 400 days is also presented here. The nebular spectrum of SN 2021efd shows narrow emission lines (~ 1000 km/s) in various species. Our observations suggest that SN 2021efd is a Type Ib SN interacting with CSM with the following parameters: The estimated CSM mass, composition, and distribution are at least a few times 0.1 M_sun, H-free, and clumpy, respectively. Based on the estimated ejecta properties, we conclude that this event is a transitional SN whose progenitor was experiencing He-layer stripping at the epoch of the explosion, and was on the way to becoming a carbon-oxygen star from a He star. The estimated CSM properties suggest that the progenitor had some episodic mass ejections with a rate of ~ 0.001-0.01 M_sun/yr for the last decade and slightly smaller before this final phase at least from ~ 200 years before the explosion, for the assumed CSM velocity of 100 km/s. For the case of ~ 1000 km/s, the necessary mass-loss rate would be increased by a factor of ten, and the timescales decreased by a factor of ten.</description>

      <title>Type II and Type III Solar Radio Burst Classification Using Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sun periodically emits intense bursts of radio emission known as solar radio bursts (SRBs). These bursts can disrupt radio communications and be indicative of large solar events that can disrupt technological infrastructure on Earth and in space. The risks posed by these events highlight the need for automated SRB classification, providing the potential to improve event detection and real-time monitoring. This would advance the techniques used to study space weather and related phenomena. A dataset containing images of radio spectra was created using data recorded by the Compound Astronomical Low frequency Low cost Instrument for Spectroscopy and Transportable Observatory (e-Callisto) network. This dataset comprises three categories: empty spectrograms; spectrograms containing Type II SRBs; and spectrograms containing Type III SRBs. These images were used to fine-tune several popular pre-trained deep learning models for classifying Type II and Type III SRBs. The evaluated models included VGGnet-19, MobileNet, ResNet-152, DenseNet-201, and YOLOv8. Testing the models on the test set produced F1 scores ranging from 87\% to 92\%. YOLOv8 emerged as the best-performing model among them, demonstrating that using pre-trained models for event classification can provide an automated solution for SRB classification. This approach provides a practical solution to the limited number of data samples available for Type II SRBs.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Initial Mass Dependent Convective Boundary Mixing on the Structure and Fates of Massive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While convection has been known to play a key role in stars for many decades, its implementation in one-dimensional stellar evolution codes still represents a major uncertainty today. The purpose of this work is to investigate the impact of initial mass dependent convective boundary mixing (CBM), often referred to as overshooting, on the frequency and type of nuclear burning shell interactions that occur in low metallicity massive stars and the subsequent effect on their fates. Two grids of models were calculated using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code and a 22-isotope nuclear network, each with a different strength of CBM applied. One grid uses the typical CBM value for diffusive overshooting used in literature whereas the other grid uses CBM values guided by the results of 3D convection simulations. Interactions between the carbon, neon and oxygen shells (C-Ne-O) are common throughout both grids. The higher CBM grid also exhibits more frequent H-He and He-C interactions at lower initial masses than in the lower CBM grid. Several models also undergo multiple interaction events during evolution. While future work will be needed to fully assess the impact of the new CBM and the interactions it leads to, one expects interesting effects like unusual nucleosynthesis including more common or enhanced i- and gamma-process nucleosynthesis. Furthermore, SN precursors and a significant change to the pre-SN structure are also expected, with many models not having the commonly expected onion-ring like structure and having a different explosion probability.</description>

      <title>The AURORA Survey: Constraining Chemical Enrichment Pathways at Cosmic Noon with Argon Abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present argon abundances from a sample of 46 star-forming galaxies at $z=2-3.5$ from the Assembly of Ultradeep Rest-Optical Observations Revealing Astrophysics (AURORA) program. Although argon is an $\alpha-$element produced by Core Collapse Supernovae (CCSNe), the latest supernova yield models suggest additional argon production and enrichment by Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), unlike other $\alpha-$elements such as oxygen. To study the relationship between argon and oxygen abundances, we construct two median-stacked composite spectra for separate $z=2.0-2.6$ and $z=2.8-3.5$ redshift bins, presenting more representative measurements than previous samples that require individual detection of faint lines. Abundance ratios were determined using an empirical calibration based on the strength of the [ArIII]$\lambda7137$ emission line relative to the [OIII]$\lambda5008$ emission line. With this calibration, we estimate argon abundances (Ar/O) of $0.42^{+0.12}_{-0.10}\mbox{(Ar/O)}_{\odot}$ for the $\langle z \rangle = 2.26$ bin and $0.42^{+0.12}_{-0.11}\mbox{(Ar/O)}_{\odot}$ for the $\langle z \rangle = 3.15$ bin, suggesting minimal SNe Ia and dominant CCSNe enrichment in this sample. Comparison of our abundance measurements of $z\sim 2-3$ AURORA galaxies with chemical evolution modeling of Milky Way stars shows consistency with the Milky Way Bulge component, suggesting a rapid star-formation timescale. However, even larger samples of actively star-forming galaxies with available argon abundances, as well as comparisons between argon abundance and other critical galaxy properties (e.g., sSFR) and models (e.g., one tuned specifically to this redshift range) are needed to draw stronger conclusions on the role of argon in galactic chemical enrichment at Cosmic Noon.</description>

      <title>Stellar physics at sub-nanoradian angular resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many stars -- if they could be imaged with enough angular resolution -- would exhibit features expected from theory but not possible to extract from spectra. We may group these by increasing complexity as follows. First, smooth variations in brightness across the surface, resembling solar limb darkening but much more prominent and involving more processes in stars with fast spin or external tides. Next, there are periodic features: not only oscillations, but also convective cells and starspots, which appear to transit across a star as its spins, and exoplanets that really do transit across the star. Then, there are transients like flares.
  Current optical interferometers provide synthetic apertures of a few hundred metres and angular resolutions down to about nanoradian ($\simeq 0.2\,$milliarcsecond), enough to resolve some of the above features on the nearest upper main-sequence stars, giants and supergiants. Ongoing projects aims to km-scale synthetic apertures, enough to measure the radius of the nearest white dwarf. In this White Paper we briefly discuss what could be observed with synthetic apertures over $\sim20\,$km -- resolving detail on white dwarfs at the level currently possible on supergiants.</description>

      <title>Dynamical constraints on the S2 (S0-2) star possible companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The center of the Galaxy harbors a supermassive black hole, Sgr\,A*, which is surrounded by a massive star cluster known as the S-cluster. The most extensively studied star in this cluster is the B-type main-sequence S2 star (also known as S0-2). These types of stars are commonly found in binary systems in the Galactic field, but observations do not seem to detect a companion to S2. This absence may be attributed to observational biases or to a dynamically hostile environment caused by phenomena such as tidal disruption or mergers. Using a $N$-body code with first-order post-Newtonian corrections, we investigate whether S2 can host a stellar or planetary companion. We perform $10^{5}$ simulations adopting uniform distributions for the orbital elements of the companion. Our results show that companions may exist for orbital periods shorter than 100~days, eccentricities below 0.8, and across the full range of mutual inclinations. The number of surviving companions increases with shorter orbital periods, lower eccentricities, and nearly coplanar orbits. We also find that the disruption mechanisms include mergers driven by Lidov-Kozai cycles and breakups that occur when the companion surpasses the Hill radius of its orbit. Finally, we find that the presence of a companion would alter S2's astrometric signal by no more than $ 5\,\mu{\rm as}$. Current radial-velocity detection limits constrain viable stellar binary configurations to approximately 4.4\% of the simulated cases. Including astrometric limits reduces to 4.3\%. Imposing an additional constraint that any companion must have a mass $\lesssim 2\,M_{\odot}$ (otherwise it would be visible) narrows the fraction of undetectable stellar binaries to just 3.0\%.</description>

      <title>Asteroid Occultations with VERITAS: Observations and Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Occultations, the covering up of one celestial body by another celestial body, have been used in astronomy for millennia to learn about the sun and moon. Since 2018, VERITAS has implemented a program to detect predicted asteroid occultations, where an asteroid covers up a star. VERITAS has attempted to observe over 100 occultations to date and successfully observed 20 occultations. With these occultations, VERITAS can directly measure the smallest angular diameters of any instrument or technique in the optical for stars between magnitude 9 and 13. Each angular diameter is measured by fitting the diffraction pattern observed by the central VERITAS pixel at the start and end of an occultation. Once a planned FADC upgrade is complete, VERITAS will begin a program to search for serendipitous occultations within its full field of view (3 deg). Serendipitous occultations of sub-km trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) have the potential to constrain models of solar system formation. This work details how VERITAS predicts and observes occultations as well as the overall status of the asteroid occultation program and future steps for observing occultations of both asteroids and TNOs.</description>

      <title>Impacts of hydrogen envelope on supernova fallback and the resulting compact remnant masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fallback in core-collapse supernovae plays a central role in setting compact-remnant masses and may produce late-time emission. In hydrogen rich progenitors, the reverse shock arising at the hydrogen-helium interface has the potential to dramatically enhance fallback, yet its overall impact across a broad explosion-energy range has not been systematically quantified. Using one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations for metal-poor progenitors with $M_{\rm ZAMS}=18$-$28\,M_\odot$ and models with and without hydrogen envelopes, we explore fallback over explosion energies of $10^{48}$-$10^{52}\,{\rm erg}$. We find a robust and universal mass-transition behaviour: when the explosion energy reaches only $2$-$3$ times the binding energy of the hydrogen envelope, the reverse shock returns to the centre and sharply increases the remnant mass by $\gtrsim 2\,M_\odot$. Above this threshold, the reverse shock escapes and hydrogen-rich and stripped-envelope progenitors yield nearly identical remnant masses. By normalizing the results with the envelope binding energy, we show that all progenitor models converge to a common fallback relation. We further provide a simple analytic prescription that connects explosion energy, hydrogen-envelope binding energy, and final compact-remnant mass. This relation provides an important link between progenitor properties and compact-remnant masses, and is useful for population-synthesis and galactic chemical-evolution studies.</description>

      <title>Dynamical evolution of massless particles in star clusters with NBODY6++GPU-MASSLESS: II. The long-term evolution of free-floating comets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Comets, asteroids, planetesimals, free-floating planets and brown dwarfs, are continuously injected into the intra-cluster environment after expulsion from their host planetary systems or binary system. The dynamics of large populations of such free-floating comets (ffcs) in a star cluster environment is not yet fully understood. Aims. We investigate the dynamical evolution of comet populations in star clusters, and characterize the kinematics and ejection rates of ffc in a star cluster. Moreover, we determine whether a different initial energy distribution affects the mass segregation of the less massive population. Methods. We carry out simulations using the N-body code NBODY6++GPU-MASSLESS (Flammini Dotti et al. 2025), which allows fast integration of star clusters that contain large numbers of massless particles, to characterize the dynamics of populations of low-mass particles with sub-virial and super-virial distributions. Results. Comets do not participate in the mass segregation process, similarly to planet-size objects, regardless of their initial energy distribution. The latter is slightly changing the whole dynamical evolution at the start of the simulation. We only observe an initial relaxation or collapse of the objects for super-virial and sub-virial ratios, respectively. The external regions of the ffcs population tend to be pulled back in the cluster core at the end of the simulation, suggesting the gravitational pull of the stars is pulling them back in the core. This phenomenon occurs at later times if the system in virial equilibrium. Compared to less massive bodies, brown dwarfs experiences more mass segregation the inner regions tend to be more mixed with the stellar population</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection powers explosive releases of magnetic energy, heating and particle acceleration throughout the plasma universe. Knowledge of this universal process is vital to understanding the Heliosphere, as it plays a key role in solar flares, coronal mass ejections, coronal heating, solar wind acceleration, geomagnetic storms, and interactions between the solar wind and planetary magnetospheres. As such, reconnection underpins multiple science objectives of multiple future space missions. The UK plays a leading role in this international field, through a combination of in situ measurements from Earth's magnetosphere and the solar wind, observations of the solar corona and chromosphere, and world-class numerical simulations and theory. This white paper identifies: Nine priority science objectives for reconnection research in the next decade; Recommendations to guide investment in theory, simulations and infrastructure; Mission priorities and required measurements to ensure the UK maintains and improves its world-class credentials in reconnection science.</description>

      <title>The Effect of a Non-universal Extinction Curve on the Wesenheit Function and Cepheid Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wesenheit function is widely used to reduce the effects of interstellar reddening in distance measurements. Its construction, however, relies on the assumption of a universal extinction curve and on fixed values of the total-to-selective extinction ratio, Rv. Recent studies have shown that Rv varies significantly across the Milky Way and between different galaxies, raising concerns about systematic biases in Wesenheit magnitudes and period-Wesenheit relations. In this work, we discuss the impact of non-universal extinction on Wesenheit indices by combining the Rv-dependent extinction curve with a grid of stellar atmosphere models. We compute the integrated extinction in optical and near-infrared passbands, derive Rv-dependent R coefficients for multiple Wesenheit indices, and examine how changes in Rv propagate into Wesenheit magnitudes and Cepheid distances in our Galaxy. We find that the R coefficients in the Wesenheit functions vary strongly with Rv. For classical Cepheids in the Milky Way disk, variations of Rv within the typical observed range (2.6-3.6) can lead to substantial differences in the Wesenheit function, reaching +-0.7 mag from the mean for the Gaia-based Wesenheit index W_G and resulting in distance errors of almost 40%. Near-infrared Wesenheit indices are much less sensitive to Rv changes. Our results clearly show that accounting for variable Rv is essential when applying period-Wesenheit relations, particularly in the optical regime, or that near or mid infrared based distances should be used. While we present this effect for classical Cepheids, it applies to all pulsating stars for which period-Wesenheit relations are used to infer distances.</description>

      <title>A sudden fine-scale bright kernel captured by Hi-C Flare in 11 MK emission during an M1.6-class solar flare's post-maximum phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On April 17, 2024, the third successful Hi-C sounding rocket flight, Hi-C Flare, recorded coronal images in Fe XXI 129 A emission from 11 MK plasma during the post-maximum phase of an M1.6-class solar flare, achieving unprecedented spatial (~300 km) and temporal (1.3 s) resolutions. The flare started at 21:55 UT, peaked at 22:08 UT, and lasted ~40 minutes. Hi-C observed for over five minutes (22:15:45 to 22:21:25), starting roughly eight minutes after flare maximum. A sudden compact bright burst - 875 +/- 25 km wide, lasting 90 +/- 1.3 s, exhibiting a proper motion of ~50 km/s, and splitting into two toward the end - occurs near the foot of some post-flare loops. Its size and brightness are reminiscent of flare-ribbon kernels during a flare's rapid rise phase, kernels marking sites of sudden heating and hot plasma upflow, making its occurrence during the late phase surprising. Such isolated brightenings in a flare's post-maximum phase are rare, and have not been previously reported. The kernel was detected in all SDO/AIA channels. Its 1600 A light curve peaked ~50 s earlier than its 131 A light curve, similar to that of flare-ribbon kernels, albeit with a smaller delay of ~25 s, during the impulsive phase of the flare. In SDO/HMI magnetograms, the kernel sits in unipolar positive magnetic flux near an embedded clump of negative flux. Although localized magnetic reconnection within the kernel (a microflare) cannot be ruled out for its cause, the observations favor the localized brightening being an isolated, exceptionally late flare-ribbon kernel, resulting from an exceptionally late burst of the flare's coronal reconnection.</description>

      <title>The Discovery of Little Red Dots in the Local Universe: Signatures of Cool Gas Envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: JWST observations have revealed a population of high-redshift "little red dots" (LRDs) that challenge conventional AGN models. We report the discovery of three local LRDs at $z = 0.1$-$0.2$, initially selected from the SDSS database, with follow-up optical/near-IR spectroscopy and photometry. They exhibit properties fully consistent with those of high-redshift LRDs, including broad hydrogen and helium emission lines, compact morphologies, V-shaped UV-optical SED, declining near-IR continua, and no significant variability. Two sources were targeted but not detected in X-rays with statistical significance. All three sources show blue-shifted He I absorption, while two exhibit H$\alpha$ and Na D absorption lines. We detect full Balmer and Paschen line series in all three objects, along with abundant narrow [Fe II] emission in two. The emission line analyses suggest narrow lines originate from AGN-powered, metal-poor regions with minimal dust; broad lines come from inner regions with exceptionally high density or atypical dust properties; and [Fe II] emission arises from dense gas between broad and narrow-line regions. One of our objects, J1025+1402 (nicknamed $The~Egg$), shows extremely high equivalent width Na D, K I, and Ca II triplet absorption lines, along with other potential low-ionization absorption features, suggesting the presence of a cool ($\sim$5000 K), metal-enriched gas envelope. The optical/near-IR continua of these LRDs are also consistent with theoretical models featuring an atmosphere around black holes. The WISE-detected IR emission is consistent with weak dust emission of $T \sim 10^2-10^3$ K. We propose a conceptual model consisting of a largely thermalized cool-gas envelope surrounding the central black hole and an extended emission line region with high-density outflowing gas to explain the observed properties of these local LRDs.</description>

      <title>Spatial Profiles of 3I/ATLAS CN and Ni Outgassing from Keck/KCWI Integral Field Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cometary activity from interstellar objects provides a unique window into the environs of other stellar systems. We report blue-sensitive integral field unit spectroscopy of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS from the Keck-II-mounted Keck Cosmic Web Imager on August 24, 2025 UT. We confirm previously reported CN and Ni outgassing, and present, for the first time, the radial profiles of Ni and CN emission in 3I/ATLAS. We find a characteristic $e$-folding radius of $593.7\pm14.8$ km for Ni and $841.0\pm15.4$ km for CN; this suggests that the Ni emission is more centrally concentrated in the nucleus of the comet and favors hypotheses involving easily dissociated species such as metal carbonyls or metal-polycyclic-aromatic-hydrocarbon molecules. Additional integral field spectroscopy after perihelion will offer a continued opportunity to determine the evolution of the radial distributions of species in interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Roman Coronagraph project HLC/575 nm observations of a newly-discovered brown dwarf (HIP 71618 B) from the Subaru/OASIS survey of young accelerating stars, which is supported by NASA headquarters with the directive to identify targets for the Roman Coronagraph that could fulfill TTR5 requirements and be observed during the technology demonstration phase. The target and multiple bright PSF references are within/close to the Roman Continuous Viewing Zone. A high SNR detection of this companion would singlehandedly fulfill TTR5 and would be the first optical detection of a companion at $&lt;$10$^{-6}$ contrast.
  Roman CPP reference star vetting prioritizing stars that can be paired with HIP 71618 would aid the execution of a successful technology demonstration. Additional similar targets may be discovered from OASIS over the next few years that could increase CGI scheduling flexibility and enhance its scientific and technical return. A close collaborative partnership with the CPP team could ensure that they are schedulable.</description>
