      <title>Data-driven stochastic 3D modeling of the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase in battery cathodes</title>

Abstract: A stochastic 3D modeling approach for the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase in hierarchically structured cathodes of lithium-ion batteries is presented. The binder-conductive additive phase of these electrodes consists of carbon black, polyvinylidene difluoride binder and graphite particles. For its stochastic 3D modeling, a three-step procedure based on methods from stochastic geometry is used. First, the graphite particles are described by a Boolean model with ellipsoidal grains. Second, the mixture of carbon black and binder is modeled by an excursion set of a Gaussian random field in the complement of the graphite particles. Third, large pore regions within the mixture of carbon black and binder are described by a Boolean model with spherical grains. The model parameters are calibrated to 3D image data of cathodes in lithium-ion batteries acquired by focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy. Subsequently, model validation is performed by comparing model realizations with measured image data in terms of various morphological descriptors that are not used for model fitting. Finally, we use the stochastic 3D model for predictive simulations, where we generate virtual, yet realistic, image data of nanoporous binder-conductive additives with varying amounts of graphite particles. Based on these virtual nanostructures, we can investigate structure-property relationships. In particular, we quantitatively study the influence of graphite particles on effective transport properties in the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase, which have a crucial impact on electrochemical processes in the cathode and thus on the performance of battery cells.</description>

      <title>A rate-distortion framework for MCMC algorithms: geometry and factorization of multivariate Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework rooted in a rate distortion problem for Markov chains, and show how a suite of commonly used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are specific instances within it, where the target stationary distribution is controlled by the distortion function. Our approach offers a unified variational view on the optimality of algorithms such as Metropolis-Hastings, Glauber dynamics, the swapping algorithm and Feynman-Kac path models. Along the way, we analyze factorizability and geometry of multivariate Markov chains. Specifically, we demonstrate that induced chains on factors of a product space can be regarded as information projections with respect to a particular divergence. This perspective yields Han--Shearer type inequalities for Markov chains as well as applications in the context of large deviations and mixing time comparison. Finally, to demonstrate the significance of our framework, we propose a new projection sampler based on the swapping algorithm that provably accelerates the mixing time by multiplicative factors related to the number of temperatures and the dimension of the underlying state space.</description>
