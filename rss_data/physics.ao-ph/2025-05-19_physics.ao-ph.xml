      <title>Quantifying urban and landfill methane emissions in the United States using TROPOMI satellite data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban areas are major sources of methane due to population needs for landfills, natural gas distribution, wastewater treatment, and residential combustion. Here we apply an inversion of TROPOMI satellite observations of atmospheric methane to quantify and attribute annual methane emissions at 12x12 km2 resolution for 12 major US urban areas in 2022. The US Environmental Protection Agency Greenhouse Gas Inventory (EPA GHGI) is used as prior estimate. Our results indicate that the GHGI underestimates methane emissions by 80% on average for the 12 urban areas, with 22%-290% underestimations in most urban areas, except Los Angeles and Cincinnati where emissions are overestimated by 32%-37%. This is corroborated by independent surface-based observations in the Northeast Corridor and Los Angeles. Landfills are the principal cause of urban emission underestimates, with downstream gas activities contributing to a lesser extent than previously found. Examination of individual landfills other than in Los Angeles shows that emissions reported by facilities with gas collection and control systems to the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) and used in the GHGI are too low by a factor of 4 when using the prevailing recovery-first reporting method. This is because GHGRP-estimated gas collection efficiencies (average 70%, range 40-87%) are much higher than inferred from our work (average 38%, range 5-90%). Los Angeles landfills have much higher collection efficiencies (average 78% in GHGRP; 85% in our work) than elsewhere in the US, suggesting that operational practices there could help inform methane mitigation in other urban areas.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Black-Box Optimization Methods for Weather Intervention Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As climate change increases the threat of weather-related disasters, research on weather control is gaining importance. The objective of weather control is to mitigate disaster risks by administering interventions with optimal timing, location, and intensity. However, the optimization process is highly challenging due to the vast scale and complexity of weather phenomena, which introduces two major challenges. First, obtaining accurate gradient information for optimization is difficult. In addition, numerical weather prediction (NWP) models demand enormous computational resources, necessitating parameter optimization with minimal function evaluations. To address these challenges, this study proposes a method for designing weather interventions based on black-box optimization, which enables efficient exploration without requiring gradient information. The proposed method is evaluated in two distinct control scenarios: one-shot initial value intervention and sequential intervention based on model predictive control. Furthermore, a comparative analysis is conducted among four representative black-box optimization methods in terms of total rainfall reduction. Experimental results show that Bayesian optimization achieves higher control effectiveness than the others, particularly in high-dimensional search spaces. These findings suggest that Bayesian optimization is a highly effective approach for weather intervention computation.</description>

      <title>Runaway processes in the upper and lower atmosphere: a change of paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic Runaway Electron Avalanches (RREA) are central to understanding a spectrum of high-energy atmospheric phenomena, including Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs), Thunderstorm Ground Enhancements (TGEs), and gamma-ray glows. Despite their common physical origin, these events are often treated separately due to differences in detection methods, duration, and altitude. In this work, we present a unified conceptual and observational framework that reinterprets these radiation bursts as manifestations of the same runaway processes occurring in distinct atmospheric depths. Integrating recent results from satellite (ASIM), aircraft (ALOFT), balloon (HELEN), and ground-based (SEVAN) experiments, we demonstrate consistent spectral and temporal behavior across scales. We propose a rational revision of current terminology and challenge longstanding models that attribute TGFs to lightning leader dynamics. This study resolves key contradictions in the field, establishes new classification criteria based on physics rather than detector location, and reshapes our understanding of particle acceleration in thunderstorms.</description>

      <title>Wind-induced Natural Gamma Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the extreme winter storms of 2024-2025 at Aragats, natural gamma radiation (NGR) increased by more than 1000%, with fluence reaching 2*10^7 gammas/cm^2 over 10 hours and a corresponding dose of 3.26 mSv, 120 times higher than normal background radiation for the same period. This unprecedented radiation surge was detected during dry, electrified snowstorms, exceeding levels explainable by known atmospheric mechanisms, necessitating a significant reassessment of gamma-ray sources in winter storm conditions. These results suggest similar radiation surges may occur in high-altitude and polar regions (Arctic and Antarctic), where strong winds and prolonged snowstorms are common. Understanding radiation surge conditions is essential for refining atmospheric models, improving radiation monitoring, and assessing environmental and climatic impacts in extreme weather conditions.</description>
