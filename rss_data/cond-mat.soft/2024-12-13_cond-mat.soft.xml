      <title>On the effect of isotropic and anisotropic dissipative response functions with associated and non-associated flow on the inelastic behaviour of polymeric composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the effect of using isotropic and anisotropic plastic response functions in the analysis of the elastic-plastic response of unidirectional fibre composites on the meso-scale. Three model problems that use a Drucker-Prager-type pressure-dependent yield function are considered to simulate the non-linearities exhibited by a composite material. A further core ingredient is the analysis of a canonical and non-conventional constitutive structure, with respect to associated and non-associated flow response, where the use of latter is motivated by the physical inconsistencies induced by the former under shear dominated loads. These models are evaluated quantitatively by comparison to experimental data.</description>

      <title>Open-source Polymer Generative Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymers play a crucial role in the development of engineering materials, with applications ranging from mechanical to biomedical fields. However, the limited polymerization processes constrain the variety of organic building blocks that can be experimentally tested. We propose an open-source computational generative pipeline that integrates neural-network-based discriminators, generators, and query-based filtration mechanisms to overcome this limitation and generate hypothetical polymers. The pipeline targets properties, such as ionization potential (IP), by aligning various representational formats to generate hypothetical polymer candidates. The discriminators demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art models due to optimized architecture, while the generators produce novel polymers tailored to the desired property range. We conducted extensive evaluations to assess the generative performance of the pipeline components, focusing on the polymers' ionization potential (IP). The developed pipeline is integrated into the DeepChem framework, enhancing its accessibility and compatibility for various polymer generation studies.</description>

      <title>Markov-type state models to describe non-Markovian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When clustering molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories into a few metastable conformational states, the Markov state models (MSMs) assumption of timescale separation between fast intrastate fluctuations and rarely occurring interstate transitions is often not valid. Hence, the naive estimation of the macrostate transition matrix via simply counting transitions between the states leads to significantly too short implied timescales and thus to too fast population decays. In this work, we discuss advanced approaches to estimate the transition matrix. Assuming that Markovianity is at least given at the microstate level, we consider the Laplace-transform based method by Hummer and Szabo, as well as a direct microstate-to-macrostate projection, which by design yields correct macrostate population dynamics. Alternatively, we study the recently proposed quasi-MSM ansatz of Huang and coworkers to solve a generalized master equations, as well as a hybrid method that employs MD at short times and MSM at long times. Adopting a one-dimensional toy model and an all-atom folding trajectory of HP35, we discuss the virtues and shortcomings of the various approaches.</description>

      <title>Weak non-linearities of amorphous polymer under creep in the vicinity of the glass transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The creep behavior of an amorphous poly(etherimide) (PEI) polymer is investigated in the vicinity of its glass transition in a weakly non linear regime where the acceleration of the creep response is driven by local configurational rearrangements. From the time shifts of the creep compliance curves under stresses from 1 to 15~\si{\mega\pascal} and in the temperature range between $T_g -10K$ and $T_g$, where $T_g$ is the glass transition, we determine a macroscopic acceleration factor. The macroscopic acceleration is shown to vary as $e^{-(\Sigma/Y)^n} $ with $n=2 \pm 0.2$, where $\Sigma$ is the macroscopic stress and $Y$ is a decreasing function of compliance. Because at the beginning of creep, the stress is homogeneous, the macroscopic acceleration is thus similar to the local one, in agreement with the recent theory of Long \textit{et al.} (\textit{Phys. Rev. Mat.} (2018) \textbf{2}, 105601 ) which predicts $n=2$. For larger compliances, the decrease of the of $Y$ is interpreted as a signature of the development of stress disorder during creep.</description>

      <title>Electrokinetic nanofluidic sensing of DNA nanostar condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate electronic sensing of DNA nanostar (NS) condensate. Specifically, we use electrokinetic nanofluidics to observe and interpret how temperature-induced NS condensation affects nanochannel current. The increase in current upon filling a nanochannel with NS condensate indicates that its electrophoretic mobility is about half that of a single NS and its effective ionic strength is $\sim35$\% greater than that of 150mM NaCl in phosphate buffer. $\zeta$-potential measurements before and after exposure to NS show that condensate binds the silica walls of a nanochannel more strongly than individual NS do under identical conditions. This binding increases electroosmotic flow, possibly enough to completely balance, or even exceed, the electrophoretic velocity of NS condensate. Although the current through a flat nanochannel is erratic in the presence of NS condensate, tilting the nanochannel to accumulate NS condensate at one entrance (and away from the other) results in a robust electronic signature of the NS phase transition at temperatures $T_c$ = $f$([NaCl]) that agree with those obtained by other methods. Electrokinetic nanofluidic detection and measurement of NS condensate thus provides a foundation for novel biosensing technologies based on liquid-liquid phase separation.</description>

      <title>Defect Dynamics in Cholesterics: Beyond the Peach-Koehler Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Peach-Koehler force between disclination lines was originally formulated in the study of crystalline solids, and has since been adopted to provide a notion of interactions between disclination lines in nematic liquid crystals. Here, we argue that the standard formulation of this interaction force seemingly fails for materials where there is a symmetry-broken ground state, and suggest that this is due to the interaction between disclination lines and merons: non-singular yet non-trivial topological solitons. We examine this in the context of chiral nematic (cholesteric) liquid crystals, which provide a natural setting for studying these interactions due to their energetic preference for meron tubes in the form of double-twist cylinders. Through a combination of theory and simulation we demonstrate that, for sufficiently strong chirality, defects of $+1/2$ winding will change their winding through the emission of a meron line, and that interactions between the merons and defects dominate over defect-defect interactions. Instead of Peach-Koehler framework, we employ a method based on contact topology - the Gray stability theorem - to directly calculate the velocity field of the material. We apply our framework to point defects as well as disclination lines. Our results have implications not just for chiral materials, but also for other phases with modulated ground states, such as the twist-bend and splay-bend nematics.</description>

      <title>Particle transport in a correlated ratchet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the many measures of the non-equilibrium nature of a system is the existence of a non-zero steady state current which is especially relevant for many biological systems. To this end, we study the non-equilibrium dynamics of a particle moving in a tilted colored noise ratchet in two different situations. In the first, the colored noise variable is reset to a specific value every time the particle transitions from one well to another in the ratchet. Contrary to intuition, we find that the current magnitude decreases as the correlation time of the noise increases, and increases monotonically with noise strength. The average displacement of the particle is against the tilt, which implies that the particle performs work. We then consider a variation of the same problem in which the colored noise process is allowed to evolve freely without any resetting at the transitions. Again, the average displacement is against the potential. However, the current magnitude increases with the correlation time, and there is an optimal noise strength that maximizes the current magnitude. Finally, we provide quantitative arguments to explain these findings and their relevance to active biological matter such as tissues.</description>

      <title>Impact of Lipid Structural Variations on Bilayer Properties: A Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The supramolecular assembly of lipids into bilayer membranes is essential for cellular structure and function. However, the impact of lipid structural variations such as acyl chain length, degree of unsaturation, and headgroup type on bilayer properties remains incompletely understood. This study employs coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations using the Martini force field to investigate seven distinct lipid species, aiming to compute critical bilayer parameters including area per lipid, bilayer thickness, and lateral diffusion coefficients. Our simulations reveal that lipids with longer acyl chains exhibit increased bilayer thickness, while unsaturation introduces kinks in the acyl chains, generally reducing bilayer thickness and increasing the area per lipid. Lipids with unsaturated chains demonstrate higher lateral diffusion coefficients, enhancing membrane fluidity. Variations in headgroup chemistry significantly influence lipid packing and membrane dynamics. This investigation advances our understanding of membrane biophysics and has significant implications for the design of lipid-based systems in biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Elastic Modulus Versus Cell Packing Density in MDCK Epithelial Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elastic moduli of tissues are connected to their states of health and function. The epithelial monolayer is a simple, minimal, tissue model that is often used to gain understanding of mechanical behavior at the cellular or multi-cellular scale. Here we investigate how the elastic modulus of Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells depends on their packing density. Rather than measuring elasticity at the sub-cellular scale with local probes, we characterize the monolayer at the multi-cellular scale, as one would a thin slab of elastic material. We use a micro-indentation system to apply gentle forces to the apical side of MDCK monolayers, applying a normal force to approximately 100 cells in each experiment. In low-density confluent monolayers, we find that the elastic modulus decreases with increasing cell density. At high densities, the modulus appears to plateau. This finding will help guide our understanding of known collective behaviors in epithelial monolayers and other tissues where variations in cell packing density are correlated with cell motion.</description>

      <title>Periodic splay Fr\'eedericksz transitions in a ferroelectric nematic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric field-induced splay of molecular orientation, called the Fr\'eedericksz transition, is a fundamental electro-optic phenomenon in nonpolar nematic liquid crystals. In a ferroelectric nematic NF with a spontaneous electric polarization P, the splay is suppressed since it produces bound electric charges. Here, we demonstrate that an alternating current (ac) electric field causes three patterns of NF polarization. At low voltages, P oscillates around the field-free orientation with no stationary deformations. As the voltage increases, the polarization acquires stationary distortions, first splay and twist in a stripe pattern and then splay and bend in a square lattice of +1 and -1 defects. In all patterns, P oscillates around the stationary orientations. The stationary bound charge is reduced by a geometrical splay cancellation mechanism that does not require free ions: the charge created by splay in one plane is reduced by splay of an opposite sign in the orthogonal plane.</description>

      <title>Towards kinetic equations of open systems of active soft matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chapter presents some new approaches to describing the collective behavior of complex systems of mathematical biology based on the evolution equations of observables such as open systems. This representation of kinetic evolution has looked to be the most direct and mathematically fully consistent formulation modeling the collective behavior of biological systems since the traditionally used concept of the state in kinetic theory is more subtle and is an implicit characteristic of the populations of living creatures. One of the advantages of the developed approach is the opportunity to construct kinetic equations for open complex systems in scaling approximations, involving initial correlations, in particular, that can characterize the condensed states of active soft matter. An approach is also related to the challenge of a rigorous derivation of the non-Markovian kinetic equations from underlying many-entity dynamics, which makes it possible to describe the memory effects of the collective behavior of living creatures.</description>

      <title>Effect of thermal fluctuations on the average shape of a graphene nanosheet suspended in a shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene nanosheets display large hydrodynamic slip lengths in most solvents, and because of this, adopt a stable orientation in a shear flow instead of rotating when thermal fluctuations are negligible [Kamal et al., Nature Comm., 11.1,2020]. In this paper, we combine molecular dynamics simulations and boundary integral simulations to demonstrate that the time-averaged 'S' shape adopted by a flexible graphene nanosheet subject to moderate thermal fluctuation is comparable to the shape predicted when neglecting thermal fluctuations. The stable 'S' shape adopted by the particle results primarily from the normal hydrodynamic traction, which is sensitive to the orientation of the particle with respect to the flow direction. Our results imply that thermally-induced shape fluctuations have a relatively minor effect on the time-averaged rheology of dilute suspensions of graphene nanosheets for relatively large but finite P\'eclet numbers.</description>

      <title>A resetting particle embedded in a viscoelastic bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the behavior of a colloidal particle immersed in a viscoelastic bath undergoing stochastic resetting at a rate $r$. Microscopic probes suspended in viscoelastic environment do not follow the classical theory of Brownian motion. This is primarily because the memory from successive collisions between the medium particles and the probes does not necessarily decay instantly as opposed to the classical Langevin equation. To treat such a system one needs to incorporate the memory effects to the Langevin equation. The resulting equation formulated by Kubo, known as the Generalized Langevin equation (GLE), has been instrumental to describe the transport of particles in inhomogeneous or viscoelastic environments. The purpose of this work, henceforth, is to study the behavior of such a colloidal particle governed by the GLE under resetting dynamics. To this end, we extend the renewal formalism to compute the general expression for the position variance and the correlation function of the resetting particle driven by the environmental memory. These generic results are then illustrated for the prototypical example of the Jeffreys viscoelastic fluid model. In particular, we identify various timescales and intermittent plateaus in the transient phase before the system relaxes to the steady state; and further discuss the effect of resetting pertaining to these behaviors. Our results are supported by numerical simulations showing an excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Splitting of nonequilibrium phase transitions in driven Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs in various equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems, where phase transitions are typically marked by a single critical point that separates ordered and disordered regimes. We reveal a novel phenomenon in which the interplay between different temperatures and driving forces splits the order-disorder transition into two distinct transition points depending on which ordered state initially dominates. Crucially, these two emerging phases have distinct scaling behaviors and thermodynamic properties. To study this, we propose a minimal variant of the Ising model where spins are coupled to two thermal baths and subjected to two opposite driving forces associated to them. Our findings, robust both for all-to-all interactions (where exact solutions are possible) and nearest-neighbor couplings on a square lattice, uncover unique nonequilibrium behaviors and scaling laws for crucial thermodynamic quantities, such as efficiency, dissipation, power and its fluctuations, that are different between the two ordered phases. We also highlight that one of these emerging phases enables heat-engine operations that are less dissipative and show reduced fluctuations. In this setup, the system can also operate near maximum power and efficiency over a wide parameter range. Our results offer new insights into the relevance of phase transitions under nonequilibrium conditions.</description>

      <title>Synchrotron X-Ray Multi-Projection Imaging for Multiphase Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiphase flows, characterized by the presence of particles, bubbles, or droplets dispersed within a fluid, are ubiquitous in natural and industrial processes. Studying densely dispersed flows in 4D (3D + time) at very small scales without introducing perturbations is challenging, but crucial to understand their macroscopic behavior. The penetration power of X-rays and the flux provided by advanced X-ray sources, such as synchrotron-radiation facilities, offer an opportunity to address this need. However, current X-ray methods at these facilities require the rotation of the sample to obtain 4D information, thus disturbing the flow. Here, we demonstrate the potential of using X-ray Multi-Projection Imaging (XMPI), a novel technique to temporally resolve any dense particle suspension flows in 4D, while eliminating the need of sample rotation. By acquiring images of a microparticle-seeded flow from multiple viewing directions simultaneously, we can determine their instantaneous three-dimensional positions, both when flowing in a simple liquid and a highly dense and opaque complex fluid (e.g. blood). Along with the recent progress in AI-supported 4D reconstruction from sparse projections, this approach creates new opportunities for high-speed rotation-free 4D microtomography, opening a new spatiotemporal frontier. With XMPI, it is now feasible to track the movement of individual microparticles within dense suspensions, extending even to the chaotic realms of turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Stiffer alginate gels deposit more efficiently in microchannel flows</title>

Abstract: The behavior of cross-linking polymer solutions as they transition from liquid-like to solid-like material in flow determines success or failure in several applications. Dilute polymer solutions flow easily, while concentrated polymers or crosslinked polymer gels can clog pores, nozzles, or channels. We have recently described a third regime of flow dynamics in polymers that occurs when cross-linking happens during flow: persistent intermittency. When a dilute alginate solution meets calcium at a Y-shaped microfluidic junction, a persistent and regular pattern of gel deposition and ablation emerges when driven at a constant volumetric flow rate. Chemical concentrations and flow rate control both the gel deposition and critical shear stress required to ablate the adhered gel. In this work, we provide an analytical framework to quantitatively describe the intermittent behavior as resulting from diffusively driven deposition in a high Peclet number flow. Fitting the experimental data shows that higher component concentrations lead to more efficient deposition and more swollen gels. Increasing the flow rate increases the deposition rate, but the resulting gels are much less swollen. Ablation occurs when applied shear stresses overcome either the adhesive energy of the gel or its yield stress. The shear stress required at ablation decreases with increased component concentrations. By correlating the results of the analytical analysis with bulk rheology measurements, we find that deposition efficiency increases with the stiffness of the gel formed in flow. Softer gels withstand higher shear stresses before ablation. Both deposition efficiency and gel stiffness increase in flow conditions nearing complete clogging.</description>

      <title>Rigid clusters in shear-thickening suspensions: a nonequilibrium critical transition</title>

Abstract: The onset and growth of rigid clusters in a two-dimensional (2D) suspension in shear flow are studied by numerical simulations. The suspension exhibits the lubricated-to-frictional rheology transition, but the key results here are for stresses above the levels that cause extreme shear-thickening. At large solid fraction, $\phi$, but below the stress-dependent jamming fraction, we find a critical $\phi_{c}\left(\sigma,\mu\right)$ where $\sigma$ is a dimensionless shear stress and $\mu$ is the interparticle friction coefficient. For $\phi&gt;\phi_c$, the proportion of particles in rigid clusters grows sharply, as $f_{\rm rig} \sim \left\vert\phi-\phi_{c}\right\vert^{\beta}$ with $\beta=1/8$, as do the fluctuations in the fraction of rigid particles, with a susceptibility measure $\chi_{\rm rig} \sim \left\vert\phi-\phi_{c}\right\vert^{-\gamma}$ with $\gamma = 7/4$. The system is thus found to exhibit criticality. The results are shown to depend on an effective field $h\left(\mu\right)$, which provides data collapse near $\phi_c$ for both $f_{\rm rig}$ and $\chi_{\rm rig}$. This behavior occurs over a range of stresses, with $\phi_c\left(\sigma,\mu\right)$ increasing as the stress decreases.</description>

Abstract: Molecular rotors form twisted conformations upon photoexcitation, with their fluorescent relaxation time serving as a measure of viscosity. They have been used to assess membrane viscosities but yield higher values compared to other methods. Here, we show that the rotor's relaxation time is influenced by a combination of membrane viscosity and interleaflet friction. We present a theory for the relaxation time and obtain a correction factor that accounts for the discrepancy. If the membrane's viscosity is known, molecular rotors may enable the extraction of the elusive interleaflet friction.</description>

      <title>Data-driven theory reveals protrusion and polarity interactions governing collision behavior of distinct motile cells</title>

Abstract: The migration behavior of colliding cells is critically determined by transient contact-interactions. During these interactions, the motility machinery, including the front-rear polarization of the cell, dynamically responds to surface protein-mediated transmission of forces and biochemical signals between cells. While biomolecular details of such contact-interactions are increasingly well understood, it remains unclear what biophysical interaction mechanisms govern the cell-level dynamics of colliding cells and how these mechanisms vary across cell types. Here, we develop a phenomenological theory based on 14 candidate contact-interaction mechanisms coupling cell position, protrusion, and polarity. Using high-throughput micropattern experiments, we detect which of these phenomenological contact-interactions captures the interaction behaviors of cells. We find that various cell types - ranging from mesenchymal to epithelial cells - are accurately captured by a single model with only two interaction mechanisms: polarity-protrusion coupling and polarity-polarity coupling. The qualitatively different interaction behaviors of distinct cells, as well as cells subject to molecular perturbations of surface protein-mediated signaling, can all be quantitatively captured by varying the strength and sign of the polarity-polarity coupling mechanism. Altogether, our data-driven phenomenological theory of cell-cell interactions reveals polarity-polarity coupling as a versatile and general contact-interaction mechanism, which may underlie diverse collective migration behavior of motile cells.</description>
