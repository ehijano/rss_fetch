      <title>Higher-Order Kuramoto Oscillator Network for Dense Associative Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks of phase oscillators can serve as dense associative memories if they incorporate higher-order coupling beyond the classical Kuramoto model's pairwise interactions. Here we introduce a generalized Kuramoto model with combined second-harmonic (pairwise) and fourth-harmonic (quartic) coupling, inspired by dense Hopfield memory theory. Using mean-field theory and its dynamical approximation, we obtain a phase diagram for dense associative memory model that exhibits a tricritical point at which the continuous onset of memory retrieval is supplanted by a discontinuous, hysteretic transition. In the quartic-dominated regime, the system supports bistable phase-locked states corresponding to stored memory patterns, with a sizable energy barrier between memory and incoherent states. We analytically determine this bistable region and show that the escape time from a memory state (due to noise) grows exponentially with network size, indicating robust storage. Extending the theory to finite memory load, we show that higher-order couplings achieve superlinear scaling of memory capacity with system size, far exceeding the limit of pairwise-only oscillators. Large-scale simulations of the oscillator network confirm our theoretical predictions, demonstrating rapid pattern retrieval and robust storage of many phase patterns. These results bridge the Kuramoto synchronization with modern Hopfield memories, pointing toward experimental realization of high-capacity, analog associative memory in oscillator systems.</description>

      <title>Non-randomness of Japan megaquakes implied by stress recovery and accumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitoring stress recovery and accumulation associated with megaquakes helps to assess their recurrence. Previous studies proposed a high likelihood of imminent recurrence for the 2011 Tohoku and the 17th-century Hokkaido megaquakes belonging to the magnitude-9 class, although their current stress state remains uncertain. Here we compare the occurrence of small earthquakes relative to larger ones, using b-values, showing high b-values in the source area of the Tohoku earthquake, indicating low stresses. In contrast, low b-values occurred in the source area of the 17th-century earthquake, indicating high stresses as seen before the Tohoku event. Around the low-b-value zone, phenomena that provide insight into subsequent large earthquakes are observed, and which were reported for worldwide earthquakes: seismic quiescence, a seismic gap, strong plate coupling, and slow earthquake activity avoiding megaquakes' rupture zones. Results imply that the Hokkaido and Tohoku megaquakes occur nonrandomly in time, rather their recurrence intervals are more characteristic.</description>
