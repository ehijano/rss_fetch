      <title>On the optimisation of the geometric pattern for structured illumination based X-ray phase contrast and dark field imaging: A simulation study and its experimental validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-contrast and dark-field imaging are relatively new X-ray imaging modalities that provide additional information to conventional attenuation-based imaging. However, this new information comes at the price of a more complex acquisition scheme and optical components. Among the different techniques available, such as Grating Interferometry or Edge Illumination, modulation-based and more generally single-mask/grid imaging techniques simplify these new procedures to obtain phase and dark-field images by shifting the experimental complexity to the numerical post-processing side. This family of techniques involves inserting a membrane into the X-ray beam that locally modulating the intensity to create a pattern on the detector which serves as a reference.
  However, the topological nature of the mask used seems to determine the quality of the reconstructed phase and dark-field images. We present in this article an in-depth study of the impact of the membrane parameters used in a single mask imaging approach. A spiral topology seems to be an optimum both in terms of resolution and contrast-to-noise ratio compared to random and regular patterns.</description>

      <title>MoS2 Based 2D Material Photodetector Array with high Pixel Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arrays of photodetector-based pixel sensors are ubiquitous in modern devices, such as smart phone cameras, automobiles, drones, laptops etc. Two dimensional (2D) material-based photodetector arrays are a relevant candidate, especially for applications demanding planar formfactors. However, shortcomings in pixel density and prototyping without cross contamination limit technology adoption and impact. Also, while 2D material detectors offer high absorption, graphene's closed bandgap results in undesirably high dark currents. Here, we introduce the experimental demonstration of dense planar photodetector arrays. We demonstrate a micrometer narrow pitched 2D detector pixels and show this approach's repeatability by verifying performance of a 16-pixel array. Such dense and repeatable detector realization is enabled by a novel, selective, contamination free 2D material transfer system, that we report here in automated operation. The so realized photodetectors responsivity peaks at 0.8 A/W. Furthermore, we achieve uniform detector performance via bias voltage tuning calibration to maximize deployment. Finally, we demonstrate 2D arrayed photodetectors not only on a silicon chip platform but also demonstrate and very array performance on flexible polymer substrates. Densely arrayed, flat, bendable, and uniform performing photodetector pixels enable emerging technologies in the space where lightweight and reliable performance is required, such as for smart phones and emerging AR/VR markets, but smart gadgets, wearables, and for SWAP constrained aviation and space platforms.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional neural network driving self-interference digital holography enables high-fidelity, non-scanning volumetric fluorescence microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a deep learning driven computational approach to overcome the limitations of self-interference digital holography that imposed by inferior axial imaging performances. We demonstrate a 3D deep neural network model can simultaneously suppresses the defocus noise and improves the spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of conventional numerical back-propagation-obtained holographic reconstruction. Compared with existing 2D deep neural networks used for hologram reconstruction, our 3D model exhibits superior performance in enhancing the resolutions along all the three spatial dimensions. As the result, 3D non-scanning volumetric fluorescence microscopy can be achieved, using 2D self-interference hologram as input, without any mechanical and opto-electronic scanning and complicated system calibration. Our method offers a high spatiotemporal resolution 3D imaging approach which can potentially benefit, for example, the visualization of dynamics of cellular structure and measurement of 3D behavior of high-speed flow field.</description>

      <title>Scanning-free three-dimensional fluorescent dipoles imaging by polarization self-interference digital holography (pSIDH)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization microscopy provides insights into the structure and orientational organization of biomolecules and their architectures in cells. The above key functional signatures, which are natively 3D, can be only detected in 2D for a single measurement in conventional polarization microscopy. It is so far a challenging task to capture simultaneously the 3D structure and molecular orientation in a single frame of far-field intensity distribution, within the timescale of rapid-happened spatial organization events of bio-complexes. We report an optical imaging method called pSIDH, to encode multidimensional sample information includes 3D structures and dipole orientations, in their far-field fluorescence-self-interference pattern. The computational reconstruction from the holographic extracted complex-valued light field provides optical-aberration-corrected 3D polarization images of the sample. In pSIDH microscope incorporating planar liquid crystal lens and high numerical aperture objective, we demonstrate scanning-free 3D volumetric polarization imaging of fluorescently-labelled sample, with simultaneously computational-improved system measuring accuracy on the 3D spatial and polarization dimensions. The pSIDH imaging on phalloidin-fluorophore labelling U2OS cells provides rapid tools of capturing simultaneous the 3D structural details and spatial-averaged molecular orientation distributions of biological complex architectures such as actin filaments.</description>

      <title>Double-optical phase-transition in a three level Rydberg state in thermal Rubidium vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the observation of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) with intrinsic phase transitions in a three-level ladder system within rubidium atomic vapor. The observed abrupt transitions between low and high Rydberg occupancy states manifest in the probe beam transmission, depending on the principal quantum number, the Rabi frequency of the coupling field, atomic density, and probe beam detuning. Our study elucidates the underlying interaction mechanisms governing the EIT phase transition and enriches the existing experiments of multi-parameter regulation phase transitions. These findings establish a robust platform for investigating nonequilibrium phase transitions in atomic ensembles, bridging the gap between classical mean-field theories and microscopic quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Engineering cm-scale true push-pull electro-optic modulators in a suspended GaAs photonic integrated circuit platform by exploiting the orientation induced asymmetry of the Pockels $r_{41}$ coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electro-optic modulators (EOMs) underpin a wide range of critical applications in both classical and quantum information processing. While traditionally the focus has been on building these devices in materials with large Pockels coefficient (mainly ferroelectric insulators like lithium niobate), there is a need to engineer EOMs in a semiconductor platform with a view towards device stability (in radiation-hard environments), manufacturability (wafer size and foundry compatibility) and integration (with active electronics and quantum confined structures). Here, we demonstrate true push-pull EOMs in a suspended GaAs photonic integrated circuit (PIC) platform by exploiting the orientation induced asymmetry of the Pockels $r_{41}$ coefficient, and folding the two arms of a cm-scale Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) modulator along two orthogonal crystal axes. Our work also shows the potential of incorporating ideas from micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) in integrated photonics by demonstrating high-performance active devices built around cm-scale suspended waveguides with sub-${\mu}$m optical mode confinement.</description>

      <title>Electrically tunable nonrigid moire exciton polariton supersolids at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A supersolid is a macroscopic quantum state which sustains superfluid and crystallizing structure together after breaking the U(1) symmetry and translational symmetry. On the other hand, a moire pattern can form by superimposing two periodic structures along a particular direction. Up to now, supersolids and moire states are disconnected from each other. In this work we show that exciton polariton supersolids can form moire states in a double degenerate parametric scattering process which creates two constituted supersolids with different periods in a liquid crystal microcavity. In addition, we demonstrate the nonrigidity of the moire exciton polariton supersolids by electrically tuning the wavevector and period of one supersolid component with another one being fixed. Our work finds a simple way to link moire states and supersolids, which offers to study nontrivial physics emerging from the combination of moire lattices and supersolids which can be electrically tuned at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Goos-H\"anchen Shift and Photonic Spin Hall Effect in Semi-Dirac Material Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) and the Goos-H\"anchen shift (GH shift) in semi-Dirac
  materials. Through theoretical modeling, we demonstrate that the anisotropic dielectric function in semi-Dirac
  materials play a critical role in determining the magnitude and polarity of these optical displacements. Further more, by utilizing the unidirectional drift of massless Dirac electrons in Semi-Dirac materials, we systematically
  reveal how the drift velocity and direction modulate the behavior of optical displacements. The results indicate
  that semi-Dirac materials provide a versatile platform for controlling spin-dependent photonic phenomena with
  their material anisotropy and carrier transport. This work opens a new avenue for designing advanced photonic
  devices with tunable optical responses, particularly with significant application potential in quantum information
  processing and topological photonics.</description>

      <title>Compact laser system with frequency stability dissemination for optical clocks and quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern experiments in quantum metrology, sensing, and quantum computing require precise control of the state of atoms and molecules, achieved through the use of highly stable lasers and microwave generators with low phase noise. One of the most effective methods for ensuring high frequency stability is stabilization using a high-finesse Fabry-P\'erot reference cavity. However, implementing separate stabilization systems for each laser increases the complexity and size of the setup, limiting its use to laboratory conditions. An alternative approach is the use of a femtosecond optical frequency comb, which transfers the noise characteristics of a single stabilized frequency reference to other wavelengths in the optical and microwave ranges. In this work, we demonstrate a scheme for transferring frequency stability from an ultrastable laser at 871 nm to a laser at 1550 nm. Measurements using the three-cornered hat method show that the stabilized laser exhibits a fractional frequency instability of less than 4e-15 for averaging times between 0.4 and 2 s, and below 1e-14 for intervals ranging from 0.2 to 500 s. The femtosecond optical frequency comb and the cavity-stabilized laser were designed to meet compactness and portability requirements to enable field and onboard applications.</description>

      <title>Generation of Relativistic Structured Spin-Polarized Lepton Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic structured spin-polarized (SSP) particle beams, characterized by polarization structures, are of critical importance in a wide range of applications, such as material properties investigation, imaging, and information storage. However, generation of relativistic SSP beams faces significant challenges. Here, we put forward a novel method for generating relativistic SSP lepton beams via employing a moderate-intensity terahertz (THz) wave. Building upon our foundational work on velocity-matched spin rotation in dielectric-lined waveguides [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 075001 (2025)], we present the first demonstration of spin-polarization mode matching - a novel mechanism that establishes a direct relation between waveguide modes and beam polarization states. This breakthrough enables precise spatial control over spin structures at relativistic energies, generating customizable spin-polarization configurations such as spider-like, azimuthal, and helical structures, etc. Such SSP beams have the potential to generate high-energy structured photon beams and open a new avenue for research on relativistic structured particle beams, especially in nuclear physics, high-energy physics, materials science and atomic physics.</description>

      <title>Super time-resolved tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding 3D fundamental processes is crucial for academic and industrial applications. Nowadays, X-ray time-resolved tomography, or tomoscopy, is a leading technique for in-situ and operando 4D (3D+time) characterization. Despite its ability to achieve 1000 tomograms per second at large-scale X-ray facilities, its applicability is limited by the centrifugal forces exerted on samples and the challenges of developing suitable environments for such high-speed studies. Here, we introduce STRT, an approach that has the potential to enhance the temporal resolution of tomoscopy by at least an order of magnitude while preserving spatial resolution. STRT exploits a 4D DL reconstruction algorithm to produce high-fidelity 3D reconstructions at each time point, retrieved from a significantly reduced angular range of a few degrees compared to the 0-180 degrees of traditional tomoscopy. Thus, STRT enhances the temporal resolution compared to tomoscopy by a factor equal to the ratio between 180 degrees and the angular ranges used by STRT. In this work, we validate the 4D capabilities of STRT through simulations and experiments on droplet collision simulations and additive manufacturing processes. We anticipate that STRT will significantly expand the capabilities of 4D X-ray imaging, enabling previously unattainable studies in both academic and industrial contexts, such as materials formation and mechanical testing.</description>

      <title>A simple, robust and cost-effective method to achieve dispersion matching in swept source OCT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11184v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical path length and dispersion matching in both measurement and reference arms of an OCT system is critical for achieving bandwidth-limited axial resolution. To minimize or eliminate dispersion mismatch, most, if not all, fiber-based OCT realisations employ a reference arm configuration that is as closely identical to the measurement arm as possible. This typically includes a collimator, dispersion compensating material (or sometimes a set of lenses), as well as a mirror (or retro-reflector) mounted on a translation stage. However, this solution makes the total instrument cost higher and the setup bulkier than necessary and it also renders the reference arm mechanically unstable. Here, a simple yet robust, low-cost reference arm setup is presented and its ability to compensate for measurement arm dispersion is demonstrated. We use a single-mode fiber cleaved and polished perpendicular to the fiber axis to construct the reference arm. The length and material of the fibre is determined by considering the optical path length and dispersion of the measurement arm. Experimental images demonstrate the operation of the novel reference arm in our Swept-source Optical Coherence Tomography.</description>

      <title>Time-Resolved Stokes Analysis of Single Photon Emitters in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state quantum emitters play a vital role in advancing quantum technologies, particularly in quantum computation and communication, where single-photon polarization acts as a fundamental information carrier. Precise polarization characterization is essential for understanding the mechanisms underlying polarization dynamics, which is critical for developing quantum emitters with minimized polarization-related errors. In this study, we employ the Rotating Quarter-Wave Plate (RQWP) method to comprehensively characterize the polarization state of quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). By examining both time-averaged and dynamic polarization features, we demonstrate the time-resolved evolution of Stokes parameters from a solid-state single-photon emitter using the RQWP technique. This approach provides more complete polarization information than conventional micro-photoluminescence methods, without requiring modifications to the experimental setup. Our results uncover intricate polarization dynamics in hBN emitters, offering insights that were previously inaccessible. The techniques presented here can be broadly applied to polarization analysis of solid-state quantum emitters across various material platforms.</description>

      <title>Attosecond plasma lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attosecond pulses provide unique opportunities for studies of time-resolved electron dynamics. However, focusing these pulses, typically ranging from the vacuum ultraviolet to the soft-X-ray region, remains challenging. Conventional refractive lenses are not suitable owing to the large dispersion and the strong absorption, while reflective optics, despite avoiding these issues, still lead to high losses. Here we propose a tunable plasma lens capable of focusing attosecond pulses, and experimentally demonstrate focusing of these pulses at extreme-ultraviolet photon energies around 20 eV and 80 eV. A key advantage is its compatibility with nonlinear frequency conversion processes like high-harmonic generation. The different focusing properties of the fundamental light and the generated harmonic frequencies allow for efficient separation of these components. Consequently, the transmission of high-harmonic generation beamlines can be increased to more than 80%, making this approach highly suitable for photon-demanding applications.</description>

Abstract: Phenomena involving multiple scattering, despite having attracted considerable attention in physics for decades, continue to generate unexpected and counterintuitive behaviours prompting further studies. For optical scattering, the memory effect well predicts fourth order statistics, i.e. the intensity correlation, as long as the scattering strength and depth are within certain bounds. The memory effect has found a wide range of applications, where its limitations also become apparent: for example, in imaging through turbid media, decorrelation due to multiscattering in thick samples has been shown to restrict the field of view. However, to our knowledge, no comprehensive mechanism exists to date that can account for decorrelation precisely. In this paper, we quantify how the scatterer's own statistics determine such limitations. We show that the ensemble statistics of the backscattered field may be decomposed into two terms: one expresses surface scattering, where statistical distributions of multiscale structure features may be inferred from our previous works; while the second term originates from the underlying scattering volume and is diffusive. The new framework agrees well with experiments, including the prediction of a new quasipower law for fluctuations induced by the single realization.</description>

      <title>Probing General Relativity-Induced Decoherence Using an on-chip Sagnac Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intersection of quantum mechanics and general relativity remains an open frontier in fundamental physics, with few experimentally accessible phenomena connecting the two. Recent theoretical proposals suggest that relativistic proper time can act as a source of decoherence in quantum systems, providing a testable overlap between the two theories. Here, we propose a chip-integrated Sagnac interferometer where rotation induces a proper time difference between clockwise and counterclockwise single-photon paths. When this time delay exceeds the photon's coherence time, interference visibility is predicted to decrease, offering a direct signature of relativistic time dilation-induced decoherence. We theoretically derive the proper time difference arising from the Sagnac effect and estimate that for a loop radius of 18.9 cm and a rotation speed of 1000 rad/s, decoherence should occur for single-photon wavepackets with a coherence time of 10 femtoseconds. We also present a practical chip design that accommodates the required high-speed mechanical rotation and includes an all-optical readout scheme to eliminate wiring constraints. This approach enables a stable, on-chip implementation using realistic parameters, with rotation speed serving as a continuously tunable knob to control decoherence. Our platform opens a new route for experimentally probing the interplay between quantum coherence and relativistic proper time in a scalable and compact form.</description>

      <title>Near-room-temperature zero-dimensional polariton lasers with sub-10 GHz linewidths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Narrow and brilliant spectral lines are essential assets for high-resolution spectroscopy as well as for precision sensing and optomechanics. In semiconductor structures and, in particular, in the well-established (Al,Ga)As material system, strong emission lines with nanosecond coherence times can be provided by the opto-electronic resonances of microcavity exciton-polariton condensates. The temporal coherence of these resonances, however, normally rapidly deteriorates as the temperature increases beyond a few tens of kelvins due to exciton dissociation. Here, we demonstrate that the temperature stability of polariton condensates in (Al,Ga)As can be significantly improved by confinement within micrometer-sized intracavity traps. We show that trapped condensates can survive up to ~200 K while maintaining a light-matter character with decoherence rates below 10 GHz (i.e., $&lt; 40 {\mu}$eV linewidths). These linewidths are by an order of magnitude smaller than those so far reported for other solid-state systems at these temperatures. Confinement thus provides a pathway towards room-temperature polariton condensation using the well-established (Al,Ga)As material system with prospects for application in scalable on-chip photonic devices for optical processing, sensing, and computing.</description>

      <title>Refractive Index Engineering: Insights from Biological Systems for Advanced Optical Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review explores the innovative design to achieve advanced optical functions in natural materials and intricate optical systems inspired by the unique refractive index profiles found in nature. By understanding the physical principles behind biological structures, we can develop materials with tailored optical properties that mimic these natural systems. One key area discussed is biomimetic materials design, where biological systems such as apple skin and the vision system inspire new materials. Another focus is on intricate optical systems based on refractive index contrast. These principles can be extended to design devices like waveguides, photonic crystals, and metamaterials, which manipulate light in novel ways. Additionally, the review covers optical scattering engineering, which is crucial for biomedical imaging. By adjusting the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index, we can control how much light is scattered and absorbed by tissues. This is particularly important for techniques like optical coherence tomography and multiphoton microscopy, where tailored scattering properties can improve imaging depth and resolution. The review also discusses various techniques for measuring the refractive index of biological tissues which provide comprehensive insights into the optical properties of biological materials, facilitating the development of advanced biomimetic designs. In conclusion, the manipulation of refractive index profiles in biological systems offers exciting opportunities for technological advancements. By drawing inspiration from nature and understanding the underlying physical principles, we can create materials and devices with enhanced performance and new functionalities. Future research should focus on further exploring these principles and translating them into practical applications to address real-world challenges.</description>

      <title>Periodic table for highly charged ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mendeleev's periodic table successfully groups atomic elements according to their chemical and spectroscopic properties. However, it becomes less sufficient in describing the electronic properties of highly charged ions (HCIs) in which many of the outermost electrons are ionized. In this work, we put forward a periodic table particularly suitable for HCIs. It is constructed purely based on the successive electron occupation of relativistic orbitals. While providing a much-simplified description of the level structure of highly charged isoelectronic ions -- essential for laboratory and astrophysical plasma spectroscopies, such a periodic table predicts a large family of highly forbidden transitions suitable for the development of next-generation optical atomic clocks. Furthermore, we also identify universal linear $Z$ scaling laws ($Z$ is the nuclear charge) in the so-called ``Coulomb splittings'' between angular momentum multiplets along isoelectronic sequences, complementing the physics of electron-electron interactions in multielectron atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Monolithic Integration of Sub-50 nm III-V Nano-Heterostructures on Si (001) for Telecom Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The demand for advanced photonics technology is increasing rapidly, fueled by the necessity for high-performance and cost-effective optical information processing systems extending into the quantum domain. Silicon, benefiting from its mature fabrication processes, stands as an ideal platform. However, its inherent indirect bandgap leads to inefficient light emission. The integration of III-V materials has been proven essential to overcome this drawback. These materials are recognized for their efficient light emission and superior bandgap engineering capabilities, making them indispensable in photonics and beyond. Here, we present the monolithic integration of small-volume III-V nanoheterostructures with silicon via selective area epitaxy in the pyramidal openings etched in (100)-oriented silicon substrate. The precise positioning of the nano-heterostructures is achieved using electron beam lithography. Our atomic resolution imaging and chemical analysis confirms the epitaxial nature of InP growth, revealing well-defined heterointerfaces. Each structure incorporates an InAsP quantum dot-like active medium, and the correlation of the growth parameters with the nanoscale structure was analyzed using advanced electron microscopy. The eight-band k.p calculations demonstrate energy level quantization in three spatial dimensions. Optical characterization shows that heterostructure emission can be engineered to cover the entire telecom wavelength range. Consequently, these InAsP/InP nano-heterostructures could serve as a gain medium for silicon-based hybrid nano-lasers and nano-LEDs and quantum light sources in the telecom wavelength range.</description>

Abstract: The design space for photonic lanterns is large and complex, making it challenging to identify optimal parameters to achieve specific performances, such as coupling, bandwidth, and insertion loss. Effectively navigating this space requires modeling tools capable to extract the most characterizing parameters. This work contrasts theoretical modeling with experimental realizations of the four possible types of $3\times1$ photonic lanterns using double-clad fibers, covering a spectrum from conventional to hybrid to mode-specific configurations. This work highlights the experimental characteristics of each photonic lantern.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Quantum Electrodynamics of Epsilon-Near-Zero Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate vacuum-induced nonlinearity and single-photon nonlinear optical responses of Epsilon-Near-Zero (ENZ) media and of sub-wavelength nanocavities. We apply the rigorous quantum Langevin-noise approach in the framework of the Green's tensor quantization method to ENZ materials and resonators with causal dispersion and we derive generally valid closed-form analytical solutions for the nonlinear phase shifts achievable in cavities with spherical geometry. This is achieved by employing a fully nonperturbative methodology for the analysis of open quantum systems with single-photon Kerr-type nonlinearity in dielectric environments with absorption losses and dispersion that satisfy the Kramers-Kronig relations. Our findings are relevant for the design of quantum optical devices and are of importance to emerging quantum technology applications, including on-chip single-photon nondemolition detection, quantum sensing, and controlled quantum gates driven by enhanced photon blockade effects at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Two-media laser threshold magnetometry: A magnetic-field-dependent laser threshold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a promising platform for high-precision magnetometry. In contrast to the use of spontaneous emission in a number of NV-magnetometers, laser threshold magnetometry (LTM) exploits stimulated emission of NV centers by placing an NV-doped diamond inside an optical cavity. The NV laser system is predicted to reach a high magnetic contrast and strong coherent signal strength, leading to an improved magnetic field sensitivity combined with a high linearity. Here, we consider a two-media setup where the cavity additionally includes a vertical external cavity surface emitting laser. This optically active material compensates cavity losses at 750 nm while still allowing for magnetic-field-dependent effects from the NV-diamond. We demonstrate a magnetic-field-dependent laser threshold and investigate the effects of pump laser induced absorption of the diamond. The experimental data is supported by an analytical simulation based on a rate model. Furthermore, we derive a generalized formula to compute the magnetic field sensitivity in the regime of high contrast yielding 33.79(23) pT/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ for the present setup. Simulations with an optimized diamond suggest that values down to 4.9 fT/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ are possible.</description>

      <title>Recurrence method in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel and systematic recurrence method for the energy spectra of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions based on the recurrence relations of their characteristic polynomials. Our formalism exhibits better accuracy and performance on multi-band non-Hermitian systems than numerical diagonalization or the non-Bloch band theory. It also provides a targeted and efficient formulation for the non-Hermitian edge spectra. As demonstrations, we derive general expressions for both the bulk and edge spectra of multi-band non-Hermitian models with nearest-neighbor hopping and under open boundary conditions, such as the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models and the non-Hermitian Hofstadter butterfly - 2D lattice models in the presence of non-reciprocity and perpendicular magnetic fields, which is only made possible by the significantly lower complexity of the recurrence method. In addition, we use the recurrence method to study non-Hermitian edge physics, including the size-parity effect and the stability of the topological edge modes against boundary perturbations. Our recurrence method offers a novel and favorable formalism to the intriguing physics of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Energy-time and time-bin entanglement: past, present and future</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is a key resource in many quantum information tasks. From a fundamental perspective entanglement is at the forefront of major philosophical discussions advancing our understanding of nature. An experimental scheme was proposed in 1989 by Franson that exploited the unpredictability in the generation time of a photon pair in order to produce a then new form of quantum entanglement, known as energy-time entanglement. A later modification gave rise to the very popular time-bin entanglement, an important cornerstone in many real-world quantum communication applications. Both forms of entanglement have radically pushed forward our understanding of quantum mechanics throughout the 1990s and 2000s. A decade later modifications to the original proposals were proposed and demonstrated, which opens the path for the highly sought-after device-independence capability for entanglement certification, with a goal of ultra-secure quantum communication. In this review we cover the beginnings of energy-time and time-bin entanglement, many key experiments that expanded our understanding of what was achievable in quantum information experiments all the way down to modern demonstrations based on new technological advances. We will then point out to the future discussing the important place that energy-time and time-bin entanglement will have in upcoming quantum networks and novel protocols based on nonlocality.</description>
