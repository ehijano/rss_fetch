      <title>Topological Defects in Semiconducting Carbon Nanotubes as Triplet Exciton Traps and Single-Photon Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of topological defects in exciton behavior in (6,5) semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes using density functional theory. Our study identifies the helical Stone-Wales defect as a prominent trap for triplet excitons, characterized by a large zero-field splitting consistent with experimental data and a small singlet-triplet gap. The weak electron-phonon coupling, as evidenced by a Huang-Rhys factor of 0.74, renders it a promising single-photon emitter, with the zero-phonon line predicted at 1.6 $\mu$m, within the telecom range. These insights into defect-engineered electronic structure and exciton dynamics offer promising opportunities for improving the performance of carbon nanotube-based quantum light sources and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Displacement field-controlled fractional Chern insulators and charge density waves in a graphene/hBN moir\'e superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rhombohedral multilayer graphene, with its flat electronic bands and concentrated Berry curvature, is a promising material for the realization of correlated topological phases of matter. When aligned to an adjacent hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layer, the graphene develops narrow minibands with non-trivial topology. By tuning an externally-applied electric displacement field, the conduction electrons can either be pushed towards or away from the moir\'e superlattice. Motivated by the recent observation of the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect (FQAHE) in the moir\'e-distant case, we study the opposite moir\'e-proximal case, where the superlattice potential is considerably stronger. We explore the physics within the moir\'e conduction bands through capacitance measurements that allow us to determine the inverse electronic compressibility and extract energy gaps of incompressible states. We observe integer and fractional Chern insulator states at superlattice filling factors v = 1, 2/3, and 1/3 with Streda slopes of -1, -2/3, and -1/3, respectively. Remarkably, the v = 1/3 state persists down to a magnetic field of 0.2 T. In addition, we also observe numerous trivial and topological charge density waves. We map out a phase diagram that is highly sensitive to both displacement and magnetic fields, which tune the system between various ground states by modifying the band dispersion and the structure of the electronic wavefunctions. This work demonstrates displacement field control of topological phase transitions in the moir\'e-proximal limit of rhombohedral pentalayer graphene, creating a highly-tunable platform for studying the interplay between intrinsic band topology and strong lattice effects.</description>

      <title>Plasmon Mode Engineering with Electrons on Helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ensemble of electrons trapped above the surface of superfluid helium is a paradigm system for investigating, and controlling, the collective charge dynamics of low-dimensional electronic matter. Of particular interest is the ability to engineer the spatial and spectral structure of surface plasmon modes in this system for integration into hybrid quantum systems or circuit quantum electrodynamic device architectures. Here we present experiments on a hybrid electron-on-helium microchannel device designed to host microwave-frequency plasmon modes having a spatial structure dictated by the geometry of the microchannel confinement. The plasma oscillations are generated via local microwave frequency excitation of the electrons in the microchannel. When this excitation is resonant with a particular surface plasmon-mode it produces a non-equilibrium decrease in the electron conductance, which we detect via simultaneous transport measurements. We find that the spatial structure of the surface plasmons is in excellent agreement with our device design parameters and modeling, and their frequency can be tuned over a broad range (several GHz) by precisely varying the areal density of electrons in the channel. By measuring the plasma resonance spectrum lineshape, and its power dependence, we can quantify the level of spatial homogeneity associated with each plasmon mode. The results highlight the versatility of electrons on helium as a model system for investigating, and engineering, the collective mode structure of low-dimensional Coulomb liquid and solid states and demonstrate a viable path for integrating precisely engineered surface plasmons in electrons on helium with future hybrid circuit quantum electrodynamic systems.</description>

      <title>Nonmonotonic Hall effect of Weyl semimetals under magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hall effect of topological quantum materials often reveals essential new physics and possesses potential for application. Magnetic Weyl semimetal is one especially interesting example that hosts an interplay between the spontaneous time-reversal symmetry-breaking topology and the external magnetic field. However, it is less known beyond the anomalous Hall effect thereof, which is unable to account for plenty of magnetotransport measurements. We propose a new Hall effect characteristically nonmonotonic with respect to the external field, intrinsic to the three-dimensional Weyl topology and free from chemical potential fine-tuning. Two related mechanisms from the Landau level bending and chiral Landau level shifting are found, together with their relation to Shubnikov-de Hass effect. This field-dependent Hall response, universal to thin films and bulk samples, provides a concrete physical picture for existing measurements and is promising to guide future experiments.</description>

      <title>Disordered Parity Anomalous Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parity anomalous semimetal is a topological state of matter characterized by its semi-metallic nature and a quantum Hall conductance of one-half $e^{2}/h$ ($e$ is the elementary charge and $h$ is the Planck constant). Here we investigate the topological phase transition driven by disorder in a semi-magnetic structure of topological insulator, and narrow-gap weak topological insulator film. We demonstrate that strong disorder not only leads to a topological transition from the parity anomalous semimetal to a diffusive metal with non-quantized anomalous Hall conductance, but also induces the topological phase in a trivial insulating phase. Our calculations of the local density of states provide clear picture for the formation of a single gapless Dirac fermion, which emerges as the disorder strength increases. The half quantized Hall effect is attributed to the existence of the gapless Dirac cone. Our findings of disorder-induced parity anomalous semimetal and diffusive metal significantly advance our understanding of the disorder-driven topological phase transition in magnetic topological insulators, opening up new avenues for further exploration in the field of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Impact of Valley Degeneracy on Thermoelectric Properties of Zigzag Graphene Nanoribbons with Staggered Sublattice Potentials and Transverse Electric Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the band inversion of flat bands in zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) using a tight-binding model. The band inversion results from symmetry breaking in the transverse direction, achievable through deposition on specific substrates such as separated silicon carbide or hexagonal boron nitride sheets. Upon band inversion, ZGNRs exhibit electronic structures characterized by valley degeneracy and band gap properties, which can be modulated by transverse electric fields. To explore the impact of this level degeneracy on thermoelectric properties, we employ Green's function techniques to calculate thermoelectric quantities in ZGNR segments with staggered sublattice potentials and transverse electric fields. Two carrier transport scenarios are considered: the chemical potential is positioned above and below the highest occupied molecular orbital. We analyze thermionic-assisted transport (TAT) and direct ballistic transport (DBT). Level degeneracy enhances the electric power factors of ZGNRs by increasing electrical conductance, while the Seebeck coefficient remains robust in the TAT scenario. Conversely, in DBT, the enhancement of the power factor primarily stems from improvements in the Seebeck coefficient at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <title>Direct electrical access to the spin manifolds of individual monovalent lanthanide atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lanthanide atoms show long magnetic lifetimes because of their strongly localized 4f electrons, but electrical control of their spins has been difficult because of their closed valence shell configurations. We achieved electron spin resonance of individual lanthanide atoms using a scanning tunneling microscope to probe the atoms bound to a protective insulating film. These atoms were prepared in the monovalent state with an unpaired 6s electron, enabling tunnel current to access their 4f electrons. Europium spectra display a rich array of transitions among the 54 combined electron and nuclear spin states. In contrast, samarium's ground state is a Kramers doublet with an extraordinarily large g-factor of nearly 5. These results demonstrate that all-electronic sensing and control of individual lanthanide spins is possible for quantum devices and spin-based electronics by using their rarely-observed monovalent cation state.</description>

      <title>Spin-wave assisted synchronization in 2D arrays of spin torque oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization of coupled oscillators is a fundamental phenomenon that has been observed in many natural and engineered systems, ranging from biological cells to electronic circuits. In recent years, spin torque nano-oscillators (STNOs) have emerged as a promising platform for a variety of applications in nanoscale systems such as neuromorphic computing, due to their compact size, low power consumption, and tunable properties. However, achieving synchronization in a large array of STNOs remains a challenge, for the complexity of the interactions between the oscillators. To address this challenge, we report on the achievement of synchronization across a 2D array of STNOs. We designed a honeycomb model that created a network of interactions among the oscillators that only involved nearest neighbors. Using micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrated the effectiveness of our design and observed that global synchronization across the whole array. Such global synchronization can also be tuned by enable/disenable next-nearest neighbor interactions. We also found that our design enables synchronization at room temperature, which is crucial for practical applications. Our work contributes to the growing body of research on the synchronization of coupled oscillators in spintronics and could pave the way for the development of new types of spintronic devices and potential applications.</description>

      <title>On-chip quantum confinement refrigeration overcoming electron-phonon heat leaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circuit-based quantum devices rely on keeping electrons at millikelvin temperatures. Improved coherence and sensitivity as well as discovering new physical phenomena motivate pursuing ever lower electron temperatures, accessible using on-chip cooling techniques. Here we show that a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), manipulated using gate voltages, works as an on-chip heat sink only limited by a fundamental phonon heat-leak. A single-shot 2DEG cooler can reduce the electron temperature by a factor of two with a hold time up to a second. Integrating an array of such coolers to obtain continuous cooldown in will allow reaching down to microkelvin device temperatures.</description>

      <title>Electric-field-tunable topological phases in valley-polarized quantum anomalous Hall systems with inequivalent exchange fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating valley as a degree of freedom into quantum anomalous Hall systems offers a novel approach to manipulating valleytronics in electronic transport. Using the Kane-Mele monolayer as a concrete model, we comprehensively explore the various topological phases in the presence of inequivalent exchange fields and reveal the roles of the interfacial Rashba effect and external electric field in tuning topological valley-polarized states. We find that valley-polarized states can be realized by introducing Kane-Mele spin-orbit coupling and inequivalent exchange fields. Further introducing Rashba spin-orbit coupling and an electric field into the system can lead to diverse topological states, such as the valley-polarized quantum anomalous Hall effect with $\mathcal{C}=~\pm 1,\pm 2$ and valley-contrasting states with $\mathcal{C}=0$. Remarkably, different valley-polarized topological states can be continuously tuned by varying the strength and direction of the external electric field in a fixed system. Our work demonstrates the tunability of topological states in valley-polarized quantum anomalous Hall systems and provides an ideal platform for applications in electronic transport devices in topological valleytronics.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian polariton-photon coupling in a perovskite open microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the non-Hermitian properties of semiconductor materials for optical applications is at the forefront of photonic research. However, the selection of appropriate systems to implement such photonic devices remains a topic of debate. In this work, we demonstrate that a perovskite crystal, characterized by its easy and low-cost manufacturing, when placed between two distributed Bragg reflectors with an air gap, can form a natural double microcavity. This construction shows promising properties for the realisation of novel, tunable non-Hermitian photonic devices through strong light-matter coupling. We reveal that such a system exhibits double-coupled polariton modes with dispersion including multiple inflection points. Owing to its non-Hermiticity, our system exhibits nonreciprocal properties and allows for the observation of exceptional points. Our experimental studies are in agreement with the theoretical analysis based on coupled mode theory and calculations based on transfer matrix method.</description>

      <title>Fractional Quantum Hall phases of graphene beyond ultra-short range intervalley-anisotropic interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental and theoretical development in the Quantum Hall effect in monolayer graphene showed that the previous model of the valley-anisotropy interaction is incomplete, as it was assumed to be ultra-short range (USR). In this work, we use exact diagonalization to go beyond the ultra-short range to find the different phases for $\nu=2/3$. We model the interaction as Yukawa so that we can control the range as a proof of concept. Even in this simple setting, we discovered how dropping the USR condition shifts the transition borders in favour of certain phases, leads to a new bond-ordered phase appearing, and breaks the ferromagnetic phase in two competing states as a result of lifting the USR-driven degeneracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-noise amplifiers are of great importance in the field of quantum technologies. We study a thermally driven parametric amplifier based on a superconductor-insulator-graphene-insulator-superconductor (SIGIS) junction coupled to a superconducting microwave cavity. The strong non-linearity in the temperature dependence of our device leads to thermal self-modulation that produces impedance oscillations at frequencies around twice the angular cavity resonance frequency $\omega_\mathrm{r}$. In particular, reactance modulation of the effective capacitance yields a gain of 18.6 dB over a frequency span of 125 kHz with a minimum noise temperature of $T_\mathrm{N} = 1.4$ K. Our theoretical modelling gives insight into the exact mixing processes, confirmation of the electron-phonon coupling parameter and possible improvements of the studied system.</description>

      <title>Parallel-Field Hall effect in ZrTe$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parallel-field Hall effect is the appearance of a Hall voltage $V_{\rm H}$ that is transverse to the current $I$ when the magnetic field $B$ is applied parallel to $I$ (i.e. $B \parallel I \perp V_{\rm H}$). Such an effect is symmetry forbidden in most cases and hence is very unusual. Interestingly, the existence of a finite parallel-field Hall effect was reported for the layered topological semimetal ZrTe$_5$ and was proposed to be due to Berry curvature. However, it is forbidden for the known symmetry of ZrTe$_5$ and the possible existence of a misaligned out-of-plane magnetic field was not completely ruled out. Here, we elucidate the existence of the parallel-field Hall effect in ZrTe$_5$ with careful magnetic-field alignment. We interpret this result to originate from symmetry breaking and quantitatively explain the observed parallel-field Hall signal by considering a tilting of the Fermi surface allowed by broken symmetry.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning and the Early Estimation of Single-Photon Source Quality using Machine Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of single-photon sources (SPSs) is central to numerous systems and devices proposed amidst a modern surge in quantum technology. However, manufacturing schemes remain imperfect, and single-photon emission purity must often be experimentally verified via interferometry. Such a process is typically slow and costly, which has motivated growing research into whether SPS quality can be more rapidly inferred from incomplete emission statistics. Hence, this study is a sequel to previous work that demonstrated significant uncertainty in the standard method of quality estimation, i.e. the least-squares fitting of a physically motivated function, and asks: can machine learning (ML) do better? The study leverages eight datasets obtained from measurements involving an exemplary quantum emitter, i.e. a single InGaAs/GaAs epitaxial quantum dot; these eight contexts predominantly vary in the intensity of the exciting laser. Specifically, via a form of `transfer learning', five ML models, three linear and two ensemble-based, are trained on data from seven of the contexts and tested on the eighth. Validation metrics quickly reveal that even a linear regressor can outperform standard fitting when it is tested on the same contexts it was trained on, but the success of transfer learning is less assured, even though statistical analysis, made possible by data augmentation, suggests its superiority as an early estimator. Accordingly, the study concludes by discussing future strategies for grappling with the problem of SPS context dissimilarity, e.g. feature engineering and model adaptation.</description>

      <title>Harnessing coupled nanolasers near exceptional points for directional emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tailoring the losses of optical systems within the frame of non-Hermitian physics has appeared very fruitful in the last few years. In particular, the description of exceptional points (EPs) with coupled resonators have become widespread. The on-chip realization of these functionalities is highly significant for integrated nanophotonics, but requires fine control techniques of the nanodevice properties. Here, we demonstrate pump-controlled directional emission of two coupled nanolasers that distantly interact via an integrated waveguide. This coupling scheme unusually enables both frequency- and loss-couplings between two cavities, which can be advantageously exploited to reach EPs by either detuning the cavities or controlling the gain of nanolasers. The system can be readily reconfigured from bidirectional to unidirectional emission by adjusting the pump power.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement and non-Hermiticity in free fermion systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a short topical review, this article reports progress on the generalization and applications of entanglement in non-Hermitian quantum systems. We begin by examining the realization of non-Hermitian quantum systems through the Lindblad master equation, alongside a review of typical non-Hermitian free-fermion systems that exhibit unique features. A pedagogical discussion is provided on the relationship between entanglement quantities and the correlation matrix in Hermitian systems. Building on this foundation, we focus on how entanglement concepts are extended to non-Hermitian systems from their Hermitian free-fermion counterparts, with a review of the general properties that emerge. Finally, we highlight various applications, demonstrating that entanglement entropy remains a powerful diagnostic tool for characterizing non-Hermitian physics. The entanglement spectrum also reflects the topological characteristics of non-Hermitian topological systems, while unique non-Hermitian entanglement behaviors are also discussed. The review is concluded with several future directions.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit-splitting-driven nonlinear Hall effect in NbIrTe4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Berry curvature dipole (BCD) serves as a one of the fundamental contributors to emergence of the nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE). Despite intense interest due to its potential for new technologies reaching beyond the quantum efficiency limit, the interplay between BCD and NLHE has been barely understood yet in the absence of a systematic study on the electronic band structure. Here, we report NLHE realized in NbIrTe4 that persists above room temperature coupled with a sign change in the Hall conductivity at 150 K. First-principles calculations combined with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements show that BCD tuned by the partial occupancy of spin-orbit split bands via temperature is responsible for the temperature-dependent NLHE. Our findings highlight the correlation between BCD and the electronic band structure, providing a viable route to create and engineer the non-trivial Hall effect by tuning the geometric properties of quasiparticles in transition-metal chalcogen compounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have been used extensively for high-sensitivity nanoscale sensing, but conventional approaches use confocal microscopy to measure individual centers sequentially, limiting throughput and access to non-local physical properties. Here we design and implement a multiplexed NV sensing platform that allows us to read out many single NV centers simultaneously using a low-noise camera. Using this platform, we coherently manipulate and read out the spin states of hundreds of individual NV centers in parallel, achieving comparable magnetic field sensitivity to confocal measurements. We also implement a parallelized version of spin-to-charge-conversion readout for low NV center spin state readout noise and use it to demonstrate multiplexed covariance magnetometry, in which we measure six two-point magnetic field correlators from four NV centers simultaneously. The number of correlators we can measure is limited only by the available laser power, opening the door to massively multiplexed covariance magnetometry. Our platform significantly increases the throughput and broadens the applications of nanoscale sensing using diamond quantum sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nodal loop semimetals are topological materials with drumhead surface states characterized by reduced kinetic energy. If the Fermi energy of such a system is near these nondispersive states interaction among charge carriers substantially impacts their electronic structure. The emergence of magnetism in these surface states is one of the possible consequences. Ca3P2 an already synthesized material possesses a remarkably large nodal loop which is situated exactly at the Fermi level of the bulk system. In the present work, we investigate how surface magnetism is impacted by surface reconstruction and lattice termination in finite slabs in this material. We show that a slight deviation from the stoichiometric occupation of Ca sites results in the stabilization of magnetic patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic adatoms on s-wave superconductors induce bound states inside the superconducting gap, called Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states (YSR). The anisotropy of the Fermi surface determines the spatial extension of bound states in a quasi-two-dimensional superconductor. This is especially important in the diluted impurity limit since the orbital overlap determines the coupling of YSR states of neighboring atoms and the formation of the collective YSR system. Here, we build diluted arrays of Mn atoms with different dimensionalities on the surface of $\beta$-Bi$_2$Pd, and we measure the evolution of their YSR spectra with the structure. We detect the coupling as a split of YSR peaks in subgap spectra and find that the split size increases with the number of atoms. The orientation of the structures along different directions of the \bipd substrate modulates the split and particle-hole asymmetry of the YSR states due to the anisotropic character of the Fermi surface, captured by the Green function model. With the aid of the model, we found multiple YSR excitations in an extended 2D array of 25 Mn atoms, and we identified that their spatial distribution reflects a chiral LDOS.</description>

      <title>Scalable parallel measurement of individual nitrogen-vacancy centers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a solid-state spin defect that has been widely adopted for quantum sensing and quantum information processing applications. Typically, experiments are performed either with a single isolated NV center or with an unresolved ensemble of many NV centers, resulting in a trade-off between measurement speed and spatial resolution or control over individual defects. In this work, we introduce an experimental platform that bypasses this trade-off by addressing multiple optically resolved NV centers in parallel. We perform charge- and spin-state manipulations selectively on multiple NV centers from within a larger set, and we manipulate and measure the electronic spin states of 10 NV centers in parallel. Further, we show that the high signal-to-noise ratio of the measurements enables the detection of shot-to-shot pairwise correlations between the spin states of 10 NV centers, corresponding to the simultaneous measurement of 45 unique correlation coefficients. We conclude by discussing how our platform can be scaled to parallel experiments with thousands of individually resolved NV centers. These results enable high-throughput experiments with individual spin defects, and provide a natural platform for the application of recently developed correlated sensing techniques.</description>

      <title>Extended quantum anomalous Hall effect in moir\'e structures: phase transitions and transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments on multilayer rhombohedral graphene have unearthed a number of interesting phenomena in the regime where Integer and Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall phenomena were previously reported. Specifically at low temperature ($T$) and low applied currents, an "Extended" Integer Quantum Anomalous Hall (EIQAH) is seen over a wide range of the phase diagram. As the current is increased, at low $T$, the EIQAH undergoes a phase transition to a metallic state at generic fillings, and to the fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) state at the Jain fillings. Increasing temperature at the Jain fillings also leads to an evolution out of the EIQAH to the Jain state. Here we provide an interpretation of these observations. We describe the EIQAH as a crystalline state (either of holes doped into the $\nu = 1$ state, or an Anomalous Hall Crystal of electrons) that breaks moir\'e translation symmetry. At generic fillings, we show how an electric current-induced depinning transition of the crystalline order leads to peculiar non-linear current-voltage curves consistent with the experiment. At Jain fillings, we propose that the depinning transition is pre-empted by an equilibrium transition between EIQAH and Jain FQAH states. This transition occurs due to the large polarizability of the Jain FQAH states which enables them to lower their energy effectively in an applied electric field compared to the crystal states. We also discuss the finite temperature evolution in terms of the relative entropies of the crystalline and FQAH states.</description>

      <title>Universal platform of point-gap topological phases from topological materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08110v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whereas point-gap topological phases are responsible for exceptional phenomena intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems, their realization in quantum materials is still elusive. Here we propose a simple and universal platform of point-gap topological phases constructed from Hermitian topological insulators and superconductors. We show that (d-1)-dimensional point-gap topological phases are realized by making a boundary in d-dimensional topological insulators and superconductors dissipative. A crucial observation of the proposal is that adding a decay constant to boundary modes in d-dimensional topological insulators and superconductors is topologically equivalent to attaching a (d-1)-dimensional point-gap topological phase to the boundary. We furthermore establish the proposal from the extended version of the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem, relating dissipative gapless modes to point-gap topological numbers. From the bulk-boundary correspondence of the point-gap topological phases, the resultant point-gap topological phases exhibit exceptional boundary states or in-gap higher-order non-Hermitian skin effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a new dark exciton in monolayer MoS$_2$ using second harmonic generation spectroscopy. Hereby, the spectrally dependent second harmonic generation intensity splits into two branches, and an anticrossing is observed at $\sim$ 25 meV blue detuned from the bright neutral exciton. These observations are indicative of coherent quantum interference arising from strong two-photon light-matter interaction with an excitonic state that is dark for single photon interaction. The existence of the dark state is supported by engineering its relaxation to bright localized excitons, mediated by vibrational modes of a proximal nanobeam cavity. We show that two-photon light-matter interaction involving dark states has the potential to control relaxation pathways induced by nanostructuring the local environment. Moreover, our results indicate that dark excitons have significant potential for nonlinear quantum devices based on their nontrivial excitonic photophysics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02318v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the response tensors in planar Hall (or planar thermal Hall) configurations such that a three-dimensional Weyl or multi-Weyl semimetal is subjected to the influence of an electric field $\mathbf E $ (or temperature gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf r } T$) and an effective magnetic field $\mathbf B^{\rm tot}$, which are oriented at a generic angle with respect to each other. The effective magnetic field consists of two parts: (a) an actual/physical magnetic field $\mathbf B $, and (b) an emergent magnetic field $\mathbf B_5 $ which quantifies the elastic deformations of the sample. $\mathbf B_5 $ is an axial pseudomagnetic field because it couples to conjugate nodal points with opposite chiralities with opposite signs. We study the interplay of the orientations of these two components of $\mathbf B^{\rm tot}$ with respect to the direction of the electric field (or temperature gradient) and elucidate how it affects the characteristics involving the chirality of the node. Additionally, we show that the magnitude and sharpness of the conductivity tensor profiles strongly depend on the value of the topological charge at the node in question.</description>

      <title>Lee-Yang theory of the superradiant phase transition in the open Dicke model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dicke model describes an ensemble of two-level atoms that are coupled to a confined light mode of an optical cavity. Above a critical coupling, the cavity becomes macroscopically occupied, and the system enters the superradiant phase. This phase transition can be observed by detecting the photons that are emitted from the cavity; however, it only becomes apparent in the limit of long observation times, while actual experiments are of a finite duration. To circumvent this problem, we here make use of recent advances in Lee-Yang theories of phase transitions to show that the superradiant phase transition can be inferred from the factorial cumulants of the photon emission statistics obtained during a finite measurement time. Specifically, from the factorial cumulants, we can determine the complex singularities of generating functions that describe the photon emission statistics, and by extrapolating their positions to the long-time limit, one can detect the superradiant phase transition. We also show that the convergence points determine the tails of the large-deviation statistics of the photon current. Our work demonstrates how phase transitions in the Dicke model and in other quantum many-body systems can be detected from measurements of a finite duration.</description>

Abstract: Multilayer nanoscale systems incorporating buried ultrathin tunnel oxides, 2D materials, and solid electrolytes are crucial for next-generation logics, memory, quantum and neuro-inspired computing. Still, an ultrathin layer control at angstrom scale is challenging for cutting-edge applications. Here we introduce a scalable approach utilizing focused ion-beam annealing for buried ultrathin oxides engineering with angstrom-scale thickness control. Our molecular dynamics simulations of Ne+ irradiation on Al/a-AlOx/Al structure confirms the pivotal role of ion generated crystal defects. We experimentally demonstrate its performance on Josephson junction tunning in the resistance range of 2 to 37% with a standard deviation of 0.86% across 25x25 mm chip. Moreover, we showcase +-17 MHz frequency control (+-0.172 A tunnel barrier thickness) for superconducting transmon qubits with coherence times up to 500 us, which is promising for useful fault-tolerant quantum computing. This work ensures ultrathin multilayer nanosystems engineering at the ultimate scale by depth-controlled crystal defects generation.</description>

Abstract: Employing large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we find in magnetized interacting Dirac fermion model, there emerges a new and universal collective Larmor-Silin spin wave mode in the transverse dynamical spin susceptibility. Such mode purely originates from the interaction among Dirac fermions and distinguishes itself from the usual particle-hole continuum with finite lifetime and clear dispersion, both at small and large momenta in a large portion of the Brillouin zone. Our unbiased numerical results offer the dynamic signature of this new collective excitations in interacting Dirac fermion systems, and provide experimental guidance for inelastic neutron scattering, electron spin resonance and other spectroscopic approaches in the investigation of such universal collective modes in quantum Moire materials, topological insulators and quantum spin liquid materials under magnetic field, with quintessential interaction nature beyond the commonly assumed noninteracting Dirac fermion or spinon approximations.</description>

Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics represents a powerful platform to generate entanglement and tailor photonic states. We consider a pair of identical qubits coupled to a parity invariant waveguide in the microwave domain. By working in the one- and two-excitation sectors, we provide a unified view of decay processes and we show the common origin of directional single photon emission and two photon directional bunching. Unveiling the quantum trajectories, we demonstrate that both phenomena are rooted in the selective coupling of orthogonal qubits Bell states with different photon propagation directions. We comment on how to use this mechanism to implement optimized post-selection of Bell states, heralded by the detection of photons on one qubits side.</description>

Abstract: We propose a minimal "three-patch model" for the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC), a topological electronic state that spontaneously breaks both time-reversal symmetry and continuous translation symmetry. The proposal for this state is inspired by the recently observed integer and fractional quantum Hall states in rhombohedral multilayer graphene at zero magnetic field. There, interaction effects appear to amplify the effects of a weak moir\'e potential, leading to the formation of stable, isolated Chern bands. It has been further shown that Chern bands are stabilized in mean field calculations even without a moir\'e potential, enabling a realization of the AHC state. Our model is built upon the dissection of the Brillouin zone into patches centered around high symmetry points. Within this model, the wavefunctions at high symmetry points fully determine the topology and energetics of the state. We extract two quantum geometrical phases of the non-interacting wavefunctions that control the stability of the topologically nontrivial AHC state. The model predicts that the AHC state wins over the topological trivial Wigner crystal in a wide range of parameters, and agrees very well with the results of full self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations of the rhombohedral multilayer graphene Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Coherent expansion of the motional state of a massive nanoparticle beyond its linear dimensions</title>

Abstract: Quantum mechanics predicts that massive particles exhibit wave-like behavior. Matterwave interferometry has been able to validate such predictions through ground-breaking experiments involving microscopic systems like atoms and molecules. The wavefunction of such systems coherently extends over a distance much larger than their size, an achievement that is incredibly challenging for massive and more complex objects. Yet, reaching similar level of coherent diffusion will enable tests of fundamental physics at the genuinely macroscopic scale, as well as the development of quantum sensing apparata of great sensitivity. We report on experimentally achieving an unprecedented degree of position diffusion in a massive levitated optomechanical system through frequency modulation of the trapping potential. By starting with a pre-cooled state of motion and employing a train of sudden pulses yet of mild modulation depth, we surpass previously attained values of position diffusion in this class of systems to reach diffusion lengths that exceed the physical dimensions of the trapped nanoparticle.</description>
