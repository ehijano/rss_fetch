      <title>Gas of thin tubes of massless scalar field as a possible model of unified dark fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigated the influence of constants that characterize the motion of thin tubes of a massless scalar field (TToMSF) in a gas on the global properties of such a gas, in particular, on its ability to accelerated expansion. The peculiarity of the TToMSF gas is related to the fact that the parameter of its equation of state $w$ depends on the degree of rarefaction of the gas and can take values in a very wide range of values $-1&lt; w &lt;1$. In this case, fluctuations in the density of the TToMSF gas, caused by its gravitational interaction with non-uniformly distributed baryonic matter, should lead to the implementation of local equations of state with different values and different laws of change of the parameter $w$. The possibility of implementing local equations of state can alleviate the tensions associated with the observed non-uniformity of the distribution of matter and the growth of structures in the Universe.</description>

      <title>York Cavity Formalism and Canonical Ensemble Thermodynamics of (2+1)D Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I perform a detailed investigation of the thermodynamic behavior of (2+1) dimensional Banados Teitelboim Zanelli (BTZ) black holes contained within the canonical ensemble framework, utilizing York formalism. A static, non-rotating BTZ black hole is considered inside a finite radius circular cavity maintained at constant temperature. By getting the measure of the Euclidean action, I obtain expressions for thermodynamic parameters including temperature, entropy, energy, pressure, and heat capacity. I confirm the validity of the Bekenstein Hawking entropy law and examine the thermal stability of the system through heat capacity analysis. Furthermore, I identify conditions for a transition of phase to a stable black hole state from hot flat space and explore the density of states from a statistical mechanics perspective. Moreover, I examine JT coefficient and heat engine efficiency for the BH. Together, our results demonstrate the consistency of York approach and highlight it as a robust tool to investigate black hole thermodynamics in lower-dimensional gravity.
  Keywords: York's cavity formalism, Canonical ensemble, BTZ black hole, Black hole thermodynamics, JT coefficient, Black hole heat engine efficiency.</description>

      <title>Highly accurate simulations of asymmetric black-hole scattering and cross validation of effective-one-body models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of unbound binary-black-hole encounters provides a gauge-invariant approach to exploring strong-field gravitational interactions in two-body systems, which can subsequently inform waveform models for bound orbits. In this work, we present 60 new highly accurate numerical relativity (NR) simulations of black-hole scattering, generated using the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC). Our simulations include 14 spin-aligned configurations, as well as 16 configurations with unequal masses, up to a mass ratio of 10. We perform the first direct comparison of scattering angles computed using different NR codes, finding good agreement. We compare our NR scattering angle results to the post-Minkowskian (PM)-based effective-one-body (EOB) closed-form models SEOB-PM and $w_{\rm EOB}$, finding less than 5% deviation except near the scatter-capture separatrix. Comparisons with the post-Newtonian-based EOB evolution models SEOBNRv5 and TEOBResumS-Dal\'{i} reveal that the former agrees within 8% accuracy with non-spinning NR results across most parameter ranges, whereas the latter matches similarly at lower energies but diverges significantly at higher energies. Both evolution EOB models exhibit increased deviations for spinning systems, predicting a notably different location of the capture separatrix compared to NR. Our key finding is the first measurement of disparate scattering angles from NR simulations due to asymmetric gravitational-wave emission. We compare these results to SEOB-PM models constructed to calculate the scattering angle of a single black hole in asymmetric systems.</description>

      <title>Post-adiabatic dynamics and waveform generation in self-force theory: an invariant pseudo-Hamiltonian framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waveform modeling in self-force theory has reached a mature stage in recent years, with fast and accurate models emerging at both adiabatic (0PA) and first post-adiabatic (1PA) orders in a multiscale expansion. Here, we provide a gauge-invariant 1PA waveform-generation framework that involves no direct calculation of the (gauge-dependent) self-force. To achieve this, we recast the multiscale framework in a pseudo-Hamiltonian form, working on the six-dimensional phase space intrinsic to the multiscale expansion. We characterize the gauge freedom on phase space and show how a localization procedure avoids nonlocal-in time effects in the 1PA dynamics. We find a conservative Hamiltonian structure can be naturally embedded into the complete, dissipative 1PA pseudo-Hamiltonian dynamics, giving rise to natural definitions of the conserved energy, angular momentum, and radial and polar actions. As a byproduct, we clarify that the on-shell value of the conservative Hamiltonian is equal to the mechanical energy historically predicted by the first law of binary black hole mechanics.</description>

      <title>A model-agnostic gravitational-wave background characterization algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors improve in sensitivity, gravitational-wave background (GWB) signals will progressively become detectable. Currently, searches for the GWB model the signal as a power law, however deviations from this model will be relevant at increased sensitivity. Therefore, to prepare for the range of potentially detectable GWB signals, we propose an interpolation model implemented through a transdimensional reverse-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm. This interpolation model foregoes a specific physics-informed model (of which there are a great many) in favor of a flexible model that can accurately recover a broad range of potential signals. In this paper, we employ this framework for an array of GWB applications. We present three dimensionless fractional GW energy density injections and recoveries as examples of the capabilities of this spline interpolation model. We further demonstrate how our model can be implemented for hierarchical GW analysis on $\Omega_{\rm GW}$.</description>

      <title>Singularities in loop quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum effects are expected to modify the cosmological dynamics of the early universe while maintaining some (potentially discrete) notion of space-time structure. In one approach, loop quantum cosmology, current models are shown here to either be incompatible with a consistent space-time structure, or to have physical singularities. The latter happens in spite of a non-zero scale factor in the isotropic background dynamics. A new effective Friedmann equation shows that a bounce is obtained at sub-Planckian densities, preceded by a physical singularity at infinite scale factor that resembles a time-reversed big rip. The entire phase is accompanied by rapid changes of the Hubble radius. In addition, a new version of perturbative inhomogeneity in loop quantum cosmology is introduced that maintains a consistent space-time structure and has a non-singular background dynamics.</description>

      <title>Improving gravitational wave search sensitivity with TIER: Trigger Inference using Extended strain Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a machine learning (ML) framework called $\texttt{TIER}$ for improving the sensitivity of gravitational wave search pipelines. Typically, search pipelines only use a small region of strain data in the vicinity of a candidate signal to construct the detection statistic. However, extended strain data ($\sim 10$ s) in the candidate's vicinity can also carry valuable complementary information. We show that this information can be efficiently captured by ML classifier models trained on sparse summary representation/features of the extended data. Our framework is easy to train and can be used with already existing candidates from any search pipeline, and without requiring expensive injection campaigns. Furthermore, the output of our model can be easily integrated into the detection statistic of a search pipeline. Using $\texttt{TIER}$ on triggers from the $\texttt{IAS-HM}$ pipeline, we find up to $\sim 20\%$ improvement in sensitive volume time in LIGO-Virgo-Kagra O3 data, with improvements concentrated in regions of high masses and unequal mass ratios. Applying our framework increases the significance of several near-threshold gravitational-wave candidates, especially in the pair-instability mass gap and intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) ranges.</description>

      <title>On Axially Symmetric Perturbations of Kerr Black Hole Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of a positive-definite and conserved energy is a serious obstacle in the black hole stability problem. In this work, we will show that there exists a positive-definite and conserved Hamiltonian energy for axially symmetric linear perturbations of the exterior of Kerr black hole spacetimes. In the first part, based on the Hamiltonian dimensional reduction of 3+1 axially symmetric, Ricci-flat Lorentzian spacetimes to a 2+1 Einstein-wave map system with the negatively curved hyperbolic 2-plane target, we construct a positive-definite, spacetime gauge-invariant energy functional for linear axially symmetric perturbations in the exterior of Kerr black holes, in a manner that is also gauge-independent on the target manifold. In the construction of the positive-definite energy, various dynamical terms at the boundary of the orbit space occur critically. In the second part, after setting up the initial value problem in harmonic coordinates, we prove that the positive energy for the axially symmetric linear perturbative theory of Kerr black holes is strictly conserved in time, by establishing that all the boundary terms dynamically vanish for all times. This result implies a form of dynamical linear stability of the exterior of Kerr black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Defining eccentricity for spin-precessing binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standardizing the definition of eccentricity is necessary for unambiguous inference of the orbital eccentricity of compact binaries from gravitational wave observations. In previous works, we proposed a definition of eccentricity for systems without spin-precession that relies solely on the gravitational waveform, is applicable to any waveform model, and has the correct Newtonian limit. In this work, we extend this definition to spin-precessing systems. This simple yet effective extension relies on first transforming the waveform from the inertial frame to the coprecessing frame, and then adopting an amplitude and a phase with reduced spin-induced effects. Our method includes a robust procedure for filtering out spin-induced modulations, which become non-negligible in the small eccentricity and large spin-precession regime. Finally, we apply our method to a set of Numerical Relativity and Effective One Body waveforms to showcase its robustness for generic eccentric spin-precessing binaries. We make our method public via Python implementation in \texttt{gw\_eccentricity}.</description>

      <title>Penrose process in magnetized non-Kerr rotating spacetime with anomalous quadrupole moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic Penrose process in the Quevedo-Mashhoon spacetime, immersed in a uniform magnetic field $B$. This metric is a stationary, axisymmetric, asymptotically flat vacuum solution to Einstein's equations with an arbitrary anomalous quadrupole moment ${\cal Q}$. A non-vanishing ${\cal Q}$ significantly modifies the near-horizon geometry, creating a multi-lobe ergoregion. Both ${\cal Q}$ and $B$ strongly influence the negative-energy region, which can extend well beyond the ergoregion, enabling the magnetic Penrose process to operate far from the ergoregion. Their combined effects allow energy extraction efficiency $\eta$ to far exceed that of the mechanical Penrose process. The maximum efficiency undergoes three distinct evolutionary stages as ${\cal Q}$ varies. In the absence of the magnetic field, efficiency is optimized for more negative ${\cal Q}$ (yielding a more oblate spacetime than Kerr). When electromagnetic interactions dominate, efficiency peaks when the infalling fragment's charge and $B$ share the same sign and ${\cal Q}$ is more positive (producing a more prolate spacetime than Kerr). These findings support the magnetic Penrose process as a theoretical framework for high-energy cosmic phenomena (e.g., extragalactic high-energy radiation) and as a tool to test the Kerr hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Null geodesics, causal structure, and matter accretion in Lorentzian-Euclidean black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, we introduced the Lorentzian-Euclidean black hole, a static and spherically symmetric solution of vacuum Einstein equations that exhibits a change in metric signature across the event horizon. In this framework, the analysis of radial trajectories of freely falling bodies proves that the central singularity can be avoided via a mechanism we interpret as atemporality, which is responsible for the shift of the time variable from real to imaginary values.
  In this paper, we further explore this model by first examining the behavior of null geodesics. Our investigation requires a set of signature-adaptive coordinate changes that generalize the local Lorentz transformations underlying General Relativity. We find that photon orbits, like their massive counterparts, cannot traverse the event horizon, thereby strengthening the previous result on the impossibility to reach the $r=0$ singularity. Additionally, we discuss the causal structure of the spacetime, provide the corresponding Penrose diagram, and analyze the process of matter accretion in the outer region of the black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the isentropic absorption of a classical charged test particle is classically forbidden for all 3+1 dimensional stationary, non-extremal, axisymmetric black holes in any diffeomorphism invariant theory of gravity. This result is derived purely from the near-horizon geometry and thermodynamic properties of the black hole spacetime, independent of the specific gravitational theory. We further consider the Kerr-Newman black hole in general relativity and analyze within the semiclassical WKB approximation, the conditions under which isentropic absorption may become allowed. Broader implications for the second law and extremality bounds are discussed.</description>

We find perfect agreement with previous self-force results, and (when inserting a recent high-post-Newtonian order derivation of radiated angular momentum [A. Geralico, arXiv:2507.03442 [gr-qc]]) with state-of-the-art post-Minkowskian scattering results [M.~Driesse et al., Nature \textbf{641}, no.8063, 603-607 (2025)].</description>

      <title>Quantum production of gravitational waves after inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variety of mechanisms in the early Universe lead to the generation of gravitational waves (GWs). We introduce here a novel source of GWs generated by vacuum fluctuations after inflation. Being gravitons minimally coupled particles, their quantum creation takes place during inflation, but is absent in an unperturbed Universe during the radiation-dominated epoch, since they behave as conformally invariant particles. However, the presence of inhomogeneities breaks the conformal flatness of the metric, allowing scalar metric perturbations to induce the quantum production of gravitons. We compute the resulting GW spectrum from this mechanism for different models of the primordial scalar power spectrum. We find that this GW signal peaks around the GHz frequency range, distinguishing it from other astrophysical and cosmological backgrounds and underscoring the need for detectors sensitive to these high frequencies.</description>

Using publicly available information, we estimate that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of GW250114 was $\sim 80$. This would make it three to four times louder than any other gravitational wave detected to date. GW250114 therefore offers a unique opportunity to make precise measurements of its source parameters and to test general relativity. In anticipation of its public data release, we analyze a set of simulated signals that have parameters similar to what we estimate for GW250114 and explore what new insights may be gained from this significant event.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Bell's spaceship paradox, a thread connects two spaceships moving with identical accelerations. As the ships accelerate in lockstep, the tension in the string increases due to the relativistic contraction and the string eventually breaks. What happens if instead of exactly matched accelerations, the changing tension in the string introduces small fluctuations that disrupt the lockstep acceleration? This relaxation of the requirement of lockstep acceleration dramatically changes the motion of the two ships. At a surprisingly small velocity, the two ships begin to move in a manner that maintains a constant proper distance between them. This allows the ships to accelerate indefinitely without breaking the string.</description>

      <title>DESI and fast radio burst used to constrain modified theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to study the viability of DESI and fast radio burst to constraint free parameters of modified theories of gravity. Thus, we present a model supported in $f(R)$ gravity involving a function of the Ricci scalar named Starobinsky-type with the peculiarity that the Non-commutative essence is intrinsic to the coefficients. Additionally, to understand the dynamics within a flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker Universe, we explore the possibility of deriving a Friedman equation (in measure) that results from an adequate mathematical treatment. As we mention previously, to test the outlined model, a Monte Carlo Markov Chain analysis is implemented, using Cosmic Chronometers, type Ia supernovae, Hydrogen II galaxies, Intermediate-luminosity quasars, Baryon Acoustic oscillations and Fast Radio Bursts data, to constraint the free parameters of the model and presenting $H(z)$, $q(z)$ and $\omega_{eff}(z)$. The final results are compared with the $\Lambda$CDM model and it is presented a robust discussion about the viability of DESI and fast radio burst to constraint free parameters in specific of a modified theory of gravity.</description>

      <title>Detecting Intermediate-mass Black Holes Using Miniature Pulsar Timing Arrays in Globular Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical models predict that intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) exist in globular clusters (GCs), but observational evidence remains elusive. Millisecond pulsars (MSPs), which are abundant in GCs and have served as precise probes for gravitational waves (GWs), offer a unique opportunity to detect potential IMBH binaries in GCs. Here, we consider the possibility of using multiple MSPs in a GC to form a miniature pulsar timing array (PTA), so as to take advantage of their correlated timing residuals to search for potential IMBH binaries in the same cluster. Our semi-analytical calculations reveal that nearby IMBH binaries around MSPs in GCs could induce microsecond-level timing residuals. In GCs like $\omega$ Centauri and M15, favorable configurations are found which could lead to the detection of binaries with mass ratios $q\gtrsim0.1$ and orbital periods of a few days. We estimate that future higher-precision timing programs could achieve $100$-nanosecond sensitivity, substantially expanding the searchable parameter space and establishing mini-PTAs as powerful detectors of IMBHs.</description>

      <title>GW231123: a Binary Black Hole Merger with Total Mass 190-265 $M_{\odot}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On 2023 November 23 the two LIGO observatories both detected GW231123, a gravitational-wave signal consistent with the merger of two black holes with masses $137^{+22}_{-17}\, M_\odot$ and $103^{+20}_{-52}\, M_\odot$ (90\% credible intervals), at luminosity distance 0.7-4.1 Gpc and redshift of $0.39^{+0.27}_{-0.24}$, and a network signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim$22.5. Both black holes exhibit high spins, $0.9^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and $0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.51}$ respectively. A massive black hole remnant is supported by an independent ringdown analysis. Some properties of GW231123 are subject to large systematic uncertainties, as indicated by differences in inferred parameters between signal models. The primary black hole lies within or above the theorized mass gap where black holes between 60-130 $M_\odot$ should be rare due to pair instability mechanisms, while the secondary spans the gap. The observation of GW231123 therefore suggests the formation of black holes from channels beyond standard stellar collapse, and that intermediate-mass black holes of mass $\sim$200 $M_\odot$ form through gravitational-wave driven mergers.</description>

      <title>Constraining decaying dark matter models with gravitational lensing and cosmic voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite overwhelming observational evidence for dark matter, we still have no evidence of direct detection. Consequently, our knowledge about dark matter is limited, for example, we do not know if dark matter is a stable particle or if it decays. Without a theoretical particle model, the parameter space of possible decay models is highly variable, and astrophysical or cosmological means of indirectly constraining the phenomenological models are required. This paper investigates a scenario in which a dark matter decays and the dark daughter particle moves with respect to the comoving mother particle. The model is parameterised by the decay rate and the injection velocity of the dark matter particles, which can be converted to the mass ratio. In previous work, a simpler model was used to investigate the evolution of cosmic voids typified as regions with low content of galaxies and non-baryonic matter. It was found that the growth of S-type voids is modified by the dark matter decay, leading to imprints at the present day. Here we extend our study and improve the method used to model the decay. We also study the gravitational weak-lensing signal that will be able to detect or constrain the parameter space of decaying dark matter. The results of this study suggest that future weak lensing surveys may provide unique probes of the phenomological parameters of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-based theory of Dirac fermions on two-dimensional hyperbolic crystals: Coupling to the spin connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete fermionic and bosonic models for hyperbolic lattices have attracted significant attention across a range of fields since the experimental realization of hyperbolic lattices in metamaterial platforms, sparking the development of hyperbolic crystallography. However, a fundamental and experimentally consequential aspect remains unaddressed: fermions propagating in curved space inherently couple to the underlying geometry via the spin connection, as required by general covariance - a feature not yet incorporated in studies of hyperbolic crystals. Here, we introduce a symmetry-based framework for Dirac fermions on two-dimensional hyperbolic lattices, explicitly incorporating spin-curvature coupling via a discrete spin connection. Starting from the continuous symmetries of the Poincar\'e disk, we classify the irreducible representations and construct a symmetry-adapted basis, establishing a direct correspondence to the continuum Dirac theory. We show that this continuum theory predicts a finite density of states at zero energy for any finite curvature in $D-$dimensional hyperbolic space with $2\leq D \leq 4$, suggesting enhanced susceptibility of Dirac fermions to interaction-driven instabilities at weak coupling. We then derive explicit forms of discrete translational and rotational symmetries for lattices characterized by Schl\"afli symbols $\{p,q\}$, and explicitly construct the discrete spin connection, represented as hopping phases, via parallel transport. Our results pave the way for experimental realization of spin-curvature effects in metamaterial platforms and systematic numerical studies of correlated Dirac phases in hyperbolic geometries.</description>

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger-Poisson formalism has found a number of applications in cosmology, particularly in describing the growth by gravitational instability of large-scale structure in a universe dominated by ultra-light scalar particles. Here we investigate the extent to which the behaviour of this and the more general case of a Schr\"odinger-Newton system, can be described in terms of classical fluid concepts such as viscosity and pressure. We also explore whether such systems can be described by a pseudo-Reynolds number as for classical viscous fluids. The conclusion we reach is that this is indeed possible, but with important restrictions to ensure physical consistency.</description>

      <title>Growth of Cosmic Structures in generalized mass-to-horizon relation Entropic Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the growth of cosmic structures in the thermodynamically consistent generalised mass-to-horizon entropic cosmology (MHEC). For the Bekenstein case the entropic energy density augments the Friedmann equations without modifying the Hawking temperature and automatically satisfies the Clausius relation, thereby avoiding the inconsistencies that afflicted earlier entropy-force models. We then derive the linear perturbation equations, emphasising the distinction between a fully perturbed interaction term and the common approximation in which the perturbation is neglected. Numerical solutions show that fully perturbed follows the LCDM matter-growth history within the current growth uncertainties. Our results demonstrate that MHEC matches both background and growth probes as well as LCDM without extra free parameters, providing a viable entropic explanation for recent accelerated expansion of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Thermal Gravitons from Warm Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In warm inflation (WI), the persistent thermal bath that is sustained by dissipative interactions with the inflaton field produces a stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWs). In this paper we study the production and evolution of these GWs. Specifically, we investigate the emission of thermal gravitons (gravitons emitted by a thermal bath) from particle scattering in the bath and the evolution of the corresponding GWs. We find that the bulk of thermal graviton production in WI occurs during the transition to radiation domination after inflation. Further, the energy density of thermal gravitons is enhanced by roughly one to two orders of magnitude compared to that in a radiation-dominated scenario with the same reheating temperature. We also calculate the spectrum of the resulting stochastic GW background and find that it has a distinctive shape, consisting of a peak at high frequencies ~100 GHz and an almost flat spectrum extending to low frequencies. The peak arises from emission of sub-horizon modes that follow the temperature of the bath. The flat part of the spectrum corresponds to the modes that exit the horizon during WI and re-enter during radiation domination. We show that the detection prospects for the high-frequency peak of the GW spectrum, while improved slightly compared to the radiation-dominated case, still remain challenging. The thermal spectrum's low-frequency plateau is typically subdominant to the amplitude of the standard vacuum tensor modes from inflation, although WI models can exist where the thermal graviton plateau surpasses the vacuum contribution without exceeding current observational limits on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. Furthermore, we calculate the thermal graviton contribution from WI to dark radiation and show that WI models are generally expected to satisfy current observational bounds, including those from the cosmic microwave background.</description>

      <title>Mining the Alerts: A Preliminary Catalog of Compact Binaries from the Fourth Observing Run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a preliminary catalog of compact binary merger candidates from the ongoing fourth observing run (O4) of Advanced LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, based on an analysis of public alerts distributed through GraceDB as of May 2025. We developed and applied methods to estimate the source-frame chirp mass for each candidate by utilizing information from public data products, including source classification probabilities, sky localizations, and observatory status. Combining our O4 analysis with previous catalogs, we provide updated estimates for the local merger rate density. For sources with chirp mass characteristic of binary neutron stars ($[1, 1.5]\,M_\odot$), we find a rate of $56^{+99}_{-40}$ $\textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\textrm{yr}^{-1}$. For systems in the expected neutron star--black hole chirp mass range ($[1.5, 3.5]\,M_\odot$), the rate is $36^{+32}_{-20}$ $\textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\textrm{yr}^{-1}$, and for heavier binary black holes ($[3.5, 100]\,M_\odot$), we estimate a rate of $19^{+4}_{-2}$ $\textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\textrm{yr}^{-1}$. This work provides an early glimpse into the compact binary population being observed in O4; we identify a number of high-value candidates up to signal-to-noise $\sim 80$, which we expect to enable precision measurements in the future.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic effective theories for fields with general potentials and their implications for cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-relativistic effective field theories (NREFTs) play a crucial role in various areas of physics, from cold atom experiments to cosmology. In this paper, we present a systematic framework for deriving NREFTs from relativistic theories with generic self-interactions. Our approach allows for (but is not limited to) non-power-law potentials (such as those arising from dilatons or axions) or potentials that are non-analytic around the classical vacuum (such as those with logarithmic radiative corrections). These are of theoretical and phenomenological interest but have largely been unexplored in the non-relativistic regime. NREFTs are typically viewed as approximations for systems with low velocities, weak couplings, and small field amplitudes. The latter assumption is relaxed in our approach, as long as the mass term remains dominant (ensuring the validity of the non-relativistic limit). Additionally, we establish an effective fluid description for the non-relativistic scalar field, identifying key quantities such as energy density, pressure, and sound speed. To enable cosmological applications, we extend our formalism to account for the expanding universe, providing a reliable tool for investigating ultra-light dark matter models with arbitrary self-interactions. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our NREFT in analyzing solitons, which is also relevant to cosmology for studying celestial objects such as boson stars and the cores of dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>Wheeler-DeWitt wavefunctions for 5d BKL dynamics, automorphic L-functions and complex primon gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The near-singularity BKL dynamics of five dimensional gravity and supergravity (and also an extended four-dimensional supergravity) is known to be given by the billiard problem of a particle within a fundamental domain of the Bianchi groups $PSL(2,{\mathcal O}) \subset PSL(2,\mathbb{C})$, acting on $\mathbb{H}_3$. Here ${\mathcal O}$ are the Gaussian or Eisenstein integers, which define a square or triangular lattice in $\mathbb{C}$. The Wheeler-DeWitt wavefunctions near the singularity are, correspondingly, automorphic Maass forms of $PSL(2,{\mathcal O})$. We show how these wavefunctions are associated to certain $L$-functions evaluated along their critical axis. Each of these $L$-functions admits an Euler product representation over the complex primes ${\mathcal{P}}_{\mathcal O} \subset {\mathcal O}$. From this fact we write the $L$-function as the trace over an auxiliary Hilbert space of charged harmonic oscillators, labeled by the complex primes ${\mathcal{P}}_{\mathcal O}$. In this way we have constructed a 'dual' primon gas partition function for the wavefunction of the universe close to a five dimensional cosmological singularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested that logarithmically enhanced infra-red loop corrections arising in theories with four derivatives correspond to a physical running of couplings, rendering quadratic gravity asymptotically free. We find that these effects depend on the gauge and on the field parameterisation. We compute physical on-shell amplitudes and find genuine infra-red log-enhanced loop corrections, that are process-dependent and cannot be absorbed into running couplings. As a byproduct, we derive the effective action of quadratic gravity at tree level, showing that its ghost does not contribute to effective operators and thereby does not violate positivity bounds.</description>

      <title>A new framework for cosmological expansion in a reformulated Newtonian-Like gravity with variable G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Newtonian-like theory inspired by the Brans-Dicke gravitational Lagrangian has been recently proposed in Ref. arXiv:2009.04434(v4). We propose here a new variant of this theory such that the usual Newtonian second law is preserved. The cosmological solutions are analysed and accelerated background expansion can be obtained even in a pure matter dominated universe. This happens due to the dynamic character of the effective gravitational coupling which is sourced by a time evolving scalar field . We also analyse the matter density perturbations and find they exhibit an enhanced growth in comparison with the usual Newtonian like behavior in Einstein-de Sitter model.</description>

      <title>Costs of Bayesian Parameter Estimation in Third-Generation Gravitational Wave Detectors: a Review of Acceleration Methods</title>

Abstract: Bayesian inference with stochastic sampling has been widely used to obtain the properties of gravitational wave (GW) sources. Although computationally intensive, its cost remains manageable for current second-generation GW detectors because of the relatively low event rate and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The third-generation (3G) GW detectors are expected to detect hundreds of thousands of compact binary coalescence (CBC) events every year with substantially higher SNR and longer signal duration, presenting significant computational challenges. In this study, we systematically evaluate the computational costs of CBC source parameter estimation (PE) in the 3G era by modeling the PE time cost as a function of SNR and signal duration. We examine the standard PE method alongside acceleration methods including relative binning, multibanding, and reduced order quadrature. We predict that PE for a one-month-observation catalog with 3G detectors could require at least billions of CPU core hours with the standard PE method, whereas acceleration techniques can reduce this demand to less than millions of core hours, which is as high as the cost of analyzing GW events in the past 10 years. These findings highlight the necessity for more efficient PE methods to enable cost-effective and environmentally sustainable data analysis for 3G detectors. In addition, we assess the accuracy of accelerated PE methods, emphasizing the need for careful treatment in high-SNR scenarios.</description>

      <title>Black hole spectroscopy and nonlinear echoes in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14259v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory with a nonminimal coupling between the electromagnetic and scalar field, we study linear (non)radial perturbations and nonlinear radial dynamics of spherically symmetric black holes. In a certain region of the parameter space, this theory admits hairy black holes with a stable photon sphere. This has a counterpart in the effective potential of linear perturbations, featuring multiple maxima and minima. The corresponding quasinormal mode spectrum contains long-lived modes trapped in the potential cavity and the time-domain linear response displays echoes, as previously observed for horizonless compact objects. Interestingly, the black-hole dynamics in this theory can be studied at the nonlinear level. By performing fully-fledged 1+1 simulations, we show that echoes are present even when the nonlinearities are significant. To our knowledge, this is the first example of echoes appearing in a consistent theory beyond a linearized analysis. In a follow-up work we will study whether this feature is also present in the post-merger signal from black hole collisions in this theory.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Shortcomings in the Generalized SU(2) Proca Theory: Challenges for Cosmic Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Generalized SU(2) Proca (GSU2P) theory has recently garnered attention for its potential to describe key phases of cosmic evolution, including primordial inflation and late-time accelerated expansion. However, its full cosmological implications remain unexplored. In this work, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the dynamical properties of the GSU2P theory in a flat, homogeneous, and isotropic spacetime, through a dynamical-system approach. Our analysis reveals the presence of three pairs of fixed points, one of them corresponding to de-Sitter expansion which may represent either a stable or unstable phase in the evolution of the universe. These points, nonetheless, give rise to an indeterminate or infinite Hubble parameter, which renders them cosmologically unviable. Additionally, we find two key pseudostationary states: the ``attractor lines'', along which the system exhibits constant-roll dynamics, and the ``central zone'', characterized by oscillatory radiation-like behaviour of the field. The dynamics within the central zone could represent a graceful exit from the primordial inflationary phase to a radiation dominated phase, or a state of the dark energy component prior to the late-time cosmic acceleration. However, within the central zone, the dynamics of the vector field leads to recurrent instances of a nonphysical expansion rate. The absence of a limit cycle in the central zone further exacerbates the issue, as the system may follow unbounded phase-space trajectories, and the expansion rate becomes complex once it escapes the region. Collectively, these challenges undermine the viability of the GSU2P theory as a cosmological model for cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Equations of motion for compact binary systems in general relativity: Do they depend on the bodies' internal structure at the third post-Newtonian order?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and discuss the possibility, derived from work carried out 20 years ago, that the equations of motion for compact binary neutron stars at the third post-Newtonian (3PN) order in general relativity might actually depend on the internal structure of the bodies. These effects involve integrals over the density and internal gravitational potentials of the bodies that are independent of the mass and radius of the bodies, but dependent on their equations of state. These effects could alter the coefficients in the 3PN equations derived using ``point mass'' methods by as much as 100 percent. They were found in independent calculations done at Washington University using the Direct Integration of the Relaxed Einstein Equations (DIRE) approach, and at the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris using the Multipolar post-Minkowskian (MPPM) approach. Neither calculation was completed because of the enormous complexity of the algebraic computations and the limitations of software of the day (Maple, Mathematica), and because of an assumption that the effects would somehow cancel or be removable by some transformation. This assumption was rooted in the Strong Equivalence Principle (SEP), which would suppress such effects up to the stage where tidal interactions become important, effectively 5PN order for compact bodies. SEP was well supported at lower PN orders and in special examples. We argue that this assumption needs to be verified by calculations. If the results show that these terms exactly cancel or can be absorbed into renormalized masses or shifted positions of each body, this would provide support for the Strong Equivalence Principle. But if they do not cancel and are not incorporated into gravitational waveforms, they could impact efforts using next-generation gravitational-wave interferometers to extract information about the equation of state for neutron star matter.</description>

      <title>Constraining dark-sector effects using gravitational waves from compact binary inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave observations are a powerful tool to constrain fundamental physics. This work considers dark matter that carries charge under a dark abelian massive vector field. If such dark matter is bound inside coalescing neutron stars, the presence of the new force will modify the total energy of the binary, and the emission of dark radiation modes will impact the rate of inspiral. At leading order, the dark matter corrections introduce a Yukawa term to the potential energy and a dipole radiation mode. We calculate modifications to the binary inspiral waveform to first post-Newtonian order, incorporate these corrections into a state-of-the-art waveform model for neutron star binaries, and use this model in a Bayesian parameter estimation analysis on real data collected by current, second-generation ground-based detectors. Through this study, we place the first robust constraints on the Yukawa interaction strength and dipole emission parameter. We find that the strongest constraints are obtained from analysis of the GW170817 event, for which the Yukawa interaction strength is constrained to be less than $O(10^{-2})$ and the dipole emission parameter is less than $O(10^{-4})$ at 90% credibility.</description>

      <title>Characteristic initial value problems for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field equations in spherical symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24162v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The characteristic initial boundary problem is discussed in spherical symmetry for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field equations. It is formulated for an affine-null metric and the resulting field equations are cast into a hierarchical system of partial differential equations. The initial boundary value problem for a family of null hypersurfaces is specified for a timelike-null foliation at the central geodesic of spherical symmetry as well as for a double-null foliation where the corresponding boundary is a null hypersurface. For the latter, two distinct boundary value formulations arise -- one where the null boundary has zero Misner-Sharp mass and another one where the corresponding Misner-Sharp mass is nonzero. As an application, the nonextremal and the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om solution in null coordinates for a charged black hole and the Fisher-Janis-Newman-Winicour solution are derived.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass ratio inspirals around topological stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a point scalar charge in circular orbit around a topological star, a regular, horizonless soliton emerging from dimensional compactification of Einstein-Maxwell theory in five dimensions, which could describe qualitative properties of microstate geometries for astrophysical black holes. This is the first step towards studying extreme mass-ratio inspirals around these objects. We show that when the particle probes the spacetime close to the object, the scalar-wave flux deviates significantly from the corresponding black hole case. Furthermore, as the topological star approaches the black-hole limit, the inspiral can resonantly excite its long-lived modes, resulting in sharp features in the emitted flux. Although such resonances are too narrow to produce detectable dephasing, we estimate that a year-long inspiral down to the innermost stable circular orbit could accumulate a significant dephasing for most configurations relative to the black hole case. While a full parameter-estimation analysis is needed, the generically large deviations are likely to be within the sensitivity reach of future space-based gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Conformal compactification and affine-null metric formulation of the Einstein equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In principle, global properties of solution of Einstein equations need to be addressed using the conformal Einstein equations, because this conformal compactification allows a clean definition of the `infinities' (spacelike, timelike and null infinity) of General Relativity. However, in numerical calculations often compactified coordinates in the physical space are used to reach these infinities. In this note, we discuss the conformal Einstein equations in spherical symmetry coupled to a massless scalar field and compare them with corresponding equations using a compactified coordinate in physical spacetime. The derivation of the field equations is based on metrics, in which the radial coordinate is an affine parameter along outgoing null rays. We show that the conformal equations within an affine-null metric formulation can be cast in a natural hierarchical form after the introduction of suitable auxiliary fields. The system of partial differential equations associated with the resulting (unphysical) conformal field equations proves to be identical to a system that employs a compactified coordinate in physical space along with well-constructed regularized fields. The reason for this equivalence is the introduction of new regularized fields in the physical spacetime after coordinate compactification to obtain a regular system of equations on the complete domain of the compactified coordinate. As part of this work, we also present the solution of the conformal field equations in affine-null coordinates near the conformal boundary, where the Bondi mass loss formula for a massless scalar field is recovered. The validity of the balance law of the mass loss at null infinity is demonstrated numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the kinetic properties of collisionless Vlasov gas in the Kerr-Newman spacetime, focusing on how the spacetime symmetries constrain the distribution functions. By establishing the general relationship between the distribution functions and the constants of motion (mass $m$, energy $E$, angular momentum $L_z$, Carter constant $L$) along with $L$'s conjugate configuration variable $Q^{3}$, we derive the analytical framework for particle dynamics in stationary axisymmetric spacetimes. Within the Locally Non-Rotating Frame, we compute key observables -- the particle number density, the energy density, the principal pressures, and the accretion rates -- resolving coordinate divergences near the event horizon through geometric rescaling. For a plasma obeying the J\"uttner distribution, asymptotic expressions at spatial infinity are explicitly calculated. Numerical analyses reveal: (1) the mass and energy accretion rates exhibit nearly identical parametric dependencies on the black hole parameters; (2) extremal Kerr-Newman black holes show monotonic enhancement in the mass, energy, and angular momentum accretion rates with increasing $a$, contrasting with the Kerr black hole behavior. These results provide new insights into accretion mechanisms in extreme spacetime geometries.</description>

      <title>Gravitational radiation at infinity with negative cosmological constant and AdS$_4$ holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The covariant characterization of the existence of gravitational radiation traversing infinity $\mathscr{J}$ in the presence of a negative cosmological constant is presented. It is coherent and consistent with the previous characterizations put forward for the cases of non-negative cosmological constant, relying on the properties of the asymptotic super-Poynting vector; or in more transparent terms, based on the intrinsic properties of the flux of tidal energy at infinity. The proposed characterization is fully satisfactory, it can be covariantly typified in terms of boundary data at infinity, and it can also be categorized according to the geometric properties of the rescaled Weyl tensor at $\mathscr{J}$. The cases with no incoming radiation entering from (or no outgoing radiation escaping at) $\mathscr{J}$ can similarly be determined in terms of the boundary data or geometric properties of the rescaled Weyl tensor. In particular, we identify the most general boundary conditions that, in an initial-boundary value problem, ensure absence of gravitational radiation traversing $\mathscr{J}$: linear dependency between the Cotton-York tensor and the holographic stress tensor at $\mathscr{J}$. We also present novel conditions ensuring the absence of just incoming (outgoing) radiation at $\mathscr{J}$. These are given in a covariant way and also in terms of standard rescaled Weyl tensor scalars.</description>

      <title>Long-lived neutron-star remnants from asymmetric binary neutron star mergers: element formation, kilonova signals and gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present 3D general-relativistic neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics simulations of two asymmetric binary neutron star mergers producing long-lived neutron stars remnants and spanning a fraction of their cooling time scale. The mergers are characterized by significant tidal disruption with neutron rich material forming a massive disc around the remnant. The latter develops one-armed dynamics that is imprinted in the emitted kilo-Hertz gravitational waves. Angular momentum transport to the disc is initially driven by spiral-density waves and enhanced by turbulent viscosity and neutrino heating on longer timescales. The mass outflows are composed by neutron-rich dynamical ejecta of mass ${\sim}10^{-3}-10^{-2}M_\odot$ followed by a persistent spiral-wave/neutrino-driven wind of ${\gtrsim}10^{-2}M_\odot$ with material spanning a wide range of electron fractions, ${\sim}0.1-0.55$. Dynamical ejecta (winds) have fast velocity tails up to ${\sim}0.8$ (${\sim}0.4$) c. The outflows are further evolved to days timescale using 2D ray-by-ray radiation-hydrodynamics simulations that include an online nuclear network. We find complete $r$-process yields and identify the production of $^{56}$Ni and the subsequent decay chain to $^{56}$Co and $^{56}$Fe. Synthetic kilonova light curves predict an extended (near-) infrared peak a few days postmerger originating from $r$-process in the neutron-rich/high-opacity ejecta and UV/optical peaks at a few hours (ten minutes) postmerger originating from weak $r$-process (free-neutron decay) in the faster ejecta components. Additionally, the fast tail of tidal origin generates kilonova afterglows potentially detectable in radio and X band on a few to ten years time scale. Quantitative effects originating from the tidal disruption merger dynamics are reflected in the multimessenger emissions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Particles Produced from Bubble Collisions in First-Order Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a new source of gravitational waves (GWs) from first-order phase transitions. The collisions of bubbles of the new phase can efficiently produce particles that couple to the background field undergoing the transition, thereby transferring a significant fraction of the released vacuum energy into a distribution of inhomogeneous and dynamic particle populations that persist long after the bubbles have disappeared. We study the GWs produced by such particle distributions, showing that GWs arise from the quadrupolar anisotropy in the radiation emitted from the bubble collisions, and present a semi-analytical calculation of the two-point correlation function for the associated energy distributions. We find that this new contribution can qualitatively modify the overall GW signal from such phase transitions, creating a distinct shift in the spectral slope at low frequencies that could be observed by future GW experiments. It is therefore important to take this new contribution into account for any transition where the background field has significant self-coupling or couplings to other fields that could lead to efficient particle production at bubble collision.</description>

      <title>Constraints from Entanglement Wedge Nesting for Holography at a Finite Cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore constraints that arise from associating an entanglement wedge (EW) to subregions of a cutoff boundary at a finite distance in AdS/CFT, using a subcritical end-of-the-world (ETW) brane acting as a cutoff. In particular, we consider the case of two intervals in the holographic dual to a BCFT, with one interval $A$ located at the asymptotic boundary and the second interval $B$ located on the ETW brane. We discuss in detail subtleties that arise near the RT end-points when defining the EW for this configuration, particularly in the connected phase. Entanglement wedge nesting (EWN) requires that $\mathcal{W}_E(A) \cup \mathcal{W}_E(B) \subseteq \mathcal{W}_E(A\cup B)$. We demonstrate that already in the simplest example of an AdS$_3$ bulk geometry, EWN can be violated even if $A$ and $B$ are spacelike separated through the bulk and instead we must require the stronger condition that $\mathcal{W}_E(A)$ be spacelike separated from $\mathcal{W}_E(B)$, which highlights the non-local nature of the cutoff theory. Our prescription to associate EWs to subregions on the ETW brane is different from the restricted maximin procedure in arXiv:2008.07022 but will agree within the subset of parameter space where EWN is respected. Additionally, we study EWN in a two sided BTZ black hole geometry with an ETW brane in one of the exteriors. In the BTZ black hole example we find that our condition for EWN disallows configurations where the RT surface goes from the brane to the black hole singularity.</description>

      <title>Probing the self-coherence of primordial quantum fluctuations with complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A smoking gun for our current paradigm of the early universe would be direct evidence for the quantum mechanical origin of density perturbations which are conjectured to seed the large scale structure of our universe. A recently-proposed novel phenomenon is that of recoherence, wherein a specific interaction between the adiabatic and the entropic sector leads to the adiabatic mode retaining a coherent state after a transient increase in linear entropy. In this paper, we choose the most general Gaussian action and analyze the evolution of linear entropy, complexity of purification (COP), and complexity of formation (COF) to capture the interplay between decoherence and recoherence in this model. In the presence of two types of couplings that drive these two opposing characteristics, we highlight how COF is an efficient tool for diagnosing dynamics for such an open quantum system.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave lensing: probing Fuzzy Dark Matter with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10758v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing is a universal phenomenon: it affects both gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic signals travelling through the gravitational field of a massive object. In this work, we explore the prospects of observing lensed GW signals from the mergers of massive black holes, lensed by dark matter halos composed of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM), which form dense cores known as solitons. We focus on wave optics phenomena, where frequency-dependent signatures can be observed in the weak lensing regime (i.e. single-image). Our results show that lensing diffraction signatures differ for low-mass halos in FDM, and can reveal the presence of a solitonic core. Furthermore, we demonstrate that FDM and cold dark matter profiles can be distinguished in GW signals from binary massive black hole mergers, which will be observed by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. However, the dense solitonic core does not substantially enhance the detectability of FDM halos at large source-lens offsets, relative to standard cold dark matter. Our analysis confirms FDM halos as a promising signature of dark matter on GW observations.</description>

      <title>Causal Structure of Higher Curvature Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16527v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the causal structure of Generalized Quadratic Gravity (GQG) and Einsteinian Cubic Gravity (ECG). It is well known that gravitons in higher-curvature theories can exhibit superluminal propagation, rendering the conventional definition of causal structures based on null curves inadequate. Instead, the causal structure must be defined using the fastest propagating modes, which travel along characteristic surfaces. The superluminal propagation in higher-curvature theories has significant implications for black holes. Specifically, if the Killing horizon of a black hole is not a characteristic surface corresponding to the fastest propagating mode, the horizon can no longer function as a causal barrier. Our analysis demonstrates that GQG with a genuine fourth-order equation of motion possesses only null characteristics, implying that the horizon is a characteristic surface. Furthermore, we perform a detailed characteristic analysis of ECG. We show that while all null surfaces are characteristic surfaces in ECG, the converse is not true - there exist non-null characteristic surfaces. In particular, we identify a non-null characteristic surface in a Type N spacetime in the algebraic classification of spacetimes. Despite the existence of multiple characteristic surfaces in ECG, we establish that the black hole horizon remains a characteristic surface.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial constitutive laws and unified structures in constrained BF theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Does a nontrivial gravitational excitation require a modified internal gauge theory constitutive law? As there is no canonical mapping between differential forms valued in distinct Lie algebras, the answer is negative, and entirely dependent on the specific unification scheme. A structural formulation in BF theory in terms of a constitutive diagram between the excitations of different interaction sectors is provided, alongside a discussion of the structure of the broken phase. As a nontrivial option, a "spontaneous" breaking into the physical constraint is attempted, however it is shown that basic B-potentials alone would not be viable. A heuristic discussion of internal gauge theory and gravity is provided, and by conflating the observer's internal and external state with the spacetime tangent structure, it is argued that there is a simple geometric obstruction to a nontrivially unified phase. A more ad hoc treatment of gauge theory and gravitational structure remains as the clear path forward, while observer, signal and causal considerations would suggest studying alternative backgrounds to the manifold topology.</description>

      <title>Hollow-grams: Generalized Entanglement Wedges from the Gravitational Path Integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10064v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Bousso and Penington (BP) made a proposal for the entanglement wedge associated to a gravitating bulk region. In this paper, we derive this proposal in time-reflection symmetric settings using the gravitational path integral. To do this, we exploit the connection between random tensor networks (RTNs) and fixed-geometry states in gravity. We define the entropy of a bulk region in an RTN by removing tensors in that region and computing the entropy of the open legs thus generated in the "hollowed" RTN. We thus derive the BP proposal for RTNs and hence, also for fixed-geometry states in gravity. By then expressing a general holographic state as a superposition over fixed-geometry states and using a diagonal approximation, we provide a general gravitational path integral derivation of the BP proposal. We demonstrate that the saddles computing the R\'enyi entropy $S_n$ depend on how the bulk region is gauge-invariantly specified. Nevertheless, we show that the BP proposal is universally reproduced in the $n\to1$ limit.</description>

      <title>Spinning the Probe in Kerr with WQFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational scattering of a spinning probe mass in a Kerr background using the worldline quantum field theory (WQFT) approach. This corresponds to the leading term (0SF) in the gravitational self-force expansion for the spinning two-body problem with large mass hierarchy. By reformulating the geodesic and Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations as a recursive Berends-Giele type equation known from multi-gluon scattering, we develop a novel integration-by-parts formalism on the worldline that enables systematic computation of scattering observables - specifically the impulse and spin kick - to arbitrary orders in Newton's constant and spin. Here, the transition to a position space formalism is key. We present explicit results up to and including the physical 7PM order, thereby incorporating all relevant higher-spin and higher-curvature terms on the worldline, advancing beyond previous calculations. This work represents an initial step to reconceptualise the gravitational self-force expansion through worldline quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic Unified Field Theory of Gravity and the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a holomorphic framework in which gravity, gauge interactions, and their couplings to charges and currents emerge from a single geometric action on a four-complex-dimensional manifold. The Hermitian metric yields on the real slice $y^\mu = 0$, a real symmetric metric $g_{(\mu \nu)}$ giving the vacuum Einstein equations, and an antisymmetric part $g_{[\mu \nu]}$ that reproduces Maxwell's equations with sources. A single holomorphic gauge connection for $G_{\text{GUT}}$, such as $SU(5)$ or $SO(10)$, encodes all gauge sectors; its Bianchi identities give homogeneous Yang--Mills equations, and variation imposes $\nabla_\mu F^{\mu \nu}_A = J^\nu_A$. Chiral fermions arise from a holomorphic Dirac Lagrangian and couple minimally to all gauge fields, reproducing the Standard Model spectrum. Anomaly cancellation follows from holomorphic gauge invariance. A holomorphic adjoint Higgs breaks $G_{\text{GUT}} \rightarrow SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ with unified coupling, and a second Higgs breaks electroweak symmetry, generating $W^\pm$, $Z$, and fermion masses. Below the unification scale, couplings run by standard renormalization-group flow. This construction unifies Einstein gravity, Yang--Mills theory, electromagnetism, and chiral fermions into a single classical geometric framework, and admits quantization via a holomorphic path integral that reproduces standard Feynman rules.</description>

      <title>A pipeline to search for signatures of line-of-sight acceleration in gravitational wave signals produced by compact binary coalescences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compact binary coalescences (CBCs), such as merging binary black holes (BBHs), binary neutron stars (BNSs), or neutron star black holes (NSBHs), hosted by dense stellar environments, could produce gravitational waves (GWs) that contain signatures of line-of-sight acceleration (LOSA) imparted by the environment's gravitational potential. We calculate the Post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the $(2,\,2)$ mode GW phase due to a finite LOSA, starting from the leading order at -4 PN below the quadrupole order, up to 3.5 PN above the quadrupole order. We do so for binaries whose component spins are aligned with the orbital angular momentum, as well as for binaries with non-zero tidal deformation. We implement these corrections into the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) collaboration's flagship parameter estimation (PE) software \textsc{Bilby\_tgr}. We study the systematics associated with recovering LOSAs. We find that, when the injection and recovery waveform models are identical, LOSAs are recovered as expected. We test the robustness of the pipeline against waveforms with strong higher-mode signatures or signatures of beyond-general-relativistic (beyond-GR) effects, to delimit the range of applicability of our GR-consistent quasi-circular LOSA-corrected waveforms.</description>

      <title>Freeze-In Dark Matter and Leptogenesis: a $\psi'$SM route</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of \emph{freeze-in} dark matter production and baryogenesis via leptogenesis in a $\psi'$SM model, which is an $E_6$ extension of the Standard Model, featuring a residual $U(1)_{\psi'}$ gauge symmetry. This symmetry arises from a linear combination of $U(1)\chi$ and $U(1)_{\psi}$, both of which are subgroups of the $E_6$. The spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_{\psi'}$ symmetry governs the dynamics of a singlet fermion, which naturally serves as a freeze-in dark matter candidate. The dark matter mass arises from dimension-five operators, and a discrete symmetry ensures their stability. We show that freeze-in production from scalar decay can yield the correct relic abundance for dark matter masses between a few MeV to a few hundred GeV. Simultaneously, heavy right-handed neutrinos generate light neutrino masses via the type-I seesaw and produce the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis.</description>
