      <title>Folded State Dynamics -- A Geometric and Deterministic Origin of Irreversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of irreversibility in isolated, deterministic systems remains a central challenge in statistical mechanics. Traditional approaches, such as Boltzmann's H-theorem and Lanford's derivation of the Boltzmann equation, rely on probabilistic assumptions and are limited to dilute gases and short timescales. We introduce Folded State Dynamics (FSD), a framework in which irreversibility arises from the geometric structure of phase space in systems with coupled rotational and translational degrees of freedom. In contrast to conventional models with unfolded, weakly coupled modes, FSD exhibits phase space folding, where deterministic coupling induces instability and chaotic mixing. We show that equilibrium states exponentially dominate the accessible phase space volume, while constrained configurations (e.g., pure rotation) occupy measure-zero subsets. This yields a geometric derivation of entropy growth, with reversal probabilities suppressed as Prev and recurrence times Trec, resolving Loschmidt's and Zermelo's objections without coarse-graining or fine-tuning. FSD is further extended to include charged systems (cFSD), where electromagnetic interactions continuously drive phase space folding. FSD thus offers a deterministic and testable mechanism for irreversibility, with implications ranging from confined colloids to the cosmological arrow of time</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Variational Principle Unifying Gravity and Heat Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the stable phase configuration in a liquid-gas system becomes a fundamental challenge when the stratification favored by gravity conflicts with arrangements induced by heat flow, particularly because standard equilibrium thermodynamics is insufficient in such non-equilibrium steady states. We propose a variational principle based on an extended thermodynamics, called global thermodynamics, to address this state selection problem. Our key finding is that gravity and heat flow effects are unified into a single parameter, ``effective gravity'' ($g_\mathrm{eff}$), within this framework. Crucially, the sign of $g_\mathrm{eff}$ determines the stable configuration: liquid is at the bottom if $g_\mathrm{eff} &gt; 0$, and floats above the gas if $g_\mathrm{eff} &lt; 0$. This provides a quantitative tool for the configuration prediction under competing drives.</description>

      <title>Inferring entropy production in many-body systems using nonequilibrium MaxEnt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for inferring entropy production (EP) in high-dimensional stochastic systems, including many-body systems and non-Markovian systems with long memory. Standard techniques for estimating EP become intractable in such systems due to computational and statistical limitations. We infer trajectory-level EP and lower bounds on average EP by exploiting a nonequilibrium analogue of the Maximum Entropy principle, along with convex duality. Our approach uses only samples of trajectory observables (such as spatiotemporal correlation functions). It does not require reconstruction of high-dimensional probability distributions or rate matrices, nor any special assumptions such as discrete states or multipartite dynamics. It may be used to compute a hierarchical decomposition of EP, reflecting contributions from different kinds of interactions, and it has an intuitive physical interpretation as a thermodynamic uncertainty relation. We demonstrate its numerical performance on a disordered nonequilibrium spin model with 1000 spins and a large neural spike-train dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networked SIR models have become essential workhorses in the modeling of epidemics, their inception, propagation and control. Here, and building on this venerable tradition, we report on the emergence of a remarkable self-organization of infectiousness in the wake of a propagating disease front. It manifests as a cascading power-law distribution of disease strength in networked SIR simulations, and is then confirmed with suitably defined kinetics, then stochastic modeling of surveillance data. Given the success of the networked SIR models which brought it to light, we expect this scale-invariant feature to be of universal significance, characterizing the evolution of disease within and across transportation networks, informing the design of control strategies, and providing a litmus test for the soundness of disease propagation models.</description>

      <title>Topology and the Conformal Invariance of Nodal Lines in Two-Dimensional Active Scalar Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inverse cascade in two-dimensional hydrodynamic turbulence exhibits a mysterious phenomenon. Numerical simulations have shown that the nodal isolines of certain scalars actively transported in the flow (eg, the vorticity in Navier-Stokes theory) obey Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE), which indicates the presence of conformal invariance. Therefore, these turbulent isolines are somehow in the same class as cluster boundaries in equilibrium statistical mechanical models at criticality, such as critical percolation. In this paper, we propose that the inverse cascade is characterized by a local energy (or in some cases, enstrophy) flux field that spontaneously breaks time reversal invariance. The turbulent state consists of random constant flux domains, with the nodal isolines acting as domain walls where the local flux vanishes. The generalized circulation of the domains is proportional to a topological winding number. We argue that these turbulent states are gapped states, in analogy with quantum Hall systems. The turbulent flow consists of many strongly coupled vortices that are analogous to quasi-particles. The nodal isolines are associated with the gapless topological degrees of freedom in the flow, where scale invariance is enhanced to conformal invariance. We introduce a concrete model of this behavior using a two-dimensional effective theory involving the canonical Clebsch scalars. This theory has patch solutions that exhibit power law scaling. The fractional winding number associated with the patches can be related to the Kolmogorov-Kraichnan scaling dimension of the corresponding fluid theory. We argue that the fully developed inverse cascade is a scale invariant gas of these patches. This theory has a conformally invariant sector described by a Liouville conformal field theory whose central charge is fixed by the fractional winding number.</description>

      <title>Defect Conformal Manifolds from Phantom (Non-Invertible) Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a general mechanism that allows (1+1)d CFTs to have interesting interface conformal manifolds even in the absence of any continuous internal symmetry or supersymmetry. This is made possible by the breaking of an enhanced continuous symmetry, which is generically non-invertible, arising in the folded theory. We provide several examples and showcase the power of the symmetry-based approach by computing the evolution of the reflection coefficient along the defect conformal manifold. We also discuss higher-dimensional generalizations and we comment on no-go theorems.</description>

      <title>Euler topology in classical spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical spin liquids have recently been analyzed in view of the single-gap homotopy classification of their dispersive eigenvectors. We show that the recent progress in defining multi-gap topologies, notably exemplified by the Euler class, can be naturally included in these homotopy-based classification schemes and present phases that change topology by band node braiding. This process alters the topology of the pinch points in the spin structure factor and consequently their stability. Furthermore, we discuss how these notions also pertain to models discussed previously in the literature and have a broader range of application beyond our specific results. Our work thus opens up an uncharted avenue in the understanding of spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Complexity transitions in chaotic quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex quantum systems -- composed of many, interacting particles -- are intrinsically difficult to model. When a quantum many-body system is subject to disorder, it can undergo transitions to regimes with varying non-ergodic and localized behavior, which can significantly reduce the number of relevant basis states. It remains an open question whether such transitions are also directly related to an abrupt change in the system's complexity. In this work, we study the transition from chaotic to integrable phases in several paradigmatic models, the power-law random banded matrix model, the Rosenzweig--Porter model, and a hybrid SYK+Ising model, comparing three complementary complexity markers -- fractal dimension, von Neumann entanglement entropy, and stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. For all three markers, finite-size scaling reveals sharp transitions between high- and low-complexity regimes, which, however, can occur at different critical points. As a consequence, while in the ergodic and localized regimes the markers align, they diverge significantly in the presence of an intermediate fractal phase. Additionally, our analysis reveals that the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy is more sensitive to underlying many-body symmetries, such as fermion parity and time reversal, than the other markers. As our results show, different markers capture complementary facets of complexity, making it necessary to combine them to obtain a comprehensive diagnosis of phase transitions. The divergence between different complexity markers also has significant consequences for the classical simulability of chaotic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic contribution to bosonic thermal Hall transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bosonic excitations like phonons and magnons dominate the low-temperature transport of magnetic insulators. Similar to electronic Hall responses, the thermal Hall effect (THE) of charge neutral bosons has been proposed as a powerful tool for probing topological properties of their wavefunctions. For example, the intrinsic contribution of the THE of a perfectly clean system is directly governed by the distribution of Berry curvature, and many experiments on topological magnon and phonon insulators have been interpreted in this way. However, disorder is inevitably present in any material and its contribution to the THE has remained poorly understood. Here we develop a rigorous kinetic theory of the extrinsic side-jump contribution to the THE of bosons. We show that the extrinsic THE can be of the same order as the intrinsic one but sensitively depends on the type of local imperfection. We study different types of impurities and show that a THE can even arise as a pure impurity-induced effect in a system with a vanishing intrinsic contribution. As a side product, we also generalize existing results for the electronic AHE to general types of impurities beyond the standard assumption of local potential scattering. We discuss the importance of our results for the correct interpretation of THE measurements.</description>

      <title>A Generative Neural Annealer for Black-Box Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a generative, end-to-end solver for black-box combinatorial optimization that emphasizes both sample efficiency and solution quality on NP problems. Drawing inspiration from annealing-based algorithms, we treat the black-box objective as an energy function and train a neural network to model the associated Boltzmann distribution. By conditioning on temperature, the network captures a continuum of distributions--from near-uniform at high temperatures to sharply peaked around global optima at low temperatures--thereby learning the structure of the energy landscape and facilitating global optimization. When queries are expensive, the temperature-dependent distributions naturally enable data augmentation and improve sample efficiency. When queries are cheap but the problem remains hard, the model learns implicit variable interactions, effectively "opening" the black box. We validate our approach on challenging combinatorial tasks under both limited and unlimited query budgets, showing competitive performance against state-of-the-art black-box optimizers.</description>

      <title>Hidden Bose-Einstein Singularities in Correlated Electron Systems: II. Pseudogap Phase in the Weakly Attractive Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hidden Bose-Einstein singularities of correlated electron systems, whose possible existence has been pointed out in a previous paper based on quantum field theory of ordered phases [T. Kita, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. {\bf 93}, 124704 (2024)], are studied in more detail in terms of the attractive Hubbard model, for which the mean-field theory predicts that spin-singlet superconductivity is realized at low enough temperatures for any band structure and interaction strength. It is shown that incorporating correlation effects should change the mean-field superconducting solution substantially and qualitatively even in the weak coupling, implying that the system lies in the strong-coupling region perturbatively. The hidden singularity is found to be present around the mean-field superconducting temperature $T_{{\rm c}0}$, below which the standard self-consistent treatment by quantum field theory cannot be used due to divergences in the zero Matsubara frequency branch obeying Bose-Einstein statistics. Our method to recover the applicability with a Lagrange multiplier predicts that the singularity is a physical entity signaling the threshold of a pseudogap phase with a characteristic V-shape structure in the density of states near zero energy, which lies above the superconducting phase and originates from the emerging one-particle-reducible structure in the self-energy.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations without quantum corrections: A coherent-incoherent correspondence approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the coherent-incoherent correspondence as a framework for deriving quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations under continuous measurement in Lindblad dynamics. The coherent-incoherent correspondence establishes a mapping between the original quantum system with coherent evolution and a corresponding incoherent system without coherent dynamics. The coherent-incoherent correspondence relates quantities across these two systems, including jump statistics, dynamical activity, and entropy production. Since the classical-like properties of the incoherent system allow us to derive thermodynamic uncertainty relations in the incoherent system, we can transfer the relations from the incoherent to the coherent system via the coherent-incoherent correspondence. This enables the derivation of quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations for the original coherent system. Unlike existing quantum uncertainty relations, which typically include explicit quantum correction terms, our approach avoids these additional terms. This framework provides a general approach to deriving trade-offs in quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Extreme Synchronization Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Across natural and human-made systems, transition points mark sudden changes of order and are thus key to understanding overarching system features. Motivated by recent experimental observations, we here uncover an intriguing class of transitions in coupled oscillators, extreme synchronization transitions, from asynchronous disordered states to synchronous states with almost completely ordered phases. Whereas such a transition appears like discontinuous or explosive phase transitions, it exhibits markedly distinct features. First, the transition occurs already in finite systems of $N$ units and so constitutes an intriguing bifurcation of multi-dimensional systems rather than a genuine phase transition that emerges in the thermodynamic limit $N\rightarrow \infty$ only. Second, the synchronization order parameter jumps from moderate values of the order of $N^{-1/2}$ to values extremely close to $1$, its theoretical maximum, immediately upon crossing a critical coupling strength. We analytically explain the mechanisms underlying such extreme transitions in coupled complexified Kuramoto oscillators. Extreme transitions may similarly occur across other systems of coupled oscillators as well as in certain percolation processes. In applications, their occurrence impacts our ability of ensuring or preventing strong forms of ordering, for instance in biological and engineered systems.</description>

      <title>High-performance local automaton decoders for defect matching in 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local automaton decoders offer a promising path toward real-time quantum error correction by replacing centralized classical decoding, with inherent hardware constraints, by a natively parallel and streamlined architecture from a simple local transition rule. We propose two new types of local decoders for the quantum repetition code in one dimension. The signal-rule decoders interpret odd parities between neighboring qubits as defects, attracted to each other via the exchange of classical point-like excitations, represented by a few bits of local memory. We prove the existence of a threshold in the code-capacity model and present numerical evidence of exponential logical error suppression under a phenomenological noise model, with data and measurement errors at each error correction cycle. Compared to previously known local decoders that suffer from sub-optimal threshold and scaling, our construction significantly narrows the gap with global decoders for practical system sizes and error rates. Implementation requirements can be further reduced by eliminating the need for local classical memories, with a new rule defined on two rows of qubits. This shearing-rule works well at relevant system sizes making it an appealing short-term solution. When combined with biased-noise qubits, such as cat qubits, these decoders enable a fully local quantum memory in one dimension.</description>

Abstract: We predict the existence of two tri-critical quantum Lifshitz points in recently discovered $d$-wave altermagnetic metals subjected to an external magnetic field. These points connect a spatially modulated Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase, a uniform polarized Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer (BCS) superconducting phase, and the normal metallic phase in a nontrivial manner. Depending on whether the FFLO state is primarily induced by the magnetic field or by $d$-wave altermagnetism, we classify the corresponding Lifshitz points as field-driven or altermagnetism-driven, respectively. Notably, the two types exhibit distinct behaviors: the transition from the FFLO phase to the polarized BCS phase is first-order near the field-driven Lifshitz point, as might be expected, whereas it becomes continuous near the altermagnetism-driven Lifshitz point. We further explore the effects of finite temperature and find that the altermagnetism-driven Lifshitz point is significantly more sensitive to thermal fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Computer simulations show that liquid-liquid phase separation enhances self-assembly</title>

Abstract: Biomolecular condensates are liquid- or gel-like droplets of proteins and nucleic acids formed at least in part through liquid-liquid phase separation. Condensates enable diverse functions of cells and the pathogens that infect them, including self-assembly reactions. For example, it has been shown that many viruses form condensates within their host cells to compartmentalize capsid assembly and packaging of the viral genome. Yet, the physical principles controlling condensate-mediated self-assembly remain incompletely understood. In this article we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect of a condensate on the assembly of icosahedral capsids. The capsid subunits are represented by simple shape-based models to enable simulating a wide range of length and time scales, while the condensate is modeled implicitly to study the effects of phase separation independent of the molecular details of biomolecular condensates. Our results show that condensates can significantly enhance assembly rates, yields, and robustness to parameter variations, consistent with previous theoretical predictions. However, extending beyond those predictions, the computational models also show that excluded volume enables control over the number of capsids that assemble within condensates. Moreover, long-lived aberrant off-pathway assembly intermediates can suppress yields within condensates. In addition to elucidating condensate-mediated assembly of viruses and other biological structures, these results may guide the use of condensates as a generic route to enhance and control self-assembly in human-engineered systems.</description>

      <title>Weighted Active Space Protocol for Multireference Machine-Learned Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multireference methods such as multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT) offer an effective means of capturing electronic correlation in systems with significant multiconfigurational character. However, their application to train machine learning-based interatomic potentials (MLPs) for catalytic dynamics has been challenging due to the sensitivity of multireference calculations to the underlying active space, which complicates achieving consistent energies and gradients across diverse nuclear configurations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Weighted Active-Space Protocol (WASP), a systematic approach to assign a consistent active space for a given system across uncorrelated configurations. By integrating WASP with MLPs and enhanced sampling techniques, we propose a data-efficient active learning cycle that enables the training of an MLP on multireference data. We demonstrate the method on the TiC+-catalyzed C-H activation of methane, a reaction that poses challenges for Kohn-Sham density functional theory due to its significant multireference character. This framework enables accurate and efficient modeling of catalytic dynamics, establishing a new paradigm for simulating complex reactive processes beyond the limits of conventional electronic-structure methods.</description>

      <title>Observing Bethe strings in an attractive Bose gas far from equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bethe strings are bound states of constituent particles in a variety of interacting many-body one-dimensional (1D) integrable quantum models relevant to magnetism, nanophysics, cold atoms and beyond. As emergent fundamental excitations, they are predicted to collectively reshape observable equilibrium and dynamical properties. Small individual Bethe strings have recently been observed in quantum magnets and superconducting qubits. However, creating states featuring intermixtures of many, including large, strings remains an outstanding experimental challenge. Here, using nearly integrable ultracold Bose gases, we realize such intermixtures of Bethe strings out of equilibrium, by dynamically tuning interactions from repulsive to attractive. We measure the average binding energy of the strings, revealing the presence of bound states of more than six particles. We find further evidence for them in the momentum distribution and in Tan's contact, connected to the correlated density. Our data quantitatively agree with predictions from generalized hydrodynamics (GHD). Manipulating intermixtures of Bethe strings opens new avenues for understanding quantum coherence, nonlinear dynamics and thermalization in strongly-interacting 1D systems.</description>

      <title>On the definition of heat current for periodic systems and its implications for simulations of thermal conductivity in solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.05196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We re-derive the expression for the heat current for a classical system subject to periodic boundary conditions and show that it can be written as a sum of two terms. The first term is a time derivative of the first moment of the system energy density while the second term is expressed through the energy transfer rate through the periodic boundary. We show that in solids the second term alone leads to the same thermal conductivity as the full expression for the heat current when used in the Green-Kubo approach. More generally, energy passing though any surface formed by translation of the original periodic boundary can be used to calculate thermal conductivity. These statements are verified for two systems: crystalline argon and crystals of argon and krypton forming an interface.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of Histories: Chaotic Versus Integrable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the emergence of decoherent histories in isolated systems based on exact numerical integration of the Schr\"odinger equation for a Heisenberg chain. We reveal that the nature of the system, which we switch from (i) chaotic to (ii) interacting integrable to (iii) non-interacting integrable, strongly impacts decoherence \new{of coarse spin observables}. From a finite size scaling law we infer a strong exponential suppression of coherences for (i), a weak exponential suppression for (ii) and no exponential suppression for (iii) on a relevant short (nonequilibrium) time scale. Moreover, for longer times we find stronger decoherence for (i) but the opposite for (ii), hinting even at a possible power-law decay for (ii) at equilibrium time scales. This behaviour is encoded in the multi-time properties of the quantum histories and it can not be explained by environmentally induced decoherence. Our results suggest that chaoticity plays a crucial role in the emergence of classicality in finite size systems.</description>

      <title>Localization transitions in quadratic systems without quantum chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transitions from delocalized to localized eigenstates have been extensively studied in both quadratic and interacting models. The delocalized regime typically exhibits diffusion and quantum chaos, and its properties comply with the random matrix theory (RMT) predictions. However, it is also known that in certain quadratic models, the delocalization in position space is not accompanied by the single-particle quantum chaos. Here, we study the one-dimensional Anderson and Wannier-Stark models that exhibit eigenstate transitions from localization in quasimomentum space (supporting ballistic transport) to localization in position space (with no transport) in a nonstandard thermodynamic limit, which assumes rescaling the model parameters with the system size. We show that the transition point may exhibit an unconventional character of Janus type, i.e., some measures hint at the RMT-like universality emerging at the transition point, while others depart from it. For example, the eigenstate entanglement entropies may exhibit, depending on the bipartition, a volume-law behavior that either approaches the value of Haar-random Gaussian states, or converges to a lower, non-universal value. Our results hint at rich diversity of volume-law eigenstate entanglement entropies in quadratic systems that are not maximally entangled.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05231v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a classical kinetically constrained model of interacting particles on a triangular ladder, which displays diffusion and jamming and can be treated by means of a classical-quantum mapping. Interpreted as a theory of interacting fermions, the diffusion coefficient is the inverse of the effective mass of the quasiparticles which can be computed using mean-field theory. At a critical density \r{ho} = 2/3, the model undergoes a dynamical phase transition in which exponentially many configurations become jammed while others remain diffusive. The model can be generalized to two dimensions.</description>

      <title>First passage time properties of diffusion with a broad class of stochastic diffusion coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion in a heterogeneous environment or diffusion of a particle that shows conformational fluctuations can be described by Brownian motions with stochastic diffusion coefficients (DCs). In the present study, we investigate first passage time (FPT) properties of diffusion with a broad class of stochastic DCs that are positive and non-zero. We show that for diffusion in one-dimensional semi-infinite domain with an absorbing boundary, the eventual absorption is certain. We also show that compared to diffusion whose DC is the ensemble average of a stochastic DC, in diffusion with the stochastic DC, there are particles that reach the absorbing boundary earlier. The approximate proportion of preceding particles is determined by the probability distribution of the time average of a stochastic DC for a given distance to the absorbing boundary. In addition, when particles begin to reach the absorbing boundary before the time change in a stochastic DC occurs, a stochastic DC with a larger supremum leads to an earlier arrival of particles at the absorbing boundary even if the ensemble averages of stochastic DCs are the same. For ergodic DCs, three more properties are revealed. The mean FPT is infinite. In addition, if particles take a long time to reach the absorbing boundary, the exact proportion of preceding particles is almost zero and the FPT distribution can be approximated by the L\'evy-Smirnov distribution. We show that these three properties of diffusion with an ergodic DC result from the convergence of the time average of the DC to the ensemble average. For three-dimensional diffusion with a spherical absorbing boundary, we obtain essentially the same results, except that the eventual absorption is not certain. Our results suggest that fluctuations in a DC play an important role in diffusion-limited reactions triggered by single molecules in physics, chemistry, or biology.</description>

Abstract: When nanoparticles (NPs) are introduced into a biological solution, layers of biomolecules form on their surface, creating a corona. Understanding how the structure of the protein evolves into the corona is essential for evaluating the safety and toxicity of nanotechnology. However, the influence of NP properties on protein conformation is not well understood. In this study, we propose a new method that addresses this issue by analyzing multi-component spectral data using Machine Learning (ML). We apply the method to fibrinogen, a crucial protein in human blood plasma, at physiological concentrations while interacting with hydrophobic carbon or hydrophilic silicon dioxide NPs, revealing striking differences in the temperature dependence of the protein structure between the two cases. Our unsupervised ML method a) does not suffer from the challenges associated with the curse of dimensionality, and b) simultaneously handles spectral data from various sources. The method offers a quantitative analysis of protein structural changes upon adsorption and enhances the understanding of the correlation between protein structure and NP interactions, which could support the development of nanomedical tools to treat various conditions.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Thermalization in the Two-Site SYK and SYK Chain Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.05291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent study of R\'enyi entanglement entropy in the SYK chain of Majorana fermions suggested that the model does not rapidly thermalize, despite being maximally chaotic. In this work, I examine the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) for both the SYK chain and the two-site SYK models using exact diagonalization. I show that single realizations of both models approximately satisfy ETH conditions, while ensemble averages strictly satisfy ETH. Therefore, I conclude that the finite-size SYK chain and two-site SYK models can rapidly thermalize with respect to generic few-body operators through the ETH mechanism. This suggests that the subthermal behavior observed in previous studies of R\'enyi entanglement entropy does not manifest in finite-size systems, and that these systems can thermalize rapidly via their light modes. It also indicates that the proposed gravitational dual may undergo rapid thermalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological order offers possibilities for processing quantum information which can be immune to imperfections. However, the question of its stability out of equilibrium is relevant for experiments, where coupling to an environment is unavoidable. In this work we demonstrate the robustness of certain aspects of $Z_2 \times Z_2$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order against a wide class of dissipation channels in the Lindblad and quantum trajectory formalisms of an open quantum system. This is illustrated using the one-dimensional $ZXZ$ cluster Hamiltonian along with Pauli-string jump operators. We show that certain choices of dissipation retaining strong symmetries support a steady-state manifold consisting of two non-local logical qubits, and for Hamiltonian perturbations preserving the global symmetry, states in this manifold remain metastable. In contrast, this metastability is destroyed upon breaking the above-mentioned symmetry. While the localized edge qubits of the cluster Hamiltonian are not conserved by the Lindbladian evolution, they do correspond to weak symmetries and thus retain a memory of their initial state at all times in the quantum trajectories. We utilize this feature to construct protocols to retrieve the quantum information either by monitoring jumps or error mitigation. Our work thus proposes a novel framework to study the dynamics of dissipative SPT phases and opens the possibility of engineering entangled states relevant to quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the hydrodynamic regime in metals with momentum-conserving electron-electron scattering. The conservation of momentum results in well-defined dynamics whose effects we investigate via the relevant continuity equations. We find anomalous contributions to the charge and heat transport currents arising from gradients of the velocity field in a semiclassical treatment with a Berry curvature. These contributions are non-vanishing for systems lacking inversion symmetry, and the corresponding transport coefficients do not obey the standard Onsager reciprocity relations. Instead, we show that the response coefficients relating the currents to the stress tensor obey independent reciprocity relations with the stress tensor and thus exhibit cross-tensor effects of charge and heat transport with the momentum transport. The Berry curvature contribution to the stress magnetization tensor is also derived.</description>

      <title>Coherent heat transfer leads to genuine quantum enhancement in the performances of continuous engines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional continuous quantum heat engines with incoherent heat transfer perform poorly as they exploit two-body interactions between the system and hot or cold baths, thus having limited capability to outperform their classical counterparts. We introduce distinct continuous quantum heat engines that utilize coherent heat transfer with baths, yielding genuine quantum enhancement in performance. These coherent engines consist of one qutrit system and two photonic baths and enable coherent heat transfer via two-photon transitions involving three-body interactions between the system and hot and cold baths. We demonstrate that coherent engines deliver significantly higher power output with much greater reliability, i.e., lower signal-to-noise ratio of the power, by hundreds of folds over their incoherent counterparts. Importantly, coherent engines can operate close to or at the maximal achievable reliability allowed by the quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation. Moreover, coherent engines manifest more nonclassical features than incoherent engines because they violate the classical thermodynamic uncertainty relation by a greater amount and for a wider range of parameters. These genuine enhancements in the performance of coherent engines are directly attributed to their capacity to harness higher energetic coherence for the resonant driving case. The experimental feasibility of coherent engines and the improved understanding of how quantum properties can enhance performance may find applications in quantum-enabled technologies.</description>

Abstract: The dynamics of quantum systems unfolds within a subspace of the state space or operator space, known as the Krylov space. This review presents the use of Krylov subspace methods to provide an efficient description of quantum evolution and quantum chaos, with emphasis on nonequilibrium phenomena of many-body systems with a large Hilbert space. It provides a comprehensive update of recent developments, focused on the quantum evolution of operators in the Heisenberg picture as well as pure and mixed states. It further explores the notion of Krylov complexity and associated metrics as tools for quantifying operator growth, their bounds by generalized quantum speed limits, the universal operator growth hypothesis, and its relation to quantum chaos, scrambling, and generalized coherent states. A comparison of several generalizations of the Krylov construction for open quantum systems is presented. A closing discussion addresses the application of Krylov subspace methods in quantum field theory, holography, integrability, quantum control, and quantum computing, as well as current open problems.</description>

      <title>Biased Degenerate Ground-State Sampling of Small Ising Models with Converged QAOA</title>

Abstract: The Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz, a generalization of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), is a quantum algorithm used for approximately solving combinatorial optimization problems. QAOA typically uses the Transverse field mixer as the driving Hamiltonian. One of the interesting properties of the Transverse-field driving Hamiltonian is that it results in non-uniform sampling of degenerate ground states of optimization problems. In this study we numerically examine the fair sampling properties transverse field mixer QAOA, and Grover Mixer QAOA (GM-QAOA) which provides theoretical guarantees of fair sampling of degenerate optimal solutions, up to large enough $p$ such that the mean expectation value converges to an optimal approximation ratio of $1$. This comparison is performed with high quality heuristically computed, but not necessarily optimal, QAOA angles which give strictly monotonically improving solution quality as p increases. These angles are computed using the Julia based numerical simulation software JuliQAOA. Fair sampling of degenerate ground-states is quantified using Shannon entropy of the ground-state amplitudes distribution. The fair sampling properties are reported on several quantum signature Hamiltonians from previous quantum annealing fair sampling studies. Small random fully connected spin glasses are shown which exhibit exponential suppression of some degenerate ground-states with transverse field mixer QAOA. The transverse field mixer QAOA simulations show that some problem instances clearly saturate the Shannon entropy of $0$ with a maximally biased distribution that occurs when the learning converges to an approximation ratio of $1$ while other problem instances never deviate from a maximum Shannon entropy (uniform distribution) at any $p$ step.</description>

      <title>What is a chemostat? Insights from hybrid dynamics and stochastic thermodynamics</title>

Abstract: At the microscopic scale, open chemical reaction networks are described by stochastic reactions that follow mass-action kinetics and are coupled to chemostats. We show that closed chemical reaction networks -- with specific stoichiometries imposed by mass-action kinetics -- behave like open ones in the limit where the abundances of a subset of species become macroscopic, thus playing the role of chemostats. We prove that this limit is thermodynamically consistent by recovering the local detailed balance condition of open chemical reaction networks and deriving the proper expression of the entropy production rate. In particular, the entropy production rate features two contributions: one accounting for the dissipation of the stochastic reactions, the other for the dissipation of continuous reactions controlling the chemostats. Finally, we illustrate our results for two prototypical examples.</description>

      <title>Higher order tacnodes in a free fermionic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a free fermion model with nearest and next-nearest neighbor hopping, evolving in imaginary time from a product state with N consecutive fermions, and conditioned to go back to the same state after a given time. In the case of nearest neighbor hoppings, this model is known to give rise to limit shapes and arctic curves for large time and fermion number, with in particular two fluctuating regions which can be tuned to merge depending on ratio between time and N. Fluctuations near the merger are governed by a so-called tacnode kernel. In this paper we study the analogous picture in the presence of a next nearest interactions. In particular, we discuss the limit shapes, and compute analytically the corresponding density profile. We also study the behavior of correlations close to the merger point, and find a novel higher order tacnode kernel governing them.</description>

      <title>Plastic deformation as a phase transition: a combinatorial model of plastic flow in copper single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuum models of plasticity fail to capture the richness of microstructural evolution because the continuum is a homogeneous construction. The present study shows that an alternative way is available at the mesoscale in the form of truly discrete constructions and in the discrete exterior calculus. A pre-existing continuum mean-field model with two parameters is rewritten in the language of the latter to model the properties of a network of plastic slip events in a perfect copper single crystal under uniaxial tension. The behaviour of the system is simulated in a triangular 2D mesh in 3D space employing a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Phases of distinct character emerge and both first-order and second-order phase transitions are observed. The phases can be interpreted as representing crystallographic phenomena like cross-slip, strain localisation and partial dislocations. The first-order transitions mostly occur as functions of the applied stress, while the second-order transitions occur exclusively as functions of the mean-field coupling parameter. The former are reminiscent of transitions in other statistical-mechanical models, while the latter find parallels in experimental observations.</description>
