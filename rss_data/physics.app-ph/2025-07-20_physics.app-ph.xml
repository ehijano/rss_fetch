      <title>Physics-guided impact localisation and force estimation in composite plates with uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-guided approaches offer a promising path toward accurate and generalisable impact identification in composite structures, especially when experimental data are sparse. This paper presents a hybrid framework for impact localisation and force estimation in composite plates, combining a data-driven implementation of First-Order Shear Deformation Theory (FSDT) with machine learning and uncertainty quantification. The structural configuration and material properties are inferred from dispersion relations, while boundary conditions are identified via modal characteristics to construct a low-fidelity but physically consistent FSDT model. This model enables physics-informed data augmentation for extrapolative localisation using supervised learning. Simultaneously, an adaptive regularisation scheme derived from the same model improves the robustness of impact force reconstruction. The framework also accounts for uncertainty by propagating localisation uncertainty through the force estimation process, producing probabilistic outputs. Validation on composite plate experiments confirms the framework's accuracy, robustness, and efficiency in reducing dependence on large training datasets. The proposed method offers a scalable and transferable solution for impact monitoring and structural health management in composite aerostructures.</description>

      <title>Programmable Space-Frequency Linear Transformations in Photonic Interlacing Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Programmable photonic circuits are versatile platforms that route light through multiple interference paths using reconfigurable optoelectronic elements to perform complex discrete linear operations. These circuits offer the potential for high-speed and low-power photonic information processing in various applications. The mainstream research on programmable photonics has focused on implementing linear operations on discrete signals encoded in the modal amplitudes of an array of spatially separated single-mode waveguides. However, many photonic device applications require simultaneous transformations in the space-frequency domain, where information is encoded in both the spatial modes of waveguides and their spectral content. Here, we experimentally demonstrate linear space-frequency transformations using a $4 \times 4$-port programmable silicon photonic circuit with an alternating architecture. This design leverages the limited dispersion of coupled waveguide arrays to enable linear operations with reconfigurable frequency-dependent matrix elements. We utilize this device to perform wavelength demultiplexing and filtering. This architecture platform can pave the way for versatile devices with applications ranging from wavelength routing to programmable dispersion control.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Performance Evaluation of Commercial SP4T Microelectromechanical Switch for Quantum Computing Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum computers have emerged as a leading platform for next-generation computing, offering exceptional scalability and unprecedented computational speeds. However, scaling these systems to millions of qubits for practical applications poses substantial challenges, particularly due to interconnect bottlenecks. To address this challenge, extensive research has focused on developing cryogenic multiplexers that enable minimal wiring between room-temperature electronics and quantum processors. This paper investigates the viability of commercial microelectromechanical system (MEMS) switches for cryogenic multiplexers in large-scale quantum computing systems. DC and RF characteristics of the MEMS switches are evaluated at cryogenic temperatures (&lt; 10 K) through finite element simulations and experimental measurements. Our results demonstrate that MEMS switches exhibit improved on-resistance, lower operating voltage, and superior RF performance at cryogenic temperatures, with reliable operation over 100 million cycles. Furthermore, stable single-pole four-throw (SP4T) switching and logical operations, including NAND and NOR gates, are demonstrated at cryogenic temperatures, validating their potential for quantum computing. These results underscore the promise of MEMS switches in realizing large-scale quantum computing systems.</description>

      <title>Overprinting with Tomographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tomographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing (TVAM) is a light-based 3D printing technique capable of producing centimeter-scale objects within seconds. A key challenge lies in the calculation of projection patterns under non-standard conditions, such as the presence of occlusions and materials with diverse optical properties, including varying refractive indices or scattering surfaces. This work focuses on demonstrating a wide variety of overprinting scenarios. First, utilizing a telecentric laser-based TVAM (LaserTVAM), we demonstrate the printing of a microfluidic perfusion system with biocompatible resins on existing nozzles for potential biomedical applications. In a subsequent demonstration, embedded spheres within the bio-resins are localized inside this perfusion system, optimized into specific patterns, and successfully connected to the nozzles via printed channels in less than three minutes. As a final LaserTVAM example, we print gears on a glossy metal rod, taking into account the scattered rays from the rod's surface. Using a non-telecentric LED-based TVAM (LEDTVAM), we then overprint engravings onto an existing LED placed in the resin. With an additional printed lens on this LED, we can project those engravings onto a screen. In a similar application with the same setup, we print microlenses on a glass tube filled with water, allowing us to image samples embedded within the glass tubes. Based on a differentiable physically-based ray optical approach, we are able to optimize all these scenarios within our existing open-source framework called Dr.TVAM. This framework enables the optimization of high-quality projections for both LaserTVAM and LEDTVAM setups within minutes, as well as lower-quality projections within seconds, outperforming existing solutions in terms of speed, flexibility, and quality.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Integration of Quantum Cascade Lasers with Germanium-on-Silicon waveguides for Mid-Infrared Sensing Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel scheme for hybrid integration of quantum cascade laser bars with germanium-on-silicon waveguides operating in the mid-infrared. The laser bars are flip-chip bonded onto a germanium-on-silicon target chip without active alignment, acheiving end-fire coupling efficiency of up to 45% (3.5 dB loss) in pulsed operation. Optical power estimates indicate 20-30 mW coupled into the waveguides. The passive alignment approach, combined with a CMOS-compatible photonic integrated circuit fabrication process, offers a scalable pathway to fully integrated mid-infrared photonic systems for sensing, free-space communications, and the realisation of novel light sources.</description>

      <title>Design of superparamagnetic nanoparticle-materials for high-frequency inductor cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13407v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The progress in the semiconductor industry has resulted in great demand for high-frequency magnetic materials applicable in microfabricated inductor cores. Nanocomposite materials, containing magnetic nanoparticles in a non-conducting matrix, may provide a solution for materials with high susceptibility or permeability and low power loss in the MHz regime, where traditional ferrites fail in performance. Here, we present a design guide for usage of magnetic nanoparticles in such materials. We use statistical mechanics methods to derive the magnetic susceptibility of nanoparticles in case of uniaxial or cubic anisotropy, as function of particle size and applied field direction, and investigate shape and interaction effects on the susceptibility. Using the derived susceptibilities, with inductor-core applications in mind, we show that close-to-spherical particles of materials with high saturation magnetization and low magnetic anisotropy, such as FeNi$_3$, are optimal. Additionally, the particle size shall be optimized to be as large as possible while maintaining superparamagnetic behaviour at the relevant frequency. Based on this, we predict that high particle susceptibilities of $&gt;$700 (/$&gt;$1500) are possible for randomly oriented (/uniaxially aligned) 20$\pm$1 nm diameter FeNi$_3$ particles, together with high-frequency stability, shown by low out-of-phase component at 2 MHz. This implies that materials containing nanoparticles have the potential to be tuned to outperform state-of-the-art ferrite inductor-core materials at MHz-frequencies.</description>

      <title>An Overview of CV-MDI-QKD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As quantum key distribution (QKD) emerges as a robust defense against quantum computer threats, significant advancements have been realized by researchers. A pivotal focus has been the development of protocols that not only simplify hardware implementation like the use of continuous-variable (CV) systems, but also negate the necessity for trusted nodes, as seen with the measurement-device independent (MDI) approach. This paper delves into the integration of these methodologies in the CV-MDI-QKD protocol, offering an in-depth exploration of its evolution, primary characteristics, and the latest advancements in both theory and experiment.</description>

      <title>Demagnetisation effects in single-domain particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the classical laws of magnetism, the shape of magnetically soft objects limits the effective susceptibility. For example, spherical soft magnets cannot display an effective susceptibility larger than 3. Although true for macroscopic multi-domain magnetic materials, we explain why magnetic nanoparticles in a single-domain state do not suffer from this limitation. We show that the differences between demagnetisation factors along principal axes are relevant and can influence susceptibility for single-domain particles, but do not limit the susceptibility as in the case for multi-domain particles. We validate this result experimentally on spherical nanoparticles with varying diameter (8 to 150 nm) and varying volume fraction (0.1 to 47 vol%). In agreement with our predictions, we measure susceptibilities largely above 3, in fact up to more than 250, for single-domain particles. Moreover, contrary to an existing model, we find that the susceptibility of non-interacting single-domain particles in a non-magnetic matrix scales simply linearly with the volume fraction of particles.</description>
