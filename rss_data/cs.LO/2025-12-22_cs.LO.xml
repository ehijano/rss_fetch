      <title>When Symmetry Yields NP-Hardness: Affine ML-SAT on S5 Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hemaspaandra~et~al.~[JCSS 2010] conjectured that satisfiability for multi-modal logic restricted to the connectives XOR and 1, over frame classes T, S4, and S5, is solvable in polynomial time. We refute this for S5 frames, by proving NP-hardness.</description>

      <title>Derivates for Containers in Univalent Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Containers conveniently represent a wide class of inductive data types. Their derivatives compute representations of types of one-hole contexts, useful for implementing tree-traversal algorithms. In the category of containers and cartesian morphisms, derivatives of discrete containers (whose positions have decidable equality) satisfy a universal property. Working in Univalent Foundations, we extend the derivative operation to untruncated containers (whose shapes and positions are arbitrary types). We prove that this derivative, defined in terms of a set of isolated positions, satisfies an appropriate universal property in the wild category of untruncated containers and cartesian morphisms, as well as basic laws with respect to constants, sums and products. A chain rule exists, but is in general non-invertible. In fact, a globally invertible chain rule is inconsistent in the presence of non-set types, and equivalent to a classical principle when restricted to set-truncated containers. We derive a rule for derivatives of smallest fixed points from the chain rule, and characterize its invertibility. All of our results are formalized in Cubical Agda.</description>

      <title>Yet another cubical type theory, but via a semantic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new cubical type theory, termed (self-deprecatingly) the naive cubical type theory, and study its semantics using the universe category framework, which is similar to Uemura's categories with representable morphisms. In particular, we show that this new type theory admits an interpretation in a wide variety of settings, including simplicial sets and cartesian cubical sets.</description>

      <title>Navigating Taxonomic Expansions of Entity Sets Driven by Knowledge Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recognizing similarities among entities is central to both human cognition and computational intelligence. Within this broader landscape, Entity Set Expansion is one prominent task aimed at taking an initial set of (tuples of) entities and identifying additional ones that share relevant semantic properties with the former -- potentially repeating the process to form increasingly broader sets. However, this ``linear'' approach does not unveil the richer ``taxonomic'' structures present in knowledge resources. A recent logic-based framework introduces the notion of an expansion graph: a rooted directed acyclic graph where each node represents a semantic generalization labeled by a logical formula, and edges encode strict semantic inclusion. This structure supports taxonomic expansions of entity sets driven by knowledge bases. Yet, the potentially large size of such graphs may make full materialization impractical in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we formalize reasoning tasks that check whether two tuples belong to comparable, incomparable, or the same nodes in the graph. Our results show that, under realistic assumptions -- such as bounding the input or limiting entity descriptions -- these tasks can be implemented efficiently. This enables local, incremental navigation of expansion graphs, supporting practical applications without requiring full graph construction.</description>

      <title>About Time: Model-free Reinforcement Learning with Timed Reward Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reward specification plays a central role in reinforcement learning (RL), guiding the agent's behavior. To express non-Markovian rewards, formalisms such as reward machines have been introduced to capture dependencies on histories. However, traditional reward machines lack the ability to model precise timing constraints, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. In this paper, we propose timed reward machines (TRMs), which are an extension of reward machines that incorporate timing constraints into the reward structure. TRMs enable more expressive specifications with tunable reward logic, for example, imposing costs for delays and granting rewards for timely actions. We study model-free RL frameworks (i.e., tabular Q-learning) for learning optimal policies with TRMs under digital and real-time semantics. Our algorithms integrate the TRM into learning via abstractions of timed automata, and employ counterfactual-imagining heuristics that exploit the structure of the TRM to improve the search. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our algorithm learns policies that achieve high rewards while satisfying the timing constraints specified by the TRM on popular RL benchmarks. Moreover, we conduct comparative studies of performance under different TRM semantics, along with ablations that highlight the benefits of counterfactual-imagining.</description>

      <title>Foundations for an Abstract Proof Theory in the Context of Horn Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel, logic-independent framework for the study of sequent-style proof systems, which covers a number of proof-theoretic formalisms and concrete proof systems that appear in the literature. In particular, we introduce a generalized form of sequents, dubbed 'g-sequents,' which are taken to be binary graphs of typical, Gentzen-style sequents. We then define a variety of 'inference rule types' as sets of operations that act over such objects, and define 'abstract (sequent) calculi' as pairs consisting of a set of g-sequents together with a finite set of operations. Our approach permits an analysis of how certain inference rule types interact in a general setting, demonstrating under what conditions rules of a specific type can be permuted with or simulated by others, and being applicable to any sequent-style proof system that fits within our framework. We then leverage our permutation and simulation results to establish generic calculus and proof transformation algorithms, which show that every abstract calculus can be effectively transformed into a lattice of polynomially equivalent abstract calculi. We determine the complexity of computing this lattice and compute the relative sizes of proofs and sequents within distinct calculi of a lattice. We recognize that top and bottom elements in lattices correspond to many known deep-inference nested sequent systems and labeled sequent systems (respectively) for logics characterized by Horn properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first formal correctness proof of Edmonds' blossom shrinking algorithm for maximum cardinality matching in general graphs. We focus on formalising the mathematical structures and properties that allow the algorithm to run in worst-case polynomial running time. We formalise Berge's lemma, blossoms and their properties, and a mathematical model of the algorithm, showing that it is totally correct. We provide the first detailed proofs of many of the facts underlying the algorithm's correctness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17250v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We note that Weihrauch problems can be regarded as containers over the category of projective represented spaces and that Weihrauch reductions correspond exactly to container morphisms. We also show that Bauer's extended Weihrauch degrees and the posetal reflection of containers over partition assemblies are equivalent. Using this characterization, we show how a number of operators over Weihrauch degrees, such as the composition product, also arise naturally from the abstract theory of polynomial functors.</description>

      <title>Going deep and going wide: Counting logic and homomorphism indistinguishability over graphs of bounded treedepth and treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the expressive power of first-order logic with counting quantifiers, especially the $k$-variable and quantifier-rank-$q$ fragment $\mathsf{C}^k_q$, using homomorphism indistinguishability. Recently, Dawar, Jakl, and Reggio (2021) proved that two graphs satisfy the same $\mathsf{C}^k_q$-sentences iff they are homomorphism indistinguishable over the class $\mathcal{T}^k_q$ of graphs admitting a $k$-pebble forest cover of depth $q$. After reproving this result using elementary means, we provide a graph-theoretic analysis of $\mathcal{T}^k_q$. This allows us to separate $\mathcal{T}^k_q$ from the intersection $\mathcal{TW}_{k-1} \cap \mathcal{TD}_q$, provided that $q$ is sufficiently larger than $k$. Here $\mathcal{TW}_{k-1}$ is the class of all graphs of treewidth at most $k-1$ and $\mathcal{TD}_q$ is the class of all graphs of treedepth at most $q$.
  We are able to lift this separation to a separation of the respective homomorphism indistinguishability relations $\equiv_{\mathcal{T}^k_q}$ and $\equiv_{\mathcal{TW}_{k-1} \cap \mathcal{TD}_q}$. We do this by showing that the classes $\mathcal{TD}_q$ and $\mathcal{T}^k_q$ are homomorphism distinguishing closed, as conjectured by Roberson (2022).
  In order to prove Roberson's conjecture for $\mathcal{T}^k_q$, we characterise $\mathcal{T}^k_q$ in terms of a monotone Cops-and-Robber game. The crux is to prove that if Cop has a winning strategy then Cop also has a winning strategy that is monotone. To that end, we transform Cops' winning strategy into a pree-tree-decomposition, which is inspired by decompositions of matroids, and then apply an intricate breadth-first cleaning up procedure along the pree-tree-decomposition (which may temporarily lose the property of representing a strategy). Thereby, we achieve monotonicity while controlling the number of rounds across all branches of the decomposition via a vertex exchange argument.</description>

      <title>Beyond Eckmann-Hilton: Commutativity in Higher Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16465v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that in a weak globular $\omega$-category, all composition operations are equivalent and commutative for cells with sufficiently degenerate boundary, which can be considered a higher-dimensional generalisation of the Eckmann-Hilton argument. Our results are formulated constructively in a type-theoretic presentation of $\omega$-categories. The heart of our construction is a family of padding and repadding techniques, which gives an equivalence relation between cells which are not necessarily parallel. Our work has been implemented, allowing us to explicitly compute suitable witnesses, which grow rapidly in complexity as the dimension increases. These witnesses can be exported as inhabitants of identity types in Homotopy Type Theory, and hence are of relevance in synthetic homotopy theory.</description>

      <title>Logical Characterizations of GNNs with Mean Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) with mean as the aggregation function, with the following results. In the non-uniform setting, such GNNs have exactly the same expressive power as ratio modal logic, which has modal operators expressing that at least a certain ratio of the successors of a vertex satisfies a specified property. In the uniform setting, the expressive power relative to MSO is exactly that of modal logic, and thus identical to the (absolute) expressive power of GNNs with max aggregation. The proof, however, depends on constructions that are not satisfactory from a practical perspective. This leads us to making the natural assumptions that combination functions are continuous and classification functions are thresholds. The resulting class of GNNs with mean aggregation turns out to be much less expressive: relative to MSO and in the uniform setting, it has the same expressive power as alternation-free modal logic. This is in contrast to the expressive power of GNNs with max and sum aggregation, which is not affected by these assumptions.</description>
