      <title>Proposal for experimental realization of quantum spin chains with quasiperiodic interaction using Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating localization properties of interacting disordered systems plays a crucial role in understanding thermalization and its absence in closed quantum systems. However, simulating such systems on classical computers is challenging due to their complexity. In this work, we propose a method to realize S = 1/2 and S = 1 quantum spin models with quasiperiodic interaction using Rydberg atoms by utilizing the high tunability of their spatial position. We also perform numerical calculations and show that these models host a many-body critical regime, which differs from the ergodic and many-body localization.</description>

      <title>Many-body density of states of bosonic and fermionic gases: a combinatorial approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a combinatorial approach to obtain exact expressions for the many-body density of states of fermionic and bosonic gases with equally spaced single-particle spectra. We identify a mapping that reveals a remarkable property, namely, fermionic and bosonic gases have the same many-body density of states, up to a shift corresponding to ground state energy. Additionally, we show that there is a regime, comprising the validity range of the Bethe approximation, where the many-body density of states becomes independent of the number of particles.</description>

      <title>(In)stability of symbiotic vortex-bright soliton in holographic immiscible binary superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbiotic vortex-bright soliton structures with non-trivial topological charge in one component are found to be robust in immiscibel two-component superfluids, due to the effective potential created by a stable vortex in the other component. We explore the properties of symbiotic vortex-bright soliton in strongly coupled binary superfluids by holography, which naturally incorporates finite temperature effect and dissipation. We show the dependence of the configuration on various parameters, including the winding number, temperature and inter-component coupling. We then study the (in)stability of symbiotic vortex-bright soliton by both the linear approach via quasi-normal modes and the full non-linear numerical simulation. Rich dynamics are found for the splitting patterns and dynamical transitions. Moreover, for giant symbiotic vortex-bright soliton structures with large winding numbers, the vortex splitting instability might be rooted in the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We also show that the second component in the vortex core could act as a stabilizer so as to suppress or even prevent vortex splitting instability. Such stabilization mechanism opens possibility for vortices with smaller winding number to merge into vortices with larger winding number, which is confirmed for the first time in our simulation.</description>

      <title>Hilbert space fragmentation at the origin of disorder-free localization in the lattice Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories, the discretized cousins of continuum gauge theories, have become an important platform for the exploration of non-equilibrium phenomena beyond their original scope in the Standard Model. In particular, recent works have reported the possibility of disorder-free localization in the lattice Schwinger model. Using degenerate perturbation theory and numerical simulations based on exact diagonalization and matrix product states, we perform a detailed characterization of thermalization breakdown in the Schwinger model including its spectral properties, the structure of eigenstates, and out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics. We scrutinize the strong-coupling limit of the model, in which an intriguing, double-logarithmic-in-time, growth of entanglement was previously proposed from the initial vacuum state. We identify the origin of this ultraslow growth of entanglement as due to an approximate Hilbert space fragmentation and the emergence of a dynamical constraint on particle hopping, which gives rise to sharp jumps in the entanglement entropy dynamics within individual background charge sectors. Based on the statistics of jump times, we argue that the entanglement growth, averaged over charge sectors, is more naturally explained as either single-logarithmic or a weak power law in time. Our results thus suggest the existence of a single ergodicity-breaking regime due to Hilbert space fragmentation, whose properties are reminiscent of conventional many-body localization within the numerically accessible system sizes.</description>

      <title>Confinement-induced field-linked states of ultracold polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We predict the existence of stable bound states between pairs of ultracold diatomic molecules with the aid of a static electric field and 1D harmonic confinement. We focus on collisions of NaK-NaK identical fermions, for which we find that currently achievable experimental parameters allow the observation of these confinement-induced field-linked bound states as scattering resonances. The bound state is highly stable with lifetimes estimated to be tens of seconds long. With the diatomic molecules bound at distances a fraction of the dipolar length scale, these complexes allow for explorations of polyatomic chemistry and Fermi gas superfluid pairing.</description>

      <title>Quadrature amplitude modulation for electronic sideband Pound-Drever-Hall locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique is routinely used to stabilize the frequency of a laser to a reference cavity. The electronic sideband (ESB) locking scheme, a PDH variant, helps bridge the frequency difference between the quantized frequencies enforced by the cavity and the laser frequency of interest. Here we use quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), a technique used in digital signal communication, to engineer the high-quality phase-modulated radio-frequency (rf) signal required for ESB locking scheme. We develop a theoretical framework to analyze the effects of in-phase/quadrature-phase (I/Q) impairments on the ESB error signal for ultra-narrow linewidth lasers. We design and implement two baseband-sampling software-defined radio variants for implementing QAM that compensate for these I/Q impairments. Using these variants, we engineer high-quality phase-modulated radio-frequency (rf) signals with a large phase modulation index of 1.01 radians, a maximum modulation frequency of 3 MHz, a tunable carrier wave frequency range of 450 MHz to 4 GHz, and I/Q errors of less than 2.25 % over the entire carrier wave frequency range.</description>

      <title>Hybrid boson sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose boson sampling from a system of coupled photons and Bose-Einstein condensed atoms placed inside a multi-mode cavity as a simulation process testing quantum advantage of quantum systems over classical computers. Consider a two-level atomic transition far-detuned from photon frequency. An atom-photon scattering and interatomic collisions provide interaction creating quasiparticles and exciting atoms, photons into squeezed entangled states orthogonal, respectively, to the atomic condensate and classical field driving the two-level transition. We find a joint probability distribution of atom and photon numbers within a quasi-equilibrium model via a hafnian of an extended covariance matrix. It shows a sampling statistics that is #P-hard for computing even if only photon numbers are sampled. Merging cavity-QED and quantum-gas technologies into hybrid boson sampling setup has the potential to overcome limitations of separate, photon or atom, sampling schemes and reveal quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Boson sampling with self-generation of squeezing via interaction of photons and atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We suggest a novel scheme for generating multimode squeezed states for the boson sampling implementation. The idea is to replace a commonly used linear interferometer by a multimode resonator containing a passive optical element consisting of two-level atoms dispersively interacting with photons and self-generating a squeezed compound state of both bosons -- photons and atoms. The suggested scheme does not need (a) on-demand external sources of photons in squeezed or Fock quantum states and (b) numerous interchannel couplers which introduce phase noise and losses that prevent scaling up the system and achieving quantum advantage. The idea is illustrated by a setup based on a Bose-Einstein-condensed gas confined in a multimode resonator, one of whose optical modes is in the classical coherent regime. The joint probability distribution of photon and/or noncondensed atom numbers is calculated via a matrix hafnian that, for certain parameters of the system, is hardly to be effectively calculated by classical computers. Such experiments are at reach via existing cavity-QED and cold-gas technology.</description>

      <title>Mirror symmetry breaking of superradiance in a dipolar BEC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.01586v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dicke superradiance occurs when two or more emitters cooperatively interact via the electromagnetic field. This collective light scattering process has been extensively studied across various platforms, from atoms to quantum dots and organic molecules. Despite extensive research, the precise role of direct interactions between emitters in superradiance remains elusive, particularly in many-body systems where the complexity of interactions poses significant challenges. In this study, we investigate the effect of dipole-dipole interaction between 18,000 atoms in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) on the superradiance process. In dipolar BECs, we simplify the complex effect of anisotropic magnetic dipole-dipole interaction with Bogoliubov transformation. We observe that anisotropic Bogoliubov excitation breaks the mirror symmetry in decay modes of superradiance.</description>

      <title>Exact results for heavy unitary Bose polarons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of unitary Bose polarons, i.e., impurities interacting via a potential with infinite scattering length with a bath of weakly interacting bosons. We provide an analytic expression for the energy of a heavy impurity whose interaction potential has a range larger than the healing length of the bath. Furthermore, we perform numerically exact Diffusion Monte Carlo calculations and we demonstrate that the simple Gross-Pitaevskii theory provides a remarkably accurate description of heavy unitary Bose polarons throughout the whole experimentally relevant range of gas densities.</description>

      <title>Induced supersolidity and hypersonic flow of a dipolar Bose-Einstein Condensate in a rotating bubble trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent realization of space-borne Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) under micro-gravity conditions, we extend the understanding of ultracold dipolar bosonic gases by exploring their behavior in a novel trapping configuration known as the ``bubble trap" topology. Utilizing the three-dimensional numerical simulations within the extended Gross-Pitaevskii framework, we unveil diverse ground state phases in this static curved topology. Subsequently, we investigate the influence of rotation on a dipolar BEC confined to the surface of a spherical bubble. Our findings reveal that the rotation of a bubble trap at certain rotation frequencies can modify the effective local dipole-dipole interaction strength, leading to the induction of supersolidity and the formation of quantum droplets. In addition, we demonstrate that a bubble trap can sustain high circulation, with the flow persisting for a longer time. Significantly, adjusting the rf detuning parameter allows the condensate to achieve hypersonic velocity. Finally, we also explore the impact of drastic change in the topological nature of the trap on the rotating dipolar BEC, transitioning from a filled shell trap to a bubble trap and vice versa. Based on the results of the topological transition, we propose a dynamic protocol to drive the interacting atomic gas into the quantum Hall regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the thermodynamics for bosonic systems with weak $s$-wave interactions has been known for decades, a general and systematic extension to higher partial waves has not yet been reported. We provide closed-form expressions for the equations of state for weakly interacting systems with arbitrary partial waves in the normal phase. Thermodynamics, including contact, loss rate, and compressibility, are derived over the entire temperature regime. Our results offer an improved thermometer for ultracold atoms and molecules with weak high-partial wave interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractonic matter can undergo unconventional phase transitions driven by the condensation of particles that move along subdimensional manifolds. We propose that this type of quantum critical point can be realized in a bilayer of crossed Rydberg chains. This system exhibits a transition between a disordered phase and a charge-density-wave phase with subextensive ground state degeneracy. We show that this transition is described by a stack of critical Ising conformal field theories that become decoupled in the low-energy limit due to emergent subsystem symmetries. We also analyze the transition using a Majorana mean-field approach for an effective lattice model, which confirms the picture of a fixed point of decoupled critical chains. We discuss the unusual scaling properties and derive anisotropic correlators that provide signatures of subdimensional criticality in this realistic setup.</description>
