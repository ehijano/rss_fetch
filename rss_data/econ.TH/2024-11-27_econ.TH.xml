      <title>The Role of the Assumptions for the Existence of a General Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General Equilibrium Theory is the benchmark of economics, especially its results concerning the efficient allocation of resources, known as the First and Second Welfare Theorems. Yet, General Equilibrium Theory is beyond the scope of most economists. This paper is pitched as the first entry point into the theory. General Equilibrium Theory proves that at least one state of equilibrium always exists. In its most general approach, it uses fixed-point theorems to this end. This paper discusses the assumptions on individuals' behaviour and the structure of the system of exchange that guarantee that the conditions of the fixed-point theorems are satisfied. The purpose is to lay bare the role each plays in proving the existence of equilibrium and provide a clear picture of the relationship between the assumptions and the result. The discussion is presented in the simplest possible setting that captures the fundamental features of commodity exchange.</description>

      <title>Decision making in stochastic extensive form II: Stochastic extensive forms and games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general theory of stochastic extensive forms is developed to bridge two concepts of information flow: decision trees and refined partitions on the one side, filtrations from probability theory on the other. Instead of the traditional "nature" agent, this framework uses a single lottery draw to select a tree of a given decision forest. Each "personal" agent receives dynamic updates from an own oracle on the lottery outcome and makes partition-refining choices adapted to this information. This theory addresses a key limitation of existing approaches in extensive form theory, which struggle to model continuous-time stochastic processes, such as Brownian motion, as outcomes of "nature" decision making. Additionally, a class of stochastic extensive forms based on time-indexed action paths is constructed, encompassing a wide range of models from the literature and laying the groundwork for an approximation theory for stochastic differential games in extensive form.</description>

      <title>Resolute and symmetric mechanisms for two-sided matching problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on the one-to-one two-sided matching model with two disjoint sets of agents of equal size, where each agent in a set has preferences on the agents in the other set modeled by a linear order. A matching mechanism associates a set of matchings to each preference profile; resoluteness, that is the capability to select a unique matching, and stability are important properties for a matching mechanism. The two versions of the deferred acceptance algorithm are resolute and stable matching mechanisms but they are unfair since they strongly favor one side of the market. We introduce a property for matching mechanisms that relates to fairness; such property, called symmetry, captures different levels of fairness and generalizes existing notions. We provide several possibility and impossibility results mainly involving the most general notion of symmetry, known as gender fairness, resoluteness, stability, weak Pareto optimality and minimal optimality. In particular, we prove that: resolute, gender fair matching mechanisms exist if and only if each side of the market consists of an odd number of agents; there exists no resolute, gender fair, minimally optimal matching mechanism. Those results are obtained by employing algebraic methods based on group theory, an approach not yet explored in matching theory.</description>

      <title>Information Aggregation with Costly Information Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study information aggregation in a dynamic trading model with partially informed traders. Ostrovsky [2012] showed that 'separable' securities aggregate information in all equilibria, however, separability is not robust to small changes in the traders' private information. To remedy this problem, we enhance the model by allowing traders to acquire signals with cost $\kappa$, in every period. We show that '$\kappa$ separable securities' aggregate information and, as the cost decreases, nearly all securities become $\kappa$ separable, irrespective of the traders' initial private information. Moreover, the switch to $\kappa$ separability happens not gradually but discontinuously, hence even a small decrease in costs can result in a security aggregating information. Finally, even with myopic traders, cheaper information may accelerate or decelerate information aggregation for all but Arrow-Debreu securities.</description>

      <title>Market Design for Capacity Sharing in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03994v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a market mechanism that sets edge prices to incentivize strategic agents to efficiently share limited network capacity. In this market, agents form coalitions, with each coalition sharing a unit capacity of a selected route and making payments to cover edge prices. Our focus is on the existence and computation of market equilibrium, where challenges arise from the interdependence between coalition formation among strategic agents with heterogeneous preferences and route selection that induces a network flow under integral capacity constraints. To address this interplay between coalition formation and network capacity utilization, we introduce a novel approach based on combinatorial auction theory and network flow theory. We establish sufficient conditions on the network topology and agents' preferences that guarantee both the existence and polynomial-time computation of a market equilibrium. Additionally, we identify a particular market equilibrium that maximizes utilities for all agents and is equivalent to the classical Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism. Furthermore, we extend our results to multi-period settings and general networks, showing that when the sufficient conditions are not met, an equilibrium may still exist but requires more complex, path-based pricing mechanisms that set differentiated prices based on agents' preference parameters.</description>
