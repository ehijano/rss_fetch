      <title>What we talk about when we talk about physics problem solving</title>

Abstract: I am a second-year cognitive science major, and as a student who has completed my physical science distributive requirements, I will likely never again come across Gauss's law. So why do I feel that the time and effort I devoted to solving Gauss's law problems was worth it? Partly, I inherently enjoy the learning process and the new perspective on the physical world I have acquired by understanding electromagnetism. But I was also inspired by the ways in which physics problems train the mind in effective problem-solving strategies. (Of course I was -- I am a cognitive science major!) Two themes emerged as I reflected on this realization. First, physics problems serve as useful toy models for more complex problems outside of physics, training us in broadly transferable problem-solving skills. Second, the physics problem-solving process invites us to reflect on our unique cognitive and affective processes. These themes are interconnected and complimentary. An improved metacognitive understanding of our minds facilitates solving progressively more complex problems, and the act of solving increasingly difficult problems provides further insight into our minds. In what follows, Professor Zosia Krusberg and I consider nine general lessons offered by the physics problem-solving process.</description>
