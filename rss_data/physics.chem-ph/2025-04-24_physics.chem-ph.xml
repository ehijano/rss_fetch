      <title>PINN-MEP: Continuous Neural Representations for Minimum-Energy Path Discovery in Molecular Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing conformational transitions in physical systems remains a fundamental challenge in the computational sciences. Traditional sampling methods like molecular dynamics (MD) or MCMC often struggle with the high-dimensional nature of molecular systems and the high energy barriers of transitions between stable states. While these transitions are rare events in simulation timescales, they often represent the most biologically significant processes - for example, the conformational change of an ion channel protein from its closed to open state, which controls cellular ion flow and is crucial for neural signaling. Such transitions in real systems may take milliseconds to seconds but could require months or years of continuous simulation to observe even once. We present a method that reformulates transition path generation as a continuous optimization problem solved through physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) inspired by string methods for minimum-energy path (MEP) generation. By representing transition paths as implicit neural functions and leveraging automatic differentiation with differentiable molecular dynamics force fields, our method enables the efficient discovery of physically realistic transition pathways without requiring expensive path sampling. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on two proteins, including an explicitly hydrated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) system with over 8,300 atoms.</description>

      <title>Response to Comment on "Non-Polaritonic Effects in Cavity-Modified Photochemistry": On the Importance of Experimental Details</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note responds to Schwartz and Hutchison's Comment (arXiv:2403.06001) on our article (DOI:10.1002/adma.202309393). We think differences have arisen not in the experimental results themselves but in their interpretation: our more extensive experiments allowed us to distinguish between "true positive" and "false positive" results. We identify potential evidence of non-polaritonic effects in Schwartz and Hutchison's own work. We hope our work will encourage others to produce more systematic investigations of strong coupling.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Methodology for Reinstating the Superhydrophilicity of Ambient-Contaminant Compromised Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The degradation of the hemi-wicking property of superhydrophilic high-energy surfaces due to contaminant adsorption from the ambient atmosphere is well documented. This degradation compromises the performance of such surfaces, thus affecting their efficacy in real-world applications where hemi-wicking is critical. In this work, the role of surface micro/nanostructure morphology of laser-textured metallic surfaces on superhydrophilicity degradation is studied. We explore intrinsic contact angle variations of superhydrophilic surfaces via adsorption of organics from the surroundings, which brings about the associated changes in surface chemistry. Furthermore, we explore condensation from humid air as a scalable and environment friendly methodology that can reinstate surface superhydrophilicity to a considerable extent (64% recovery of intrinsic wettability after three hours of condensation) due to the efficient removal of physisorbed contaminants from the surface texture features. The present results strengthen the argument that contact-line movement at fine scales can be used for de-pinning and removal of adsorbed organic molecules from contaminated surfaces.</description>

      <title>Gas-phase formation routes of dimethyl sulfide in the interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Dimethyl sulfide (DMS; CH$_3$SCH$_3$) is an organosulfur compound that has been suggested as a potential biosignature in exoplanetary atmospheres. In addition to its tentative detections toward the sub-Neptune planet K2-18b, DMS has been detected in the coma of the 67/P comet and toward the galactic center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027. However, its formation routes have not been characterized yet.
  Aims: In this work, we have investigated three gas-phase reactions (CH$_3$SH + CH$_3$OH$_2^+$, CH$_3$OH + CH$_3$SH$_2^+$, and the CH$_3$ + CH$_3$S radiative association), aiming at characterizing DMS formation routes in shocked molecular clouds and star-forming regions.
  Methods: We have performed dedicated quantum and kinetics calculations to evaluate the reaction rate coefficients as a function of temperature to be included in astrochemical models.
  Results: Among the investigated processes, the reaction between methanethiol (CH$_3$SH) and protonated methanol (CH$_3$OH$_2^+$)(possibly followed by a gentle proton transfer to ammonia) is a compelling candidate to explain the formation of DMS in the galactic center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027. The CH$_3$ + CH$_3$S radiative association does not seem to be a very efficient process, with the exclusion of cold clouds, provided that the thiomethoxy radical (CH$_3$S) is available.
  This work does not deal directly with the possible formation of DMS in the atmosphere of exoplanets. However, it clearly indicates that there are efficient abiotic formation routes of this interesting species.</description>

      <title>Breaking scaling relations with inverse catalysts: a machine learning exploration of trends in $\mathrm{CO_2}$ hydrogenation energy barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conversion of $\mathrm{CO_2}$ into useful products such as methanol is a key strategy for abating climate change and our dependence on fossil fuels. Developing new catalysts for this process is costly and time-consuming and can thus benefit from computational exploration of possible active sites. However, this is complicated by the complexity of the materials and reaction networks. Here, we present a workflow for exploring transition states of elementary reaction steps at inverse catalysts, which is based on the training of a neural network-based machine learning interatomic potential. We focus on the crucial formate intermediate and its formation over nanoclusters of indium oxide supported on Cu(111). The speedup compared to an approach purely based on density functional theory allows us to probe a wide variety of active sites found at nanoclusters of different sizes and stoichiometries. Analysis of the obtained set of transition state geometries reveals different structure--activity trends at the edge or interior of the nanoclusters. Furthermore, the identified geometries allow for the breaking of linear scaling relations, which could be a key underlying reason for the excellent catalytic performance of inverse catalysts observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Electronic Paddlewheels Impact the Dynamics of Superionic Conduction in AgI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state ion conductors hold promise as next generation battery materials. To realize their full potential, an understanding of atomic-scale ion conduction mechanisms is needed, including ionic and electronic degrees of freedom. Molecular simulations can create such an understanding, however, including a description of electronic structure necessitates computationally expensive methods that limit their application to small scales. We examine an alternative approach, in which neural network models are used to efficiently sample ionic configurations and dynamics at ab initio accuracy. Then, these configurations are used to determine electronic properties in a post-processing step. We demonstrate this approach by modeling the superionic phase of AgI, in which cation diffusion is coupled to rotational motion of local electron density on the surrounding iodide ions, termed electronic paddlewheels. The neural network potential can capture the many-body effects of electronic paddlewheels on ionic dynamics, but classical force field models cannot. Through an analysis rooted the generalized Langevin equation framework, we find that electronic paddlewheels have a significant impact on the time-dependent friction experienced by a mobile cation. Our approach will enable investigations of electronic fluctuations in materials on large length and time scales, and ultimately the control of ion dynamics through electronic paddlewheels.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing with spin defects in boron nitride nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin defects in semiconductors are widely investigated for various applications in quantum sensing. Conventional host materials such as diamond and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) provide bulk or low-dimensional platforms for optically addressable spin systems, but often lack the structural properties needed for chemical sensing. Here, we introduce a new class of quantum sensors based on naturally occurring spin defects in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), which combine high surface area with omnidirectional spin control, key features for enhanced sensing performance. First, we present strong evidence that these defects are carbon-related, akin to recently identified centers in hBN, and demonstrate coherent spin control over ensembles embedded within dense, microscale BNNTs networks. Using dynamical decoupling, we enhance spin coherence times by a factor exceeding 300x and implement high-resolution detection of radiofrequency signals. By integrating the BNNT mesh sensor into a microfluidic platform we demonstrate chemical sensing of paramagnetic ions in solution, with detectable concentrations reaching levels nearly 1000 times lower than previously demonstrated using comparable hBN-based systems. This highly porous and flexible architecture positions BNNTs as a powerful new host material for quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Maximizing NMR Sensitivity: A Guide to Receiver Gain Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16411v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Novel methods and technology drive the rapid advances of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The primary objective of developing novel hardware is to improve sensitivity and reliability (and possibly to reduce cost). Automation has made NMR much more convenient, but it may lead to trusting the algorithms without regular checks. In this contribution, we analyzed the signal and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a function of the receiver gain (RG) for 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N nuclei on five spectrometers. On a 1 T benchtop spectrometer (Spinsolve, Magritek), the SNR showed the expected increase as a function of RG. Still, the 1H and 13C signal amplitudes deviated by up to 50% from supposedly RG-independent signal intensities. On 7, 9.4, 11.7, and 14.1 T spectrometers (Avance Neo, Bruker), the signal intensity increases linearly with RG as expected, but surprisingly a drastic drop of SNR is observed for some X-nuclei and fields. For example, while RG = 18 provided a 13C SNR similar to that at a maximum RG of 101 at 9.4 T, at RG = 20.2 the determined SNR was 32% lower. The SNR figures are strongly system and resonance frequency dependent. Our findings suggest that NMR users should test the specific spectrometer behavior to obtain optimum SNR for their experiments, as automatic RG adjustment does not account for the observed characteristics. In addition, we provide a method to estimate optimal settings for thermally and hyperpolarized samples of a chosen concentration, polarization, and flip angle, which provide a high SNR and avoid ADC-overflow artefacts.</description>

      <title>Simulating biochemical reactions: The Linear Noise Approximation can capture non-linear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a plethora of highly stochastic non-linear dynamical systems in fields such as molecular biology, chemistry, epidemiology, and ecology. Yet, none of the currently available stochastic models are both accurate and computationally efficient for long-term predictions of large systems. The Linear Noise Approximation (LNA) model for biochemical reaction networks is analytically tractable, which makes it computationally efficient for simulation, analysis, and inference. However, it is only accurate for linear systems and short-time transitions. Other methods can achieve greater accuracy across a wider range of systems, including non-linear ones, but lack analytical tractability. This paper seeks to challenge the prevailing view by demonstrating that the Linear Noise Approximation can indeed capture non-linear dynamics after certain modifications. We introduce a new framework that utilises centre manifold theory allowing us to identify simple interventions to the LNA that do not significantly compromise its computational efficiency. We develop specific algorithms for systems that exhibit oscillations or bi-stability and demonstrate their accuracy and computational efficiency across multiple examples.</description>

      <title>Mapping molecular polariton transport via pump-probe microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how the transport properties of molecular polaritons in optical cavities can be extracted from a microscopic modeling of pump-probe spectroscopy. Our approach combines a mean-field treatment of the light-matter Hamiltonian with a perturbative expansion of both light and matter components, along with spatial coarse-graining. This approach extends semiclassical cavity spectroscopy to multimode light-matter interactions, providing full access to spatially resolved transient spectra. By simulating a microscopy experiment with counter-propagating pump and probe pulses, we compute the differential transmission and show how molecular dephasing and persistent dark exciton populations drive sub-group-velocity transport of the root-mean-square displacement. We analyze transport across the polariton dispersion, showing how velocity renormalization correlates with excitonic weight, consistent with experimental observations, and further its dependence on the rate of molecular dephasing. Our results highlight the need to consider measured spectroscopic observables when characterizing transport in polaritonic systems.</description>
