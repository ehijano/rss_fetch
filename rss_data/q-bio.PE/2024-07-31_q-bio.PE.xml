      <title>Information index augmented eRG to model vaccination behaviour: A case study of COVID-19 in the US</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent pandemics triggered the development of a number of mathematical models and computational tools apt at curbing the socio-economic impact of these and future pandemics. The need to acquire solid estimates from the data led to the introduction of effective approaches such as the \emph{epidemiological Renormalization Group} (eRG). A recognized relevant factor impacting the evolution of pandemics is the feedback stemming from individuals' choices. The latter can be taken into account via the \textit{information index} which accommodates the information--induced perception regarding the status of the disease and the memory of past spread. We, therefore, show how to augment the eRG by means of the information index. We first develop the {\it behavioural} version of the eRG and then test it against the US vaccination campaign for COVID-19. We find that the behavioural augmented eRG improves the description of the pandemic dynamics of the US divisions for which the epidemic peak occurs after the start of the vaccination campaign. Our results strengthen the relevance of taking into account the human behaviour component when modelling pandemic evolution. To inform public health policies, the model can be readily employed to investigate the socio-epidemiological dynamics, including vaccination campaigns, for other regions of the world.</description>

      <title>Integrating Agent-Based and Compartmental Models for Infectious Disease Modeling: A Novel Hybrid Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the spatial integration of agent-based models (ABMs) and compartmental models in infectious disease modeling, presenting a novel hybrid approach and studying its implications. ABMs, characterized by individual agent interactions and decision-making, offer detailed insights but are computationally intensive for large populations. Compartmental models, based on differential equations, provide population-level dynamics but lack granular detail. Our hybrid model aims to balance the granularity of ABMs with the computational efficiency of compartmental models, offering a more nuanced understanding of disease spread in diverse scenarios, including large populations. We developed a custom ABM and a compartmental model, analyzing their infectious disease dynamics separately before integrating them into a hybrid model. This integration involved spatial coupling of discrete and continuous populations and evaluating the consistency of disease dynamics at the macro scale. Our key objectives were to assess the effect of model hybridization on resulting infection dynamics, and to quantify computational cost savings of the hybrid approach over the ABM. We show that the hybrid approach can significantly reduce computational costs, but is sensitive to between-model differences, highlighting that model equivalence is a crucial component of hybrid modeling approaches.
