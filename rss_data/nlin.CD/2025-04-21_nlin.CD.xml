      <title>Predicting Forced Responses of Probability Distributions via the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem and Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel data-driven framework for estimating the response of higher-order moments of nonlinear stochastic systems to small external perturbations. The classical Generalized Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (GFDT) links the unperturbed steady-state distribution to the system's linear response. Standard implementations rely on Gaussian approximations, which can often accurately predict the mean response but usually introduce significant biases in higher-order moments, such as variance, skewness, and kurtosis. To address this limitation, we combine GFDT with recent advances in score-based generative modeling, which enable direct estimation of the score function from data without requiring full density reconstruction. Our method is validated on three reduced-order stochastic models relevant to climate dynamics: a scalar stochastic model for low-frequency climate variability, a slow-fast triad model mimicking key features of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and a six-dimensional stochastic barotropic model capturing atmospheric regime transitions. In all cases, the approach captures strongly nonlinear and non-Gaussian features of the system's response, outperforming traditional Gaussian approximations.</description>

      <title>Denoising and Reconstruction of Nonlinear Dynamics using Truncated Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements acquired from distributed physical systems are often sparse and noisy. Therefore, signal processing and system identification tools are required to mitigate noise effects and reconstruct unobserved dynamics from limited sensor data. However, this process is particularly challenging because the fundamental equations governing the dynamics are largely unavailable in practice. Reservoir Computing (RC) techniques have shown promise in efficiently simulating dynamical systems through an unstructured and efficient computation graph comprising a set of neurons with random connectivity. However, the potential of RC to operate in noisy regimes and distinguish noise from the primary dynamics of the system has not been fully explored. This paper presents a novel RC method for noise filtering and reconstructing nonlinear dynamics, offering a novel learning protocol associated with hyperparameter optimization. The performance of the RC in terms of noise intensity, noise frequency content, and drastic shifts in dynamical parameters are studied in two illustrative examples involving the nonlinear dynamics of the Lorenz attractor and adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire system (AdEx). It is shown that the denoising performance improves via truncating redundant nodes and edges of the computing reservoir, as well as properly optimizing the hyperparameters, e.g., the leakage rate, the spectral radius, the input connectivity, and the ridge regression parameter. Furthermore, the presented framework shows good generalization behavior when tested for reconstructing unseen attractors from the bifurcation diagram. Compared to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), the presented RC framework yields competitive accuracy at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and high-frequency ranges.</description>

      <title>Using Machine Learning and Neural Networks to Analyze and Predict Chaos in Multi-Pendulum and Chaotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A chaotic system is a highly volatile system characterized by its sensitive dependence on initial conditions and outside factors. Chaotic systems are prevalent throughout the world today: in weather patterns, disease outbreaks, and even financial markets. Chaotic systems are seen in every field of science and humanities, so being able to predict these systems is greatly beneficial to society. In this study, we evaluate 10 different machine learning models and neural networks [1] based on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R^2 values for their ability to predict one of these systems, the multi-pendulum. We begin by generating synthetic data representing the angles of the pendulum over time using the Runge Kutta Method for solving 4th Order Differential Equations (ODE-RK4) [2]. At first, we used the single-step sliding window approach, predicting the 50st step after training for steps 0-49 and so forth. However, to more accurately cover chaotic motion and behavior in these systems, we transitioned to a time-step based approach. Here, we trained the model/network on many initial angles and tested it on a completely new set of initial angles, or 'in-between' to capture chaotic motion to its fullest extent. We also evaluated the stability of the system using Lyapunov exponents. We concluded that for a double pendulum, the best model was the Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM)[3] for the sliding window and time step approaches in both friction and frictionless scenarios. For triple pendulum, the Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN)[4] was the best for the sliding window and Gated Recurrent Network (GRU) [5] was the best for the time step approach, but for friction, LSTM was the best.</description>
