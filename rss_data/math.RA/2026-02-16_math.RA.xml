      <title>Coalgebra measurings, cyclic theory and homologies of matrix algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider coalgebra measurings and the maps induced by them between Hochschild and cyclic homology of algebras. We show that these induced maps are well behaved with respect to the various structures appearing on Hochschild and cyclic homology, such as the $\lambda$-decomposition, the product structure, as well as the module structure of Hochschild homology over cyclic homology. Thereafter, we relate the maps between homology theories of algebras induced by a coalgebra measuring to those induced between homologies of matrix algebras. This is done in the following contexts: (a) cyclic homology and the primitive part of Lie algebra homology of the matrix algebra, (b) Hochschild homology and the primitive part of Leibniz homology of the matrix algebra, and (c) Dihedral homology of an involutive algebra and the primitive part of Lie algebra homology of symplectic or skew symmetric matrices.</description>

      <title>Jacobi algebras and Jacobi Novikov-Poisson algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of Jacobi Novikov-Poisson algebras and demonstrate that their affinization yields Jacobi algebras. We note that every unital differential Novikov-Poisson algebra is also a Jacobi Novikov-Poisson algebra. Additionally, any Jacobi Novikov-Poisson algebra gives rise to a Jacobi algebra, either by taking the commutator bracket of its underlying Novikov algebra or by using a derivation. We provide classifications of low-dimensional Jacobi Novikov-Poisson algebras including those of dimensions 2 and 3 over $\mathbb{C}$ up to isomorphism and show that the tensor product of two such algebras remains a Jacobi Novikov-Poisson algebra. Several further constructions of Jacobi Novikov-Poisson algebras from existing ones are also presented. The notion of Frobenius Jacobi Novikov-Poisson algebras is introduced, and several equivalent characterizations are established in terms of quadratic structures and integrals. Classifications of quadratic Jacobi Novikov-Poisson algebras of dimensions 2 and 3 over $\mathbb{C}$ are given. Finally, we provide an explicit construction of Frobenius Jacobi algebras using finite-dimensional quadratic Jacobi Novikov-Poisson algebras and finite-dimensional quadratic right Jacobi Novikov-Poisson algebras.</description>

      <title>Transposed Novikov-Poisson algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the definition of transposed Novikov-Poisson algebras, whose affinization are transposed Poisson algebras. Moreover, we show that there is a natural transposed Poisson algebra structure on the tensor product of a transposed Novikov-Poisson algebra and a right differential Novikov-Poisson algebra. A transposed Poisson algebra also naturally arises from a transposed Novikov-Poisson algebra by taking the commutator Lie algebra of the Novikov algebra. We show that the tensor products of two transposed Novikov-Poisson algebras are also transposed Novikov-Poisson algebras. Several constructions of transposed Novikov-Poisson algebras are presented. Moreover, transposed Novikov-Poisson algebras are closely related to $\frac{1}{2}$-derivations of the associated Novikov algebras. By using $\frac{1}{2}$-derivations, we show that there are non-trivial transposed Novikov-Poisson algebra structures on solvable Novikov algebras with some conditions. We also prove that if a non-trivial transposed Novikov-Poisson algebra is simple, then the associated Novikov algebra is simple. Therefore, if the base field is algebraically closed and of characteristic 0, then any simple transposed Novikov-Poisson is of dimension $1$. Transposed Novikov-Poisson algebra structures on some simple Novikov algebras are also characterized.</description>

      <title>Structures and comodules of Hom-post Lie coalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notions of Hom-tridendriform coalgebras and Hom-post-Lie coalgebras as the dual notions of Hom-tridendriform algebras and Hom-post-LIe algebras respectively. We give some properties related to them. Then, we study the relationships between them and their connection with post-Hom-Poisson coalgebras. Next, using the Yau stwisting in the modules case, we give some constructions of comodules over post-Hom-Lie coalgebras by twisting either the comodule structures or post-Hom-Lie coalgebra structures.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative pre-Poisson bialgebras and relative Rota-Baxter operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the bialgebra theory for coherent noncommutative pre-Poisson algebras and establish equivalences among matched pairs, Manin triples, the phase space of noncommutative Poisson algebras and noncommutative pre-Poisson bialgebras. The investigation of coboundary noncommutative pre-Poisson bialgebras naturally leads to the noncommutative pre-Poisson Yang-Baxter equation (NPP-YBE). We prove that a symmetric solution of the NPP-YBE gives rise to a (coboundary) noncommutative pre-Poisson bialgebra. Moreover, we demonstrate how solutions without the symmetry condition can also generate such bialgebras. This motivates the introduction of quasi-triangular and factorizable noncommutative pre-Poisson bialgebras.In particular, we show that a solution of the NPP-YBE with an invariant skew-symmetric part yields a quasi-triangular noncommutative pre-Poisson bialgebra.Such solutions are further interpreted as relative Rota-Baxter operators with weights. Finally, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between quadratic Rota-Baxter noncommutative pre-Poisson algebras and factorizable noncommutative pre-Poisson bialgebras.</description>

      <title>Complex to Rational Fast Matrix Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast matrix multiplication algorithms are asymptotically faster than the classical cubic-time algorithm, but they are often slower in practice. One important obstacle is the use of complex coefficients, which increases arithmetic overhead and limits practical efficiency. This paper focuses on transforming complex-coefficient matrix multiplication schemes into equivalent real- or rational-coefficient ones. We present a systematic method that, given a complex-coefficient scheme, either constructs a family of equivalent rational algorithms or proves that no equivalent rational scheme exists. Our approach relies only on basic linear-algebraic properties of similarity transformations of complex matrices. This method recovers the previously known ad hoc results of Dumas, Pernet, and Sedoglavic (2025) and extends them to more general settings, including algorithms involving rational coefficients and square roots, with $i=\sqrt{-1}$ as a special case.
  Using this framework, we show that no rational scheme is equivalent to Smirnov's $\langle4,4,9,104\rangle$ $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{161}]$ algorithm (2022) and that no real scheme is equivalent to the $\langle4,4,4,48\rangle$ complex algorithm of Kaporin (2024). More generally, our approach can also be used to prove the non-existence of integer-coefficient schemes.</description>

      <title>Discrete Invariants of Koszul Artin-Schelter Regular Algebras of Dimension four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the superpotentials for known families of Koszul Artin-Schelter regular algebras of dimension four using Magma, and apply Schur-Weyl duality from representation theory to determine the relevant invariants. Through the Borel-Weil theorem, we interpret these invariants as sections of line bundles over partial flag varieties, resulting in geometric invariants that, in some cases, correspond to K3 surfaces. We compute discrete invariants of these geometric invariants and use them to distinguish algebras.</description>

      <title>Monoidal invariance of the cohomological dimension of Hopf algebras: the finite case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A consequence of the recent work of Ren and Zhu on Gorenstein projective dimensions of modules over Hopf algebras is that if $A$ and $B$ are Hopf algebras with bijective antipodes having equivalent linear tensor categories of comodules and both having finite global dimensions, then their global dimensions coincide. In this note we provide a direct proof of this result, without using Gorenstein projective dimensions, and we notice that the assumption on the bijectivity of the antipodes can be removed.</description>

      <title>Formalizing Gr\"obner Basis Theory in Lean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a formalization of Gr\"obner basis theory in Lean 4, built on top of Mathlib's infrastructure for multivariate polynomials and monomial orders. Our development covers the core foundations of Gr\"obner basis theory, including polynomial division with remainder, Buchberger's criterion, and the existence and uniqueness of reduced Gr\"obner bases. We develop the theory uniformly for polynomial rings indexed by arbitrary types, enabling the treatment of Gr\"obner bases in rings with infinitely many variables. Furthermore, we connect the finite and infinite settings by showing that infinite-variable reduced Gr\"obner bases can be characterized via reduced Gr\"obner bases on finite-variable subrings through monomial-order embeddings and filter-based limit constructions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal G\simeq H\rtimes\Gamma$ be the semidirect product of a finite group $H$ and $\Gamma\simeq\mathbb Z_p$. Let $ F/\mathbb Q_p$ be a finite extension with ring of integers $\mathcal O_F$. Then the total ring of quotients $\mathcal Q^F(\mathcal G)$ of the completed group ring $\mathcal O_F[[\mathcal G]]$ is semisimple artinian. We determine its Wedderburn decomposition in full generality in terms of the Wedderburn decomposition of the group ring $ F[H]$. Such a description was previously available only for those simple components for which a certain associated field extension is totally ramified.</description>

      <title>The images of the higher generators via the evaluation map for the affine Yangian of type $A$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The affine Yangian associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n)$ has several presentations: the current presentation, the minimalistic presentation and so on. The evaluation map for the affine Yangian was given by using the minimalistic presentation. One of the issues about the evaluation map is that the images of the evaluation maps are unkown except on finitely many generators. In this article, we write down the images of the higher generators of the current presentation via the evaluation map for the affine Yangian of type $A$ explicitly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.04556v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an integral matrix and let $P$ be the convex hull of its columns. By a result of Gelfand, Kapranov and Zelevinski, the so-called principal $A$-determinant locus is equal to the union of the closures of the discriminant loci of the Laurent polynomials associated to the faces of $P$ that are hypersurfaces. In this short note we show that it is also the straightforward union of all the discriminant loci, i.e. we may include those of higher codimension, and there is no need to take closures. This answers a question by Kite and Segal.</description>

Abstract: We define a Young subgroup of the braid group as a subgroup generated by an arbitrary subset of the Birman-Ko-Lee generators. We give an intrinsic description of such subgroups which yields, in particular, an easy criterion to decide membership. We also give an algorithm to write an element of a Young subgroup as a product of the generators. Our methods are based on analyzing the Hurwitz action on tuples over free groups via a diagrammatic approach.</description>

      <title>Double shuffle Lie algebra and special derivations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Racinet's double shuffle Lie algebra $\mathfrak{dmr}_0$ is a Lie subalgebra of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{tder}$ of tangential derivations of the free Lie algebra with generators $x_0,x_1$, i.e. of derivations such that $x_1\mapsto 0$ and $x_0\mapsto [a,x_0]$ for some element $a$. We prove: (1) $\mathfrak{dmr}_0$ is contained in the Lie subalgebra $\mathfrak{sder}$ of $\mathfrak{tder}$ of special derivations, i.e. satisfying the additional condition that $x_\infty\mapsto [b,x_\infty]$ for some element $b$, where $x_\infty:=x_1-x_0$; (2) $\mathfrak{dmr}_0$ is stable under the involution of $\mathfrak{sder}$ induced by the exchange of $x_0$ and $x_\infty$. The first statement: (a) says that any element of $\mathfrak{dmr}_0$ satisfies the "senary relation" (a fact announced without proof by Ecalle in 2011); (b) implies the inclusion $\mathfrak{dmr}_0\subset \mathfrak{krv}_2$ (which was proved by Schneps in 2012 only conditionally to the truth of (1)). We also derive the analogues of statements (a) and (b) respective to Racinet's ``double shuffle schemes'' $\mathsf{DMR}_\mu(\mathbf k)$ and to the Betti double shuffle group $\mathsf{DMR}^{\mathrm{B}}(\mathbf k)$ introduced in our earlier work.</description>
