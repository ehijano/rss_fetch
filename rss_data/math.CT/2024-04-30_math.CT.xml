      <title>Monadic aspects of the ideal lattice functor on the category of distributive lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the construction of the frame of ideals from a distributive lattice induces a monad whose algebras are precisely the frames and frame homomorphisms. Using the Fakir construction of an idempotent approximation of a monad, we extend B. Jacobs' results on lax idempotent monads and show that the sequence of monads and comonads generated by successive iterations of this ideal functor on its algebras and coalgebras do not strictly lead to a new category. We further extend this result and provide a new proof of the equivalence between distributive lattices and coherent frames by showing that when the first inductive step in the Fakir construction is the identity monad, then the ambient category is equivalent to the free algebras.</description>

      <title>Hilbert series of representations of categories of $G$-sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group. A contravariant functor from the category of finite free $G$-sets to vector spaces has an associated Hilbert series, which records the underlying sequence of $G^n$ representations, $n \in \mathbb N$. We prove that this Hilbert series is rational with denominator given by linear polynomials with coefficients in the field generated by the character table of $G$.</description>

      <title>Homotopical models for metric spaces and completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.00147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Categories enriched in the opposite poset of non-negative reals can be viewed as generalizations of metric spaces, known as Lawvere metric spaces. In this article, we develop model structures on the categories $\mathbb{R}\text-\mathbf{Cat}$ and $\mathbb{R}\text-\mathbf{Cat}^\mathrm{sym}$ of Lawvere metric spaces and symmetric Lawvere metric spaces, each of which capture different features pertinent to the study of metric spaces. More precisely, in the three model structures we construct, the fibrant-cofibrant objects are the extended metric spaces (in the usual sense), the Cauchy complete Lawvere metric spaces, and the Cauchy complete extended metric spaces, respectively. Finally, we show that two of these model structures are unique in a similar way to the canonical model structure on $\mathbf{Cat}$.</description>

      <title>Free and co-free constructions for Hopf categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that under mild conditions on the monoidal base category $\mathcal V$, the category ${\sf VHopf}$ of Hopf $\mathcal V$-categories is locally presentable and deduce the existence of free and cofree Hopf categories. We also provide an explicit description of the free and cofree Hopf categories over a semi-Hopf category. One of the conditions on the base category $\mathcal V$, states that endofunctors obtained by tensoring with a fixed object preserve jointly monic families, which leads us to the notion of ``very flat monoidal product'', which we investigate in particular for module categories.</description>

      <title>Exact weights and path metrics for triangulated categories and the derived category of persistence modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define exact weights on a triangulated category to be nonnegative functions on objects satisfying a subadditivity condition with respect to exact triangles. Such weights induce a metric on objects in the triangulated category, which we call a path metric. Our exact weights generalize the rank functions of J.\ Chuang and A.\ Lazarev and are analogous to the exact weights for an exact category given by the first author and J.\ Scott and D.\ Stanley. We show that cohomological functors from a triangulated category to an abelian category with an additive weight induce an exact weight on the triangulated category. We prove that triangle equivalences induce an isometry for the path metrics induced by cohomological functors. In the perfectly generated or compactly generated case, we use Brown representability to express the exact weight on the triangulated category. We give three characterizations of exactness for a weight on a triangulated category and show that they are equivalent. We also define Wasserstein distances for triangulated categories. Finally, we apply our work to derived categories of persistence modules and to representations of continuous quivers of type $\mathbb{A}$.</description>

      <title>Homology and homotopy for arbitrary categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03735v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the prime motivation for topology was Homotopy theory, which captures the general idea of a continuous transformation between two entities, which may be spaces or maps. In later decades, an algebraic formulation of topology was discovered with the development of Homology theory. Some of the deepest results in topology are about the connections between Homotopy and Homology. These results are proved using intricate constructions. This paper re-proves these connections via an axiomatic approach that provides a common ground for homotopy and homology in arbitrary categories. One of the main contributions is a re-interpretation of convexity as an extrinsic rather than intrinsic property. All the axioms and results are applicable for the familiar notions of homology and homotopy for topological spaces. We also provide a recipe for making the axioms come to fruition in arbitrary categories.</description>

      <title>Globalization of partial inverse semigroupoid actions on sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that every partial action of an inverse semigroupoid on a set admits a universal globalization. Moreover, we show that our construction gives a reflector from the category of partial actions on the full subcategory of global actions. Finally, we investigate if the mediating function given by the universal property of our construction is injective.</description>

      <title>Singularity categories via McKay quivers with potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2018, Kalck and Yang showed that the singularity categories associated with 3-dimensional Gorenstein quotient singularities are triangle equivalent (up to direct summands) to small cluster categories associated with McKay quivers with potential. We introduce graded McKay quivers with potential and generalize Kalck-Yang's theorem to arbitrary dimensions. The singularity categories we consider occur as stable categories of categories of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules. We refine our description of the singularity categories by showing that these categories of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules are equivalent to Higgs categories in the sense of Wu. Moreover, we describe the singularity categories in the non-Gorenstein case.</description>
