      <title>Two Roads to Koopman Operator Theory for Control: Infinite Input Sequences and Operator Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Koopman operator, originally defined for dynamical systems without input, has inspired many applications in control. Yet, the theoretical foundations underpinning this progress in control remain underdeveloped. This paper investigates the theoretical structure and connections between two extensions of Koopman theory to control: (i) Koopman operator via infinite input sequences and (ii) the Koopman control family. Although these frameworks encode system information in fundamentally different ways, we show that under certain conditions on the function spaces they operate on, they are equivalent. The equivalence is both in terms of the actions of the Koopman-based formulations in each framework as well as the function values on the system trajectories. Our analysis provides constructive tools to translate between the frameworks, offering a unified perspective for Koopman methods in control.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Disturbance Rejection Control of Triangularly Coupled Loop Thermosyphon System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the stability of a triangularly coupled triple loop thermosyphon system with momentum and heat exchange at the coupling point as well as the existence of disturbances. The controller consists of a single, local state feedback. From the stability analysis, we obtain explicit bounds on the feedback gains, which depend on the Rayleigh numbers and the momentum coupling parameter, but independent of the thermal coupling parameter. The existence of the stability bounds allows us to design decentralized adaptive controllers to automatically search for the feasible gains when the system parameters are unknown. In the case of existing disturbances in the system, we approximate the disturbances via an extended state observer for the purpose of disturbance rejection. Numerical results are given to demonstrate the performance of the proposed decentralized disturbance rejection controller design.</description>

      <title>An Iterative Problem-Driven Scenario Reduction Framework for Stochastic Optimization with Conditional Value-at-Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scenario reduction (SR) alleviates the computational complexity of scenario-based stochastic optimization with conditional value-at-risk (SBSO-CVaR) by identifying representative scenarios to depict the underlying uncertainty and tail risks. Existing distribution-driven SR methods emphasize statistical similarity but often exclude extreme scenarios, leading to weak tail-risk awareness and insufficient problem-specific representativeness. Instead, this paper proposes an iterative problem-driven scenario reduction framework. Specifically, we integrate the SBSO-CVaR problem structure into SR process and project the original scenario set from the distribution space onto the problem space. Subsequently, to minimize the SR optimality gap with acceptable computation complexity, we propose a tractable iterative problem-driven scenario reduction (IPDSR) method that selects representative scenarios that best approximate the optimality distribution of the original scenario set while preserving tail risks. Furthermore, the iteration process is rendered as a mixed-integer program to enable scenario partitioning and representative scenarios selection. And ex-post problem-driven evaluation indices are proposed to evaluate the SR performance. Numerical experiments show IPDSR significantly outperforms existing SR methods by achieving an optimality gap of less than 1% within an acceptable computation time.</description>

      <title>Minimisation of Submodular Functions Using Gaussian Zeroth-Order Random Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the minimisation problem of submodular functions and investigate the application of a zeroth-order method to this problem. The method is based on exploiting a Gaussian smoothing random oracle to estimate the smoothed function gradient. We prove the convergence of the algorithm to a global $\epsilon$-approximate solution in the offline case and show that the algorithm is Hannan-consistent in the online case with respect to static regret. Moreover, we show that the algorithm achieves $O(\sqrt{NP_N^\ast})$ dynamic regret, where $N$ is the number of iterations and $P_N^\ast$ is the path length. The complexity analysis and hyperparameter selection are presented for all the cases. The theoretical results are illustrated via numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Bilevel Optimization with Gradient Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization (BLO) offers a principled framework for hierarchical decision-making and has been widely applied in machine learning tasks such as hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning. While existing BLO methods are mostly developed in Euclidean spaces, many real-world problems involve structural constraints. In this paper, we propose a Riemannian bilevel optimization (RBLO) algorithm that incorporates a bilevel descent aggregation (BDA) scheme to jointly coordinate upper- and lower-level updates. Concretely, first we abstract the constraints in the BLO to a manifold structure and then transform the constrained BLO be a unconstrained RBLO problem. Second, to address limitations of existing RBLO methods, particularly the restrictive assumptions required for convergence, we reformulate the bilevel problem using smooth manifold mappings and provide a convergence analysis under the conditions of geodesic convexity and Lipschitz smoothness. Finally, we recall the multi-view hypergraph spectral clustering task, and evaluate the proposed approach on 3sources data sets. The numerical results validate the superior performance over Euclidean and manifold-based baselines.</description>

      <title>Turnpike property for hierarchical optimal control problems: from particle systems to hydrodynamic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with a hierarchical framework of optimal control problems connecting interacting particle systems, the mean field limit equations, and associated hydrodynamic models. By assuming the existence of solutions, we establish the exponential turnpike property for each level of the hierarchy, showing that optimal trajectories remain close to the associated steady states over long time horizons. The results demonstrate that the exponential turnpike behavior persists consistently across scales, providing a unified connection between microscopic, kinetic, and macroscopic optimal control frameworks.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction Techniques for Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimisation (BO) is a standard approach for sample-efficient global optimisation of expensive black-box functions, yet its scalability to high dimensions remains challenging. Here, we investigate nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques that reduce the problem to a sequence of low-dimensional Latent-Space BO (LSBO). While early LSBO methods used (linear) random projections (Wang et al., 2013), building on Grosnit et al. (2021), we employ Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for LSBO, focusing on deep metric loss for structured latent manifolds and VAE retraining to adapt the encoder-decoder to newly sampled regions. We propose some changes in their implementation, originally designed for tasks such as molecule generation, and reformulate the algorithm for broader optimisation purposes. We then couple LSBO with Sequential Domain Reduction (SDR) directly in the latent space (SDR-LSBO), yielding an algorithm that narrows the latent search domains as evidence accumulates. Implemented in a GPU-accelerated BoTorch stack with Matern-5/2 Gaussian process surrogates, our numerical results show improved optimisation quality across benchmark tasks and that structured latent manifolds improve BO performance. Additionally, we compare random embeddings and VAEs as two mechanisms for dimensionality reduction, showing that the latter outperforms the former. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to combine SDR with VAE-based LSBO, and our analysis clarifies design choices for metric shaping and retraining that are critical for scalable latent space BO. For reproducibility, our source code is available at https://github.com/L-Lok/Nonlinear-Dimensionality-Reduction-Techniques-for-Bayesian-Optimization.git.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Optimization with Random Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit random search for stochastic optimization, where only noisy function evaluations are available. We show that the method works under weaker smoothness assumptions than previously considered, and that stronger assumptions enable improved guarantees. In the finite-sum setting, we design a variance-reduced variant that leverages multiple samples to accelerate convergence. Our analysis relies on a simple translation invariance property, which provides a principled way to balance noise and reduce variance.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Data-Driven Contextual Robust Optimization: An End-to-End Learning Approach for Online Energy Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional end-to-end contextual robust optimization models are trained for specific contextual data, requiring complete retraining whenever new contextual information arrives. This limitation hampers their use in online decision-making problems such as energy scheduling, where multiperiod optimization must be solved every few minutes. In this paper, we propose a novel Data-Driven Contextual Uncertainty Set, which gives rise to a new End-to-End Data-Driven Contextual Robust Optimization model. For right-hand-side uncertainty, we introduce a reformulation scheme that enables the development of a variant of the Column-and-Constraint Generation (CCG) algorithm. This new CCG method explicitly considers the contextual vector within the cut expressions, allowing previously generated cuts to remain valid for new contexts, thereby significantly accelerating convergence in online applications. Numerical experiments on energy and reserve scheduling problems, based on classical test cases and large-scale networks (with more than 10,000 nodes), demonstrate that the proposed method reduces computation times and operational costs while capturing context-dependent risk structures. The proposed framework (model and method), therefore, offers a unified, scalable, and prescriptive approach to robust decision-making under uncertainty, effectively bridging data-driven learning and optimization.</description>

      <title>A Split-Client Approach to Second-Order Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second-order methods promise faster convergence but are rarely used in practice because Hessian computations and decompositions are far more expensive than gradients. We propose a \emph{split-client} framework where gradients and curvature are computed asynchronously by separate clients. This abstraction captures realistic delays and inexact Hessian updates while avoiding the manual tuning required by Lazy Hessian methods. Focusing on cubic regularization, we show that our approach retains strong convergence guarantees and achieves a provable wall-clock speedup of order $\sqrt{\tau}$, where $\tau$ is the relative time needed to compute and decompose the Hessian compared to a gradient step. Since $\tau$ can be orders of magnitude larger than one in high-dimensional problems, this improvement is practically significant. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets confirm the theory: asynchronous curvature consistently outperforms vanilla and Lazy Hessian baselines, while maintaining second-order accuracy.</description>

      <title>Optimization in Theory and Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithms for continuous optimization problems have a rich history of design and innovation over the past several decades, in which mathematical analysis of their convergence and complexity properties plays a central role. Besides their theoretical properties, optimization algorithms are interesting also for their practical usefulness as computational tools for solving real-world problems. There are often gaps between the practical performance of an algorithm and what can be proved about it. These two facets of the field -- the theoretical and the practical -- interact in fascinating ways, each driving innovation in the other. This work focuses on the development of algorithms in two areas -- linear programming and unconstrained minimization of smooth functions -- outlining major algorithm classes in each area along with their theoretical properties and practical performance, and highlighting how advances in theory and practice have influenced each other in these areas. In discussing theory, we focus mainly on non-asymptotic complexity, which are upper bounds on the amount of computation required by a given algorithm to find an approximate solution of problems in a given class.</description>

      <title>Interior-Point vs. Spatial Branching Approaches for Solving the AC Optimal Power Flow Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problem is a non-convex, NP-hard optimization task essential for secure and economic power system operation. Two prominent solution strategies are interior-point methods, valued for computational efficiency, and spatial branching techniques, which provide global optimality guarantees at higher computational cost. In this work, we also explore data-boosted variants that leverage historical operating data to enhance performance by guiding initialization in interior-point methods or constraining the search region in spatial branching. We conduct a comprehensive empirical comparison across networks of varying sizes and under both standard benchmark conditions and modified configurations designed to induce local optima. Our results show that data-boosted strategies can improve convergence and reduce computation times for both approaches. Spatial branching, however, remains computationally demanding, requiring further development for practical application. In contrast, modern interior-point solvers exhibit remarkable robustness, often converging to the global optimum even in challenging instances with multiple local solutions.</description>

      <title>A Unifying Convexification Framework for Chance-Constrained Programs via Bilinear Extended Formulations over a Simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chance-constrained programming is a widely used framework for decision-making under uncertainty, yet its mixed-integer reformulations involve nonconvex mixing sets with a knapsack constraint, leading to weak relaxations and computational challenges. Most existing approaches for strengthening the relaxations of these sets rely primarily on extensions of a specific class of valid inequalities, limiting both convex hull coverage and the discovery of fundamentally new structures. In this paper, we develop a novel convexification framework that reformulates chance-constrained sets as bilinear sets over a simplex in a lifted space and employs a step-by-step aggregation procedure to derive facet-defining inequalities in the original space of variables. Our approach generalizes and unifies established families of valid inequalities in the literature while introducing new ones that capture substantially larger portions of the convex hull. Main contributions include: (i) the development of a new aggregation-based convexification technique for bilinear sets over a simplex in a lower-dimensional space; (ii) the introduction of a novel bilinear reformulation of mixing sets with a knapsack constraint -- arising from single-row relaxations of chance constraints -- over a simplex, which enables the systematic derivation of strong inequalities in the original variable space; and (iii) the characterization of facet-defining inequalities within a unified framework that contains both existing and new families. Preliminary computational experiments demonstrate that our inequalities describe over 90\% of the facet-defining inequalities of the convex hull of benchmark instances, significantly strengthening existing relaxations and advancing the polyhedral understanding of chance-constrained programs.</description>

      <title>The Tree-SNE Tree Exists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The clustering and visualisation of high-dimensional data is a ubiquitous task in modern data science. Popular techniques include nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods like t-SNE or UMAP. These methods face the `scale-problem' of clustering: when dealing with the MNIST dataset, do we want to distinguish different digits or do we want to distinguish different ways of writing the digits? The answer is task dependent and depends on scale. We revisit an idea of Robinson &amp; Pierce-Hoffman that exploits an underlying scaling symmetry in t-SNE to replace 2-dimensional with (2+1)-dimensional embeddings where the additional parameter accounts for scale. This gives rise to the t-SNE tree (short: tree-SNE). We prove that the optimal embedding depends continuously on the scaling parameter for all initial conditions outside a set of measure 0: the tree-SNE tree exists. This idea conceivably extends to other attraction-repulsion methods and is illustrated on several examples.</description>

      <title>Reduced order method based Anderson-type acceleration method for nonlinear least square problems and large scale ill-posed problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the Anderson's type acceleration method for numerical optimizations. Most mathematical modeling problems can be formulated as constrained optimization. The necessary optimality condition is written as a fixed point problem in a Banach space. Anderson's acceleration method improves the convergence of the standard fixed point iteration by minimizing the total sum of residuals and updating solutions through an optimal linear combination of a sequence of iterates. Thus, it is a form of iterative method of retard which uses the history of solutions as a reduced order element method (ROM). The weights are determined optimally by the least squares problem based on the total residual. We analyze Anderson's method and the reduced order method (ROM) for nonlinear least squares problems of minimizing |F(x)| squared. That is, the solution is approximated by a linear combination of sequentially generated solutions, and then we minimize the equation error on the linear manifold spanned by the iterates. We use the reduced order Gauss Newton method to solve the least squares problem for |F(x)| squared on the linear solution manifold. For the linear equation case it is similar to Anderson's method. Anderson's method approximates the solution to the nonlinear ROM. We consider variable step size gradient and quasi Newton methods and the variable fixed point iteration to generate the solution basis, then combine these with ROM acceleration. It converges very rapidly if the condition number of matrix A is not large. The variable iterate with ROM acceleration is nearly optimal, and ROM also regularizes and stabilizes the convergence. We also consider a randomly overlapped Kaczmarz type method and develop an acceleration approach for large scale ill posed linear systems. Finally, we analyze the convergence of the ROM to the operator equation.</description>

      <title>Navigating the consequences of mechanical ventilation in clinical intensive care settings through an evolutionary game-theoretic framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying the effects of mechanical ventilation strategies and protocols in critical care requires analyzing data from heterogeneous patient-ventilator systems within the context of the clinical decision-making environment. This research develops a framework to help understand the consequences of mechanical ventilation (MV) and adjunct care decisions on patient outcome from observations of critical care patients receiving MV. Developing an understanding of and improving critical care respiratory management requires the analysis of existing secondary-use clinical data to generate hypotheses about advantageous variations and adaptations of current care. This work introduces a perspective of the joint patient-ventilator-care systems (so-called J6) to develop a scalable method for analyzing data and trajectories of these complex systems. To that end, breath behaviors are analyzed using evolutionary game theory (EGT), which generates the necessary quantitative precursors for deeper analysis through probabilistic and stochastic machinery such as reinforcement learning. This result is one step along the pathway toward MV optimization and personalization. The EGT-based process is analytically validated on synthetic data to reveal potential caveats before proceeding to real-world ICU data applications that expose complexities of the data-generating process J6. The discussion includes potential developments toward a state transition model for the simulating effects of MV decision using empirical and game-theoretic elements.</description>

      <title>Policy Transfer Ensures Fast Learning for Continuous-Time LQR with Entropy Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal decision-making strategies through interaction with an environment, yet training from scratch on complex tasks can be highly inefficient. Transfer learning (TL), widely successful in large language models (LLMs), offers a promising direction for enhancing RL efficiency by leveraging pre-trained models.
  This paper investigates policy transfer, a TL approach that initializes learning in a target RL task using a policy from a related source task, in the context of continuous-time linear quadratic regulators (LQRs) with entropy regularization. We provide the first theoretical proof of policy transfer for continuous-time RL, proving that a policy optimal for one LQR serves as a near-optimal initialization for closely related LQRs, while preserving the original algorithm's convergence rate. Furthermore, we introduce a novel policy learning algorithm for continuous-time LQRs that achieves global linear and local super-linear convergence. Our results demonstrate both theoretical guarantees and algorithmic benefits of transfer learning in continuous-time RL, addressing a gap in existing literature and extending prior work from discrete to continuous time settings.
  As a byproduct of our analysis, we derive the stability of a class of continuous-time score-based diffusion models via their connection with LQRs.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Sylvester-Fermat-Torricelli problem with application in disaster relief operations by UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural and human-made disasters can cause severe devastation and claim thousands of lives worldwide. Therefore, developing efficient methods for disaster response and management is a critical task for relief teams. One of the most essential components of effective response is the rapid collection of information about affected areas, damages, and victims. More data translates into better coordination, faster rescue operations, and ultimately, more lives saved. However, in some disasters, such as earthquakes, the communication infrastructure is often partially or completely destroyed, making it extremely difficult for victims to send distress signals and for rescue teams to locate and assist them in time. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as valuable tools in such scenarios. In particular, a fleet of UAVs can be dispatched from a mobile station to the affected area to facilitate data collection and establish temporary communication networks. Nevertheless, real-world deployment of UAVs faces several challenges, with adverse weather conditions--especially wind--being among the most significant. To address this, we develop a novel mathematical framework to determine the optimal location of a mobile UAV station while explicitly accounting for the heterogeneity of the UAVs and the effect of wind. In particular, we generalize the Sylvester problem to introduce the Sylvester-Fermat-Torricelli (SFT) problem, which captures complex factors such as wind influence, UAV heterogeneity, and back-and-forth motion within a unified framework. The proposed framework enhances the practicality of UAV-based disaster response planning by accounting for real-world factors such as wind and UAV heterogeneity. Experimental results demonstrate that it can reduce wasted operational time by up to 84%, making post-disaster missions significantly more efficient and effective.</description>

      <title>Portfolio Optimization of Indonesian Banking Stocks Using Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of investors in the Indonesia Stock Exchange has steadily increased, emphasizing the importance of portfolio optimization in balancing risk and return. The classical mean-variance optimization model, while widely applied, depends on historical return and risk estimates that are uncertain and may result in suboptimal portfolios. To address this limitation, robust optimization incorporates uncertainty sets to improve portfolio reliability under market fluctuations. This study constructs such sets using moving-window and bootstrapping methods and applies them to Indonesian banking stock data with varying risk-aversion parameters. The results show that robust optimization with the moving-window method, particularly with a smaller risk-aversion parameter, provides a better risk-return trade-off compared to the bootstrapping approach. These findings highlight the potential of the moving-window method to generate more effective portfolio strategies for risk-tolerant investors.</description>

      <title>Constrained bilinear optimal control of reactive evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider constrained bilinear optimal control of second-order linear evolution partial differential equations (PDEs) with a reaction term on the half line, where control arises as a time-dependent reaction coefficient and constraints are imposed on the state and control variables. These PDEs represent a wide range of physical phenomena in fluid flow, heat, and mass transfer. Existing computational methods for this type of control problems only consider constraints on control variables. In this paper, we propose a novel optimize-then-discretize framework for computing constrained bilinear optimal control with both state and control constraints. Unlike existing methods that derive optimality conditions directly from the PDE constraint, this framework first replaces the PDE constraint with an equivalent integral representation of the PDE solution. The integral representation, derived from the unified transform method, does not involve differential operators, and thus explicit expressions for necessary conditions of optimality can be derived using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions for infinite-dimensional optimization. Discretizing the optimality conditions results in a system of finite-dimensional smooth nonlinear equations, which can be efficiently solved using existing solvers without the need for specialized algorithms. This is in contrast with discretize-then-optimize methods that discretize the PDE first and then solve the optimality conditions of the approximated finite-dimensional problem. Computational results for two applications, namely nuclear reactivity control and water quality treatment in a reactor, are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Gradient Flows for the $p$-Laplacian Arising from Biological Network Models: A Novel Dynamical Relaxation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a scalar partial differential equation model for the formation of biological transportation networks. Starting from a discrete graph-based formulation on equilateral triangulations, we rigorously derive the corresponding continuum energy functional as the $\Gamma$-limit under network refinement and establish the existence of global minimizers. The model possesses a gradient-flow structure whose steady states coincide with solutions of the $p$-Laplacian equation. Building on this connection, we implement finite element discretizations and propose a novel dynamical relaxation scheme that achieves optimal convergence rates in manufactured tests and exhibits mesh-independent performance, with the number of time steps, nonlinear iterations, and linear solves remaining stable under uniform mesh refinement. Numerical experiments confirm both the ability of the scalar model to reproduce biologically relevant network patterns and its effectiveness as a computationally efficient relaxation strategy for solving $p$-Laplacian equations for large exponents $p$.</description>

      <title>High order Tensor-Train-Based Schemes for High-Dimensional Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a fully discrete scheme to solve a class of high-dimensional Mean Field Games systems. Our approach couples semi-Lagrangian (SL) time discretizations with Tensor-Train (TT) decompositions to tame the curse of dimensionality. By reformulating the classical Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Fokker-Planck equations as a sequence of advection-diffusion-reaction subproblems within a smoothed policy iteration, we construct both first and second order in time SL schemes. The TT format and appropriate quadrature rules reduce storage and computational cost from exponential to polynomial in the dimension. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our TT-accelerated SL methods achieve their theoretical convergence rates, exhibit modest growth in memory usage and runtime with dimension, and significantly outperform grid-based SL in accuracy per CPU second.</description>

Abstract: This paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions for a pair of randomised stopping times to form a saddle point of a zero-sum Dynkin game with partial and/or asymmetric information across players. The framework is non-Markovian and covers essentially any information structure. Our methodology relies on the identification of suitable super and submartingales involving players' equilibrium payoffs. Saddle point strategies are characterised in terms of the dynamics of those equilibrium payoffs and are related to their Doob-Meyer decompositions.</description>

Abstract: We propose the first parameter-free decentralized online learning algorithms with network regret guarantees, which achieve sublinear regret without requiring hyperparameter tuning. This family of algorithms connects multi-agent coin-betting and decentralized online learning via gossip steps. To enable our decentralized analysis, we introduce a novel "betting function" formulation for coin-betting that simplifies the multi-agent regret analysis. Our analysis shows sublinear network regret bounds and is validated through experiments on synthetic and real datasets. This family of algorithms is applicable to distributed sensing, decentralized optimization, and collaborative ML applications.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural ODE Operator Networks for PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for developing efficient surrogate models to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). However, existing approaches often overlook the domain knowledge inherent in the underlying PDEs and hence suffer from challenges in capturing temporal dynamics and generalization issues beyond training time frames. This paper introduces a deep neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) operator network framework, termed NODE-ONet, to alleviate these limitations. The framework adopts an encoder-decoder architecture comprising three core components: an encoder that spatially discretizes input functions, a neural ODE capturing latent temporal dynamics, and a decoder reconstructing solutions in physical spaces. Theoretically, error analysis for the encoder-decoder architecture is investigated. Computationally, we propose novel physics-encoded neural ODEs to incorporate PDE-specific physical properties. Such well-designed neural ODEs significantly reduce the framework's complexity while enhancing numerical efficiency, robustness, applicability, and generalization capacity. Numerical experiments on nonlinear diffusion-reaction and Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate high accuracy, computational efficiency, and prediction capabilities beyond training time frames. Additionally, the framework's flexibility to accommodate diverse encoders/decoders and its ability to generalize across related PDE families further underscore its potential as a scalable, physics-encoded tool for scientific machine learning.</description>

      <title>Self-Certifying Primal-Dual Optimization Proxies for Large-Scale Batch Economic Dispatch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has shown that optimization proxies can be trained to high fidelity, achieving average optimality gaps under 1% for large-scale problems. However, worst-case analyses show that there exist in-distribution queries that result in orders of magnitude higher optimality gap, making it difficult to trust the predictions in practice. This paper aims at striking a balance between classical solvers and optimization proxies in order to enable trustworthy deployments with interpretable speed-optimality tradeoffs based on a user-defined optimality threshold. To this end, the paper proposes a hybrid solver that leverages duality theory to efficiently bound the optimality gap of predictions, falling back to a classical solver for queries where optimality cannot be certified. To improve the achieved speedup of the hybrid solver, the paper proposes an alternative training procedure that combines the primal and dual proxy training. Experiments on large-scale transmission systems show that the hybrid solver is highly scalable. The proposed hybrid solver achieves speedups of over 1000x compared to a parallelized simplex-based solver while guaranteeing a maximum optimality gap of 2%.</description>

Abstract: Decentralized non-convex optimization is important in many problems of practical relevance. Existing decentralized methods, however, typically either lack convergence guarantees for general non-convex problems, or they suffer from a high subproblem complexity. We present a novel bi-level SQP method, where the inner quadratic problems are solved via ADMM. A decentralized stopping criterion from inexact Newton methods allows the early termination of ADMM as an inner algorithm to improve computational efficiency. The method has local convergence guarantees for non-convex problems. Moreover, it only solves sequences of Quadratic Programs, whereas many existing algorithms solve sequences of Nonlinear Programs. The method shows competitive numerical performance for an optimal power flow problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a Real-Time Iteration (RTI) scheme for distributed Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). The scheme transfers the well-known RTI approach, a key enabler for many industrial real-time NMPC implementations, to the setting of cooperative distributed control. At each sampling instant, one outer iteration of a bi-level decentralized Sequential Quadratic Programming (dSQP) method is applied to a centralized optimal control problem. This ensures that real-time requirements are met and it facilitates cooperation between subsystems. Combining novel dSQP convergence results with RTI stability guarantees, we prove local exponential stability under standard assumptions on the MPC design with and without terminal constraints. The proposed scheme only requires neighbor-to-neighbor communication and avoids a central coordinator. A numerical example with coupled inverted pendulums demonstrates the efficacy of the approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), primarily due to the curse of dimensionality induced by the non-stationarity of optimal policies. In this work, we study a natural actor-critic (NAC) algorithm that integrates recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures into a natural policy gradient (NPG) method and a temporal difference (TD) learning method. This framework leverages the representational capacity of RNNs to address non-stationarity in RL to solve POMDPs while retaining the statistical and computational efficiency of natural gradient methods in RL. We provide non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees for this method, including bounds on sample and iteration complexity to achieve global optimality up to function approximation. Additionally, we characterize pathological cases that stem from long-term dependencies, thereby explaining limitations of RNN-based policy optimization for POMDPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12013v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an S.o.S hierarchy of lower bounds for a polynomial optimization problem whose constraint is expressed as a matrix polynomial semidefinite inequality. Our approach involves utilizing a penalty function framework to directly address the matrix-based constraint, making it applicable to both discrete and continuous polynomial optimization problems. We investigate the convergence rates of these bounds in both types of problems. The proposed method yields a variant of Putinar's theorem, tailored for positive polynomials within a compact semidefinite set $\mathcal{X}$ defined by a matrix polynomial semidefinite constraint. More specifically, we derive novel insights into the convergence rates and bounds on the degree of the S.o.S polynomials required to certify positivity on $\mathcal{X}$, based on Jackson's theorem and a variant of the {\L}ojasiewicz inequality.</description>

Abstract: In broad terms, accessibility measures opportunities reachable (such as shops, residents, etc.) within a given time frame. Urban Rail Transit (URT) plays a crucial role in providing accessibility, but it is susceptible to disruptions. In city centers with dense public transport (PT) networks, travelers can often find alternative lines. However, in suburbs where PT is sparse, disruptions have a more significant impact on accessibility. The traditional approach consists in deploying bridge and replacement buses to mitigate URT disruptions without specific care to accessibility. Yet, the question arises: is this approach the most effective way to restore accessibility? To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose a bus re-routing method with the objective of restoring accessibility during URT disruptions. We formulate an integer program and develop a two-stage heuristic algorithm to maximize restored accessibility. The efficacy of our method is always the present assessed in \'Evry-Courcouronnes and Choisy-le-Roi, France. The results show that, compared to conventional replacement methods, our strategy improves accessibility in particular in the areas most affected by the disruption. Such results are observed even when no additional vehicles are deployed, and at the same time, achieving a reduction in the kilometers traveled. Despite it is well understood that accessibility is the most relevant benefit a transportation system can produce, this aspect is reflected by the traditional approaches in remediation to disruption. With this work, we show instead how to make accessibility the main guiding principle in remediation.</description>

      <title>Kernel-based Koopman approximants for control: Flexible sampling, error analysis, and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02811v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven techniques for analysis, modeling, and control of complex dynamical systems are on the uptake. Koopman theory provides the theoretical foundation for the popular kernel extended dynamic mode decomposition (kEDMD). In this work, we propose a novel kEDMD scheme to approximate nonlinear control systems accompanied by an in-depth error analysis. Key features are regularization-based robustness and an adroit decomposition into micro and macro grids enabling flexible sampling. But foremost, we prove proportionality, i.e., explicit dependence on the distance to the (controlled) equilibrium, of the derived bound on the full approximation error. Leveraging this key property, we rigorously show that asymptotic stability of the data-driven surrogate (control) system implies asymptotic stability of the original (control) system and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Fast Reflected Forward-Backward algorithm: achieving fast convergence rates for convex optimization with linear cone constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a Fast Reflected Forward-Backward (Fast RFB) algorithm to solve the problem of finding a zero of the sum of a maximally monotone operator and a monotone and Lipschitz continuous operator in a real Hilbert space. Our approach extends the class of reflected forward-backward methods by introducing a Nesterov momentum term and a correction term, resulting in enhanced convergence performance. The iterative sequence of the proposed algorithm is proven to converge weakly, and the Fast RFB algorithm demonstrates impressive convergence rates, achieving $o\left( \frac{1}{k} \right)$ as $k \to +\infty$ for both the discrete velocity and the tangent residual at the \emph{last-iterate}. When applied to minimax problems with a smooth coupling term and nonsmooth convex regularizers, the resulting algorithm demonstrates significantly improved convergence properties compared to the current state of the art in the literature. For convex optimization problems with linear cone constraints, our approach yields a fully splitting primal-dual algorithm that ensures not only the convergence of iterates to a primal-dual solution, but also a \emph{last-iterate} convergence rate of $o\left( \frac{1}{k} \right)$ as $k \to +\infty$ for the objective function value, feasibility measure, and complementarity condition. This represents the most competitive theoretical result currently known for algorithms addressing this class of optimization problems. Numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the convergence behavior of Fast RFB.</description>

      <title>A Unified Recursive Identification Algorithm with Quantized Observations Based on Weighted Least-Squares Type Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates system identification problems with Gaussian inputs and quantized observations under fixed thresholds. By reinterpreting the nonlinear effects induced by quantization as the product of the unknown parameter and an unknown nonlinear coefficient, this work establishes a novel weighted least-squares criterion that enables linear estimation of unknown parameters under quantized observations. Subsequently, a two-step recursive identification algorithm is constructed by estimating two unknown terms, which is capable of handling both Gaussian noisy and noise-free linear systems. Convergence analysis of this identification algorithm is conducted, demonstrating convergence in both almost sure and $L^{p}$ senses under mild conditions, with respective rates of $O(\sqrt{ \log \log k/k})$ and $O(1/k^{p/2})$, where $k$ denotes the time step. In particular, this algorithm offers an asymptotically efficient estimation of the variance of Gaussian variables using quantized observations. Furthermore, extensions to output-error systems are discussed, enhancing the applicability and relevance of the proposed methods. Two numerical examples are provided to validate these theoretical advancements.</description>

      <title>Feedback Stackelberg-Nash equilibria in difference games with quasi-hierarchical interactions and inequality constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15019v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of two-player deterministic finite-horizon difference games with coupled inequality constraints, where each player has two types of decision variables: one involving sequential interactions and the other simultaneous interactions. We refer to this class of games as quasi-hierarchical dynamic games and define a solution concept called the feedback Stackelberg-Nash (FSN) equilibrium. Under separability assumption on cost functions, we provide a recursive formulation of the FSN solution using dynamic programming. We show that the FSN solution can be derived from the parametric feedback Stackelberg solution of an associated unconstrained game involving only sequential interactions, with a specific choice of the parameters that satisfy certain implicit complementarity conditions. For the linear-quadratic case, we show that an FSN solution is obtained by reformulating these complementarity conditions as a single large-scale linear complementarity problem. Finally, we illustrate our results using a dynamic duopoly game with production constraints.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Smoothing Damped Newton Method for Large-Scale Mathematical Programs with Equilibrium Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bilevel hyperparameter optimization has received growing attention thanks to the fast development of machine learning. Due to the tremendous size of data sets, the scale of bilevel hyperparameter optimization problem could be extremely large, posing great challenges in designing efficient numerical algorithms. In this paper, we focus on solving the large-scale mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) derived from hyperparameter selection of L1 support vector classification (L1-SVC). We propose a highly efficient smoothing damped Newton method (SDNM) for solving such MPEC. Compared with most existing algorithms where subproblems are involved and solved by on-shelf packages, our approach fully takes advantage of the structure of MPEC and therefore is package-free. Moreover, the proposed SDNM converges to C-stationary point under MPEC-LICQ with subproblem enjoys a quadratic convergence rate under proper assumptions. Extensive numerical results over LIBSVM dataset show the superior performance of SDNM over other state-of-art algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Incorporating force bounds is crucial for realistic control implementations in physical systems. Here, we investigate the fastest possible synchronisation of a Li\'enard system to its limit cycle using a bounded external force. To tackle this challenging non-linear optimal control problem, our approach involves applying Pontryagin's Maximum Principle with a combination of analytical and numerical tools. We show that the optimal control develops a remarkably complex structure in phase space as the force bound is lowered. Trajectories rewound from the limit cycle's extreme points turn out to play a key role in determining the maximum number of control bangs for optimal connection. We illustrate these intricate features using the paradigmatic van der Pol oscillator model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers stochastic monotone variational inequalities whose feasible region is the intersection of a (possibly infinite) number of convex functional level sets. A projection-based approach or direct Lagrangian-based techniques for such problems can be computationally expensive if not impossible to implement. To deal with the problem, we consider randomized methods that avoid the projection step on the whole constraint set by employing random feasibility updates. In particular, we propose and analyze modified stochastic Korpelevich and Popov methods for solving monotone stochastic VIs. We introduce a modified dual gap function and prove the convergence rates with respect to this function. We illustrate the performance of the methods in simulations on a zero-sum matrix game.</description>

      <title>Which exceptional low-dimensional projections of a Gaussian point cloud can be found in polynomial time?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given $d$-dimensional standard Gaussian vectors $\boldsymbol{x}_1,\dots, \boldsymbol{x}_n$, we consider the set of all empirical distributions of its $m$-dimensional projections, for $m$ a fixed constant. Diaconis and Freedman (1984) proved that, if $n/d\to \infty$, all such distributions converge to the standard Gaussian distribution. In contrast, we study the proportional asymptotics, whereby $n,d\to \infty$ with $n/d\to \alpha \in (0, \infty)$. In this case, the projection of the data points along a typical random subspace is again Gaussian, but the set $\mathscr{F}_{m,\alpha}$ of all probability distributions that are asymptotically feasible as $m$-dimensional projections contains non-Gaussian distributions corresponding to exceptional subspaces.
  Non-rigorous methods from statistical physics yield an indirect characterization of $\mathscr{F}_{m,\alpha}$ in terms of a generalized Parisi formula. Motivated by the goal of putting this formula on a rigorous basis, and to understand whether these projections can be found efficiently, we study the subset $\mathscr{F}^{\rm alg}_{m,\alpha}\subseteq \mathscr{F}_{m,\alpha}$ of distributions that can be realized by a class of iterative algorithms. We prove that this set is characterized by a certain stochastic optimal control problem, and obtain a dual characterization of this problem in terms of a variational principle that extends Parisi's formula.
  As a byproduct, we obtain computationally achievable values for a class of random optimization problems including `generalized spherical perceptron' models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In multi-item screening, optimal selling mechanisms are challenging to characterize and implement, even with full knowledge of valuation distributions. In this paper, we aim to develop tractable, interpretable, and implementable mechanisms with strong performance guarantees in the absence of precise distributional knowledge. In particular, we study robust screening with a maximin ratio objective. We show that given the marginal support of valuations, the optimal mechanism is separable: each item's allocation probability and payment depend only on its own valuation and not on other items' valuations. However, we design the allocation and payment rules by leveraging the available joint support information. This enhanced separable mechanism can be efficiently implemented through randomized pricing for individual products, which is easy to interpret and implement. Moreover, our framework extends naturally to scenarios where the seller possesses marginal support information on aggregate valuations for any product bundle partition, for which we characterize a bundle-wise separable mechanism and its guarantee. Beyond rectangular-support ambiguity sets, we further establish the optimality of randomized grand bundling mechanisms within a broad class of ambiguity sets, which we term ``$\boldsymbol{\rho}-$scaled invariant ambiguity set".</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18792v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world black-box optimization problems have multiple conflicting objectives. Rather than attempting to approximate the entire set of Pareto-optimal solutions, interactive preference learning allows to focus the search on the most relevant subset. However, few previous studies have exploited the fact that utility functions are usually monotonic. In this paper, we address the Bayesian Optimization with Preference Exploration (BOPE) problem and propose using a neural network ensemble as a utility surrogate model. This approach naturally integrates monotonicity and supports pairwise comparison data. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and exhibits robustness to noise in utility evaluations. An ablation study highlights the critical role of monotonicity in enhancing performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a network inventory system motivated by one-way, on-demand vehicle sharing services. Under uncertain and correlated network demand, the service operator periodically repositions vehicles to match a fixed supply with spatial customer demand while minimizing costs. Finding an optimal repositioning policy in such a general inventory network is analytically and computationally challenging. We introduce a base-stock repositioning policy as a multidimensional generalization of the classical inventory rule to $n$ locations, and we establish its asymptotic optimality under two practically relevant regimes. We present exact reformulations that enable efficient computation of the best base-stock policy in an offline setting with historical data. In the online setting, we illustrate the challenges of learning with censored data in networked systems through a regret lower bound analysis and by demonstrating the suboptimality of alternative algorithmic approaches. We propose a Surrogate Optimization and Adaptive Repositioning algorithm and prove that it attains an optimal regret of $O(n^{2.5} \sqrt{T})$, which matches the regret lower bound in $T$ with polynomial dependence on $n$. Our work highlights the critical role of inventory repositioning in the viability of shared mobility businesses and illuminates the inherent challenges posed by data and network complexity. Our results demonstrate that simple, interpretable policies, such as the state-independent base-stock policies we analyze, can provide significant practical value and achieve near-optimal performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04649v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integer-order calculus often falls short in capturing the long-range dependencies and memory effects found in many real-world processes. Fractional calculus addresses these gaps via fractional-order integrals and derivatives, but fractional-order dynamical systems pose substantial challenges in system identification and optimal control due to the lack of standard control methodologies. In this paper, we theoretically derive the optimal control via linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for fractional-order linear time-invariant (FOLTI) systems and develop an end-to-end deep learning framework based on this theoretical foundation. Our approach establishes a rigorous mathematical model, derives analytical solutions, and incorporates deep learning to achieve data-driven optimal control of FOLTI systems. Our key contributions include: (i) proposing an innovative system identification method control strategy for FOLTI systems, (ii) developing the first end-to-end data-driven learning framework, Fractional-Order Learning for Optimal Control (FOLOC), that learns control policies from observed trajectories, and (iii) deriving a theoretical analysis of sample complexity to quantify the number of samples required for accurate optimal control in complex real-world problems. Experimental results indicate that our method accurately approximates fractional-order system behaviors without relying on Gaussian noise assumptions, pointing to promising avenues for advanced optimal control.</description>

Abstract: We propose a stochastic Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that ensures closed-loop chance constraint satisfaction for linear systems with general sub-Gaussian process and measurement noise. By considering sub-Gaussian noise, we can provide guarantees for a large class of distributions, including time-varying distributions. Specifically, we first provide a new characterization of sub-Gaussian random vectors using matrix variance proxy, which can more accurately represent the predicted state distribution. We then derive tail bounds under linear propagation for the new characterization, enabling tractable computation of probabilistic reachable sets of linear systems. Lastly, we utilize these probabilistic reachable sets to formulate a stochastic MPC scheme that provides closed-loop guarantees for general sub-Gaussian noise. We further demonstrate our approach in simulations, including a challenging task of surgical planning from image observations.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present a second-order numerical scheme to address the solution of optimal control problems constrained by the evolution of nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations arising from socio-economic dynamics. In order to design an appropriate numerical scheme for control realization, a coupled forward-backward system is derived based on the associated optimality conditions. The forward equation, corresponding to the Fokker-Planck dynamics, is discretized using a structure preserving scheme able to capture steady states. On the other hand, the backward equation, modeled as a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman problem, is solved via a semi-Lagrangian scheme that supports large time steps while preserving stability. Coupling between the forward and backward problems is achieved through a gradient descent optimization strategy, ensuring convergence to the optimal control. Numerical experiments demonstrate second-order accuracy, computational efficiency, and effectiveness in controlling different examples across various scenarios in social dynamics. This approach provides a reliable computational tool for the study of opinion manipulation and consensus formation in socially structured systems.</description>

Abstract: We address the optimal stopping of multidimensional Brownian motion in a bounded domain. Under a geometric condition, we provide a simple proof that the value function is the pointwise infimum of Dirichlet Laplacian potentials dominating the gain function. Weakening this condition, approximations from differential geometry and potential theory provide a similar result when the infimum is taken over a branching set of piecewise potentials.</description>

      <title>Faithful-Newton Framework: Bridging Inner and Outer Solvers for Enhanced Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Newton-type methods enjoy fast local convergence and strong empirical performance, but achieving global guarantees comparable to first-order methods remains challenging. Even for simple strongly convex problems, no straightforward variant of Newton's method matches the global complexity of gradient descent. While more sophisticated variants can improve iteration complexity, they typically require solving difficult subproblems with high per-iteration costs, leading to worse overall complexity. These limitations stem from treating the subproblem as an afterthought, either as a black box, yielding overly complex and impractical formulations, or in isolation, without regard to its role in advancing the optimization of the main objective. By tightening the integration between the inner iterations of the subproblem solvers and the outer iterations of the optimization algorithm, we introduce simple Newton-type variants, called Faithful-Newton framework, which, in a sense, remain faithful to the overall simplicity of classical Newton's method by retaining simple linear system subproblems. The key conceptual difference, however, is that the quality of the subproblem solution is directly assessed based on its effectiveness in reducing optimality, which in turn enables desirable convergence complexities across a variety of settings. Under standard assumptions, we show that our variants, depending on parameter choices, achieve global superlinear convergence, condition-number-independent linear convergence, and/or local quadratic convergence, even when using inexact Newton steps, for strongly convex problems; and competitive iteration complexity for general convex problems. Numerical experiments further demonstrate that our proposed methods perform competitively compared with several alternative Newton-type approaches.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transfer Mechanism for Municipal Soft-Budget Constraints in Newfoundland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02171v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Newfoundland and Labrador's municipalities face severe soft budget pressures due to narrow tax bases, high fixed service costs, and volatile resource revenues. We develop a Stackelberg style mechanism design model in which the province commits at t = 0 to an ex ante grant schedule and an ex post bailout rule. Municipalities privately observe their fiscal need type, choose effort, investment, and debt, and may receive bailouts when deficits exceed a statutory threshold. Under convexity and single crossing, the problem reduces to one dimensional screening and admits a tractable transfer mechanism with quadratic bailout costs and a statutory cap. The optimal ex ante rule is threshold-cap; under discretionary rescue at t = 2, it becomes threshold-linear-cap. A knife-edge inequality yields a self-consistent no bailout regime, and an explicit discount factor threshold renders hard budgets dynamically credible. We emphasize a class of monotone threshold signal rules; under this class, grant crowd out is null almost everywhere, which justifies the constant grant weight used in closed form expressions. The closed form characterization provides a policy template that maps to Newfoundland's institutions and clarifies the micro-data required for future calibration.</description>
