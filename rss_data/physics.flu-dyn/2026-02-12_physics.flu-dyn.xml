      <title>Comparison of the potential energy for different equilibrium configurations of symmetric and asymmetric floating drops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a numerical method for computing solutions to a free boundary problem arising from the equilibrium state of a floating drop. This numerical method is based on a Newton's method for the underlying nonlinear boundary value problems, and at each iterative step a Chebyshev spectral collocation method is employed. The problems considered here are those that can be described by using generating curves, and include problems in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$.
  The resulting nine-dimensional space of physical parameters is explored, and examples are given that highlight the potential energy of centrally located drops, wall-bound drops, and asymmetrical configurations in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Non-uniqueness of solutions to the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations is displayed, and also strong evidence of non-uniqueness of energy minimizers is given.</description>

      <title>Validation and extension of an analytic momentum availability model for the two-scale momentum theory of wind farm flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key parameter in the two-scale momentum theory of wind farm flows is the momentum availability, which quantifies the supply of momentum to a wind farm from various different momentum transport mechanisms (advection, pressure gradient, Coriolis, turbulence and unsteadiness). In this study, the contribution of each of these mechanisms to the momentum availability is evaluated directly from large-eddy simulation (LES) data in order to validate an analytic momentum availability model (Kirby, Dunstan, &amp; Nishino, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 976, 2023, A24). Application of the model to six wind farm cases, three with different atmospheric boundary-layer (ABL) heights and three with different turbine layouts, shows that the full model performs well across all cases, but that its linearized version increasingly overpredicts the momentum availability for increasing ABL heights. It is found that the overprediction is related to the ABL Rossby number, and based on this observation, we propose an extension of the original linear model, which improves its accuracy for the considered cases and makes it more generally applicable, in particular to cases with tall ABL heights or strong Coriolis forcing.</description>

      <title>Collective and nonlinear structure of wind power correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the correlation structure of wind power fluctuations in a farm of 80 turbines, sampled over 5 years. We report the presence of universal, collective, and nonlinear correlations, responsible for the excess persistency and intermittency of farm-aggregated power output. A first cross-correlation analysis of turbine production reveals a dynamical scaling transition (\`a la Family-Vicszek) from local decoherence to large-scale turbulence-driven scaling, and responsible for the geographical smoothing effect, previously reported beyond farm scale [M. M. Bandi, Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 028301 (2017)]. A second bivariate analysis shows the long-range correlation of non-Gaussian features, responsible for their amplification in total farm output. These findings provide a new perspective on wind power variability, highlighting the importance of nonlinear correlations in power production dynamics. By better characterizing these fluctuations, our results can inform strategies for grid management, storage optimization, and wind farm design, ultimately improving the integration of wind energy into modern power systems.</description>

      <title>PEST: Physics-Enhanced Swin Transformer for 3D Turbulence Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate simulation of turbulent flows is fundamental to scientific and engineering applications. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) offers the highest fidelity but is computationally prohibitive, while existing data-driven alternatives struggle with stable long-horizon rollouts, physical consistency, and faithful simulation of small-scale structures. These challenges are particularly acute in three-dimensional (3D) settings, where the cubic growth of spatial degrees of freedom dramatically amplifies computational cost, memory demand, and the difficulty of capturing multi-scale interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a Physics-Enhanced Swin Transformer (PEST) for 3D turbulence simulation. PEST leverages a window-based self-attention mechanism to effectively model localized PDE interactions while maintaining computational efficiency. We introduce a frequency-domain adaptive loss that explicitly emphasizes small-scale structures, enabling more faithful simulation of high-frequency dynamics. To improve physical consistency, we incorporate Navier--Stokes residual constraints and divergence-free regularization directly into the learning objective. Extensive experiments on two representative turbulent flow configurations demonstrate that PEST achieves accurate, physically consistent, and stable autoregressive long-term simulations, outperforming existing data-driven baselines.</description>

      <title>Comparing surface and deep horizontal distributions of depth-keeping particles in shallow fluid layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines whether the dispersion of passive particles at the free surface of a generic (nonturbulent) shallow flow can reliably represent the behavior of depth-keeping particles below the surface. A shallow configuration characterize many aquatic environments, such as coastal regions and lakes, where horizontal scales far exceed vertical ones, large-scale flow structures dominate, and observations are sometimes limited to the surface. We compare surface and subsurface horizontal velocities in both direction and magnitude, identifying distinct behaviors depending on the parameter $Re_F\delta^2$, where $Re_F$ is the Reynolds number based on forcing, and $\delta$ is the aspect ratio between the fluid layer depth and the horizontal forcing scale. At low $Re_F\delta^2$, deep flows match the surface flow in direction throughout the layer, but not in magnitude. At high $Re_F\delta^2$, the magnitude matches (outside the bottom boundary layer), but not always the direction. Despite these differences, for all $Re_F\delta^2$, surface particle patterns correlate with those in the upper quarter of the fluid layer. Filamentary structures caused by horizontal flow convergence remain spatially aligned within this region. Below it, at intermediate $Re_F\delta^2$, deep filaments become diffuse and eventually vanish. At high $Re_F\delta^2$, filaments persist at depth, but become spatially misaligned with surface filaments. These findings suggest that in shallow environments, surface observations can quantitatively infer subsurface transport processes in the upper quarter of the fluid layer. For the deeper part, knowledge of the vertical profiles of the mean flow yields insights into the horizontal transport processes.</description>

      <title>Towards a full-scale version of Yakhot's model of strong turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present first elements of an extension of Yakhot's model of strong turbulence towards small scales. The analysis is based on an empirically observed relation for even order structure functions which extends from the inertial into the dissipation range. With this relation and Kolmogorov's four-fifth law, models for structure functions of orders two and three can be derived that replicate expected small scale limits and describe the transition from dissipative to inertial range scaling regimes correctly. An additional length scale parameter is introduced by the extension. It marks the crossover point of inertial and dissipation range and can be expressed as a function of the Reynolds number. In combination with a recently proposed large-scale extension of Yakhot's model, we ultimately obtain full-scale models for structure functions of second and third order. These expressions are closed-form, do not contain free parameters and are in good agreement with experimental data from the smallest dissipative scales up to the system scale.</description>

      <title>Transonic Buffet Modeling via Invariant Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In transonic flow over aircraft wings, shock-boundary-layer interactions can give rise to transonic buffet, which degrades maneuverability through unsteady aerodynamic loads. Beyond its practical importance, two-dimensional transonic buffet represents a canonical example of a global instability for which reduced-order modeling remains challenging due to nonlinearity, sharp spatial gradients, and the coexistence of an unstable equilibrium with an attracting limit cycle. Commonly, reduced-order models of such phenomena capture nonlinear dynamics only in aerodynamic observables, while prediction of the full flow state is achieved through linear representations valid only near the unstable equilibrium or on the limit cycle.
  In this work, we present a reduced-order model that predicts the nonlinear evolution of the full flow field by exploiting the existence of an attracting two-dimensional invariant manifold. We adapt an existing data-driven framework for identifying invariant manifolds and the associated reduced dynamics, making it suitable for scaling to large-scale CFD applications. The invariant manifold is identified as a graph over its tangent space using an iterative encoder-update and the reduced dynamics are obtained via least-squares regression. A subsequent extended normal-form transformation enables physical interpretability of the model through a modal decomposition of the flow.
  The reduced-order model is identified for transonic buffet over the OAT15A supercritical airfoil, showing that it is possible to achieve this accurately using just a single training trajectory. Validation against independent simulations demonstrates accurate prediction of nonlinear behavior, together with reliable reconstruction of the full flow field, particularly in the late-transient and limit-cycle regimes.</description>

      <title>Accurate simulation of pulled and pushed fronts in the nonautonomous Fisher-KPP equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel numerical method for direct simulation of front propagation in the Fisher-KPP equation with a time-dependent parameter on an infinite domain. The method computes a time-dependent boundary condition that accurately captures the leading-edge dynamics by coupling the nonlinear simulation region to a linear approximation region in which the dynamics can be solved exactly via the Green's function of the linearized equation. This approach enables precise front velocity measurements on relatively small computational domains for a variety of nonautonomous regimes and initial conditions for which existing numerical methods break down. We apply the method to pulled and pushed fronts in the Fisher-KPP equation with quadratic and quadratic-cubic nonlinearities, finding that it improves the accuracy of the simulated front velocity even for constant parameters and a fixed domain size. For pulled fronts with a diffusion coefficient that increases algebraically in time, our results reveal a deviation from the natural asymptotic velocity predicted by linear theory, whose explanation requires nonlinear theory. For pushed fronts with constant parameters, the method reproduces the exponential convergence to the theoretical asymptotic front speed and profile with improved precision. For a slowly time-varying linear growth parameter, we find that the pushed front velocity follows the changing parameter adiabatically if the asymptotic pushed velocity remains faster than the natural asymptotic pulled velocity. As the growth parameter moves toward the pushed--pulled transition point, the competition between the pushed and pulled fronts can result in both delayed and even premature onset of the pushed--pulled transition, depending on the form of parameter growth. The numerical method presented here proves to be an effective tool for analyzing front propagation in nonautonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Effect of Reynolds number on triboelectric particle charging in turbulent channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triboelectric charging in particle-laden flows is a complex interplay of fluid and particle dynamics, collision mechanics, and electrostatics. In this study, we introduce triboFoam, an open-source solver built on the OpenFOAM framework, designed to simulate triboelectric charging in particle-laden turbulent flows. We validate triboFoam using Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of a fully developed turbulent channel flow at a friction Reynolds number of $Re_\tau = 180$. The results demonstrate good agreement with DNS data for particle concentration profiles and charge distributions. Then, we investigate the influence of Reynolds number on particle distribution and charging behaviour using Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) at varying friction Reynolds numbers up to $Re_\tau = 550$. Our findings reveal that higher Reynolds numbers lead to increased near-wall particle concentrations and enhanced charging rates, attributed to intensified turbulent fluctuations and elevated impact velocities. Finally, an empirical correlation is proposed to predict the average particle charging rate as a function of Reynolds number and particle diameter. With this work, we provide a tool for simulating triboelectric charging in complex geometries and turbulent flows, advancing the understanding of electrostatic phenomena in particle-laden systems. The empirical correlation offers practical insights for predicting charging behaviour in industrial applications and thus can contribute to improved safety and efficiency in processes involving particulate matter.</description>

      <title>Critical Reynolds Number as a Topological Phase Transition in Adaptive Fractional Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework that models the laminar-turbulent transition as a topological change in the dissipative operator. The order s of the fractional Laplacian is promoted from a fixed parameter to a dynamic field, governed by a variational principle that minimizes a regularized free-energy functional. This adaptive formulation continuously interpolates between the local, viscous dissipation of the Navier-Stokes equations and the non-local, anomalous dissipation characteristic of the inertial range in Kolmogorov turbulence. From this framework, we derive an analytical expression for the critical Reynolds number, Rec, by establishing a spectral balance condition where the effective dissipative capacity of the laminar operator is saturated.</description>

      <title>The search for the gust-wing interaction "textbook"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10968v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address whether complex physical relations can be investigated through the synergy of automated high-volume experiments and the reduction of large datasets to a concise, representative subset of canonical examples -- a "textbook". To this end, we consider the unsteady aerodynamics of wing-gust interactions, which is characterized by its rich, high-dimensional physics. We take advantage of a purpose-built gust generator to systematically produce over 1,000 distinct random gust events and to measure the unsteady loads induced on a delta wing. We then employ a data summarization procedure to identify representative subsets of increasing size from the large-scale database, which then serve as training data for a machine-learning model of the aerodynamic loads from sparse pressure measurements. An appropriately selected "textbook" of a few events can achieve predictive accuracy comparable to random training sets up to two orders of magnitude larger, capturing the intrinsic diversity of the full-scale data and enhancing modeling efficiency and interpretability. Our methodology evidences the potential of distilling the essential information contained in large amounts of experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Solitary waves of moderate amplitude in the SSGGN equations: the extended KdV-Whitham approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the extended Korteweg-de Vries (eKdV) equation as a model for long moderately nonlinear surface water waves. In the slow time formulation this equation generates fast propagating resonant radiation due to the non-convexity of its linear dispersion curve, which is not present in the strongly nonlinear Serre-Su-Gardner-Green-Naghdi (SSGGN) parent system. We show that the extended KdV-Whitham approximation and the slow space formulation of the eKdV equation are suitable regularisations of the eKdV equation in several cases of interest, and even for moderate amplitudes. Numerical comparisons are made between the SSGGN system and the respective reduced models, where simulations are initiated with an approximate soliton solution of the eKdV equation, constructed by use of Kodama-Fokas-Liu near-identity transformation to the KdV equation.</description>

      <title>Impact of Separation Distance on the Performance and Annual Energy Production of a Dual-Flap Oscillating Surge Wave Energy Converter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the different concepts for wave energy conversion, oscillating surge wave energy converters have been shown to have a high capture width ratio. The primary wave capture structure consists of a flap hinged at the seabed or to a floating platform. Different flap configurations, including single and dual-flap, have been investigated. The separation distance between the oscillating surge wave energy converters can have an impact on their response when deployed in arrays. We consider the case of a dual-flap oscillating surge wave energy converter and investigate the impact of the separation distance between them on the performance of each flap. We estimate the absorbed wave energy and the annual energy production by the two flaps when deployed at the PacWave South site. Inviscid numerical simulations were conducted to predict the response of the oscillating surge wave energy converters. The simulations are validated with experimental measurements of a 1:10 scaled model in a wave tank. The results show that for a short separation distance, the interaction between the oscillating surge wave energy converters has a destructive and constructive effect depending on the wave frequency. However, these effects tend to balance each other out when considering the broad range of wave excitations. For longer separation distances, the interaction always results in a constructive effect. The results reveal that the separation distance has an insignificant impact on annual energy production when considering all wave frequencies and amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Boiling flow parameter estimation from boundary layer data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence and aero-optic effects cause phase aberrations in propagating light waves, thereby reducing effectiveness in transmitting and receiving coherent light from an aircraft. Existing optical sensors can measure the resulting phase aberrations, but the physical experiments required to induce these aberrations are expensive and time-intensive. Simulation methods could provide a less expensive alternative. For example, an existing simulation algorithm called boiling flow, which generalizes the Taylor frozen-flow method, can generate synthetic phase aberration data (i.e., phase screens) induced by atmospheric turbulence. However, boiling flow depends on physical parameters, such as the Fried coherence length r0, which are not well-defined for aero-optic effects. In this paper, we introduce a method to estimate the parameters of boiling flow from measured aero-optic phase aberration data. Our algorithm estimates these parameters to fit the spatial and temporal statistics of the measured data. This method is computationally efficient and our experiments show that the temporal power spectral density of the slopes of the synthetic phase screens reasonably matches that of the measured phase aberrations from two turbulent boundary layer data sets, with errors between 8-9%. However, the Kolmogorov spatial structure function of the phase screens does not match that of the measured phase aberrations, with errors above 28%. This suggests that, while the parameters of boiling flow can reasonably fit the temporal statistics of highly convective data, they cannot fit the complex spatial statistics of aero-optic phase aberrations.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we derive asymptotic interface models for an elastic Muskat free boundary problem describing Darcy flow beneath an elastic membrane. In a weakly nonlinear regime of small interface steepness, we obtain nonlocal evolution equations that capture the free-boundary dynamics up to quadratic order. In the long-wave thin-film regime, we rewrite the kinematic condition in flux form, flatten the moving domain, and derive a lubrication-type equation. Moreover, we establish well-posedness for these models in suitable Wiener spaces.</description>

      <title>Acceleration Waves and the K-Condition in Viscoelastic Solids and Non-Newtonian Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The K-condition introduced by Shizuta and Kawashima provides a sufficient criterion for the global existence of smooth solutions to dissipative hyperbolic systems. For genuinely nonlinear characteristic fields, a weaker K-condition becomes necessary, although not sufficient. In this paper, we analyze this weaker K-condition through the study of acceleration waves propagating in an equilibrium state. We investigate two classes of hyperbolic models: one describing viscoelasticity with linear dissipation, and the other non-Newtonian fluids asymptotically converging to a power-law behavior. For viscoelastic models, the weaker K-condition is always satisfied and acceleration waves remain bounded. For non-Newtonian fluids, the validity of the condition depends on the power-law index $m$: it holds for Newtonian fluids ($m=1$), is violated for shear-thinning fluids ($m&lt;1$), and leads to an instantaneous regularization of acceleration waves for shear-thickening fluids ($m&gt;1$).</description>

      <title>Self-similar Features in Secondary Breakup of a Droplet and Ligament Mediated Fragmentation under Extreme Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Droplet formation is relevant in many applications spanning natural and artificial settings. A physical understanding of aerobreakup or air-assisted secondary atomization and predicting size distributions in these applications is non-trivial. We show that extreme airflow speeds induce catastrophic breakup, which, although chaotic and seemingly obscure, is not hopelessly unstructured. In the present study, through shockwave-induced breakups, we investigate the associated intermediate processes at smaller spatiotemporal scales at very high Weber numbers ($We \sim 10^3-10^4$). We demonstrate that microscale protrusions decorate the disintegrating droplet interface and eventually fragment, resulting in the generation of daughter droplets. We discover these undulations to follow breakup patterns (sub-secondary breakup) that resemble a scaled-down version of secondary atomization. The consistent topology across a vast range of scales $(10^{-6}m-10^{-2}m)$ suggests a self-similar mechanism bridged by local Weber number. The normalized size distribution of the resultant droplets exhibits universality and $We$ invariance at all extreme conditions, including transient statistics for subsequent time periods. This conforms to a universal modified gamma distribution characterized by ligament shape factors, which tend toward the limiting behavior associated with the maximum corrugations physically possible. Scaling laws based on the $We$ are derived for the averaged diameter as $\sim We^{-1/3}$, using a high-energy aerodynamic breakup mechanism and subsequently used to derive a time-integrated distribution. These observations reinforce the idea of a self-similar mechanism for the catastrophic droplet breakups, encompassing multiscale deformation cascades, self-similar sub-secondary breakups, maximally corrugated ligaments, and universal droplet size distributions.</description>

      <title>Soap Film Drainage Using a Centrifugal Thin Film Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface bubbles are an abundant source of aerosols, with important implications for climate processes. In this context, we investigate the stability and thinning dynamics of soap films under effective gravity fields. Experiments are performed using a centrifugal thin-film balance capable of generating accelerations from 0.2 up to 100 times standard gravity, combined with thin-film interferometry to obtain time-resolved thickness maps. Across all experimental conditions, the drainage dynamics are shown to be governed by capillary suction and marginal regeneration-a mechanism in which thick regions of the film are continuously replaced by thin film elements (TFEs) formed at the meniscus. We consistently recover a thickness ratio of 0.8-0.9 between the TFEs and the adjacent film, in agreement with previous observations under standard gravity. The measured thinning rates also follow the predicted scaling laws. We identified that effective gravity has three distinct effects: (i) it induces a strong stretching of the initial film, extending well beyond the linear-elastic regime; (ii) it controls the meniscus size, and thereby the amplitude of the capillary suction and the drainage rate; and (iii) it reveals an inertia-to-viscous transition in the motion of TFEs within the film. These results are supported by theoretical modeling and highlight the robustness of marginal regeneration and capillary-driven drainage under extreme gravity conditions.</description>

Abstract: Based on the Jaffer (2023) heat engine analysis of natural convection, this investigation derives a novel, comprehensive formula predicting the natural convective heat transfer from an inclined cylinder given its length, diameter, angle, Rayleigh number, and the fluid's Prandtl number and thermal conductivity.
  The present formula was tested with 93 inclined cylinder measurements having length-to-diameter ratios between 1.48 and 104 in nine data-sets from three peer-reviewed studies, yielding (data-set) root-mean-squared relative error values between 2% and 4.7%.</description>

      <title>Mixing by offshore wind infrastructure: Resolving the density stratified wakes past vertical cylinders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Offshore wind is rapidly expanding to meet clean and secure energy needs. New developments are now increasingly constrained to deep seasonally stratified waters. Here, flows past offshore wind infrastructure will increase water column mixing, although such processes and their extent are poorly understood. Studies have so far been limited to: field-scale simulations, which make sweeping assumptions regarding flow-structure interactions and fine-scale stratified turbulence; and field observations, which are limited by the sparsity of measurement campaigns and data captured. To isolate and quantify the key processes governing water column mixing by infrastructure, we present the first structure-resolved direct numerical simulations of two-layer stratified flow past a vertical cylinder. We identify two wake regimes dependent on the flow Reynolds and Richardson numbers: i) A weakly stratified regime, characterised by a narrow but highly energetic wake dominated by horizontal shear, and ii) A strongly stratified wake, characterised by a thermocline-spanning recirculation cell attached to the cylinder. Here, strong vertical motions develop which are responsible for the formation of large-scale stationary internal waves. These waves account for up to 10% of the total energy budget, and provide a new mechanism for far field energy propagation. The weakly stratified wake regime is characteristic of existing offshore wind sites where temperature gradients are relatively weak; the newly identified strongly stratified regime describes the dynamics to be expected in new and future deep water offshore wind sites. This difference between the two regimes explains previously enigmatic field observations regarding wake persistence and detectability. These simulations provides a critical benchmark for validating future models and narrowing the gap between idealized simulations and field-scale flows.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic flows induced by localized torques (rotlets) in wedge-shaped geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wedge-shaped geometries in low-Reynolds-number flows are of increasing importance, for instance, in the design of microfluidic devices. The corresponding Green's functions describing the induced flow in response to a locally applied force were derived some time ago. To achieve a complete characterization of particle motion at low Reynolds numbers, we derive the flow response to locally applied torques. This is accomplished through a direct calculation based on the Fourier-Kontorovich-Lebedev transform using the Papkovich-Neuber representation of the hydrodynamic fields. We then illustrate the resulting flow fields, highlighting their structure, key features, and dependence on the geometry and orientation of the applied torque. Based on these solutions, we compute the corresponding hydrodynamic mobility tensor that couples torque and motion. Owing to the broken spatial symmetry imposed by the wedge-shaped confinement, a particle subjected to a torque will experience not only rotational motion but also translational motion. These results provide analytical tools relevant for predicting and controlling particle behavior in confined microfluidic environments.</description>

      <title>The stability of propagating plane inertial waves in rotating fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inertial waves transport energy and momentum in rotating fluids and are a major contributor to mixing and tidal dissipation in Earth's oceans, gaseous planets, and stellar interiors. However, their stability and breakdown mechanisms are not fully understood. We examine the linear stability and nonlinear breakdown of finite-amplitude propagating plane inertial waves using Floquet theory and direct numerical simulations. The Floquet analysis generalizes previous studies as it is valid for arbitrary perturbation wavelengths and primary wave amplitudes. We find that the wavenumber orientation of the most unstable perturbations depends strongly on the wave frequency and weakly on the wave amplitude. The most unstable perturbations have wavelengths that are small relative to the primary wave wavelength for low wave amplitudes, but become comparable for large wave amplitudes. We then use direct numerical simulations to follow the nonlinear breakdown of the wave and examine how the wave energy is either dissipated in a forward cascade or accumulated into long-lived geostrophic modes. Simulations reveal that the conversion efficiency into geostrophic modes increases with increasing wave amplitude, as expected for pumping of geostrophic modes by nearly-resonant triadic interactions. We also find that the conversion efficiency increases with decreasing primary wave frequency, which may be due to the more efficient coupling of quasi-2D waves to geostrophic modes. These results on the stability and breakdown of single plane inertial waves provides additional foundation for understanding the role of inertial waves in rotating turbulence, transport properties of inertial wave beams, and inertial wave propagation in more complex environments such as those with magnetic fields or shear flows.</description>

      <title>Near-inertial waves enhance vertical transport at ocean fronts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interactions between near-inertial waves (NIWs) and submesoscale currents in the surface ocean are challenging to deconvolve due to their overlapping temporal and spatial scales. The frequency of NIW is modulated by the relative vorticity, $\zeta$, of submesoscale currents, which varies between positive and negative $\zeta$ of $O(f)$ on spatial scales of 1 -- 10~$km$, particularly across fronts where the horizontal buoyancy gradient, $\nabla_H b$, is intensified. The effective NIW frequency $f_{\scriptstyle{eff}} = f + \zeta/2$ can therefore also vary by $O(f)$ on these scales, causing the waves to be out of phase. This generates periodic convergence and divergence in the surface layer, particularly at fronts. The resulting vertical motion, known as inertial pumping, is traditionally considered to be reversible. However, the strong vertical shear of the horizontal velocity at fronts, $v_z \sim |\nabla_H b|/f$, implies that not all of the water that is pumped downward will return. We examine the effect of this asymmetry on the vertical transport of tracers with an ambient vertical gradient, analogous to biogeochemical tracers, such as oxygen and dissolved organic carbon. Using numerical simulations of an unstable front forced by NIW, we demonstrate that inertial pumping can lead to net vertical tracer transport. Spectral analysis of the vertical tracer flux given by the covariance between tracer and vertical velocity anomalies reveals that the interaction of strong NIW with submesoscale currents enhances the vertical exchange at the front on both the sub-inertial and inertial time scales.</description>

      <title>Euler-Korteweg vortices: A fluid-mechanical analogue to the Schr\"odinger and Klein-Gordon equations</title>

Abstract: Quantum theory and relativity exhibit several formal analogies with fluid mechanics. This paper examines under which conditions a coherent classical fluid model may recover the most basic mathematical formalism of both theories. By assuming that the angular momentum of an irrotational vortex in an inviscid, barotropic, isothermal fluid with sound speed c is equal in magnitude to the reduced Planck constant, and incorporating Korteweg capillary stress, a complex wave equation describing the momentum and continuity equations of a Euler-Korteweg vortex is obtained. When uniform convection is introduced, the weak field approximation of this wave equation is equivalent to Schr\"odinger's equation. The model is shown to yield classical analogues to de Broglie wavelength, the Einstein-Planck relation, the Born rule and the uncertainty principle. Accounting for the retarded propagation of the wavefield of a vortex in convection produces the Lorentz transformation and the Klein-Gordon equation, with Schr\"odinger's equation appearing as the low-Mach-number limit. These results demonstrate that, under explicit assumptions, a classical continuum can recover some of the simplest mathematical formalisms of quantum and relativistic theory.</description>

Abstract: Viscosity, the internal friction of fluids, is among the most consequential yet underappreciated properties in physics. This paper explores what would happen if viscosity vanished from all fluids while other material properties remained unchanged. The consequences are catastrophic and universal. Aircraft cannot generate lift because circulation around wings requires viscous action. Rotating machinery seizes without lubricating fluid films. Cardiovascular systems lose the resistance necessary for pressure regulation. Rivers become violent torrents, aquifers drain in hours, and storms persist indefinitely without frictional dissipation. The pedagogical value lies in illuminating viscosity's role providing resistance, damping, and control across all scales - from cellular interiors to planetary atmospheres. Evolution, engineering, and climate have exploited viscous dissipation for billions of years; its absence would render complex life impossible and Earth uninhabitable. By imagining a world without viscosity, we better understand the viscous world we inhabit.</description>
