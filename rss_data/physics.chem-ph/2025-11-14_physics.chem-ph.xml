      <title>Mamba-driven multi-perspective structural understanding for molecular ground-state conformation prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of molecular structures is important for the prediction of molecular ground-state conformation involving property information. Meanwhile, state space model (e.g., Mamba) has recently emerged as a promising mechanism for long sequence modeling and has achieved remarkable results in various language and vision tasks. However, towards molecular ground-state conformation prediction, exploiting Mamba to understand molecular structure is underexplored. To this end, we strive to design a generic and efficient framework with Mamba to capture critical components. In general, molecular structure could be considered to consist of three elements, i.e., atom types, atom positions, and connections between atoms. Thus, considering the three elements, an approach of Mamba-driven multi-perspective structural understanding (MPSU-Mamba) is proposed to localize molecular ground-state conformation. Particularly, for complex and diverse molecules, three different kinds of dedicated scanning strategies are explored to construct a comprehensive perception of corresponding molecular structures. And a bright-channel guided mechanism is defined to discriminate the critical conformation-related atom information. Experimental results on QM9 and Molecule3D datasets indicate that MPSU-Mamba significantly outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, we observe that for the case of few training samples, MPSU-Mamba still achieves superior performance, demonstrating that our method is indeed beneficial for understanding molecular structures.</description>

      <title>Nanobubble size controls gas hydrate nucleation in supercooled water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas hydrates are crystalline compounds formed when water molecules encapsulate guest gas molecules under high pressure and low temperatures. They have gained significant interest due to their potential as alternative energy resources and their applications in gas storage, transportation, and carbon sequestration. However, the fundamental mechanisms governing their formation, especially the influence of gas bubbles, remain poorly understood. In this study, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine how methane nanobubble size modulates hydrate formation in supercooled water. Nanobubbles of different sizes are generated by modulating the methane concentration in a methane-water mixture during equilibration under high-temperature and low-pressure conditions, followed by quenching to low temperature and high pressure to induce gas hydrate nucleation and subsequent growth. The simulations reveal a strong correlation between nanobubble size and the extent of hydrate formation. Specifically, the extent of hydrate formation increases with bubble size in the small-to-intermediate regime. However, beyond a critical bubble size threshold, the hydrate formation efficiency declines. The work provides new molecular-level insight into how nanobubble size modulates gas hydrate nucleation and growth dynamics.</description>

      <title>VEDA: 3D Molecular Generation via Variance-Exploding Diffusion with Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models show promise for 3D molecular generation, but face a fundamental trade-off between sampling efficiency and conformational accuracy. While flow-based models are fast, they often produce geometrically inaccurate structures, as they have difficulty capturing the multimodal distributions of molecular conformations. In contrast, denoising diffusion models are more accurate but suffer from slow sampling, a limitation attributed to sub-optimal integration between diffusion dynamics and SE(3)-equivariant architectures. To address this, we propose VEDA, a unified SE(3)-equivariant framework that combines variance-exploding diffusion with annealing to efficiently generate conformationally accurate 3D molecular structures. Specifically, our key technical contributions include: (1) a VE schedule that enables noise injection functionally analogous to simulated annealing, improving 3D accuracy and reducing relaxation energy; (2) a novel preconditioning scheme that reconciles the coordinate-predicting nature of SE(3)-equivariant networks with a residual-based diffusion objective, and (3) a new arcsin-based scheduler that concentrates sampling in critical intervals of the logarithmic signal-to-noise ratio. On the QM9 and GEOM-DRUGS datasets, VEDA matches the sampling efficiency of flow-based models, achieving state-of-the-art valency stability and validity with only 100 sampling steps. More importantly, VEDA's generated structures are remarkably stable, as measured by their relaxation energy during GFN2-xTB optimization. The median energy change is only 1.72 kcal/mol, significantly lower than the 32.3 kcal/mol from its architectural baseline, SemlaFlow. Our framework demonstrates that principled integration of VE diffusion with SE(3)-equivariant architectures can achieve both high chemical accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Orbital-Optimized Unitary Coupled Cluster for Indirect Nuclear Spin-Spin Coupling Constants within a Quantum Linear Response Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum linear response (qLR) approach within an active-space framework for computing indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling constants, a key ingredient in NMR spectra predictions. The method employs the unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz and its orbital-optimized variant (ooUCC), both suitable for quantum computing implementations, to evaluate spin-spin coupling constants via qLR. Test calculations on five small molecules are compared with CASCI, CASSCF, and conventional CCSD results. qLR with UCC/ooUCC yields spin-spin coupling constants comparable to classical methods. We further examine the role of orbital optimization and find that ooUCC markedly affects the computed couplings; orbital-optimized results show better agreement with CCSD. These findings indicate that orbital optimization is important for accurate NMR coupling predictions within quantum-computing-friendly correlated methods.</description>

      <title>Solvaformer: an SE(3)-equivariant graph transformer for small molecule solubility prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of small molecule solubility using material-sparing approaches is critical for accelerating synthesis and process optimization, yet experimental measurement is costly and many learning approaches either depend on quantumderived descriptors or offer limited interpretability. We introduce Solvaformer, a geometry-aware graph transformer that models solutions as multiple molecules with independent SE(3) symmetries. The architecture combines intramolecular SE(3)-equivariant attention with intermolecular scalar attention, enabling cross-molecular communication without imposing spurious relative geometry. We train Solvaformer in a multi-task setting to predict both solubility (log S) and solvation free energy, using an alternating-batch regimen that trains on quantum-mechanical data (CombiSolv-QM) and on experimental measurements (BigSolDB 2.0). Solvaformer attains the strongest overall performance among the learned models and approaches a DFT-assisted gradient-boosting baseline, while outperforming an EquiformerV2 ablation and sequence-based alternatives. In addition, token-level attention produces chemically coherent attributions: case studies recover known intra- vs. inter-molecular hydrogen-bonding patterns that govern solubility differences in positional isomers. Taken together, Solvaformer provides an accurate, scalable, and interpretable approach to solution-phase property prediction by uniting geometric inductive bias with a mixed dataset training strategy on complementary computational and experimental data.</description>

      <title>Beyond Born-Oppenheimer Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a time-dependent density functional theory for the coupled dynamics of electrons and nuclei that goes beyond the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation. We prove that the time-dependent marginal nuclear probability density $|\chi({\bdu R},t)|^2$, the conditional electronic density $n_{\bdu R}(\br,t)$, and the current density $\bm J_{\bdu R}(\br,t)$ are sufficient to uniquely determine the full time-evolving electron-nuclear wave function, and thus the dynamics of all observables. Moreover, we propose a time-dependent Kohn-Sham scheme which reproduces the exact conditional electronic density and current density and the exact N-body nuclear density. The remaining task is to look for functional approximations for the Kohn-Sham exchange-correlation scalar and vector potentials. Using a model driven proton transfer system, we numerically demonstrate that the adiabatic extension of a beyond-BO ground state functional captures the dominant nonadiabatic effects in the regime of slow driving.</description>

      <title>Analytical Nuclear Gradients for the Multiconfigurational Self-Consistent Field Method Coupled with the Polarizable Fluctuating Charges Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiscale model combining the multiconfigurational self-consistent field (MCSCF) method with the fully atomistic polarizable Fluctuating Charges (FQ) force field (J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 9954-9967) is here extended to the calculation of analytical nuclear gradients. The gradients are derived from first principles, implemented in the OpenMolcas package, and validated against numerical references. The resulting MCSCF/FQ nuclear gradients are employed to simulate vibronic absorption spectra of aromatic molecules in aqueous solution, namely benzene and phenol. By integrating this approach with molecular dynamics simulations, both solute conformational flexibility and the dynamical aspects of solvation are properly captured. The computed spectra reproduce experimental profiles and relative band intensities with remarkable accuracy, demonstrating the capability of the MCSCF/FQ model to simultaneously describe the multireference character of the solute and its interaction with the solvent environment.</description>

      <title>Prebiotic Chemistry Insights for Dragonfly: Thermodynamics of Amino Acid Synthesis in Selk Crater on Titan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Saturnian moon Titan presents a compelling testbed for probing prebiotic chemistry beyond early Earth. Impact-generated melt pools provide transient aqueous habitats in an otherwise cryogenic environment. We use Cantera equilibrium models to assess whether mixtures of hydrogen cyanide (HCN), acetylene (C2H2), and ammonia (NH3) can drive amino acid synthesis in Selk-sized craters. Across twenty-one amino acids (twenty proteinogenic plus beta-alanine), NH3-free systems yield only proline, alanine, and beta-alanine, whereas adding as little as 1% NH3 (relative to H2O) renders almost the full suite accessible, with yields peaking at 2% and tapering thereafter. The NH3-free alanine result implies alternative pathways beyond classical Strecker or aminonitrile hydrolysis, suggesting acetylene, abundant on Titan but scarce on early Earth, as a plausible feedstock. We identify acrylonitrile (detected on Titan) as a thermodynamically favorable intermediate that can convert to alanine under aqueous conditions in an NH3-free pathway. For glycine and alanine production from nitrile hydrolysis, comparison with laboratory kinetics shows that our equilibrium models predict near-complete conversion, while observed rates yield only partial products over weeks. Yet estimated chemical equilibration times (years-centuries) are far shorter than melt lifetimes, supporting plausibility of equilibrium in situ. These predictions are directly testable with Dragonfly mass spectrometer (DraMS), for which we recommend pre-flight standards to test proline, alanine, beta-alanine, cysteine, and methionine. The first three offer the best chances for amino acid detection regardless of ammonia availability; the latter two offer diagnostic tools for determining the presence of reactive sulfur in post-impact Titan ponds.</description>

      <title>Constrained Shadow Tomography for Molecular Simulation on Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography is a fundamental task in quantum information science, enabling detailed characterization of correlations, entanglement, and electronic structure in quantum systems. However, its exponential measurement and computational demands limit scalability, motivating efficient alternatives such as classical shadows, which enable accurate prediction of many observables from randomized measurements. In this work, we introduce a bi-objective semidefinite programming approach for constrained shadow tomography, designed to reconstruct the two-particle reduced density matrix (2-RDM) from noisy or incomplete shadow data. By integrating $N$-representability constraints and nuclear-norm regularization into the optimization, the method builds an $N$-representable 2-RDM that balances fidelity to the shadow measurements with energy minimization. This unified framework mitigates noise and sampling errors while enforcing physical consistency in the reconstructed states. Numerical and hardware results demonstrate that the approach significantly improves accuracy, noise resilience, and scalability, providing a robust foundation for physically consistent fermionic state reconstruction in realistic quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>SeQuant Framework for Symbolic and Numerical Tensor Algebra. I. Core Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SeQuant is an open-source library for symbolic algebra of tensors over commutative (scalar) and non-commutative (operator) rings. The key innovation supporting most of its functionality is a graph-theoretic tensor network (TN) canonicalizer that can handle tensor networks with symmetries faster than their standard group-theoretic counterparts. The TN canonicalizer is used for routine simplification of conventional tensor expressions, for optimizing application of Wick's theorem (used to canonicalize products of tensors over operator fields), and for manipulation of the intermediate representation leading to the numerical evaluation. Notable features of SeQuant include support for noncovariant tensor networks (which often arise from tensor decompositions) and for tensors with modes that depend parametrically on indices of other tensor modes (such dependencies between degrees of freedom are naturally viewed as nesting of tensors, "tensors of tensors" arising in block-wise data compressions in data science and modern quantum simulation). SeQuant blurs the line between pure symbolic manipulation/code generation and numerical evaluation by including compiler-like components to optimize and directly interpret tensor expressions using external numerical tensor algebra frameworks. The SeQuant source code is available at https://github.com/ValeevGroup/SeQuant.</description>

      <title>Exact fluctuation relation for open systems beyond the Jarzynski equality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive exact fluctuation equalities for open systems that recover free energy differences between two equilibrium endpoints connected by nonequilibrium processes with arbitrary dynamics and coupling. The exponential of the free energy difference is expressed in terms of ensemble averages of the Hamiltonian of mean force (HMF) shift and the chi-squared divergence between the initial and final marginal probability distribution of the open system. A trajectory counterpart of this relation follows from an asymptotic equilibration postulate, which treats relaxation to the final stationary canonical state as a boundary condition rather than as a consequence of constraints on the driven dynamics. In the frozen-coupling regime, the HMF shift reduces to the bare-system Hamiltonian shift, yielding a clear heat-work decomposition. The Jarzynski equality (JE) is recovered under the assumption of Hamiltonian dynamics for the combined system. We validate the theory on a dissipative, phase-space-compressing drive followed by an underdamped Langevin relaxation, where the assumptions underlying the JE break down, whereas our equality reproduces the exact free energy differences.</description>

      <title>Long-range propagating paramagnon-polaritons in organic free radicals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials are commonly distinguished by their magnetic response into diamagnetic, paramagnetic, and magnetically ordered (ferro-, ferri-, and antiferromagnetic) phases. Diamagnets and paramagnets lack spontaneous long-range order, whereas ordered magnets develop such order below their Curie or N\'eel temperature and support single spin-wave excitations (magnons). Magnons have found applications in radio-frequency technologies and computation, magneto-optics, and foundational quantum experiments. Above the Curie/N\'eel temperature, long-range order is lost and the material transitions to a paramagnetic phase, with localised spin alignment in small patches, producing paramagnons with only short-range propagation. Here we show that long-range coherence is preserved in the organic free radical 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl above the N\'eel temperature using all-electrical propagating spin-wave spectroscopy in external magnetic fields. We observe coherently excited low-energy paramagnon-polaritons up to $\mathbf{23\,\mathrm{GHz}}$ , propagating over $\mathbf{8\,\mathrm{mm}}$ at supersonic group velocities exceeding $\mathbf{100\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}}$. Using free radicals as magnon carriers integrates organic materials with spintronics and opens the way to organic electronics, dense information storage, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Thermodynamics of Cooperative Biomolecular Machines: Fluctuation Relations and Hidden Detailed Balance Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine a biomolecular machine involving a driven, observable process coupled to a hidden process in a kinetically cooperative manner. A stochastic thermodynamics framework is employed to analyze a fluctuation theorem for the first-passage time of the observable process under nonequilibrium steady-state conditions. Based on a generic kinetic model, we demonstrate that, along first-passage trajectories, entropy production remains constant when the changes in stochastic entropy and free energy of the machine are balanced, which corresponds to zero net hidden flux through the initial state manifold. Under this condition, which we define quite generally, this first-passage time fluctuation theorem can be established, with its violation serving as an experimentally detectable signature of hidden detailed balance breaking (which we subsequently characterize). In addition, using an enzymatic model, we show that the violation of our first-passage time fluctuation theorem can be thought of as a consequence of the breakdown of local detailed balance in the steps linking coarse-grained states that correspond to the initial and intermediate state manifolds. In the absence of hidden current, the fluctuation theorem is restored, and a mesoscopic local detailed balance condition can be established, which has implications for the thermodynamic analysis of driven, coarse-grained systems. This work sheds significant light on the unique connections between stochastic thermodynamic quantities and kinetic measurements in complex cooperative networks.</description>

Abstract: Core-shell electrode particles are a promising morphology control strategy for high-performance lithium-ion batteries. However, experimental observations reveal that these structures remain prone to mechanical failure, with shell fractures and core-shell debonding occurring after a single charge. In this work, we present a novel, comprehensive computational framework to predict and gain insight into the failure of core-shell morphologies and the associated degradation in battery performance. The fully coupled chemo-mechano-damage model presented captures the interplay between mechanical damage and electrochemical behaviours, enabling the quantification of particle cracking and capacity fade. Both bulk material fracture and interface debonding are captured by utilising the phase field method. We quantify the severity of particle cracking and capacity loss through case studies on a representative core-shell system (NMC811@NMC532). The results bring valuable insights into cracking patterns, underlying mechanisms, and their impact on capacity loss. Surface cracks are found to initiate when a significantly higher lithium concentration accumulates in the core compared to the shell. Interfacial debonding is shown to arise from localised hoop stresses near the core-shell interface, due to greater shell expansion. This debonding develops rapidly, impedes lithium-ion transport, and can lead to more than 10\% capacity loss after a single discharge. Furthermore, larger particles may experience crack branching driven by extensive tensile zones, potentially fragmenting the entire particle. The framework developed can not only bring new insight into the degradation mechanisms of core-shell particles but also be used to design electrode materials with improved performance and extended lifetime.</description>

      <title>User Manual for MOLSCAT, BOUND and FIELD, Version 2025.0: programs for quantum scattering properties and bound states of interacting pairs of atoms and molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.06755v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MOLSCAT is a general-purpose package for performing non-reactive quantum scattering calculations for atomic and molecular collisions using coupled-channel methods. Simple atom-molecule and molecule-molecule collision types are coded internally and additional ones may be handled with plug-in routines. Plug-in routines may include external magnetic, electric or photon fields (and combinations of them). Simple interaction potentials are coded internally and more complicated ones may be handled with plug-in routines.
  BOUND is a general-purpose package for performing calculations of bound-state energies in weakly bound atomic and molecular systems using coupled-channel methods. It solves the same sets of coupled equations as MOLSCAT, and can use the same plug-in routines if desired, but with different boundary conditions.
  FIELD is a development of BOUND that locates external fields at which a bound state exists with a specified energy. One important use is to locate the positions of magnetically tunable Feshbach resonance positions in ultracold collisions.

      <title>The Singlet-Triplet Gap of Cyclobutadiene: The CIPSI-Driven CC($P$;$Q$) Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An accurate determination of singlet-triplet gaps in biradicals, including cyclobutadiene in the automerization barrier region where one has to balance the substantial nondynamical many-electron correlation effects characterizing the singlet ground state with the predominantly dynamical correlations of the lowest-energy triplet, remains a challenge for many quantum chemistry methods. High-level coupled-cluster (CC) approaches, such as the CC method with a full treatment of singly, doubly, and triply excited clusters (CCSDT), are often capable of providing reliable results, but the routine application of such methods is hindered by their high computational costs. We have recently proposed a practical alternative to converging the CCSDT energetics at small fractions of the computational effort, even when electron correlations become stronger and connected triply excited clusters are larger and nonperturbative, by merging the CC($P$;$Q$) moment expansions with the selected configuration interaction methodology abbreviated as CIPSI. We demonstrate that one can accurately approximate the highly accurate CCSDT potential surfaces characterizing the lowest singlet and triplet states of cyclobutadiene along the automerization coordinate and the gap between them using tiny fractions of triply excited cluster amplitudes identified with the help of relatively inexpensive CIPSI Hamiltonian diagonalizations.</description>

      <title>MLIP Arena: Advancing Fairness and Transparency in Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials via an Open, Accessible Benchmark Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized molecular and materials modeling, but existing benchmarks suffer from data leakage, limited transferability, and an over-reliance on error-based metrics tied to specific density functional theory (DFT) references. We introduce MLIP Arena, a benchmark platform that evaluates force field performance based on physics awareness, chemical reactivity, stability under extreme conditions, and predictive capabilities for thermodynamic properties and physical phenomena. By moving beyond static DFT references and revealing the important failure modes of current foundation MLIPs in real-world settings, MLIP Arena provides a reproducible framework to guide the next-generation MLIP development toward improved predictive accuracy and runtime efficiency while maintaining physical consistency. The Python package and online leaderboard are available at https://github.com/atomind-ai/mlip-arena.</description>

      <title>Seniority-Zero Canonical Transformation Theory: Reducing Truncation Error with Late Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how to add the effects of residual electron correlation to a reference seniority-zero wavefunction by making a unitary transformation of the true electronic Hamiltonian into seniority-zero form. The transformation is treated via the Baker Campbell Hausdorff (BCH) expansion and the seniority-zero structure of the reference is exploited to evaluate the first three commutators exactly; the remaining contributions are handled with a recursive commutator approximation, as is typical in canonical transformation methods. By choosing a seniority-zero reference and using parallel computation, this method is practical for small- to medium-sized systems. Numerical tests show high accuracy, with errors $\sim 10^{-4}$ Hartree.</description>

      <title>Insights into Symmetry and Substitution Patterns Governing Singlet-Triplet Energy Gap in the Chemical Space of Azaphenalenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecules that violate Hund's rule by exhibiting an inverted singlet-triplet gap (STG), where the first excited singlet (S$_1$) lies below the triplet (T$_1$), are rare but hold great promise as efficient fifth-generation light emitters. Azaphenalenes (APs) represent one of the few known molecular classes capable of such inversion of the S$_1$/T$_1$ energy ordering, yet a systematic exploration of all unique APs is lacking. Here, we investigate 104 distinct APs and classify them based on their adherence to or deviation from Hund's rule using S$_1$-T$_1$ gaps computed with the Laplace-transformed second-order coupled-cluster method (L-CC2). To capture substitution-dependent pseudo-Jahn-Teller distortions that are inadequately described by MP2 and DFT methods, we employ an extrapolative geometry scheme to estimate equilibrium structures at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ level. We find three APs to undergo $D_{\rm 3h} \rightarrow C_{\rm 3h}$ and ten to show $C_{\rm 2v}\rightarrow C_{\rm s}$ symmetry lowering, leading to a total of 117 configurations of 104 unique APs. Our study identifies top candidates with inverted STGs, revealing how substitution and symmetry-lowering modulate these gaps to uncover new stable AP cores that provide promising targets for designing molecular light-emitters.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Quantum Mechanics Approach for Extracting and Emulating Continuum Physics Based on Bound-State-Like Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a unified emulation framework for studying continuum physics in finite quantum systems. Using a reduced basis method, we construct powerful emulators for the inhomogeneous Schr\"{o}dinger equation that operate in a combined parameter space of complex energy ($E$) and other inputs ($\bm{\theta}$). Within the space, the emulators simultaneously perform analytical continuation in $E$ -- extracting continuum physics from numerically simpler bound-state-like calculations -- and interpolate this entire process across $\bm{\theta}$. This yields a small, non-Hermitian system whose properties (e.g., resonances and scattering observables) can be rapidly predicted for any $\bm{\theta}$. Crucially, the complex-$E$ emulation provides a pathway to compute continuum observables for complex systems where advanced bound-state methods exist but direct continuum calculations are yet to be developed, while the $\bm{\theta}$-emulation enables rapid parameter-space exploration and can be adapted to accelerate other existing continuum calculations. Demonstrations with two- and three-body systems highlight the method's effectiveness and suggest its connection to (near-)optimal rational approximation. This Letter presents the key results, with further details reserved for a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian quantum mechanics approach for extracting and emulating continuum physics based on bound-state-like calculations: Detailed description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work applies a reduced basis method to study the continuum physics of a finite quantum system -- either few or many-body. Specifically, I develop reduced-order models, or emulators, for the underlying inhomogeneous Schr\"{o}dinger equation and train the emulators against the equation's bound-state-like solutions at complex energies. The emulators rapidly and accurately interpolate and extrapolate the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian resolvent operator (Green's function) across a parameter space that includes both complex energy and other real-valued physical inputs in the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. The spectra, discretized and compressed as the result of emulation, and the associated resolvent matrix elements (or amplitudes), have the defining characteristics of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics calculations, featuring complex eigenenergies with negative imaginary parts and branch cuts moved below the real axis in the complex energy plane. Therefore, one now has a method that extracts continuum physics from bound-state-like calculations and emulates those extractions in the input parameter space. Building on a prior Letter [\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03309}{[arXiv:2408.03309}], this article provides the full theoretical details, a comprehensive analysis of the method's performance, and a brief discussion of how it can be coupled with existing continuum approaches to perform emulations in their input parameter spaces.</description>

      <title>Physics of droplet regulation in biological cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13639v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Droplet formation has emerged as an essential concept for the spatiotemporal organisation of biomolecules in cells. However, classical descriptions of droplet dynamics based on passive liquid-liquid phase separation cannot capture the complex situation inside cells. This review discusses three distinct aspects that are crucial in cells: (i) biomolecules are diverse and individually complex, implying that cellular droplets possess complex internal behaviour, e.g., in terms of their material properties; (ii) the cellular environment contains many solid-like structures that droplets can wet; (iii) cells are alive and use fuel to drive processes out of equilibrium. We illustrate how these principles control droplet nucleation, growth, position, and count to unveil possible regulatory mechanisms in biological cells and other applications of phase separation.</description>

      <title>ELECTRA: A Cartesian Network for 3D Charge Density Prediction with Floating Orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Electronic Tensor Reconstruction Algorithm (ELECTRA) - an equivariant model for predicting electronic charge densities using floating orbitals. Floating orbitals are a long-standing concept in the quantum chemistry community that promises more compact and accurate representations by placing orbitals freely in space, as opposed to centering all orbitals at the position of atoms. Finding the ideal placement of these orbitals requires extensive domain knowledge, though, which thus far has prevented widespread adoption. We solve this in a data-driven manner by training a Cartesian tensor network to predict the orbital positions along with orbital coefficients. This is made possible through a symmetry-breaking mechanism that is used to learn position displacements with lower symmetry than the input molecule while preserving the rotation equivariance of the charge density itself. Inspired by recent successes of Gaussian Splatting in representing densities in space, we are using Gaussian orbitals and predicting their weights and covariance matrices. Our method achieves a state-of-the-art balance between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy on established benchmarks. Furthermore, ELECTRA is able to lower the compute time required to arrive at converged DFT solutions - initializing calculations using our predicted densities yields an average 50.72 \% reduction in self-consistent field (SCF) iterations on unseen molecules.</description>

      <title>pH-dependent interfacial rheology of polymer membranes assembled at liquid-liquid interfaces using hydrogen bonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-assembly of polymers at liquid interfaces using non-covalent interactions has emerged as a promising technique to reversibly produce self-healing membranes. Besides the assembly process, it is also crucial to control the mechanical properties of these membranes. Here, we measure the interfacial rheological properties of PMAA-PPO (polymethacrylic acid - polypropylene oxide) polymer membranes assembled using hydrogen bonds at the interface between water and a polar oil, Mygliol. Varying the pH enables us to modify the degree of ionization of the PMAA chains, and hence their ability to establish hydrogen interactions with PPO. Frequency sweeps of the interfacial layers show a crossover between a viscous regime at low frequencies and an elastic regime at high frequencies. The crossover elastic modulus, measured one hour after the two phases were put into contact, decreases by a half over the pH range investigated, which can be accounted for by a decrease of the layer thickness as pH increases. Furthermore, we find that the crossover frequency varies exponentially with the degree of ionization of PMAA. To account for these observations, we propose a simple picture where the short PPO chains behave as non-covalent cross-linkers that bridge several PMAA chains. The dissociation rate and hence the crossover frequency are controlled by the number of PO units per PPO chain involved in the hydrogen bonds.</description>
