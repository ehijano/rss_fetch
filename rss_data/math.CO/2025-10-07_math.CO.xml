      <title>Note on the Number of Almost Ordinary Triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a set of $n$ points in the plane, not all on a line. According to the Gallai-Sylvester
  theorem, $X$ always spans an \emph{ordinary line}, i.e., one that passes through precisely 2
  elements of $X$. Given an integer $c\ge 2,$ a \emph{line} spanned by $X$ is called
  \emph{$c$-ordinary} if it passes through at most $c$ points of $X$. A \emph{triangle} spanned by 3
  noncollinear points of $X$ is called \emph{$c$-ordinary} if all 3 lines determined by its sides
  are \emph{$c$-ordinary}. Motivated by a question of Erd\H os, Fulek \emph{et al.}~\cite{FMN+17}
  proved that there exists an absolute constant $c &gt; 2$ such that if $X$ cannot be covered by 2
  lines, then it determines at least one $c$-ordinary triangle. Moreover, the number of such
  triangles grows at least linearly in $n$. They raised the question whether the true growth rate of
  this function is superlinear.
  We prove that if $X$ cannot be covered by 2 lines, and no line passes through more than $n-t(n)$
  points of $X$, for some function $t(n)\rightarrow\infty,$ then the number of $17$-ordinary
  triangles spanned by $X$ is at least constant times $n \cdot t(n)$, i.e., superlinear in $n$. We also
  show that the assumption $t(n)\rightarrow\infty$ is necessary. If we further assume that no line
  passes through more than $n/2-t(n)$ points of $X$, then the number of $17$-ordinary triangles
  grows superquadratically in $n$. This statement does not hold if $t(n)$ is bounded. We close this
  paper with some algorithmic results. In particular, we provide a $O(n^{2.372})$ time algorithm for
  counting all $c$-ordinary triangles in an $n$-element point set, for any $c&lt;n$.</description>

      <title>Chip-Firing Games on Banana Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study chip-firing games on multigraphs whose underlying simple graphs are trees, paths, and stars, denoted as banana trees, paths, and stars respectively. We present a polynomial time algorithm to compute the divisorial gonality of banana paths, and give combinatorial formulas for the related invariants of scramble number and screewidth for any banana tree. Furthermore, we leverage banana paths to show that gonality can increase or decrease by an arbitrary amount upon deletion of a single edge, even when the resulting graph is connected. Lastly, we study banana trees and Brill-Noether theory to prove that the gonality conjecture holds for all banana trees.</description>

      <title>Linear Recurrent Sequences, Markov Chains and Their Applications in Graph Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After a brief review of the key theorems concerning recurrent sequences, we give an explicit computation of the inverse of the Vandermonde matrix. This will then be used to derive sub-exponential decay error terms in the ergodic theorem of Markov chains. Finally, we apply these results to give estimates for the diameters of directed graphs.</description>

      <title>The minimum degree of minimal 2-extendable claw-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A connected graph $G$ with a perfect matching is said to be $k$-extendable for integers $k$, $1 \leq k\leq \frac{|V(G)|}{2}-1$, if any matching in $G$ of size $k$ is contained in a perfect matching of $G$. A $k$-extendable graph is minimal if the deletion of any edge results in a graph that is not $k$-extendable. In 1994, Plummer proved that every $k$-extendable claw-free graph has minimum degree at least $2k$. Recently, He et al. showed that every minimal 1-extendable graph has minimum degree 2 or 3. In this paper, we prove that the minimum degree of a minimal 2-extendable claw-free graph is either $4$ or $5$.</description>

      <title>Pinnacles for Complex Reflection Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study, characterize, and enumerate the admissible pinnacle sets of nonexceptional complex reflection groups $G(m,p,n)$, which include all generalized symmetric groups $\mathbb{Z}_m \wr S_n$ as special cases. This generalizes the work of Davis--Nelson--Petersen--Tenner for symmetric groups $S_n$ and Gonz\'alez--Harris--Rojas Kirby--Smit Vega Garcia--Tenner for signed symmetric groups $\mathbb{Z}_2 \wr S_n$. As a consequence, we prove a conjecture of Gonz\'alez--Harris--Rojas Kirby--Smit Vega Garcia--Tenner for pinnacles of signed permutations.</description>

      <title>Orbit lengths for promotion on 2-row and near-hook tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Promotion has been well-studied for rectangular standard Young tableaux, in which case the orbit lengths divide the total number of boxes and are described by a cyclic sieving phenomenon (CSP), but little is known about the orbit lengths for tableaux of general shape. We approach this problem by building a stable sequence of tableaux where we fix the bottom portion and add extra boxes to the first row to get $n$ total boxes, with $n$ varying. We show that for 2-row tableaux with a fixed bottom row, the orbit lengths are divisors of certain monic polynomials in $n$, with degree generally equal to the number of distinct lengths of runs of consecutive numbers in the bottom row. For the subsets of 2-row tableaux where all runs have the same length, we show that the orbit lengths are characterized by a CSP polynomial that is a slightly modified version of the major index generating function, like in the rectangle case. We also show that for any stable sequence of tableaux, the orbit lengths are linear in $n$ as long as all non-first-row entries differ from each other by at least 2, which asymptotically happens for almost all tableaux in the limit as $n\to\infty.$ We also calculate the orbit lengths for near-hook tableaux, which are divisors of certain linear or quadratic polynomials in $n$.</description>

      <title>Quadrangulations and the Lov\'asz complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lov\'asz complex $L(G)$ of a graph $G$ is a deformation retract of its neighborhood complex, equipped with a canonical $Z_2$-action. We show that, under mild assumptions, $L(G)$ is homeomorphic to a surface if and only if $G$ is a non-bipartite quadrangulation of the orbit space $L(G)/Z_2$ in which every $4$-cycle is facial. This yields a classification of the Lov\'asz complexes of all such quadrangulations. As an application, we contextualize a result of Archdeacon \emph{et al.}\ and Mohar and Seymour on the chromatic number of quadrangulations, obtaining a stronger statement about the $Z_2$-index.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that if $n$ vertices can be removed from a connected graph $\Gamma$ so that no subgraphs isomorphic to the graph $K$ remain, then no more than $|V(K)|\cdot n$ vertices can be removed, forming a set invariant with respect to all automorphisms of the graph $\Gamma$, so that no subgraphs isomorphic to the graph $K$ remain. We construct an infinite set of (connected) graphs $K$ for which this estimate is not exact.</description>

      <title>Further analysis of Peeling Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P\subset \mathbf{R}^2$ be a set of $n$ points in general position. A peeling sequence of $P$ is a list of its points, such that if we remove the points from $P$ in that order, we always remove the next point from the convex hull of the remainder of $P$. Using the methodology of Dumitrescu and T\'oth \cite{Dumitrescu}, with more careful analysis, we improve the upper bound on the minimum number of peeling sequences for an $n$ point set in the plane from $\frac{12.29^n}{100}$ to $\frac{9.78^n}{500}$.</description>

      <title>At most 10 cylinders mutually touch: a Ramsey-theoretic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Littlewood asked for the maximum number $N$ of congruent infinite cylinders that can be arranged in $\mathbb{R}^3$ so that every pair touches. We improve upon the proof of the second author that $N \leq 18$ to show that $N \leq 10$. Together with the lower bound established by Boz\'oki, Lee, and R\'onyai, this shows that $N \in \{7,8,9,10\}$. Our method is based on linear algebra and Ramsey theory, and makes partial use of computer verification. We also provide a completely computer-free proof that $N \leq 12$.</description>

      <title>Every Fifth Real Number is Evil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fifteen years ago, then-Carleton-undergrad Isaac Hodes, proved that the Golden Ratio is evil. In this modest contribution to human knowledge, we show that in fact, every fifth real number is evil, and we present lots of other interesting numbers that are evil. We also show (in addition to many other fascinating facts), that the expected evil-location of a random evil number is 148.185185185185185... . It follows that the Golden Ratio is a fairly average evil real number, since, as first computed by Hodes, the evil location of the Golden Ratio is 146.</description>

      <title>Toward a rainbow Corr\'{a}di--Hajnal Theorem \RNum{1}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an anti-Ramsey extension of the classical Corr\'{a}di--Hajnal Theorem: how many colors are needed to color the complete graph on $n$ vertices in order to guarantee a rainbow copy of $t K_{3}$, that is, $t$ vertex-disjoint triangles.
  We provide a conjecture for large $n$, consisting of five classes of different extremal constructions, corresponding to five subintervals of $\left[1,\, \tfrac{n}{3}\right]$ for the parameter $t$.
  In this work, we establish this conjecture for the first interval, $t \in \left[1,\, \tfrac{2n-6}{9}\right]$.
  In particular, this improves upon a recent result of Lu--Luo--Ma~[arXiv:2506.07115] which established the case $t \le \tfrac{n - 57}{15}$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White's conjecture asserts that any two tuples of matroid bases that have the same multi-set union can be transformed from one to another by symmetric exchanges; it also implies that the toric ideals of matroids are generated by the binomials encoding these exchanges. We prove White's conjecture for the class of paving matroids. Our strategy is to generalize the inductive argument using circuit-hyperplane relaxations in the recent work of Han et al. to stressed hyperplane relaxations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Congruent polygons are congruent in angles as well as in edge lengths. We concentrate on the angle aspect, and investigate how tilings of the sphere by congruent pentagons can be determined by the angle information only. We also investigate how the features of tilings are changed under reductions, i.e., by ignoring the difference among the angles.</description>

      <title>A lower bound on the minimum weight of some geometric codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $p$-ary code associated with the incidence structure of points and $t$-spaces in a projective space $\mathrm{PG}(m,q)$, where $q=p^h$, is the $\mathbb{F}_p$-subspace generated by the incidence vectors of the blocks of this design. The dual of this code consists of all vectors orthogonal to every codeword of the original code. In contrast to the codes derived from point-subspace incidences, the minimum weight of the corresponding dual codes is generally unknown, which makes the problem more challenging.
  In 2008 Lavrauw, Storme and Van de Voorde proved the following reduction: the minimum weight of the dual of the code derived from point and $t$-space incidences in $\mathrm{PG}(m,q)$ is the same as the minimum weight of the dual of the code derived from point and line incidences in $\mathrm{PG}(m-t+1,q)$. After a series of works by Delsarte (1970), Assmus and Key (1992), Calkin, Key and De Resmini (1999), the best known lower bound for the case of point-line incidences was established in [B. Bagchi and P. Inamdar: Projective geometric codes, J. Combin. Theory Ser. A, 99(1) (2002), 128-142].
  The problem of determining the minimum weight of these codes admits a natural geometric interpretation in terms of multisets of points in a projective space which meet each line in $0$ modulo $p$ points. In this paper, by adopting this geometrical perspective and exploiting certain polynomial techniques from [S. Ball, A. Blokhuis, A. G\'acs, P. Sziklai, Zs. Weiner: On linear codes whose weights and length have a common divisor, Adv. Math., 211 (2007), 94-104], we prove a substantial improvement of the Bagchi-Inamdar bound in the case where $h&gt;1$ and $m, p &gt;2$.</description>

      <title>On the Modular Chromatic Index of Random Hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k,r \geq 2$ be two integers. We consider the problem of partitioning the hyperedge set of an $r$-uniform hypergraph $H$ into the minimum number $\chi_k'(H)$ of edge-disjoint subhypergraphs in which every vertex has either degree $0$ or degree congruent to $1$ modulo $k$. For a random hypergraph $H$ drawn from the binomial model $\mathbf{H}(n,p,r)$, with edge probability $p \in (C\log(n)/n,1)$ for a large enough constant $C&gt;0$ independent of $n$ and satisfying $n^{r-1}p(1-p)\to\infty$ as $n\to\infty$, we show that asymptotically almost surely $\chi_k'(H) = k$ if $n$ is divisible by $\gcd(k,r)$, and $\max(k,r) \le \chi_k'(H) \le k+r+1$ otherwise. A key ingredient in our approach is a sufficient condition ensuring the existence of a $k$-factor, a $k$-regular spanning subhypergraph, within subhypergraphs of a random hypergraph from $\mathbf{H}(n,p,r)$, a result that may be of independent interest. Our main result extends a theorem of Botler, Colucci, and Kohayakawa (2023), who proved an analogous statement for graphs, and provides a partial answer to a question posed by Goetze, Klute, Knauer, Parada, Pe\~na, and Ueckerdt (2025) regarding whether $\chi_2'(H)$ can be bounded by a constant for every hypergraph $H$.</description>

      <title>Results on long twins in random words and permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study long $r$-twins in random words and permutations. Motivated by questions posed in works of Dudek-Grytczuk-Ruci\'nski, we obtain the following. For a uniform word in $[k]^n$ we prove sharp one-sided tail bounds showing that the maximum $r$-power length (the longest contiguous block that can be partitioned into $r$ identical subblocks) is concentrated around $\frac{\log n}{(r-1)\log k}$. For random permutations, we prove that for fixed $k$ and $r\to\infty$, a uniform permutation of $[rk]$ a.a.s. contains $r$ disjoint increasing subsequences of length $k$, generalizing a previous result that proves this for $k=2$. Finally, we use a computer-aided pattern count to improve the best known lower bound on the length of alternating twins in a random permutation to $\alpha_n \ge \left(\tfrac{1}{3}+0.0989-o(1)\right)n$, strengthening the previous constant.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Aspects of Elliptic Schubert Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to extend two fundamental combinatorial results in Schubert calculus on flag manifolds from equivariant cohomology and $K$-theory to equivariant elliptic cohomology. The foundations of elliptic Schubert calculus were laid in a few relatively recent papers by Rim\'anyi, Weber, and Kumar. They include the recursive construction of elliptic Schubert classes via generalizations of the cohomology and $K$-theory push-pull operators and the study of the corresponding Demazure algebra. We derive a Billey-type formula for the localization of elliptic Schubert classes (for partial flag manifolds of arbitrary type) and a pipe dream model for their polynomial representatives in the case of type $A$ flag manifolds. The latter extends the pipe dream model for double Schubert and Grothendieck polynomials. We also study the degeneration of elliptic Schubert classes to $K$-theory, which recovers the corresponding classical formulas.</description>

      <title>Obstructions for normally spanned sets of vertices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halin conjectured that a graph has a normal spanning tree if and only if every minor of it has countable colouring number. This has recently been proven by the second author.
  In this paper, we strengthen this result by establishing the following local version of it: Given a prescribed set of vertices $U$ in a connected graph $G$, there is a normal tree in $G$ that includes $U$ if and only if every $U$-rooted minor of $G$ (i.e. a minor every branch set of which meets $U$) has countable colouring number.
  Our proof relies on a novel approach that combines normal partition trees as introduced by Brochet and Diestel with a suitable closure argument developed by Robertson, Seymour and Thomas in their discussion of infinite graphs of finite tree width.</description>

      <title>The high order spectral radius of graphs without long cycles or paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1959, Erd\H{o}s and Gallai established two classic theorems, which determine the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex graph with no cycles of length at least $k$, and in an $n$-vertex graph with no paths on $k$ vertices, respectively. Subsequently, generalized and spectral versions of the Erd\H{o}s-Gallai theorems have been investigated. A concept of a high order spectral radius for graphs was introduced in 2023, defined as the spectral radius of a tensor and termed the $t$-clique spectral radius $\rho_t(G)$. In this paper, we establish a high order spectral version of Erd\H{o}s-Gallai theorems by employing the $t$-clique spectral radius, i.e., we determine the extremal graphs that attain the maximum $t$-clique spectral radius in the $n$-vertex graphs with no cycles of length at least $k$ and in the $n$-vertex graphs with no paths on $k$ vertices, respectively.</description>

      <title>The Smith normal form of distance matrices of high dimensional trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graham-Lov\'asz-Pollak \cite{GL,GP} obtained the celebrated formula $$\det({\sf D}(T_{n+1}))=(-1)^nn2^{n-1},$$ for the determinant of the distance matrix ${\sf D}(T_{n+1})$ for any tree $T_{n+1}$ with $n+1$ vertices. Later, Hou and Woo \cite{HW} extended this formula to the Smith normal form (SNF) obtaining that $\SNF({\sf D}(T_{n+1}))={\sf I}_2\oplus 2{\sf I}_{n-2}\oplus [2n]$, for any tree $T_{n+1}$ with $n+1$ vertices.
  A $k$-{\it tree} is either a complete graph on $k$ vertices or a graph obtained from a smaller $k$-tree by adjoining a new vertex together with $k$ edges connecting it to a $k$-clique. If $\tau$ and $\tau'$ are $d$-cliques in a $k$-tree $T$, a $d$-{\it walk} between $\tau$ and $\tau'$ is a finite sequence $\tau_1\sigma_1\tau_2\sigma_2\cdots\tau_l$, where $\tau_1=\tau$, $\tau_l=\tau'$, and the $d$-cliques $\tau_i$ and $\tau_{i+1}$ are incident to the same $(d+1)$-clique $\sigma_i$. For $d\in\{1,\dots,k\}$, the $d$-{\it distance} from the $d$-cliques $\tau$ and $\tau'$ is the number of $(d+1)$-cliques in a minimum $d$-walk from $\tau$ and $\tau'$, and is denoted by $\dist^d(\tau,\tau')$. Let $c_d$ denote the number of $d$-cliques in the $k$-tree $T$. Then the $d$-distance matrix ${\sf D}^d(T)$ of the $k$-tree $T$ is the $c_d\times c_d$ matrix, indexed by the $d$-cliques of $T$, such that the $(i,j)$-entry is $0$ if $i=j$, and $\dist^d(\tau_i,\tau_j)$ otherwise. Here, we show that, for $k$ and $n$ fixed, the SNF of the $k$-distance matrix is the same for any $k$-tree with $n$ vertices. Specifically, for any $k$-tree $T_{n}$ with $n$ vertices such that $n\geq k+2$, the Smith normal form of ${\sf D}^{k}(T_{n})$ is $${\sf I}_{(k-1)(n-k)+2}\oplus (k+1){\sf I}_{n-k-2}\oplus [k(k+1)(n-k)],$$ which extends Graham-Lov\'asz-Pollak and Hou-Woo results.</description>

      <title>Estimates of the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the Li--Yau eigenvalue-diameter estimates, we investigate lower bounds for the first Dirichlet eigenvalue in terms of the diameter (or inscribed radius) of a graph. Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with boundary $B$. Assume that the interior $\Omega = V \setminus B$ is connected. Let $r$ be the inscribed radius of $(G, B)$ and $d$ be the maximum degree of $G$. We prove that $$\lambda_1(G, B) \geq \frac{d - 1}{r d^r},$$ which can be viewed as an analogue of the Lin--Yau bound and the Meng--Lin bound for normalized Dirichlet/Laplacian eigenvalues. We also derive the inequality $$\lambda_1(G, B) \geq \frac{1}{r |\Omega|}.$$ In particular, for a tree $T$ with at least $3$ vertices, we show that $$\lambda_1(T) \geq 4 \sin^2 \frac{\pi}{4r + 6} \geq \frac{1}{(r + 1)^2}.$$ Notably, both of the two preceding bounds are sharp up to a constant factor. We additionally examine upper bounds on the first Dirichlet eigenvalue under constraints on the numbers of interior and boundary vertices.</description>

      <title>Further Perspectives on the Intersection Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concepts of intersection distribution and non-hitting index were recently introduced by Li and Pott, and offer a new way to classify the behaviour of finite field polynomials. They have both an algebraic and geometric interpretation: via the intersection of a polynomial $f$ with a set of lines, and via a $(q+1)$-set $S_f$ in $\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$ possessing an internal nucleus. In this paper, we build on these ideas: we prove novel geometric results (particularly on the relationship between intersection distribution and projective equivalence of polynomials), new algebraic results (particularly on the degree of $S_f$ - the index of the largest non-zero entry in the intersection distribution of $f$) and new results on the non-hitting spectrum. We resolve several Open Problems from Li and Pott's original paper, and offer alternative treatments of related subsequent literature.</description>

      <title>Redicoloring some classes of circulant tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a digraph $D$ with no loops, the \textit{dicoloring graph} of $D$, denoted by $\mathcal{D}_k(D)$, is the graph whose vertices are the acyclic $k$-colorings of $D$ and two colorings are adjacent in $\mathcal{D}_k(D)$ if they differ in color on exactly one vertex. In this paper, we prove that there is no expression $\phi(\vec{\chi})$ in terms of the dichromatic number $\vec\chi$, such that the graph $\mathcal{D}_k(D)$ is connected for all graphs $D$ and integers $k\geq \phi(\vec\chi)$. We give conditions for the dicoloring graph of two infinite families of circulant tournaments to be connected, and we provide upper bounds for its diameter. In particular, for the Payley tournament $\vec{C}_{7}(1,2,4)$, also known as $ST_7$, we prove that $\mathcal{D}_k(\vec{C}_{7}(1,2,4))$ is connected and has diameter 8, for each $k\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>The functional Loomis-Whitney type inequality in the Heisenberg groups and Projection theorems over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a functional Loomis--Whitney framework on the finite Heisenberg groups $\mathbb{H}^n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ and discover connections to the boundedness and orthogonal projection problems. For $n=1$ we determine the sharp region of exponents $(u_1,u_2)$ for which the associated bilinear projection form is bounded uniformly in $q$, namely \[ \frac{1}{u_1}+\frac{2}{u_2}\le 2 \quad\text{and}\quad \frac{2}{u_1}+\frac{1}{u_2}\le 2, \] which includes the endpoint $L^{3/2}\times L^{3/2}\to L^1$. For general $n$ we prove a multilinear estimate at the critical exponent \[ u=\frac{n(2n+1)}{n+1}, \] via an induction on $n$ that exploits the group's fiber structure together with multilinear interpolation. Specializing to indicators yields a sharp Loomis--Whitney type set inequality that controls $|K|$ for every finite $K\subset \mathbb{H}^n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ by the sizes of its $2n$ Heisenberg projections $\{\pi_j(K)\}$, forcing a large projection in every configuration. A straightening map then converts these bounds into covering statements by additive cosets and provides a new approach to the orthogonal projection problem onto the vertical hyperplanes $\{x_j=0\}$, which presents an interesting link between commutative and non-commutative settings. The obtained results are optimal up to absolute constants, and in the planar case $n=1$, when the size of the set is not too small, our bound can be sharpened further using a point--line incidence estimate.</description>

This strengthens a recent result of Li, Magee, Sabri, and Thomas (2025), and answers one of their questions. Our proof relies on the theory of the matching polynomial of a graph, and we further prove new results about its Gallai--Edmonds decomposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the probability that the random signed sum $\xi_1 v_1 + \dotsb + \xi_n v_n$ lies within a given distance $r$ of the origin, where $v_1,\dotsc,v_n \in \mathbb{R}^d$ are fixed unit vectors and $\xi_1,\dotsc,\xi_n$ are independently and uniformly distributed on $\{-1,+1\}$. In particular, our results demonstrate that, for certain values of $r$, the infimum of this probability is very sensitive to the parity of $n$.
  We prove that, for any $d\geq 3$, there is some $\varepsilon = \varepsilon(d) &gt; 0$ such that for any $n \not\equiv d \mod 2$ and unit vectors $v_1,\dotsc,v_n\in \mathbb{R}^d$, there are signs $\eta_1,\dotsc,\eta_n \in \{-1,+1\}$ such that $\|\sum_{i=1}^n \eta_i v_i\| \leq \sqrt{d - \varepsilon}$, and so $\mathbb{P}(\| \xi_1 v_1 + \dotsb + \xi_n v_n \| \leq \sqrt{d-\varepsilon}) &gt; 0$. This is in contrast to the case of $n\equiv d \mod 2$, wherein the above probability can be zero. More is known if $d=2$ and $n$ is odd, and in this case we present a construction demonstrating that $\mathbb{P}(\|\xi_1 v_1 + \dotsb + \xi_n v_n\| \leq 1)$ can decay exponentially as $n$ increases.</description>

      <title>Restrictions of PCBNs for integration-free computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pair-copula Bayesian Networks (PCBN) are graphical models composed of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that represents (conditional) independence in a joint distribution. The nodes of the DAG are associated with marginal densities, and arcs are assigned with bivariate (conditional) copulas following a prescribed collection of parental orders. The choice of marginal densities and copulas is unconstrained. However, the simulation and inference of a PCBN model may necessitate possibly high-dimensional integration.
  We present the full characterization of DAGs that do not require any integration for density evaluation or simulations. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm that can find all possible parental orders that do not lead to (expensive) integration. Finally, we show the asymptotic normality of estimators of PCBN models using stepwise estimating equations. Such estimators can be computed effectively if the PCBN does not require integration. A simulation study shows the good finite-sample properties of our estimators.</description>

      <title>On the global linear Zarankiewicz problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The `global' Zarankiewicz problem for hypergraphs asks for an upper bound on the number of edges of a finite $r$-hypergraph $V$ in terms of the number $|V|$ of its vertices, assuming the edge relation is induced by a fixed $K_{k, \dots, k}$-free $r$-hypergraph $E$, for some $k\in\mathbb N$. In [4], such bounds of size $O(|V|^{r-1})$ were achieved for a semilinear $E$, namely, definable in a linear o-minimal structure. We establish the same bounds in five new settings: when $E$ is definable in (a) a semibounded o-minimal structure and the vertex set of $V$ is `sufficiently distant', (b) a model of Presburger arithmetic, (c) the expansion $\langle\mathbb R,&lt;,+, \mathbb Z\rangle$ of the real ordered group by the set of integers, (d) a stable 1-based structure without the finite cover property, and (e) a locally modular regular type in a stable theory, such as the generic type of the solution set of the Heat differential equation.
  Our methods include techniques for reducing Zarankiewicz's problem to the setting of arbitrary subgroups of powers of groups, used in geometric cases (a)--(c). They also include an abstract version of Zarankiewicz's problem for general `linear structures' that yields the desired bounds in the model-theoretic settings (d)--(e), as well as a parametric version in (b). Furthermore, the bounds in (a) characterise those o-minimal structures that do not recover a global field, and in (c) they yield new versions of Zarankiewicz's problem for certain ordered abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Scattered Behavior Using Modified Cyclotomic Mapping Over Finite Fields Of Odd Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introduced by Sheekey in 2016, the study of scattered polynomials over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$ has been increasing regarding the classification of those that are \textit{exceptional}, i.e., polynomials which are scattered over infinite field extensions, are limited to the cases where their index $t$ is small, or a prime number larger than the q-degree k of the polynomial, or an integer smaller than k in the case where k is a prime. In this paper, we focus on the scattered behavior of $S(x)=\sum_{i=1}^k a_ix^{q^{r_i}} \in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}[x]$, where $q$ is a power of an odd prime, $0&lt;r_1&lt;r_2&lt; \cdots&lt;r_k&lt;n$ and $a_1, \cdots,a_k \in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}^*$ such that the order of $a_i$'s divide $(q^{r_1}-1)$, $\forall i=2,3,\cdots,k $. We explore a connection between $S(x)$ and the cyclotomic mapping polynomial. As an application, in three parts, we discuss the scattered behavior of $S(x)$ of index $t$ where $t=r_1$, or $0&lt;t&lt;r_1$, or $r_1&lt;t&lt;n$. Starting with the pseudoregulus type of index $t \geq 0$, we present conditions to verify scattered behavior of $S(x)$ of index $r_1$. With some additional conditions, we do the same in case $0&lt;t&lt;r_1$ or $r_1&lt;t&lt;n$. In particular, for $S(x)=a_1x^{q^{r_1}}+a_2x^{q^{r_2}} \in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}[x]$ with $a_1,a_2 \in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}^*$ such that $|a_2| \mid q^{r_1}-1$, we present a necessary and sufficient condition to verify its scattered behavior of index $t \in \{r_1,r_2\}$. We also connect such scattered binomials with the well known \textit{Lunardon-Polverino} polynomial. With conditions on $\delta, q,n$, and $r$; we present a new family of \textit{exceptional scattered polynomial} $S(x)=x^q+\delta x^{q^{(2r+1)}} \in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}[x]$ of index $\{r+1\}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G=F\ast_\varphi t$ be an HNN extension of a free group $F$ with two equal associated normal subgroups $H_1 = H_2$ of finite index. We prove that the word problem in $G$ is decidable in polynomial time. This result extends to the case where the subgroups $H_1=H_2$ are not normal, provided that the isomorphism $\varphi:H_1\to H_2$ satisfies an additional condition described in Section 5.</description>

      <title>Vector Trifference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a geometric generalization of trifference, a concept introduced by Elias in 1988 in the study of zero-error channel capacity. In the discrete setting, a code C \subseteq {0,1,2}^n is trifferent if for any three distinct codewords x, y, z in C, there exists a coordinate i in [n] where x_i, y_i, z_i are all distinct. Determining the maximum size of such codes remains a central open problem; the classical upper bound |C| \leq 2 * (3/2)^n, proved via a simple pruning argument, has resisted significant improvement.
  Motivated by the search for new techniques, and in line with vectorial extensions of other classical combinatorial notions, we introduce the concept of vector trifferent codes. Consider C \subseteq (S^2)^n, where the alphabet is the unit sphere S^2 = { v in R^3 : ||v|| = 1 }. We say C is vector trifferent if for any three distinct x, y, z in C, there is an index i where the vectors x_i, y_i, z_i are mutually orthogonal. A direct reduction of the vectorial problem to the discrete setting appears infeasible, making it difficult to replicate Elias's pruning argument. Nevertheless, we develop a new method to establish the upper bound |C| \leq (sqrt(2) + o(1)) * (3/2)^n.
  Interestingly, our approach, when adapted back to the discrete setting, yields a polynomial improvement to Elias's bound: |C| \lesssim n^(-1/4) * (3/2)^n. This improvement arises from a technique that parallels, but is not identical to, a recent method of the authors, though it still falls short of the sharper n^(-2/5) factor obtained there. We also generalize the concept of vector trifferent codes to richer alphabets and prove a vectorial version of the Fredman-Komlos theorem (1984) for general k-separating codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enumerative geometry, the art and science of counting geometric objects satisfying geometric conditions, has seen a resurgence of activity in recent years due to an influx of new techniques that allow for enriched computations. This paper offers a historical survey of enumerative geometry, starting with its classical origins and real counterparts, to new advances in quadratic enrichment. We include a brief survey of the paradigm shift initiated by Gromov-Witten theory, whose impact can be seen in recent results in quadratically enriched enumerative geometry. Finally, we conclude with a brief overview of emerging directions including random and equivariant enumerative geometry.</description>

Abstract: We generalize Pach and de Zeeuw's bound for distinct distances between points on two curves, from algebraic curves to Pfaffian curves. Pfaffian curves include those that can be defined by any combination of elementary functions, including exponential and logarithmic functions, rational and irrational powers, trigonometric functions and their inverses, integration, and more. The bound remains $\Omega(\min\{m^{3/4}n^{3/4},m^2,n^2\})$, as obtained from the proximity technique of Solymosi and Zahl.</description>

      <title>Finding a HIST: Chordality, Structural Parameters, and Diameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A homeomorphically irreducible spanning tree (HIST) is a spanning tree with no degree-2 vertices, serving as a structurally minimal backbone of a graph. While the existence of HISTs has been widely studied from a structural perspective, the algorithmic complexity of finding them remains less understood. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive investigation of the HIST problem from both structural and algorithmic viewpoints. We present a simple characterization that precisely describes which chordal graphs of diameter at most~3 admit a HIST, leading to a polynomial-time decision procedure for this class. In contrast, we show that the problem is NP-complete for strongly chordal graphs of diameter~4. From the perspective of parameterized complexity, we establish that the HIST problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by clique-width, indicating that the problem is unlikely to be efficiently solvable in general dense graphs. On the other hand, we present fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms when parameterized by treewidth, modular-width, or cluster vertex deletion number. Specifically, we develop an $O^*(4^{k})$-time algorithm parameterized by modular-width~$k$, and an FPT algorithm parameterized by the cluster vertex deletion number based on kernelization techniques that bound clique sizes while preserving the existence of a HIST. These results together provide a clearer understanding of the structural and computational boundaries of the HIST problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We express the outer multiplicities in the tensor products of two fundamental simple modules for an affine Kac-Moody algebra of type $A$ in terms of counting certain sets of multipartitions by exploring the stabilizing limits of certain excellent filtrations. This extends for all ranks a previously obtained result by Jakeli\'c and the second author for rank $1$. The same outer multiplicities were previously computed by Misra and Wilson in terms of counting certain sets of tableaux. By comparing these two expressions and by explicitly exhibiting a combinatorial description of level-$2$ affine Weyl group orbits, we establish the existence of a bijection between the Misra-Wilson set of tableaux and a disjoint union of certain sets of multipartitions.</description>

      <title>Mock modular forms from the k-rank moments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the generating functions of Garvans so-called $k$-ranks are used, to define a family of mock Eisenstein series. The $k$-rank moments are then expressed as partition traces of these functions. We explore the modular properties of this new family, give recursive formulas for them involving divisor like sums, and prove that their Fourier coefficient are integral. Furthermore, we show that these functions lie in an algebra that is generated only by derivatives up to a finite order but is nevertheless closed under differentiation. In the process, we also answer a question raised by Bringmann, Pandey and van Ittersum by showing that the divisor like sum $$\left(1-2^{\ell-1} \right) \frac{B_\ell}{2\ell}+ \sum_{2n-1 \geq bm \geq b} (2n-bm)^{\ell-1} q^{mn} - \sum_{m-1 \geq 2bn \geq 2b} (m-2bn)^{\ell-1} q^{mn},$$ has a quasi-completion, when $b\geq 3$ is odd.</description>

Abstract: Strongly robust toric ideals are the toric ideals for which the set of indispensable binomials is the Graver basis. The strongly robust simplicial complex $\Delta _T$ of a simple toric ideal $I_T$ determines the strongly robust property for all toric ideals that have $I_T$ as their bouquet ideal. We prove that $\text{dim} \Delta_T&lt;\text{rank}(T)$ for configurations in general position, partially answering a question posed by Sullivant.</description>

      <title>Embeddings of weighted projective spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a projective toric variety of dimension $n$ and let $L$ be a ample line bundle on $X$. For $k \geq 0$, it is in general difficult to determine whether $L^{\otimes k}$ is very ample and whether it additionally gives a projectively normal embedding. These two properties are equivalent to the very ampleness, respectively normality, of the corresponding polytope. By a result of Ewald-Wessels, both statements are classically known to hold for $k \geq n - 1$.
  We study embeddings of weighted projective spaces $\mathbb{P}(a_0, \ldots, a_n)$ via their corresponding rectangular simplices $\Delta(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n)$. We give multiple criteria (depending on arithmetic properties of the weights $a_i$) to obtain bounds for the power $k$ which are sharp in many cases. We also introduce combinatorial tools that allow us to systematically construct families exhibiting extremal behaviour. These results extend earlier work of Payne, Hering and Bruns-Gubeladze.</description>

      <title>A Tauberian approach to metric scaling limits of random discrete structures, with an application to random planar maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove sandwich theorems and a Tauberian theorem in the space of compact metric measure spaces, endowed with the Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov (GHP) topology. These results hold with respect to a close relative of Gromov's Lipschitz order. As a proof-of-concept of a general method to prove metric scaling limits of random discrete structures, we give an application to the theory of random planar maps: the Brownian sphere is the scaling limit in the GHP topology of irreducible quandrangulations. Our main inputs are (i) the convergence of general quadrangulations to the Brownian sphere (Le Gall, 2013; Miermont, 2013); and (ii) couplings where irreducible quadrangulations of the hexagon are "grown" by face-openings (Addario-Berry, 2016).</description>

      <title>Stanley decompositions of modules of covariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16749v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a complex reductive group, with finite-dimensional representations $W$ and $U$. The module of covariants for $W$ of type $U$ is the space of all $H$-equivariant polynomial maps $\varphi: W \longrightarrow U$. In this paper, we take $H$ to be one of the classical groups $\operatorname{GL}(V)$, $\operatorname{O}(V)$, or $\operatorname{Sp}(V)$, where $W$ is a direct sum of copies of $V$ and $V^*$, and $U$ is an arbitrary rational representation (with $U$ restricted to exterior powers of $V$ in the $H= \operatorname{O}(V)$ case). Our main result gives uniform Stanley decompositions of these modules of covariants, with Stanley spaces parametrized by combinatorial objects we call jellyfish. As a corollary, we write down the Hilbert series as a finite sum of rational functions, each with a combinatorial interpretation in terms of lattice paths. Notably, these results do not rely on the module being Cohen-Macaulay. We further apply our methods to invariant rings for $\operatorname{SL}(V)$ and $\operatorname{SO}(V)$. Our proofs (for $H = \operatorname{GL}(V)$ and $\operatorname{Sp}(V)$) rely on previous work by Jackson on standard monomial theory for dual reductive pairs, since classical modules of covariants can be viewed via Howe duality as Harish-Chandra modules of unitary highest weight representations of a certain real reductive group. As a first step toward extending this program to arbitrary unitary highest weight representations (including those of the exceptional groups), we establish analogous results uniformly for the Wallach representations of type ADE.</description>

We also provide formulas for the higher-order derivatives of Cauchy polynomials and obtain corresponding formulas and identities for poly-Cauchy polynomials. Furthermore, we introduce a multiparameter framework for poly-Cauchy polynomials, unifying earlier generalizations like shifted poly-Cauchy numbers and polynomials with a $q$ parameter.</description>

      <title>Finding d-Cuts in Graphs of Bounded Diameter, Graphs of Bounded Radius and H-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11389v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The d-Cut problem is to decide if a graph has an edge cut such that each vertex has at most d neighbours at the opposite side of the cut. If $d=1$, we obtain the intensively studied Matching Cut problem. The d-Cut problem has been studied as well, but a systematic study for special graph classes was lacking. We initiate such a study and consider classes of bounded diameter, bounded radius and $H$-free graphs. We prove that for all $d\geq 2$, d-Cut is polynomial-time solvable for graphs of diameter 2, $(P_3+P_4)$-free graphs and $P_5$-free graphs. These results extend known results for $d=1$. However, we also prove several NP-hardness results for d-Cut that contrast known polynomial-time results for $d=1$. Our results lead to full dichotomies for bounded diameter and bounded radius and to almost-complete dichotomies for H-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Regular polytopes of rank $n/2$ for transitive groups of degree $n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous research established that the maximal rank of the abstract regular polytopes whose automorphism group is a transitive proper subgroup of $\mbox{S}_n$ is $n/2 + 1$. Up to isomorphism and duality, when $n\geq 12$, there are only two polytopes attaining this rank and they occur when $n/2$ is odd, and hence have even rank.
  In this paper, we investigate the case where the rank is equal to $n/2$ ($n\geq 14$). Our analysis suggests that reducing the rank by one results in a substantial increase in the number of regular polytopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $E$ be a set in $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ and $S$ be a set of maps from $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ to $\mathbb{F}_p^n$. We define \[ S (E) := \bigcup_{f\in S} f(E) = \left\lbrace f(x) \colon x\in E, f\in S \right\rbrace.\] In this paper, we establish sharp lower bounds on the size of $S(E)$ when $S$ consists of matrices from either the special linear group $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ or the first Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}_1(\mathbb{F}_p)$. Our proofs are based on novel results on algebraic incidence-type structures associated with these groups. We also discuss higher-dimensional generalizations.</description>

      <title>Color avoidance for monotone paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2014, Moshkovitz and Shapira determined the tower height for hypergraph Ramsey numbers of tight monotone paths. We address the color-avoiding version of this problem in which one no longer necessarily seeks a monochromatic subgraph, but rather one which avoids some colors. This problem was previously studied in uniformity two by Loh and by Gowers and Long.
  We show, in general, that the tower height for such Ramsey numbers requires one less exponential than in the usual setting. The transition occurs at uniformity three, where the usual Ramsey numbers of monotone paths of length $n$ are exponential in $n$, but the color-avoiding Ramsey numbers turn out to be polynomial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11781v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of pattern avoidance in rectangulations. We give a formal definition of such patterns and investigate rectangulations that avoid $\top$-like patterns - the pattern $\top$ and its rotations. For every $L \subseteq \{\top, \, \vdash, \, \bot, \, \dashv \}$ we enumerate $L$-avoiding rectangulations, both weak and strong. In particular, we show $\top$-avoiding weak rectangulations are enumerated by Catalan numbers and construct bijections to several Catalan structures. Then, we prove that $\top$-avoiding strong rectangulations are in bijection with several classes of inversion sequences, among them $I(010,101,120,201)$ and $I(011,201)$ - which leads to a solution of the conjecture that these classes are Wilf-equivalent. Finally, we show that $\{\top, \bot\}$-avoiding strong rectangulations are in bijection with recently introduced rushed Dyck paths.</description>

Abstract: For a graph $G=(V,\ E)$ and a nonempty set $S\subseteq V$, the \emph{vertex boundary} of $S$, denoted by $\partial_G(S)$, is defined to be the set of vertices that are not in $S$ but have at least one neighbor in $S$. In this paper, for $G$ being a strong product of two paths, we determine the cases in which $|\partial_G(S)|$ is minimized.</description>

      <title>Term Coding for Extremal Combinatorics: Dispersion and Complexity Dichotomies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16265v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce \emph{Term Coding}, a novel framework for analysing extremal problems in discrete mathematics by encoding them as finite systems of \emph{term equations} (and, optionally, \emph{non-equality constraints}). In its basic form, all variables range over a single domain, and we seek an interpretation of the function symbols that \emph{maximises} the number of solutions to these constraints. This perspective unifies classical questions in extremal combinatorics, network/index coding, and finite model theory.
  We further develop \emph{multi-sorted Term Coding}, a more general approach in which variables may be of different sorts (e.g., points, lines, blocks, colours, labels), possibly supplemented by variable-inequality constraints to enforce distinctness. This extension captures sophisticated structures such as block designs, finite geometries, and mixed coding scenarios within a single logical formalism.
  Our main result shows how to determine (up to a constant) the maximum number of solutions \(\max_{\mathcal{I}}(\Gamma,n)\) for any system of term equations (possibly including non-equality constraints) by relating it to \emph{graph guessing numbers} and \emph{entropy measures}.
  Finally, we focus on \emph{dispersion problems}, an expressive subclass of these constraints. We discover a striking complexity dichotomy: deciding whether, for a given integer \(r\), the maximum code size that reaches \(n^{r}\) is \emph{undecidable}, while deciding whether it exceeds \(n^{r}\) is \emph{polynomial-time decidable}.</description>

      <title>Counting subgraphs of coloring graphs using shadow graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, the $k$-coloring graph $\mathcal{C}_k(G)$ is constructed by selecting proper $k$-colorings of $G$ as vertices, with an edge between two colorings if they differ in the color of exactly one vertex. The number of vertices in $\mathcal{C}_k(G)$ is the famous chromatic polynomial of $G$. Asgarli, Krehbiel, Levinson and Russell showed that for any subgraph $H$, the number of induced copies of $H$ in $\mathcal{C}_k(G)$ is a polynomial function in $k$. Hogan, Scott, Tamitegama, and Tan found a shorter proof for polynomiality of these chromatic $H$-polynomials. In this paper, we provide a method of constructing these polynomials explicitly in terms of chromatic polynomials of shadow graphs. We illustrate the practicality of our formulas by computing an explicit formula for $H$-polynomial for trees when $H=Q_d$ is an arbitrary hypercube, a task which does not seem approachable from previous methods. The coefficients of the resulting polynomials feature generalized degree sequences introduced by Crew. In the special case when $H=P_2$, the corresponding polynomial is dubbed the chromatic pairs polynomial. We present a pair of graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ sharing the same chromatic pairs polynomial but different chromatic polynomials, disproving a conjecture raised by Asgarli, Krehbiel, Levinson and Russell.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the set of numbers the total number of independent sets can admit in $n$-vertex graphs. In this paper, we prove that the cardinality $\mathcal{N}i(n)$ of this set is very close to $2^n$ in the following sense: $\mathcal{N}i(n)/2^n = O(n^{-1/5})$ while for infinitely many $n$, we have $\log_2(\mathcal{N}i(n)/2^n)\ge -2^{(1+o(1)\sqrt{\log_2 n}}$. This set is also precisely the set of possible values of the independence polynomial $I_G(x)$ at $x=1$ for $n$-vertex graphs $G$. As an application, we address an additive combinatorial problem on subsets of a given vector space that avoid certain intersection patterns with respect to subspaces.</description>

      <title>Positive combinatorial formulae for involution matrix loci and orbit harmonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11747v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}_{n,a}$ be the set consisting of involutions in symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ with exactly $a$ fixed points and apply the orbit harmonics method to obtain a graded $\mathfrak{S}_n$-module $R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a})$. Liu, Ma, Rhoades, and Zhu figured out a signed combinatorial formula for the graded Frobenius image $\mathrm{grFrob}(R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a});q)$ of $R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a})$. Our goal is to cancel these signs. Finally, we find two positive combinatorial formulae for $\mathrm{grFrob}(R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a});q)$. As an application, we deduce a series of $\mathfrak{S}_n$-equivariant isomorphisms between graded components $R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a})_d$ and $R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a^{\prime}})_d$ for some integers $a\neq a^{\prime}$ and $d$. Our positive formulae also yield potential attempts to find a linear basis for $R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a})$ and a statistic $\mathrm{stat}:\mathcal{M}_{n,a}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_{\ge0}$ to interpret the Hilbert series $\mathrm{Hilb}(R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a});q)$ of $R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a})$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an equivariant version of the characteristic quasi-polynomials as the permutation characters on the complement of mod $q$ hyperplane arrangements. We prove that the permutation character is a quasi-polynomial in $q$, and show that it can be expressed by the sum of the induced characters of an equivariant version of the Ehrhart quasi-polynomials. Furthermore, we consider the case of the Coxeter arrangements, and compute in detail for type $A_\ell$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider an order $n$ abelian group $G$ and a tree $T$ on $n$ vertices. When is it possible to (bijectively) label $V(T)$ by $G$ so that along all edges $xy$ of $T$, the sums $x+y$ are distinct? This problem can be traced back to the work of Graham and Sloane on the harmonious labelling conjecture, and has been studied extensively since its introduction in 1980. We give a precise characterisation that holds for all bounded degree trees. In particular, our characterisation implies that if $G=\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ and $T$ is a bounded degree tree, the desired labelling exists. This confirms a conjecture of Graham and Sloane from 1980, and another conjecture of Chang, Hsu, and Rogers from 1987, for bounded degree trees. Our results also have further applications for the study of graph coverings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph is said to be rigid if, given a generic realisation of the graph as a bar-and-joint framework in the plane, there exist only finitely many other realisations of the graph with the same edge lengths modulo rotations, reflections and translations. In recent years there has been an increase of interest in determining exactly what this finite amount is, hereon known as the realisation number. Combinatorial algorithms for the realisation number were previously known for the special cases of minimally rigid and redundantly rigid graphs. In this paper we provide a combinatorial algorithm to compute the realisation number of any rigid graph, and thus solve an open problem of Jackson and Owen. We then adapt our algorithm to compute: (i) spherical realisation numbers, and (ii) the number of rank-3 PSD matrix completions of a generic partial matrix.</description>

Abstract: Matrix Schubert varieties (Fulton '92) carry natural actions of Levi groups. Their coordinate rings are thereby Levi-representations; what is a combinatorial counting rule for the multiplicities of their irreducibles? When the Levi group is a torus, (Knutson-Miller '04) answers the question. We present a general solution, a common refinement of the multigraded Hilbert series, the Cauchy identity, and the Littlewood-Richardson rule. Our result applies to any ``bicrystalline'' algebraic variety; we define these using the operators of (Kashiwara '95) and of (Danilov-Koshevoi '05, van Leeuwen '06). The proof introduces a ``filtered'' generalization of the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence.</description>

Abstract: Laurent phenomenon algebras, first introduced by Lam and Pylyavskyy, are a generalization of cluster algebras that still possess many salient features of cluster algebras. Graph Laurent phenomenon algebras, defined by Lam and Pylyavskyy, are a subclass of Laurent phenomenon algebras whose structure is given by the data of a directed graph. In this paper, we prove that the cluster monomials of a graph Laurent phenomenon algebra form a linear basis, as conjectured by Lam and Pylyavskyy and analogous to a result for cluster algebras by Caldero and Keller. We also prove that, if the graph is a bidirected tree, the coefficients of the expansion of any monomial in terms of cluster monomials are nonnegative.</description>

Abstract: We give a classification of the $regular$ soliton solutions of the KP hierarchy, referred to as the $KP solitons$, under the Gel'fand-Dickey $\ell$-reductions in terms of the permutation of the symmetric group. As an example, we show that the regular soliton solutions of the (good) Boussinesq equation as the 3-reduction can have $at ~most$ one resonant soliton in addition to two sets of solitons propagating in opposite directions. We also give a systematic construction of these soliton solutions for the $\ell$-reductions using the vertex operators. In particular, we show that the $non-crossing$ permutation gives the regularity condition for the soliton solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19878v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transpose top-$2$ with random shuffle (J. Theoret. Probab., 2020) is a lazy random walk on the alternating group $A_n$ generated by $3$-cycles of the form $(\star,n-1,n)$ and $(\star,n,n-1)$. We obtain the limit profile of this random walk by comparing it with the random walk on $A_n$ generated by all $3$-cycles. Our method employs a non-commutative Fourier analysis analogue of the comparison method introduced by Nestoridi (Electron. J. Probab., 2024).

      <title>On the gcd graphs over polynomial rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gcd-graphs over the ring of integers modulo $n$ are a natural generalization of unitary Cayley graphs. The study of these graphs has foundations in various mathematical fields, including number theory, ring theory, and representation theory. Using the theory of Ramanujan sums, it is known that these gcd-graphs have integral spectra; i.e., all their eigenvalues are integers. In this work, inspired by the analogy between number fields and function fields, we define and study gcd-graphs over polynomial rings with coefficients in finite fields. We establish some fundamental properties of these graphs, emphasizing their analogy to their counterparts over $\mathbb{Z}.$</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Bounds and Online Algorithms for Average-Case Matrix Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the matrix discrepancy problem in the average-case setting. Given a sequence of $m \times m$ symmetric matrices $A_1,\ldots,A_n$, its discrepancy is defined as the minimal spectral norm over all signed sums $\sum_{i=1}^n x_iA_i$ with $x_1,\ldots,x_n \in \{\pm1\}$. Our contributions are twofold. First, we study the asymptotic discrepancy of random matrices. When the matrices belong to the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, we provide a sharp characterization of the asymptotic discrepancy and show that the limiting distribution is concentrated around $\Theta(\sqrt{nm}4^{-(1 + o(1))n/m^2})$, under the assumption $m^2 \ll n/\log{n}$. We observe that the trivial bound $O(\sqrt{nm})$ cannot be improved when $n \ll m^2$ and show that this phenomenon occurs for a broad class of random matrices. In the case $n = \Omega(m^2)$, we provide a matching upper bound. Second, we analyse the matrix hyperbolic cosine algorithm, an online algorithm for matrix discrepancy minimization due to Zouzias (2011), in the average-case setting. We show that the algorithm achieves with high probability a discrepancy of $O(m\log{m})$ for a broad class of random matrices, including Wigner matrices with entries satisfying a hypercontractive inequality and Gaussian Wishart matrices.</description>

      <title>Growing conditioned BGW trees with log-concave offspring distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03065v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that given a log-concave offspring distribution, the corresponding sequence of Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson trees conditioned to have $n\geq 1$ vertices admits a realization as a Markov process $(T_n)_{n\geq1}$ which adds a new "right-leaning" leaf at each step. This applies for instance to offspring distributions which are Poisson, binomial, geometric, or any convolution of those. By a negative result of Janson, the log-concavity condition is optimal in the restricted case of offspring distributions supported in $\{0,1,2\}$. We then prove a generalization to the case of an offspring distribution supported on an arithmetic progression, if we assume log-concavity along that progression.
  As an application, we deduce the existence of increasing couplings in an inhomogeneous model of random subtrees of the Ulam--Harris tree. This is equivalent to the statement that, in a corresponding inhomogeneous Bernouilli percolation model on a regular tree, the root cluster is stochastically increasing in its size.
  These results generalize a construction of Luczak and Winkler which applies to uniformly sampled subtrees with $n$ vertices of the infinite complete $d$-ary trees. Our proofs are elementary and we tried to make them as self-contained as possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we will associate a family $\{K_1,\dots,K_l\}\subset \mathbb{S}^3$ of iterated torus knots to a given free numerical semigroup. We will describe the fundamental group of the knot complement of each knot of the family. Finally, we will show that all knots in the family have same Alexander polynomial and it coincides (up to a factor) with the Poincar\'e series of the free numerical semigroup. As a consequence, we will provide families of iterated torus knots with the same Alexander polynomial of an irreducible plane curve singularity but which are non-isotopic to its associated knot.</description>

      <title>Faces of homogeneous cones and applications to homogeneous chordality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09581v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A convex cone $\mathcal{K}$ is said to be homogeneous if its group of automorphisms acts transitively on its relative interior. Important examples of homogeneous cones include symmetric cones and cones of positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices that follow a sparsity pattern given by a homogeneous chordal graph. Our goal in this paper is to elucidate the facial structure of homogeneous cones and make it as transparent as the faces of the PSD matrices. We prove that each face of a homogeneous cone $\mathcal{K}$ is mapped by an automorphism of $\mathcal{K}$ to one of its finitely many so-called principal faces. Furthermore, constructing such an automorphism can be done algorithmically by making use of a generalized Cholesky decomposition. Among other consequences, we give a proof that homogeneous cones are projectionally exposed, which strengthens the previous best result that they are amenable. Using our results, we will carefully analyze the facial structure of cones of PSD matrices satisfying homogeneous chordality and discuss consequences for the corresponding family of PSD completion problems.</description>

      <title>The connectivity carcass of a vertex subset in a graph: both odd and even case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected unweighted multi-graph and $S\subseteq V$ be a subset of vertices. A set of edges with the least cardinality whose removal disconnects $S$, that is, there is no path between at least one pair of vertices from $S$, is called a Steiner mincut for $S$ or simply an $S$-mincut. Connectivity Carcass is a compact data structure storing all $S$-mincuts in $G$ announced by Dinitz and Vainshtein in an extended abstract by Dinitz and Vainshtein in 1994. The complete proof of various results of this data structure for the simpler case when the capacity of $S$-mincut is odd appeared in the year 2000 in SICOMP. Over the last couple of decades, there have been attempts towards the proof for the case when the capacity of $S$-mincut is even, but none of them met a logical end. We present the following results.
  - We present the first complete, self-contained exposition of the connectivity carcass which covers both even and odd cases of the capacity of $S$-mincut.
  - We derive the results using an alternate and much simpler approach. In particular, we derive the results using submodularity of cuts -- a well-known property of graphs expressed using a simple inequality.
  - We also show how the connectivity carcass can be helpful in efficiently answering some basic queries related to $S$-mincuts using some additional insights.</description>

      <title>Correlator Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, "cosmohedra" have been introduced as polytopes underlying the cosmological wavefunction for conformally coupled Tr($\Phi^3$) theory in FRW cosmologies, generalizing associahedra for flat space scattering amplitudes. In this letter we show that correlation functions are also directly captured by a new polytope - the "Correlatron". The combinatorics of correlation functions is an interesting blend of flat space scattering amplitudes and wavefunctions. This is reflected in the correlatron geometry, which is a one-higher dimensional polytope sandwiched between cosmohedron and associahedron facets. We provide an explicit embedding for the correlatron, which is a natural extension of the "shaving" picture for cosmohedra to one higher dimension. As a byproduct, we also define "graph correlahedra" as polytopes for the contribution to correlators from any fixed graph. We show how the canonical form of these polytopes directly computes the graph correlator, without the power of two weights seen in previous geometric formulations. Finally, we give a prescription for extracting the full correlator from the canonical form of the correlatron.</description>

      <title>A Higgs category for the cluster variety of triples of flags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cluster variety of triples of flags (associated with a split simple Lie group of Dynkin type Delta) plays a key role in higher Teichmuller theory as developed by Fock-Goncharov, Jiarui Fei, Ian Le, ... and Goncharov-Shen. We refer to it as the basic triangle associated with Delta. In this paper, for simply laced Delta, we construct and study a Higgs category (in the sense of Yilin Wu) which we expect to categorify the basic triangle. This category is a certain exact dg category (in the sense of Xiaofa Chen) which is Frobenius and stably 2-Calabi-Yau. We show that it has indeed the expected cyclic group symmetry and that its derived category has the expected braid group symmetry. A key ingredient in our construction is a conjecture by Merlin Christ, whose proof occupies most of this paper. The proof is based on a new description of the Higgs category in terms of Gorenstein projective dg modules. Our techniques are in the spirit of Orlov in his work on triangulated categories of graded B-branes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic properties of permutations drawn from the Luce model, a natural probabilistic framework in which permutations are generated sequentially by sampling without replacement, with selection probabilities proportional to prescribed positive weights. These permutations arise in applications such as ranking models, the Tsetlin library, and related Markov processes. Under minimal assumptions on the weights, we establish a permuton limit theorem describing the global behavior of Luce-distributed permutations and derive an explicit density of the limiting permuton. We further compute limiting pattern densities and analyze the differences between exact Luce permutations and their permuton approximations. We also study the local convergence of these permutations, proving a quenched Benjamini--Schramm limit and a central limit theorem for consecutive pattern occurrences. Finally, we prove a central limit theorem for the number of inversions.</description>

      <title>Signature 0 toric varieties, wall crossings, and cross polytope-like structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the structure of simplicial locally convex fans associated to even-dimensional complete toric varieties with signature 0. They belong to the set of such toric varieties whose even degree Betti numbers yield a top gamma vector component equal to 0. The gamma vector is an invariant of palindromic polynomials whose nonnegativity lies between unimodality and real-rootedness. It is known (and expected more generally) that the cases where this top component is 0 are among the "building blocks" of those where it is nonnegative. This means minimality with respect to a certain restricted class of blowups. However, this equality to 0 case is currently poorly understood. In the course of addressing this situation, we find that this interpretation encodes *intrinsic* combinatorial information on the fan in addition to earlier compatibility with existing natural combinatorial examples.
  Our main method uses wall crossings. The links of the fan come from a repeated suspension of the maximal linear subspace in its realization in the ambient space of the fan. Conversely, the centers of these links containing any particular line form a cone or a repeated suspension of one. The intersection patterns between these "anchoring" linear subspaces come from how far certain submodularity inequalities are from equality and parity conditions on their dimensions. This involves linear dependence and containment relations between them which are connected to optimization. We obtain these relations by viewing the vanishing of certain mixed volumes from the perspective of the exponents. Finally, these wall crossings yield a simple method of generating induced 4-cycles covering the minimal objects described above. We intersect rational equivalence relations with 2-dimensional orbit closures instead of 1-dimensional ones as in most combinatorial applications.</description>

      <title>Reinforced Generation of Combinatorial Structures: Applications to Complexity Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18057v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore whether techniques from AI can help discover new combinatorial structures that improve on known limits on efficient algorithms. Specifically, we use AlphaEvolve (an LLM coding agent) to study two settings:
  a) Average-case hardness for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set: We improve a recent result of Kunisky and Yu to obtain near-optimal upper and (conditional) lower bounds on certification algorithms for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set on random 3- and 4-regular graphs. Our improved lower bounds are obtained by constructing nearly extremal Ramanujan graphs on as many as $163$ nodes, using AlphaEvolve. Additionally, via analytical arguments we strengthen the upper bounds to settle the computational hardness of these questions up to an error in the third decimal place.
  b) Worst-case Hardness of Approximation for MAX-k-CUT: We obtain new inapproximability results, proving that it is NP-hard to approximate MAX-4-CUT and MAX-3-CUT within factors of $0.987$ and $0.9649$ respectively, using AlphaEvolve to discover new gadget reductions. Our MAX-4-CUT result improves upon the SOTA of $0.9883$, and our MAX-3-CUT result improves on the current best gadget-based inapproximability result of $0.9853$, but falls short of improving the SOTA of $16/17$ that relies on a custom PCP, rather than a gadget reduction from "standard" H{\aa}stad-style PCPs.
  A key technical challenge we faced: verifying a candidate construction produced by AlphaEvolve is costly (often requiring exponential time). In both settings above, our results were enabled by using AlphaEvolve itself to evolve the verification procedure to be faster (sometimes by $10,000\times$). We conclude with a discussion of norms by which to assess the assistance from AI in developing proofs.</description>

      <title>Graph enumeration for moduli spaces of curves and maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a calculus based on graph enumeration for calculating $S_n$-equivariant motivic invariants of graphically stratified moduli spaces. We apply our theory to the Deligne--Mumford moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g, n}$ and to the space of torus-fixed stable maps $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g, n}(X, \beta)^{\mathbb{C}^\star}$ when the target $X$ admits an appropriate $\mathbb{C}^\star$-action, deriving new formulas in each case. A key role is played by the P\'olya--Petersen character of a graph, which enriches P\'olya's classical cycle index polynomial. This character is valued in an algebra $\Lambda^{[2]}$ of wreath product symmetric functions, which we study from combinatorial and representation--theoretic perspectives. We prove that this algebra may be viewed as the Grothendieck ring of the category of polynomial functors which take symmetric sequences of vector spaces to vector spaces, building on foundational work of Macdonald. This leads to a plethystic action of $\Lambda^{[2]}$ on the ring $\Lambda$ of ordinary symmetric functions. Using this action, we derive our formulas, which ultimately involve only ordinary symmetric functions and the Grothendieck ring of mixed Hodge structures.</description>

      <title>A family of non-uniform distributions on the set of parking functions generated by random permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a rather natural family of non-uniform distributions on $PF_n$, $n\in\mathbb{N}$, the set of parking functions of length $n$. One of the motivations for this comes from a similar situation in the context of integer partitions. For a permutation $\sigma\in S_n$ and for $j\in[n]$, let $I_{n,&lt;j}(\sigma)$ denote the number of inversions in $\sigma$ that involve the number $j$ and a number less than $j$. Let $\tilde I_{n,&lt;j}(\sigma)=I_{n,&lt;j}(\sigma)+1$. The map $(\sigma,\tau)\to\left(\tilde I_{n,&lt;\tau_1}(\sigma),\cdots, \tilde I_{n,&lt; \tau_n}(\sigma)\right)$ maps $S_n\times S_n$ onto $PF_n$. Consider the family of distributions $P_n^{(q)}\times P_n$, $q\in(0,\infty)$, on $S_n\times S_n$, where $P_n$ is the uniform distribution on $S_n$ and $P_n^{(q)}$ is the Mallows distribution with parameter $q$ on $S_n$. The Mallows distributions are defined by exponential tilting via the inversion statistic. For each $q&gt;0$, the above map along with the distribution $P_n^{(q)}\times P_n$ induces an exchangeable distribution $\mathcal{P}_n^{(q)}$ on $PF_n$. We study the asymptotic behavior of two fundamental statistics of parking functions under the family of distributions $\mathcal{P}_n^{(q)}$.</description>

Abstract: Answering a question of Michael Bleicher and Paul Erd\H{o}s, we show that there exists a lacunary sequence of positive integers such that finite sums of reciprocals of its terms attain all rational numbers from a non-empty open interval. We also study several stronger variants of their original problem: determining the value of the optimal lacunarity parameter, representing rationals infinitely many times, finding such lacunary sequences with arbitrarily large jumps, and relating the maximal length of a filled interval to a prescribed lacunarity parameter.</description>

Abstract: We discuss smooth functions which are Morse on preimages of values not being local extrema. We call such a function internally Morse or I-Morse.
  The Reeb graph of a smooth function is the space of all connected components of preimages of single points of it topologized with the natural quotient topology of the manifolds and a vertex of it is a point corresponding to a preimage with critical points. A smooth function is neat with respect to the Reeb graph or N-Reeb if the preimages of the vertices are the closed subsets in the manifolds of the domains with interiors being empty.
  We discuss I-Morse and N-Reeb functions, IN-Morse-Reeb functions. Our main result presents an IN-Morse-Reeb function respecting two such functions, on a connected sum of these given manifolds.</description>
