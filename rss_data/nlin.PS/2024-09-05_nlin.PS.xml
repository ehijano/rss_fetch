      <title>Pinning control of chimera states in systems with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the mechanisms behind synchronization phenomena is of paramount importance in nonlinear science. In particular, chimera states, patterns in which order and disorder coexist simultaneously, continue to puzzle scholars, due to their elusive nature. Recently, it has been shown that higher-order interactions greatly promote the onset of chimera states, which are easier to found and more resilient when the system units interact in group. In this work, we show that the higher-order framework is fertile not only for the emergence of chimera states, but also for their control. Via pinning control, a technique consisting in applying a forcing to a subset of the nodes, we are able to trigger the emergence of chimera states with only a small fraction of controlled nodes, at striking contrast with the case without higher-order interactions. We show that our setting is robust for different higher-order topologies and types of pinning control and, finally, we give a heuristic interpretation of the results via phase reduction theory. Our numerical and theoretical results provide further understanding on how higher-order interactions shape nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Data-driven 2D stationary quantum droplets and wave propagations in the amended GP equation with two potentials via deep neural networks learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a systematic deep learning approach to solve two-dimensional (2D) stationary quantum droplets (QDs) and investigate their wave propagation in the 2D amended Gross-Pitaevskii equation with Lee-Huang-Yang correction and two kinds of potentials. Firstly, we use the initial-value iterative neural network (IINN) algorithm for 2D stationary quantum droplets of stationary equations. Then the learned stationary QDs are used as the initial value conditions for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to explore their evolutions in the some space-time region. Especially, we consider two types of potentials, one is the 2D quadruple-well Gaussian potential and the other is the PT-symmetric HO-Gaussian potential, which lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking and the generation of multi-component QDs. The used deep learning method can also be applied to study wave propagations of other nonlinear physical models.</description>

      <title>Stability of standing periodic waves in the massive Thirring model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the spectral stability of the standing periodic waves in the massive Thirring model in laboratory coordinates. Since solutions of the linearized MTM equation are related to the squared eigenfunctions of the linear Lax system, the spectral stability of the standing periodic waves can be studied by using their Lax spectrum. Standing periodic waves are classified based on eight eigenvalues which coincide with the endpoints of the spectral bands of the Lax spectrum. Combining analytical and numerical methods, we show that the standing periodic waves are spectrally stable if and only if the eight eigenvalues are located either on the imaginary axis or along the diagonals of the complex plane.</description>

      <title>On the long-wave approximation of solitary waves in cylindrical coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address justification and solitary wave solutions of the cylindrical KdV equation which is formally derived as a long wave approximation of radially symmetric waves in a two-dimensional nonlinear dispersive system. For a regularized Boussinesq equation, we prove error estimates between true solutions of this equation and the associated cylindrical KdV approximation in the L2-based spaces. The justification result holds in the spatial dynamics formulation of the regularized Boussinesq equation. We also prove that the class of solitary wave solutions considered previously in the literature does not contain solutions in the L2-based spaces. This presents a serious obstacle in the applicability of the cylindrical KdV equation for modeling of radially symmetric solitary waves since the long wave approximation has to be performed separately in different space-time regions.</description>

      <title>Natural convection in a vertical channel. Part 2. Oblique solutions and global bifurcations in a spanwise-extended domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vertical thermal convection is a non-equilibrium system in which both buoyancy and shear forces play a role in driving the convective flow. Beyond the onset of convection, the driven dissipative system exhibits chaotic dynamics and turbulence. In a three-dimensional domain extended in both the vertical and the transverse dimensions, Gao et al. (2018) have observed a variety of convection patterns which are not described by linear stability analysis. We investigate the fully non-linear dynamics of vertical convection using a dynamical-systems approach based on the Oberbeck-Boussinesq equations. We compute the invariant solutions of these equations and the bifurcations that are responsible for the creation and termination of various branches. We map out a sequence of local bifurcations from the laminar base state, including simultaneous bifurcations involving patterned steady states with different symmetries. This atypical phenomenon of multiple branches simultaneously bifurcating from a single parent branch is explained by the role of D4 symmetry. In addition, two global bifurcations are identified: first, a homoclinic cycle from modulated transverse rolls and second, a heteroclinic cycle linking two symmetry-related diamond-roll patterns. These are confirmed by phase space projections as well as the functional form of the divergence of the period close to the bifurcation points. The heteroclinic orbit is shown to be robust and to result from a 1:2 mode interaction. The intricacy of this bifurcation diagram highlights the essential role played by dynamical systems theory and computation in hydrodynamic configurations.</description>

      <title>Vector rogue waves in spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analytically and numerically study three-component rogue waves (RWs) in spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates with Raman-induced spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Using the multiscale perturbative method, we obtain approximate analytical solutions for RWs with positive and negative effective masses, determined by the effective dispersion of the system. The solutions include RWs with smooth and striped shapes, as well as higher-order RWs. The analytical solutions demonstrate that the RWs in the three components of the system exhibit different velocities and their maximum peaks appear at the same spatiotemporal position, which is caused by SOC and interactions. The accuracy of the approximate analytical solutions is corroborated by comparison with direct numerical simulations of the underlying system. Additionally, we systematically explore existence domains for the RWs determined by the baseband modulational instability (BMI). Numerical simulations corroborate that, under the action of BMI, plane waves with random initial perturbations excite RWs, as predicted by the approximate analytical solutions.</description>
