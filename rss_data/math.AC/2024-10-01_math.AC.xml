      <title>Finiteness of Leaps in the sense of Hasse-Schmidt of reduced rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give sufficent conditions for a derivation of a $k$-algebra $A$ of finite type to be $\infty$-integrable in the sense of Hasse-Schmidt, when $A$ is a complete intersection, or when $A$ is reduced and $k$ is a regular ring. As a consequence, we prove that, if in addition $A$ contains a field, then the set of leaps of $A$ is finite along the minimal primes of certain Fitting ideal of $\Omega_{A/k}$.</description>

      <title>On the Internal Sum of Puiseux Monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the internal (finite) sum of submonoids of rank-$1$ torsion-free abelian groups. These submonoids, when not groups, are isomorphic to nontrivial submonoids of the nonnegative cone of $\mathbb Q$, known as Puiseux monoids, and have been actively studied during the last few years. Here we study how the atomicity and arithmetic of Puiseux monoids behave under their internal (finite) sum inside the abelian group $\mathbb Q$. We study the factorization properties of such internal sums, giving priority to Cohn's notion of atomicity and the classical bounded and finite factorization properties introduced and studied in 1990 by Anderson, Anderson, and Zafrullah in the setting of integral domains, and then generalized by Halter-Koch to commutative monoids. We pay special attention to how each of the considered properties behaves under the internal sum of a Puiseux monoid with a finitely generated Puiseux monoid. Throughout the paper, we also discuss examples showing that our primary results do not hold for submonoids of torsion-free abelian groups with rank larger than $1$.</description>

      <title>On a particular subspace of homogeneous preserving star operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a torsionless commutative cancellative monoid, $R=\bigoplus_{\alpha \in \Gamma}R_{\alpha}$ be a $\Gamma$-graded integral domain. In this note we show that each homogeneous star operation $\star:\mathbf{HF}(R)\to\mathbf{HF}(R)$ of $R$, is the restriction of a (classical) star operation $e(\star):F(R)\to F(R)$ of $R$. We also show that the set $HStar_f(R)$ of homogeneous star operations of finite type on $R$, endowed with the Zariski topology, is a spectral space.</description>

      <title>Nil-prime ideals of a commutative ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let R be a commutative ring with identity and N(R) be the set of all nilpotent elements of R. The aim of this paper is to introduce and study the notion of nil-prime ideals as a generalization of prime ideals. We say that a proper ideal P of R is a nil-prime ideal if there exists x \in N(R) and whenever ab \in P, then a+x \in P or b+x \in P for each a,b \in R. Also, we introduce nil versions of some algebraic concepts in ring theory such as nil-maximal ideal, nil-minimal ideal, nil-principal ideal and investigate some nil-version of a well-known results about them.</description>

      <title>The stability of the algebraic degree of Boolean functions when restricted to affine spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $n$-variable Boolean functions which keep their algebraic degree unchanged when they are restricted to any (affine) hyperplane, or more generally to any affine space of a given co-dimension $k$. For cryptographic applications it is of interest to determine functions $f$ which have a relatively high degree and also maintain this degree when restricted to affine spaces of co-dimension $k$ for $k$ ranging from 1 to as high a value as possible. This highest value will be called the restriction degree stability of $f$, denoted by $\rm deg\_stab(f)$. We give several necessary and/or sufficient conditions for $f$ to maintain its degree on spaces of co-dimension $k$; we show that this property is related to the property of having ``fast points'' as well as to other properties and parameters. The value of $\rm deg\_stab(f)$ is determined for functions of degrees $r\in \{1,2,n-2,n-1,n\}$ and for functions which are direct sums of monomials; we also determine the symmetric functions which maintain their degree on any hyperplane. Furthermore, we give an explicit formula for the number of functions which maintain their degree on all hyperplanes. Finally, using our previous results and some computer assistance, we determine the behaviour of all the functions in 8 variables, therefore determining the optimal ones (i.e. with highest value of $\rm deg\_stab(f)$) for each degree.</description>

      <title>On the Extensions of the Cohen Structure Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to pose a question that, when answered, would directly imply the Cohen Structure Theorem. We provide a solution to this question for a specific class of local rings (not necessarily complete). We also explore how this question connects to the Gelfand-Mazur Theorem and, more broadly, to a fundamental theorem in Gelfand theory. Finally, we provide a categorical reformulation of the question.</description>

      <title>Model Theory of Local Real Closed SV-Rings of Finite Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note begins the model-theoretic study of local real closed SV-rings of finite rank; to this end, a structure theorem for reduced local SV-rings of finite rank is given and branching ideals in local real closed rings of finite rank are analysed. The class of local real closed SV-rings of rank $ n \in \mathbb{N}^{\geq 2} $ is elementary in the language of rings $ \mathscr{L} := \{ +, -, \cdot, 0, 1 \} $ and its $ \mathscr{L} $-theory $ T_n $ has a model companion $ T_{n,1} $; models of $ T_{n,1} $ are $ n $-fold fibre products $ (((V_1 \times_{\textbf{k}} V_2) \times_{\textbf{k}}V_3) \dots \times_{\textbf{k}} V_{n-1})\times_{\textbf{k}} V_{n} $ of non-trivial real closed valuation rings $ V_i $ with isomorphic residue field $\mathbf{k}$. The $ \mathscr{L} $-theory $ T_{n,1} $ is complete, decidable, and NIP. After enriching $ \mathscr{L} $ with a predicate for the maximal ideal, models of $ T_n $ have prime extensions in models of $ T_{n,1} $, and $ T_{n,1} $ is the model completion of $ T_n $ in this enriched language. A quantifier elimination result for $ T_{n,1} $ is also given. The class of those local real closed SV-rings of rank $ n\in \mathbb{N}^{\geq 2} $ which are $ n $-fold fibre products $ (((V_1 \times_{W} V_2) \times_{W}V_3) \dots \times_{W} V_{n-1})\times_{W} V_{n} $ of non-trivial real closed valuation rings $ V_i $ along surjective morphisms $ V_i \twoheadrightarrow W $ onto a non-trivial domain $ W $ is elementary in the language of rings, and its $ \mathscr{L} $-theory $ T_{n,2} $ is also complete, decidable, and NIP; after enriching $ \mathscr{L} $ with predicates for the maximal ideal and the unique branching ideal, $ T_{n,2} $ is model complete.</description>

Abstract: This paper extends the results of Boij, Eisenbud, Erman, Schreyer, and S\"oderberg on the structure of Betti cones of finitely generated graded modules and finite free complexes over polynomial rings, to all finitely generated graded rings admitting linear Noether normalizations. The key new input is the existence of lim Ulrich sequences of graded modules over such rings.</description>

      <title>On the ascent of atomicity to monoid algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A commutative cancellative monoid is atomic if every non-invertible element factors into irreducibles (also called atoms), while an integral domain is atomic if its multiplicative monoid is atomic. Back in the eighties, Gilmer posed the question of whether the fact that a torsion-free monoid $M$ and an integral domain $R$ are both atomic implies that the monoid algebra $R[M]$ of $M$ over $R$ is also atomic. In general this is not true, and the first negative answer to this question was given by Roitman in 1993: he constructed an atomic integral domain whose polynomial extension is not atomic. More recently, Coykendall and the first author constructed finite-rank torsion-free atomic monoids whose monoid algebras over certain finite fields are not atomic. Still, the ascent of atomicity from finite-rank torsion-free monoids to their corresponding monoid algebras over fields of characteristic zero is an open problem. Coykendall and the first author also constructed an infinite-rank torsion-free atomic monoid whose monoid algebras (over any integral domain) are not atomic. As the primary result of this paper, we construct a rank-one torsion-free atomic monoid whose monoid algebras (over any integral domain) are not atomic. To do so, we introduce and study a methodological construction inside the class of rank-one torsion-free monoids that we call lifting, which consists in embedding a given monoid into another monoid that is often more tractable from the arithmetic viewpoint. For instance, the embedding in the lifting construction preserves the ascending chain condition on principal ideals and the existence of maximal common divisors.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the Macaulay2 package SCMAlgebras. It provides functions for computing deficiency modules and filter ideals, in order to check whether a module or an ideal is sequentially Cohen-Macaulay. After the basic algebraic notions and results are recalled, the main features of the package are described through examples.</description>

      <title>Congruence modules and the Wiles-Lenstra-Diamond numerical criterion in higher codimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.08212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a congruence module $\Psi_A(M)$ associated to a surjective $\mathcal O$-algebra morphism $\lambda\colon A \to \mathcal{O}$, with $\mathcal{O}$ a discrete valuation ring, $A$ a complete noetherian local $\mathcal{O}$-algebra regular at $\mathfrak{p}$, the kernel of $\lambda$, and $M$ a finitely generated $A$-module. We establish a numerical criterion for $M$ to have a free direct summand over $A$ of positive rank. It is in terms of the lengths of $\Psi_A(M)$ and the torsion part of $\mathfrak{p}/\mathfrak{p}^2$. It generalizes results of Wiles, Lenstra, and Diamond, that deal with the case when the codimension of $\mathfrak{p}$ is zero.
  Number theoretic applications include integral (non-minimal) $R=\mathbb T$ theorems in situations of positive defect conditional on certain standard conjectures. Here $R$ is a deformation ring parametrizing certain Galois representations and $\mathbb T$ is a Hecke algebra. An example is a modularity lifting for 2-dimensional $\ell$-adic Galois representations over an imaginary quadratic field. The proofs combine our commutative algebra results with a generalization due to Calegari and Geraghty of the patching method of Wiles and Taylor--Wiles and level raising arguments that go back to Ribet. The results provide new evidence in favor of the intriguing, and as yet fledgling, torsion analog of the classical Langlands correspondence.
  We also prove unconditional integral $R=\mathbb T$ results for Hecke algebras $\mathbb T$ acting on weight one cohomology of Shimura curves over $\mathbb Q$. This leads to a torsion Jacquet--Langlands correspondence comparing integral Hecke algebras acting on weight one cohomology of Shimura curves and modular curves. In this case the cohomology has abundant torsion and so our correspondence cannot be deduced by means of the classical Jacquet--Langlands correspondence.</description>

      <title>Telescope conjecture via homological residue fields with applications to schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00601v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a big tt-category, we give a characterization of the Telescope Conjecture (TC) in terms of definable tensor-ideals generated by homological residue fields. We formulate a stalk-locality property of (TC) and prove that it holds in the case of the derived category of a quasi-compact quasi-separated scheme, strengthening a result \cite{HHZ21}. As an application, we find strong links between (TC) and separation properties of the adic topology on local rings. This allows us to recover known examples and counterexamples of when (TC) holds over a scheme, as well as to construct some new ones.</description>
