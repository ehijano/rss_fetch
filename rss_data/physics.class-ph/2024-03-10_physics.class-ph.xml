      <title>Extreme wave skewing and dispersion spectra of anisotropic elastic plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guided wave dispersion is commonly assessed by Fourier analysis of the field along a line, resulting in frequency-wavenumber dispersion curves. In anisotropic plates, a point source can generate multiple dispersion branches pertaining to the same modal surface, which arise due to the angle between the power flux and the wave vector. We show that this phenomenon is particularly pronounced near zero-group-velocity points, entailing up to six contributions along a given direction. Stationary phase points accurately describe the measurements conducted on a monocrystalline silicon plate.</description>

      <title>Can the Dirac deltas in dipole fields be ignored in classical interactions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When studying (or teaching) classical electromagnetism, one is bound to deal with the electric field of an ideal electric dipole, as well as its magnetic counterpart. A careful analysis then reveals that each of those fields must include, for consistency, a term proportional to a Dirac delta function localized at the position of the dipole. However, one is usually told not to worry about those terms since, as classical interactions always involve sources which are spatially separated, the Dirac-delta terms are only relevant for quantum mechanics, where they are directly related to important phenomena. In this work, we pose and solve a purely classical problem in electrostatics in which the Dirac-delta terms in the dipole fields are indispensable. It involves the computation of the interaction energy between a conductor with a spherical cavity and an (ideal) electric dipole located at the center of that cavity. We also solve its magnetic counterpart, replacing the conductor with a superconductor and the electric dipole with a magnetic one.</description>

      <title>Extreme anti-ohmic conductance enhancement in neutral diradical acene-like molecular junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We achieve, at room temperature, conductance enhancements over two orders of magnitude in single molecule circuits formed with polycyclic benzoquinoidal (BQn) diradicals upon increasing molecular length by ~0.5 nm. We find that this extreme and atypical anti-ohmic conductance enhancement at longer molecular lengths is due to the diradical character of the molecules, which can be described as a topologically non-trivial electronic state. We adapt the 1D-SSH model originally developed to examine electronic topological order in linear carbon chains to the polycyclic systems studied here and find that it captures the anti-ohmic trends in this molecular series. The mechanism of conductance enhancement with length is revealed to be constructive quantum interference (CQI) between the frontier orbitals with non-trivial topology, which is present in acene-like, but not in linear, molecular systems. Importantly, we predict computationally and measure experimentally that anti-ohmic trends can be engineered through synthetic adjustments of the diradical character of the acene-like molecules. Overall, we achieve an experimentally unprecedented anti-ohmic enhancement and mechanistic insight into electronic transport in a class of materials that we identify here as promising candidates for creating highly conductive and tunable nanoscale wires.</description>

      <title>Quantum tomography of molecules using ultrafast electron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum tomography (QT) approach to retrieve the temporally evolving reduced density matrix in elecotronic state basis, where the populations and coherence between ground state and excited state are reconstructed from the ultrafast electron diffraction signal. In order to showcase the capability of the proposed QT approach, we simulate the nuclear wavepacket dynamics and ultrafast electron diffraction of photoexcited pyrrole molecules using ab initio quantum chemical CASSCF method. From simulated time-resolved diffraction data, we retrieve the evolving density matrix in a crude diabatic representation basis and reveal the symmetry of the excited pyrrole wavepacket. Our QT approach opens the route to make quantum version of "molecular movie" that covers the electronic degree of freedom, and equips ultrafast electron diffraction with the power to reveal the coherence between electronic states, relaxation and dynamics of population transfer.</description>
