      <title>Fast leave-one-cluster-out cross-validation by clustered Network Information Criteria (NICc)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduced a clustered estimator of the Network Information Criterion (NICc) to approximate leave-one-cluster-out cross-validated deviance, which can be used as an alternative to cluster-based cross-validation when modeling clustered data. Stone proved that Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is an asymptotic equivalence to leave-one-observation-out cross-validation if the parametric model is true. Ripley pointed out that the Network Information Criterion (NIC) derived in Stone's proof, is a better approximation to leave-one-observation-out cross-validation when the model is not true. For clustered data, we derived a clustered estimator of NIC, referred to as NICc, by substituting the Fisher information matrix in NIC with its estimator that adjusts for clustering. This adjustment imposes a larger penalty in NICc than the unclustered estimator of NIC when modeling clustered data, thereby preventing overfitting more effectively. In a simulation study and an empirical example, we used linear and logistic regression to model clustered data with Gaussian or binomial response, respectively. We showed that NICc is a better approximation to leave-one-cluster-out deviance and prevents overfitting more effectively than AIC and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). NICc leads to more accurate model selection, as determined by cluster-based cross-validation, compared to AIC and BIC.</description>

      <title>Introducing sgboost: A Practical Guide and Implementation of sparse-group boosting in R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the sgboost package in R, which implements sparse-group boosting for modeling high-dimensional data with natural groupings in covariates. Sparse-group boosting offers a flexible approach for both group and individual variable selection, reducing overfitting and enhancing model interpretability. The package uses regularization techniques based on the degrees of freedom of individual and group base-learners, and is designed to be used in conjunction with the mboost package. Through comparisons with existing methods and demonstration of its unique functionalities, this paper provides a practical guide on utilizing sparse-group boosting in R, accompanied by code examples to facilitate its application in various research domains. Overall, this paper serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to use sparse-group boosting for efficient and interpretable high-dimensional data analysis.</description>

      <title>Numerical Generalized Randomized HMC processes for restricted domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a generic approach for numerically efficient simulation from analytically intractable distributions with constrained support. Our approach relies upon Generalized Randomized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (GRHMC) processes and combines these with a randomized transition kernel that appropriately adjusts the Hamiltonian flow at the boundary of the constrained domain, ensuring that it remains within the domain. The numerical implementation of this constrained GRHMC process exploits the sparsity of the randomized transition kernel and the specific structure of the constraints so that the proposed approach is numerically accurate, computationally fast and operational even in high-dimensional applications. We illustrate this approach with posterior distributions of several Bayesian models with challenging parameter domain constraints in applications to real-word data sets. Building on the capability of GRHMC processes to efficiently explore otherwise challenging and high-dimensional posteriors, the proposed method expands the set of Bayesian models that can be analyzed by using the standard Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) methodology, As such, it can advance the development and use of Bayesian models with useful constrained priors, which are difficult to handle with existing methods. The article is accompanied by an R-package (\url{https://github.com/torekleppe/pdmphmc}), which allows for automatically implementing GRHMC processes for arbitrary target distributions and domain constraints.</description>
