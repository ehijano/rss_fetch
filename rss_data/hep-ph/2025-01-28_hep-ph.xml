      <title>T-odd observables from anomalous $tbW$ couplings in single-top W associated production at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that an imaginary anomalous $tbW$ coupling can be measured in the process $pp \to tW^-X$ by means of T-odd observables. One such observable is the polarization of the top quark transverse to the production plane. Another is the asymmetry between the cross sections with a positive and with a negative value of a certain T-odd correlation constructed out of observable momenta when the top quark decays leptonically. The mean value of this correlation, which is also T-odd, is the third observable. These three T-odd observables are shown to be proportional to the imaginary part of only one of the $tbW$ anomalous couplings, the other couplings giving vanishing contributions. This imaginary part could signal either a CP-odd coupling, or an absorptive part in the effective coupling. We estimate the 1-$\sigma$ limits that might be derived in the case of each of these observables for centre-of-mass energies 7, 8, 13 and 14 TeV at the LHC.</description>

      <title>A plethora of long-range neutrino interactions probed by DUNE and T2HK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next-generation neutrino oscillation experiments would be sensitive to the new neutrino interactions that would strengthen the search for physics beyond the Standard Model. In this context, we explore the capabilities of the two leading future long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, DUNE and T2HK, to search for new flavor-dependent neutrino interactions with electrons, protons, and neutrons that could potentially modify neutrino flavor transitions. We forecast their sensitivities in the context of long-range neutrino interactions mediated by a neutral vector boson lighter than $10^{-10}$ eV and sourced by the vast amount of nearby and distant matter in the Earth, Moon, Sun, Milky Way, and local Universe. For the first time, we explore a plethora of $U(1)^\prime$ symmetries inducing the new interactions built from the combination of lepton and baryon numbers. We find that in all cases, DUNE and T2HK may constrain or discover the existence of new long-range neutrino interaction, and in some favorable cases, may identify the new $U(1)^\prime$ symmetry responsible for it. In this short proceeding, we only summarize the prospects of constraining the new interaction in case of all our candidate $U(1)^\prime$ symmetries, which have been discussed in JHEP 09 (2024) 055.</description>

      <title>Triple Higgs Boson Production with Two Heavy Scalars at the LHC via a Simplified Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate triple Higgs boson production at the CERN LHC, in models containing two new neutral scalar particles heavier than the Higgs boson. We apply a simplified factorized approach in the narrow-width approximation to double-resonant triple Higgs boson production, and demonstrate that relevant constraints can be derived on models with extended scalar sectors, during the high-luminosity phase of the LHC. We also show that analyzing the double-resonant process will be sufficient at the LHC, within an explicit model with two real singlet scalar fields, and that non-resonant components are not expected to play a crucial role in the specific scenario. The method can be applied to any model where triple Higgs boson production can be enhanced via the double-resonant process in the presence of two new neutral scalar resonances.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Predictions for the Inner Dark Matter Distribution in the Milky Way Informed by Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build a theoretical range for the Milky Way's (MW) inner dark matter (DM) distribution informed by the FIRE-2, Auriga, VINTERGATAN-GM, and TNG50 simulation suites assuming the canonical cold dark matter (CDM) model. The DM density profiles in Auriga, VINTERGATAN-GM, and TNG50 can be approximately modeled using the adiabatic contraction prescription of Gnedin et al. 2004, while FIRE-2 has stronger baryonic feedback, leading to a departure from the adiabatic contraction model. The simulated halos that are adiabatically contracted are close to spherical (axis ratio $q \in [0.75-0.9]$ at $5^\circ$), whereas halos that experience strong baryonic feedback are oblate ($q \in [0.5-0.7]$). Using the adiabatic contraction and strong baryonic feedback models, along with the observed stellar distribution of the MW, the inner logarithmic density slope for CDM in the MW is predicted to range from $ -0.5$ to $-1.3$. The $J$-factor, which determines the DM-annihilation flux, averaged over a solid angle of $5^\circ$ ($10^\circ$) is predicted to span the range $0.8$-$30$ ($0.6$-$10$) $\times 10^{23} \rm{GeV}^2/\rm{cm}^5$. The $D$-factor, which determines the flux due to DM decay, is predicted to be in the range $0.6$-$2$ ($0.5-1$) $\times10^{23} \rm{GeV}/\rm{cm}^2$.

      <title>Ephemeral Oscillons in Scalar-Tensor Theories: The Higgs-like case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the post-inflationary evolution of a non-minimally coupled inflaton field in scalar-tensor theories, framed within the flexible framework of Einstein-Cartan gravity. By focusing on a class of simplified Higgs-like scenarios, we simulate the transition from the end of inflation to the formation of oscillons using fully-fledged 3+1 classical lattice simulations. Once oscillons form, we extract their profiles and perform 1+1 simulations to evolve their radial equations. Our findings reveal that these oscillons, unlike typical cases in the literature, are relatively short-lived, due to the presence of self interactions at small field values. The radiation produced by this novel type of oscillons can quickly lead to a radiation-dominated Universe, even in the absence of additional fields or interactions. Finally, we leverage our results to derive precise predictions for the inflationary observables and the produced spectrum of gravitational waves associated with oscillon formation. Significantly, our study establishes also an upper bound on the duration of the heating phase in Einstein-Cartan Higgs inflation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Probing small-scale power spectrum with gravitational-wave diffractive lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a novel way to probe subgalactic-scale matter distribution with diffractive lensing on gravitational waves. Five-year observations from Einstein Telescope and DECIGO are expected to probe $k= 10^5\sim 10^8 \,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ down to $P(k) = 10^{-16} \sim 10^{-14} \,{\rm Mpc}^3$ level. These results can be interpreted in terms of primordial black holes in the range $M_{\rm PBH} \gtrsim 10^{-3}M_\odot$ down to $f_{\rm PBH} = 10^{-6}$ level, or QCD axion minihalos in the range $m_a = 10^{-3} \sim 10^{-12} \,{\rm eV}$. A key result of the paper is the approximate relation between the scale $k$ and the gravitational wave frequency $f$, derived in an ensemble of `multi-lensing' events. This relation enables direct measurement of the power spectrum at specific scales, with sensitivities characterized by model-independent kernels $\delta P(k)$. Additionally, we delineate the statistical properties of `multi-lensing' based on the `Fresnel number' $N_F$. When $N_F \gtrsim {\cal O}(1)$, the statistical significance can be approximately calculated by Variance of lensing effects, which is directly related to the power spectrum among other moments of matter distribution.</description>

      <title>Comparing strange and non-strange quark stars within resummed QCD at NLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the renormalization group optimized perturbation theory (RGOPT) resummation method to evaluate the equation of state (EoS) for strange ($N_f=2+1$) and non-strange ($N_f=2$) cold quark matter at NLO. This allows us to obtain the mass-radius relation for pure quark stars and compare the results with the predictions from perturbative QCD (pQCD) at NNLO. Choosing the renormalization scale to generate maximum star masses of order $M=2 - 2.6 M_\odot$, we show that the RGOPT can produce mass-radius curves compatible with the masses and radii of some recently observed pulsars, regardless of their strangeness content. The scale values required to produce the desired maximum masses are higher in the strange scenario since the EoS is softer in this case. The possible reasons for such behavior are discussed. Our results also show that, as expected, the RGOPT predictions for the relevant observables are less sensitive to scale variations than those furnished by pQCD.</description>

      <title>Geomagnetic Signal of Millicharged Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millicharge particles (mCPs) are viable dark matter candidates motivated by many standard model extensions. We show that despite of the tiny coupling with the photon, millicharged dark matters can convert efficiently to photons through annihilation processes in the Earth magnetic field background, which generates a monochromatic quasi static magnetic field signal with angular frequency being twice the millicharged particle mass. By recasting null results from the SuperMAG and the SNIPE Hunt collaborations, we constrain the effective charge of bosonic millicharged dark matter in the mass ranges $10^{-18}-3.5 \times 10^{-17}\,\text{eV}$ and $10^{-15}-10^{-14}\,\text{eV}$. Our bounds surpass current stellar cooling constraints by more than ten orders of magnitude, making this proposal a powerful tool to search for millicharged dark matter.</description>

      <title>Exclusive $\eta$ production in proton-proton collisions at GSI-FAIR energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the cross sections for the $p p \to p p \eta$ reaction at energies relevant for the HADES, PANDA and SIS100 experiments at GSI-FAIR within an effective Lagrangian approach. We consider the $\eta$-bremsstrahlung mechanism with the intermediate proton exchange via the $\pi^{0}$, $\eta$, $\rho^{0}$ and $\omega$ exchanges and the mechanism involving the nucleon resonances $N(1535)$, $N(1650)$, $N(1710)$ and $N(1880)$ excited via the pseudoscalar- or/and vector-meson exchanges, depending on the model. We also discuss the role of the $\omega \omega$- and $\rho^{0} \rho^{0}$-fusion processes with the reggeized vector-meson exchanges. To determine the parameters of the model, the $\gamma p \to \eta p$ and $\pi^{-} p \to \eta n$ reactions are discussed and the results are compared with Crystal Ball and CLAS data. For the $p p \to p p \eta$ reaction, the model results are compared with the energy dependence of the cross section measured far from the threshold and with the differential distributions $d\sigma/d\cos\theta_{\eta}$ and $d\sigma/dp_{\eta}$ measured by the DISTO Collaboration. The comparison shows that the $N(1535)$ resonance is the dominant contribution and that other contributions are also important due to interference effects. Assuming that the $\rho$ exchange is the dominant resonant excitation process, the model is able to describe the available data, e.g. it reproduces the shape of the angular distributions measured by the DISTO Collaboration. Predictions are given for the HADES experiment at center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 3.46$~GeV, which can be verified in the near future, and for planned PANDA and SIS100 experiments at higher energies.</description>

      <title>Several problems on the measured hyperorder cumulants of net-proton distributions in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperorder cumulants $C_5/C_1$ and $C_6/C_2$ are recommended as sensitive observables to explore the QCD phase transition in heavy-ion collisions. Precisely measuring their results remains a difficult task in experiments, when employing the Centrality Bin Width Correction (CBWC) to suppress the initial volume fluctuations. Various techniques within the CBWC formula can lead to notable differences in the results. We will systematically investigate the application of the CBWC method to the measured net-proton $C_5/C_1$ and $C_6/C_2$ using the UrQMD model and Skellam-based simulations at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 11.5 GeV in Au + Au collisions. A recommended approach is proposed to calculate $C_5/C_1$ and $C_6/C_2$ in 0-40\% centrality. With statistics comparable to the RHIC Beam Energy Scan phase II (BES-II), our studies provide a baseline for analyzing net-proton $C_5/C_1$ and $C_6/C_2$ in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Supercooled Phase Transitions: Why Thermal History of Hidden Sector Matters in Analysis of Pulsar Timing Array Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of a gravitational wave background in the nano-Hertz frequency range from Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations offers new insights into evolution of the early universe. In this work we analyze gravitational wave data from PPTA, EPTA, and NANOGrav, as arising from a supercooled first-order phase transition within a hidden sector, characterized by a broken $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry. Several previous works have discussed challenges in producing observable {PTA signal} from supercooled phases transitions. We discuss these challenges and show how they are overcome by inclusion in part of the proper thermal history of the hidden and the visible sectors. The analysis of this work demonstrates that thermal histories of hidden and visible sectors profoundly influence the gravitational wave power spectrum, an aspect not previously explored in the literature. Further, the analysis of this work suggests that supercooled phase transitions not only align with the Pulsar Timing Array observations but also show promise for gravitational wave detection by future gravitational wave detectors. Our analysis shows that the dominant contribution to the gravitational wave power spectrum for PTA signals comes from bubble collision while the sound wave and turbulence contributions are highly suppressed. It is also found that all the PTA events are of detonation type while deflagration and hybrid events are absent. The analysis presented in this work provides a robust framework for further investigations on the origin of gravitational wave power spectrum in the early universe and for their experimental observation in the future.</description>

      <title>Bottomonia in an unquenched quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bottomonium spectrum is systematically studied within an unquenched quark model. Based on a good description of both the masses and widths for the well-established states, we further give predictions for the higher $S$-, $P$-, and $D$-wave bottomonium states up to a mass region of $\sim 11.3$ GeV. For the vector states, the $S$-$D$ mixing and dielectron decays are studied. Additionally, to understand the role of the higher vector resonances in the $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilation reaction, we evaluate the cross section by combining our quark model predictions for the mass, dielectron and strong decay properties. It is found that (i) The mass shifts of the high $b\bar{b}$ states due to the coupled-channel effects are the order of a few tens MeV, most of the high-lying resonances contain significant non-$b\bar{b}$ components. (ii) The $\Upsilon_1(3D,5D,6D)$ states significantly mix with $\Upsilon(4S,6S,7S)$, respectively, which is mainly induced by the intermediate hadronic loops. (iii) The non-$b\bar{b}$ components will lead a significant suppression for the dielectron decay widths of some vector resonances.(iv) The threshold effects of open-bottom meson pairs can cause rich bump structures in the cross section of $e^{+}e^{-}\to b\bar{b}$. Our model shows that the $\Upsilon(10753)$ may arise from threshold effects due to the strong coupling between $\Upsilon(4S)$ and $\bar{B}^*B^*$.</description>

      <title>Are Parton Showers in a Quark-Gluon Plasma Strongly Coupled? A Theorist's Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study whether in-medium showers of high-energy quarks and gluons can be treated as a sequence of individual splitting processes or whether there is significant quantum overlap between where one splitting ends and the next begins. Accounting for the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect, we calculate such overlap effects to leading order in high-energy $\alpha_s(\mu)$ for the simplest theoretical situation. We investigate a measure of overlap effects that is independent of physics that can be absorbed into an effective value $\hat{q}_{eff}$ of the jet-quenching parameter $\hat{q}$.</description>

      <title>Study on the Distribution Amplitude of the Scalar Meson $K_0^*(1430)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on sum rules, we explore the twist-2 distribution amplitude of the $K_0^*(1430)$ meson, treating it as the ground state of a quark-antiquark system. We posit that the spacetime distance $x$ should be infinitesimally close to the quark separation $ z$. By incorporating quark distance corrections, with $x^2 \approx z^2 \approx x z$, the calculated moments yield additional insights. Moreover, we employ light-cone sum rules to compute the form factors for the semi-leptonic decay process $B_s \rightarrow K$. The reliability of the computed distribution amplitude is confirmed through its comparison with the form factor.</description>

      <title>Improved global determination of two-meson distribution amplitudes from multi-body $B$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We improve the perturbative QCD (PQCD) formalism for multi-body charmless hadronic $B$ meson decays, such as $B\to VP_3\to P_1P_2P_3$, by resolving the possible discrepancy in parametrizing the contribution of the $P$-wave resonance $V$ to the two-meson distribution amplitudes (DAs) associated with the pairs $P_1P_2=\pi\pi, K\pi, KK$. The determination of the Gegenbauer moments in the two-meson DAs is then updated in the global fit of the improved PQCD factorization formulas at leading order in the strong coupling $\alpha_s$ to available data for branching ratios and polarization fractions of three- and four-body $B$ decays. The convergence of the Gegenbauer expansion of the resultant two-meson DAs is manifest. The satisfactory quality of the fit implies the consistency of the PQCD framework for multi-body $B$ decays and the universality of the nonperturbative two-meson DAs. In particular, the predicted longitudinal polarization fraction $f_0(B_s^0\to K^{*0} {\bar K}^{*0})=28.2^{+8.8}_{-9.5} \%$ with the updated Gegenbauer moments matches well the measurement. The observable $L_{K^{*0}{\bar K}^{*0}}=7.7^{+4.9}_{-3.8}$, defined as the ratio of the longitudinal amplitudes of the two $U$-spin related channels $B_s^0\to K^{*0} {\bar K}^{*0}$ and $B^0\to K^{*0} {\bar K}^{*0}$, accommodates the current data within errors. It is found that the direct $CP$ asymmetries ${\cal A}^{0,||,\bot}_{\rm CP}$ in the polarization states of some four-body decays $B\to V_1V_2\to (P_1P_2)(P_3P_4)$ might be large, but the destruction among them result in small net $CP$ violation. Our predictions can be confronted with LHCb and Belle-II data in the future.</description>

      <title>Roles of $\Delta(1232)$, $N^*(1520)$, and $N^*(1650)$ resonances in $\gamma p\to \pi^0 \pi^0 p$ reaction within an effective Lagrangian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Roles of the $\Delta (1232)$, ${N}^{*}(1520)$, and ${N}^{*}(1650)$ resonances in the $\gamma p\to{\pi }^{0}{\pi }^{0}p $ reaction near threshold is investigated within an effective Lagrangian approach. We have calculated the differential cross sections of the $\gamma p\to{\pi }^{0}{\pi }^{0}p$ reaction by including the contributions from the $\Delta (1232)$, ${N}^{*}(1520)$, and ${N}^{*}(1650)$ intermediate states decaying into $\pi^0 p$ via the $s$-channel nucleon pole and $t$-channel $\rho$ exchange, and found that the current experimental measurements can be well reproduced. The production of $\Delta(1232)$ is mainly from the mechanism of the $s$-channel nucleon pole, while the ${N}^{*}(1520)$ and ${N}^{*}(1650)$ are produced from the mechanism of the $t$-channel $\rho$ exchange. It is expected that more experimental data on the $\gamma p \to \pi^0 \pi^0 p$ reaction can be used to explore the properties of the low-lying excited baryon states and also the scalar $f_0(500)$ and $f_0(980)$ mesons.</description>

      <title>Investigate the glueball-like particle $X(2370)$ in $B$ meson decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the collected data on $J/\psi\to \gamma K_S^0K_S^0\eta'$, the BESIII experiment has conducted an analysis of the mass and spin parity of the $X(2370)$ particle. The findings are consistent with the characteristics expected of the lightest pseudoscalar glueball. We point out that further exploration of this particle's nature can be pursued through investigations of heavy bottom meson decays. Assuming the identity of $X(2370)$ as a pseudoscalar glueball, we compute the form factors for $B\to X(2370)$ transitions in the factorization approach. With these results, the estimated branching fractions for semileptonic $B$ decays into $X(2370)$ can reach the order of $10^{-6}$ and those for nonleptonic decays can reach the order $10^{-8}$. These results suggest that decays of $B$ meson into $X(2370)$ are detectable at experimental facilities like Belle-II. Future experimental endeavors hold promise in expanding our understanding of glueball physics, contributing to the ongoing exploration surrounding this intriguing particle.</description>

      <title>VacuumTunneling: A package to solve bounce equation with renormalization factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vacuum tunneling rate $\Gamma$ from the effective action is a key to studying the cosmological first-order phase transition(FOPT). One solid way to compute the $\Gamma$ is to start with the derivative expansion of the effective action and solve the bounce equation numerically. In this process, the renormalization factor $Z$ of the tunneling field may play a center rule, which is not considered in existing packages. Therefore, we present a \texttt{Mathematica} package \vt to compute the bounce action with or without the renormalization factor. Applying the \vt package, we find that the presence of $Z$ has a significant impact on the action, as well on the tunneling path. We provide some concrete examples to demonstrate the difference between the solution with and without the renormalization factor, both in the action and tunneling path. This package is based on the modified shooting and path deformation method. We also made some optimizations for the super-cooling phase transition(thick wall scenario), in which other numerical package works poorly. This package works as long as the expressions can give values of the potential and the renormalization at a certain field point. This means the input potential and the renormalization can be merely numerical quantities without analytical expressions. The computation time can be as short as 1 second in single-field tunneling and several seconds in multi-field cases.</description>

      <title>One-loop induced contributions to the rare decay of $A_0 \rightarrow h_0h_0\gamma$ in Two Higgs Doublet Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analytic expressions for one-loop contributions to the rare decay process $A_0 \rightarrow h_0h_0\gamma$ within the CP-conserving of Two Higgs Doublet Models are first reported in this paper. Analytic results are presented in term of scalar one-loop Passarino-Veltman functions following the standard output of the packages~{\tt LoopTools} and {\tt Collier}. In this context, physical results for the computed process are easily generated by using one of these packages. The numerical checks are proposed to verify for the analytic results in this paper. The checks rely on the renormalization conditions that the decay amplitude must be the ultraviolet finiteness and infrared finiteness. The amplitude consisting of an external photon always obeys the Ward identity. This will be confirmed numerically in this article. In phenomenological results, the decay rates of $A_0 \rightarrow h_0h_0\gamma$ are evaluated at several points in the allowed regions of the parameter space. Furthermore, the differential decay widths with respect to the invariant mass of Higgs-pair in final states are studied.</description>

      <title>Dark Chiral Phase Transition Driven by Chemical Potential and its Gravitational Wave Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, for the first time, we explore the scenario that the dark-QCD sector has a large chemical potential $\mu$ (on the order of magnitude of temperature) of dark quarks. It leads to a complex-valued Polyakov loop and tilts the partial confinement effect, driving the dark-QCD phase transition to a first-order one in the early universe. We present a toy model via the Affleck-Dine mechanism that could generate degenerate dark quarks. Our study, in the framework of PNJL, focuses on the dynamical impacts of a large chemical potential on the chiral phase transition without turning on the KMT instanton term. We plot the phase diagram of the dark-QCD in the chiral limit. The resulting first-order phase transition actually refers to a chiral phase transition, with the transition to the confinement vacuum being a cross-over. Following the phase diagram, we find that increasing $\mu$ can considerably prolong the duration of the phase transition and also the release of latent heat, which together make the cosmic dark-QCD phase transition at the critical temperature above 1 GeV and below 100 GeV produce gravitational wave signal in the intermediate frequency band, which is well probable in space detectors such as BBO</description>

      <title>Probing ALP couplings to electroweak gauge bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the more and more abundant experimental data, we revisit the couplings axion-like particle (ALP) to electroweak gauge bosons across the ALP mass range from MeV to 100 GeV. The current and future experimental limits on the couplings are extended. The ALP coupling to $W$-bosons gives rise to flavor-changing ALP-quark couplings at the one-loop level. These flavor-changing couplings deserve further investigation under current experimental constraints, especially those stemming from rare meson decays and neutral meson mixing processes. Additionally, flavor-conserving couplings of the ALP to Standard Model (SM) fermions arise at the one-loop level as well from ALP-electroweak gauge boson couplings, even in the absence of tree-level couplings to these SM fermions, with consequent ALP decays to the SM fermions leading to constraints on the ALP-electroweak gauge boson couplings. We also investigate processes relevant to $Z$-boson measurements, such as the invisible decay $Z\to a\gamma$, subsequent decays
  $Z\to 3\gamma$ and $Z\to \gamma ll$, as well as constraints from oblique parameters ($S,\, T,\, U$). Our study highlights that rare two-body decays of pseudoscalar mesons offer the most sensitive probes of ALP couplings to electroweak gauge bosons from the loop-induced flavor-violating interactions for ALP masses below the kinematic threshold, while $Z$-boson decays complementarily explore larger ALP masses. Future lepton colliders, such as CEPC and FCC-ee operating at the $Z$-pole, along with SHiP, provide further opportunities to probe ALP couplings to electroweak gauge bosons.</description>

Abstract: We estimate the sensitivity of Wilson coefficients of the lepton flavor-violating dimension-six operators at the proposed $\mu^+\mu^-$ collider. We compute the signal significance at $\sqrt{s}$ = 3 and 10 TeV, respectively, with an integrated luminosity of 1 and 10 ab$^{-1}$ corresponding to unpolarized and polarized initial muon beams. Using the optimal observable method for the kinematic distributions, we study the measurement errors of the effective couplings at the 1-sigma level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CiADS-BDE is a beam-dump experiment recently proposed for searching for light, long-lived particles (LLPs) at China initiative Accelerator Driven System. Primarily thanks to the large numbers of protons on target at the experiment, it has been shown to be sensitive to large, unique regions of the parameter space of dark photon, with a small detector volume of $\mathcal{O}(0.01\text{--}1)$ m$^3$. Here, we explore the search prospect of the CiADS-BDE for a series of new-physic models predicting LLPs that could emanate from decays at rest of charged pions and muons at the facility, namely, heavy neutral leptons, axionlike particles, and light binos in the R-parity-violating supersymmetry. For these benchmark models, we find that the CiADS-BDE can also probe vast parameter regions beyond the existing bounds.</description>

Abstract: In the Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulos-Dvali (ADD) model with n extra compactified dimensions, the gravitational potential scales as 1/r^{n+1} and becomes significantly stronger at short distances. We investigate the possibility of forming small-sized composite systems of Standard Model particles bound by this potential. Such bound states, composed of quarks, neutrinos, axions, or other particles, exhibit a small cross-section-to-mass ratio, making them viable candidates for dark matter.</description>

Abstract: We examine a contribution of axion-like particles (ALPs) to a top pair production via the collision of Compton backscattered photons at the CLIC operating in a $\gamma\gamma$ mode. The exclusion bounds on the ALP-top quark coupling depending on the ALP mass $m_a$ are given. The mass range 10 GeV -- 10 TeV is considered. We have obtained that for $m_a = 10$ GeV the ALP-top quark couplings as small as $0.17$ TeV$^{-1}$ and $0.11$ TeV$^{-1}$ can be probed at the CLIC with the energy of 1.5 TeV and 3 TeV, respectively.</description>

      <title>Finite size effects on the transport coefficients of strongly interacting QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of finite volume effects on the various transport coefficients of strongly interacting quark matter is analyzed in the Polyakov chiral SU(3) quark mean field model (PCQMF) at finite temperatures and chemical potentials incorporating fermionic vacuum term. Using a non-zero lower momentum cutoff and two different forms of the Polyakov loop potentials with quark back reaction, we study the following viscous properties: specific shear viscosity ($\eta/s$), normalized bulk viscosity ($\zeta_b/s$), and conductivity properties: electrical conductivity ($\sigma_{el}/T$), thermal conductivity ($\kappa/T^2$). Along with this, some essential thermodynamic quantities in the context of transport properties, such as the square of the speed of sound ($c_s^2$) and the specific heat ($c_v$) at a constant volume, are computed. Finite size effects are applied to the vacuum term and its influence on the effective quark masses, thermodynamic quantities, and transport coefficients is studied. The temperature dependence of the transport coefficients is obtained through the kinetic theory approach with the relaxation time approximation. The size of the system has been found to have significant effects on all transport coefficients. We find that all the transport coefficients increase as the size of the system is reduced. We have also studied the specific sound channel $(\eta+3\zeta_b/4)/s$ and the bulk-to-shear viscosity ratio $\zeta_b/\eta$. The effect of finite size is found to be more prominent in the transition region and vanishes at high $T$. The transition temperature $T_{\chi}$ is found to decrease as the system size (characterized by $R$) decreases. At finite chemical potentials, $T_{\chi}$ is shifted to lower values compared to the case of the vanishing chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Determination of $\alpha_s(M_Z)$ via a high-precision effective coupling $\alpha^{g_1}_s(Q)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to determine the strong coupling of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and fix its running behavior at all scales by using the Bjorken sum rules (BSR). The BSR defines an effective coupling $\alpha^{g_1}_s(Q)$ which includes the nonperturbative high-twist corrections and perturbative QCD (pQCD) corrections to the leading-twist part. For the leading-twist part of $\alpha^{g_1}_s(Q)$, we adopt the infinite-order scale-setting procedure of the principle of maximum conformality ($\rm{PMC}_\infty$) to deal with its pQCD corrections, which reveals the intrinsic conformality of series and eliminates conventional renormalization scheme-and-scale ambiguities. Using the $\rm{PMC}_\infty$ approach, we not only eliminate \textit{the first kind of residual scale dependence} due to uncalculated higher-order terms, but also resolve the previous ``self-consistence problem". The holographic light-front QCD model is used for $\alpha^{g_1}_s(Q)$ in the infrared region, which also reveals a conformal behavior at $Q\to 0$. As a combination, we obtain a precise $\alpha^{g_1}_s(Q)$ at all scales, which matches well with the known experimental data with $p$-value $\sim99\%$, we determine the strong coupling constant at the critical scale $M_Z$, $\alpha_s(M_Z)=0.1191\pm{0.0012}\mp0.0006$, where the first error comes from $\Delta\kappa$ of LFHQCD model and the second error is from \textit{the second kind of residual scale dependence} that is negligible.</description>

Abstract: In this article, the vector, axial vector and tensor form factors of $B_{c}\to \chi_{cJ}$ ($J=0,1,2$) and $B_{c}\to h_{c}$ are analyzed within the framework of three-point QCD sum rules. With the calculated vector and axial vector form factors, we directly study the decay widths and branching ratios of semileptonic decays $B_{c}^{-}\to \chi_{cJ}l \bar{\nu}_l, h_{c}l \bar{\nu}_l$ $(l=e, \mu$ and $\tau)$ and analyze the nonleptonic decays $B_{c}^{-}\to \chi_{cJ}\pi^{-}, \chi_{cJ}K^{-}, \chi_{cJ}\rho^{-}, \chi_{cJ}K^{*-}$, $B_{c}^{-}\to h_{c}\pi^{-}, h_{c}K^{-}, h_{c}\rho^{-}, h_{c}K^{*-}$ by using the naive factorization approach (NFA). These results can provide more information to understand the properties of $B_{c}$ meson and $P$-wave charmonia and to study the heavy quark dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After cosmic inflation, the universe is cold and almost empty. Thus, the inflation field should decay to the particles for BBN through the so-called reheating process. Later, the matter-antimatter asymmetry and dark matter are produced. In this chapter, the ``first particle" production between the inflation phase and BBN phase is introduced. We focus on the reheating, electroweak baryogenesis, and leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Double heavy quarkonia production with color-octet channels at Z factory and at the CEPC/FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the NRQCD framework, we calculate the exclusive production of double heavy quarkonium(double charmonium and double bottomonium) at future super $Z$ factory and at the CEPC/FCC-ee. The color-octet(CO) channels in the $\gamma^*/Z^*$-propagated process are considered along with the color-singlet(CS) channels. We found that the contributions of CO states to the total cross section are significant or dominant for many processes within energy region at $Z$ factory and at the CEPC/FCC-ee. The experimental measurements will help us to verify the CO mechanism. Among these CO channels, the gluon fragmentation into $^3S_1^{8}$ states is most important. Thus, the comparison between the theoretical results and future data will give a strong constraint to the matrix elements $\langle\mathcal{O}\left(^3S_1^{[8]}\right)\rangle$. Additionally, we consider the relativistic corrections to both the CS and CO channels which decrease the cross sections significantly. Specially, the $K$ factors are about $0.5$ for most charmonium channels. We get estimates of the events for double heavy quarkonium production. The final events of $J/\psi+\eta_c$, $J/\psi+J/\psi$, $\Upsilon+\eta_b$, $\Upsilon+\Upsilon$ production would be (22, 570, 71, 61) and (206, 5343, 665, 576) at the CEPC (2-year) and at the FCC-ee (4-year) for the $Z$ factory mode, respectively.</description>

      <title>Supercooled Dark Scalar Phase Transitions explanation of NANOGrav data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evidence of a Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) in the nHz frequency range is posed to open a new window on the Universe. A preferred explanation relies on a supercooled first order phase transition at the 100 MeV - GeV scale. In this article, we address the feasibility going from the particle physics model to the production of the gravitational waves. We take a minimal approach for the dark sector model introducing the fewest ingredients required, namely a new U(1) gauge group and a dark scalar that dynamically breaks the symmetry. Supercooling poses challenges in the analysis that put under question the feasibility of this explanation: we address them, going beyond previous studies by carefully considering the effects of a vacuum domination phase and explicitly tracking the phase transition from its onset to its completion. We find that the proposed model can successfully give origin to the observed PTA SGWB signal. The strong supercooling imposes a correlation between the new gauge coupling and the scalar quartic one, leading to a significant hierarchy between the (heavier) gauge boson and the dark scalar. Ultimately, information on phase transitions from SGWB observations could provide a direct probe of the microphysics of the Early Universe and be used to guide future searches of dark sector in laboratories.</description>

      <title>Ultra-cold neutrons in qBounce experiments as laboratory for test of chameleon field theories and cosmic acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accelerating expansion of the Universe, attributed to dark energy, has spurred interest in theories involving scalar fields such as chameleon field theories. These fields, which couple to matter with density-dependent effective mass, offer a promising explanation for cosmic acceleration. Experiments leveraging ultra-cold neutrons (UCNs) provide an innovative approach to testing these theories. The existence of a chameleon field, being responsible for the current phase of cosmic acceleration, is investigated by analysing a free fall of ultra-cold neutrons from the gap between two mirrors after their bouncing between these two mirrors. We analyse a deformation of the wave functions of the quantum gravitational states of ultra-cold neutrons, induced by a chameleon field, and find a new upper bound $\beta\leq6.5\times10^8$ on the chameleon-matter coupling constant $\beta$ from the unitarity condition. This result refines previous estimates and highlights the potential of ultra-cold neutron experiments as laboratories for exploring scalar field theories and fundamental physics.</description>

Abstract: We study a non-holomorphic modular $S_3$ flavor symmetry in which we analyze neutrino sector, dark matter, and lepton flavor violations. The active neutrino mass is generated via one-loop level. We achieve chi-square analysis and demonstrate some predictions in cases of normal hierarchy with fermionic or bosonic dark matter and inverted hierarchy of fermionic or bosonic dark matter.</description>

      <title>The Signals of the Doomsday</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measured standard model parameters indicate that we might live in a false Higgs vacuum, possibly with a very long lifetime. However, small black holes can serve as catalysers and significantly speed up the phase transition. In fact, bubbles of true vacuum might already exist in our universe. We calculate the spectrum of Higgs particles produced by such a bubble, and use event generators to study their decay and subsequent evolution of the decay products to obtain the spectrum of emitted photons and neutrinos as a long-range signature. If the propagation of the bubble walls slows down due to interaction with the surrounding matter and plasma, these signals can reach us before the bubble wall hits us, thus representing the signals of the doomsday.</description>

      <title>The charming case of $X(3872)$ and $\chi_{c1}(2P)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More than twenty years have elapsed since the discovery of $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ (previously denoted as $X(3872)$), and an impressive amount of theoretical and experimental studies has been devoted to its properties, decays and production mechanisms. Despite the extensive work, a full understanding of the nature of $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ is still missing. In the present study we reconsider a theoretical framework based on the heavy quark large mass limit to analyse the radiative decays of heavy quarkonia, in particular the electric dipole transitions of $\chi_{c1}(2P)$ to S-wave charmonia. The results favourably compare to recent measurements for $\chi_{c1}(3872)$, obtained by the LHCb Collaboration, if this meson is identified with $\chi_{c1}(2P)$.</description>

      <title>Axion-like Particle Conversion in the Solar Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs), hypothetical extensions of the Standard Model, can convert into photons in an external magnetic field. Two recent studies~\cite{Todarello:2023ptf, Ruz:2024gkl} explored the phenomenology of ALP-photon conversion in the magnetic field of the solar atmosphere. Dark matter ALPs convert into radio photons and may be detected with next-generation radio interferometers, while ALPs produced in the solar core convert into X-rays. Thanks to solar observation acquired with the NuSTAR X-ray telescope, Ref.~\cite{Ruz:2024gkl} establishes stringent robust bounds on the ALP-photon coupling over a large portion of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Further study on excited $\Xi_{QQ^{\prime}}$ via photoproduction at CEPC and FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of NRQCD, the photoproduction of doubly heavy baryons $\Xi_{cc}$, $\Xi_{bc}$, $\Xi_{bb}$ and their $P$-wave excited states has been systematically investigated. The production mechanism is that a color anti-triplet or sextuplet diquark $\langle QQ^{\prime} \rangle$ is first produced, and then evolved into a corresponding doubly heavy baryon $\Xi_{QQ^{\prime}}$ via the subprocess $\gamma+\gamma \rightarrow \langle QQ^{\prime} \rangle[n] +\bar{Q^{\prime}}+\bar{Q} \rightarrow \Xi_{QQ^{\prime}} +\bar{Q^{\prime}}+\bar{Q}$. Here, $Q^{(\prime)}$ denotes the heavy quark $b$ or $c$, [$n$] is the color and spin quantum number of intermediate diquark, which can be $[^3S_1]_{\bar{\textbf{3}}/\textbf{6}}$ and $[^1S_0]_{\bar{\textbf{3}}/\textbf{6}}$ for $S$-wave states, or $[^1P_1]_{\bar{\textbf{3}}/\textbf{6}}$ and $[^3P_J]_{\bar{\textbf{3}}/\textbf{6}}$ with $J=0,~1,~2$ for $P$-wave states. Predictions for the cross sections, differential distributions, and theoretical uncertainty have been analyzed. The results indicate that, at $\sqrt{s}=91$ GeV, the contribution of photoproduction for $P$-wave $\Xi_{cc}$, $\Xi_{bc}$, and $\Xi_{bb}$ is approximately $2.19\%$, $4.23\%$, $1.26\%$ of the contribution for $S$-wave, respectively. As the collision energy increases, the contribution of $P$-wave also increases. Assuming that the highly excited state can decay into ground state with $100\%$ efficiency, the total produced events at CEPC and FCC-ee can be as high as $\mathcal{O}(10^8)$, $\mathcal{O}(10^7),$ and $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ corresponding to $\Xi_{cc}$, $\Xi_{bc}$, and $\Xi_{bb}$, respectively, which is very promising to be detected in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Higgs and Flavour: BSM Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss scenarios for BSM physics near the TeV, motivated by the hierarchy problem and the flavour puzzle, and review their experimental tests at present and future colliders. Strong LHC constraints on couplings to light quarks motivate $U(2)$-like flavour symmetries as a means of lowering the new physics scale: this is demonstrated by general SMEFT analyses, and is also seen in composite Higgs solutions to the hierarchy problem. We discuss flavour non-universal gauge interactions as a possible origin for $U(2)$-like flavour symmetries which, in addition to allowing new physics to be lighter, opens up a simultaneous low-scale solution to the flavour puzzle. We focus on `flavour deconstructed' gauge interactions close to the TeV, and show how this non-universal gauge structure can be combined with Higgs compositeness in a way that better accommodates the requisite tuning in the Higgs mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a modified chromomagnetic interaction model, assuming $X(4140)$ to be the lowest $1^{++}$ $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ tetraquark and treating it as the reference state, we systematically investigated the masses of the triply-heavy tetraquark states $QQ\bar{Q}\bar{q}$ ($Q=c,b;q=u,d,s$). Because of their higher masses, no stable tetraquarks were found. Using a simple scheme, we also estimated the partial widths of the rearrangement decay channels and relevant ratios. A compact triply heavy tetraquark candidate would be favored if its observed mass and partial width ratios were comparable with our predictions. We hope that the present work will be helpful for further studies.</description>

      <title>Neutrino reheating predictions with non-thermal leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connecting inflation with neutrino physics through non-thermal leptogenesis via direct inflaton-right-handed neutrino (RHN) coupling naturally incorporates neutrino reheating, leaving no ambiguity regarding the early history of the Universe. In ref.~\cite{Zhang:2023oyo}, we demonstrate that non-thermal leptogenesis from inflaton decay expands the viable parameter space compared to thermal leptogenesis and provides a natural link to inflation. In this work, we refine our previous findings by closely examining the dynamics of neutrino reheating. We first calculate the duration of neutrino reheating on a general basis, then analyze inflationary observables consistent with neutrino reheating across four models, establishing a direct connection between baryon asymmetry and the spectral index. This approach places these two important observables on the same plane and yields specific predictions that help break the degeneracy among inflationary models. The well-motivated and economical framework offers a simple, natural, and testable description of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Two-body Hidden Charm Decays of $D$ Wave Charmonia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experimental observations of $\psi_2(3823)$ and $\psi_3(3842)$ make $D$ wave charmonia family abundant. In the present work, we investigate the hidden charm decay processes of spin triplets of the $D$-wave charmonia with the meson loop mechanism. The model parameter $\alpha_\Lambda$ is determined by reproducing the branching fraction of $\psi(3770)\to J/\psi \eta$. With this range of model parameter values, the branching fractions (partial widths) of $\psi(3770) \to \eta_c \omega$, $\psi_2(3823)/\psi_3(3842) \to J/\psi \eta$, $\psi_2(3823)/\psi_3(3842) \to \eta_c \omega$ are estimated. Our estimations find that the partial width of $\psi_2(3823) \to J/\psi \eta$ is $\left(29.64^{+4.01}_{-4.63}\right)\ \mathrm{keV}$, and the partial width ratio of $\psi_2(3823) \to J/\psi \eta$ relative to $\psi_2(3823)\to \gamma \chi_{c1}$ is about $10\%$, which could be tested by further precise measurements from the BESIII, Belle II and LHCb Collaborations.</description>

      <title>Aspects of the dilute Glasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Glasma is a semiclassical nonequilibrium state describing the earliest stage in relativistic heavy-ion collisions predicted by the Color Glass Condensate effective theory. It is characterized by strong color fields, which are sourced by color currents pertaining to hard partons in the colliding nuclei. We introduce the (3+1)D dilute Glasma framework, which incorporates the longitudinal and transverse structure of colliding particles and describes the rapidity-dependence of observables like the energy-momentum tensor. This is in stark contrast to the canonical picture of boost-invariance, where nuclei are infinitesimally thin in longitudinal direction, and the rapidity-dependence of observables is lost. We discuss the derivation of the (3+1)D dilute Glasma field-strength tensor, which relies on linearizing the Yang-Mills equations in the dilute approximation, i.e., assuming weak sources. The dilute Glasma energy-momentum tensor can efficiently be evaluated numerically on a lattice. Employing a generalized 3D McLerran-Venugopalan model, we discuss numerical results for the collisions of heavy ions at energies corresponding to experiments at RHIC and the LHC. We discover longitudinal flow that differs significantly from Bjorken flow and argue that this is a consequence of taking into account the longitudinal extension of nuclei. Furthermore, we find limiting fragmentation as a universal feature of the dilute Glasma analytically and numerically. Finally, we study the applicability of the dilute Glasma to proton-proton collisions and show the necessary modifications to reproduce experimental multiplicity distributions.</description>

      <title>Mechanical properties of the nucleon from the generalized parton distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proton's internal structure is characterized not only by its charge and magnetic distribution but also by its mechanical and mass properties, which are encoded in the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). These properties provide insights into the spatial distributions of energy, pressure, and shear forces within the proton. Understanding the proton's internal structure, including properties such as its mechanical and mass radii, is essential for unraveling the complex interplay between quarks and gluons that govern its stability and dynamics. In this study, we investigate the gravitational form factors (GFFs) of the proton, particularly the D-term, which encodes key information about the internal stress distribution, pressure, and shear forces within the nucleon. Using a model for skewness-dependent generalized parton distributions (GPDs) constructed from the double-distribution representation, we extract the quark contribution to the $ D(t) $ GFF of the EMT by analyzing available data on Compton form factors (CFFs). We then employ this extracted GFF to explore the mechanical properties of the proton, including its mechanical and mass radii, as well as the internal pressure and shear force distributions. Our results provide new insights into the proton's internal structure and contribute to the broader understanding of nucleon properties.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Form Factors from GPDs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel ansatz for Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs), named GSAMA24. This ansatz aims to provide a more accurate and comprehensive description of the internal structure of hadrons by incorporating advanced parameterizations and fitting techniques. We compare the performance of the GSAMA24 ansatz with three established models: the Extended Regge (ER), Modified Gaussian (MG), and M-HS22 ansatz. The GSAMA24 ansatz is designed to address limitations observed in previous models by offering improved flexibility in the ( $t$ )-dependence and skewness parameter $\xi$. Our analysis involves fitting the GSAMA24 ansatz to experimental form factor data and evaluating its predictive power against the ER, MG, and M-HS22 models. The comparison is based on key metrics such as the accuracy of form factor predictions, the consistency with known GPD properties, and the computational efficiency of the fitting process. Results indicate that the GSAMA24 ansatz provides a superior fit to the experimental data, particularly in the high momentum transfer region, where it outperforms the ER and MG models. Additionally, the GSAMA24 ansatz demonstrates better agreement with the theoretical expectations of GPD behavior compared to the M-HS22 model. These findings suggest that the GSAMA24 ansatz is a promising tool for future studies of hadronic structure and could significantly enhance our understanding of the spatial and momentum distributions of quarks and gluons within hadrons.</description>

      <title>A precise study of the SU(3) Yang-Mills theory across the deconfinement transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a detailed computation of key quantities across the first-order deconfinement phase transition of the SU(3) Yang-Mills theory. Specifically, we calculate the entropy density, $s(T_c)/T_c^3$, on both sides of the transition and determine the latent heat $h$. The calculations are carried out in the lattice regularization with the Wilson action, employing shifted boundary conditions in the temporal direction. Our simulations are performed at five different values of the lattice spacing in order to extrapolate the results to the continuum limit. The latent heat can be measured also as the discontinuity in the trace anomaly of the energy-momentum tensor: our result using the entropy density is compatible with the one obtained from the trace anomaly, giving a combined estimate $h=1.175(10)$. Additionally, we determine the critical temperature $T_c$ in physical units with permille accuracy, yielding $T_c \sqrt{t_0} = 0.24915(29)$. These results allow to connect with precision the confined and the deconfined phases and we present an improved computation of the Equation of State across the deconfinement transition for $T$ between 0 and $3.4 T_c$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sun can efficiently capture leptophilic dark matter that scatters with free electrons. If this dark matter subsequently annihilates into leptonic states, it can produce a detectable neutrino flux. Using 10 years of Super-Kamiokande observations, we set constraints on the dark-matter/electron scattering cross-section that exceed terrestrial direct detection searches by more than an order of magnitude for dark matter masses below 100 GeV, and reach cross-sections as low as $\sim$4$\times$10$^{-41}$cm$^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Gamma-Ray Observations of Galaxy Clusters Strongly Constrain Dark Matter Annihilation in Prompt Cusps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal dark matter models generically include the prompt creation of highly-concentrated dark matter cusps in the early Universe. Recent studies find that these cusps can survive to the present day, as long as they do not fall into extremely dense regions of baryonic structure. In this work, we build models of dark matter annihilation within the prompt cusps that reside in galaxy clusters, showing that they dominate the total $\gamma$-ray annihilation signal. Using 15 years of Fermi-LAT data, we find no evidence for a $\gamma$-ray excess from these sources, and set strong constraints on annihilating dark matter. These constraints generically rule out the thermal annihilation cross-section to the $b\bar{b}$ channel for dark matter masses below $\sim$200~GeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sub-nuclear fluctuations in the initial state of heavy-ion collisions impact not only transverse long-range correlations of small systems, but also the creation of longitudinal structures, seen in particle detectors as longitudinal decorrelation observables. In this work, we study the emergence of long-range rapidity correlations in nuclear collisions based on the 3D resolved McDIPPER initial state model, and for the first time, connect it to experimental observables using the 3+1D viscous hydrodynamics framework CLVisc. We include different sources of fluctuations at the nucleon and subnucleon level and study the effects of these additional fluctuation sources on the longitudinal structure of relevant observables, such as the flow decorrelations and directed flow.</description>

      <title>The Double EFT Expansion in Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to characterize the structure of higher-derivative corrections within low-energy Effective Field Theories (EFTs) arising from a UV-complete theory of quantum gravity. To this end, we use string theory as a laboratory and argue that such EFTs should exhibit a $\textit{double EFT expansion}$ involving higher-curvature operators. The $\textit{field-theoretic}$ expansion is governed by the mass of the lightest (tower of) new degrees of freedom, as expected from standard field theory considerations. Conversely, the $\textit{quantum-gravitational}$ expansion is suppressed relative to the Einstein-Hilbert term by the quantum gravity cutoff, $\Lambda_{\rm QG}$, above which no local gravitational EFT description remains valid. This structure becomes manifest in the so-called $\textit{asymptotic regime}$, where a hierarchy between the Planck scale and $\Lambda_{\rm QG}$ emerges, the latter identified herein as the species scale. Most notably, we demonstrate the features of the double EFT expansion through an amplitudes-based approach in (toroidal compactifications of) ten-dimensional Type IIA string theory, and via a detailed analysis of the supersymmetric black hole entropy in 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravities derived from Type II Calabi-Yau compactifications. We provide further evidence for our proposal across various string theory setups, including Calabi-Yau compactifications of M/F-theory and Type II string theory. Finally, we explore the implications of this framework for the Wilson coefficients of the aforementioned higher-curvature operators, revealing potentially significant constraints in the asymptotic regime and highlighting a remarkable interplay with recent results from the S-matrix bootstrap program.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Black Hole Spin for the X-Ray Binary MAXI J1727-203 Based on Insight-HXMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We constrain the spin of the black hole (BH) candidate MAXI J1727-203 using Insight-HXMT data. Due to limited HXMT observations covering only part of the outburst, NICER data were used to analyze the full outburst's state transitions, we identified two of three HXMT observations in the high soft state and applied the continuum-fitting method to measure the spin. Based on previous estimates and continuum spectral fittings, we explored the parameter space and found that the best-fitting values were $(D, i, M) \approx (6\ \text{kpc}, 30^\circ, 12 M_{\odot})$. We also tested the variation of these parameters using Monte Carlo simulations, sampling over 3000 sets within the parameter ranges: $5.9 \text{kpc}&lt; D&lt;7 \text{kpc}$, $24^\circ&lt;i&lt; 35^\circ$, and $10 M_{\odot}&lt;M&lt;14 M_{\odot}$, yielding a spin measurement of $a=0.34_{-0.19}^{+0.15}$ (1$\sigma$). In addition, we analyzed NuSTAR data in low hard state and found a good fit with the {\tt tbabs*(diskbb+powerlaw)} model, with no significant iron line features observed in the residuals, then the previous reflection model results suggesting an extremely high spin would over-estimate the BH spin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For several independent reasons, the idea that notorious sources of entropy could exist in the Universe has been recently revived. Taking advantage of a new framework accounting for non-equilibrium processes in cosmology, we explicitly investigate the cosmological dynamics as a function of the entropy production, focusing on the stability of the system. An exhaustive investigation is performed. As the main physical conclusion, we show that for a wide class of entropy source terms, the fluid dynamics converges towards an effective cosmological constant. Constraints on the associated entropic force are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional core-collapse supernova models with phenomenological treatment of neutrino flavor conversions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform three-dimensional supernova simulations with a phenomenological treatment of neutrino flavor conversions. We show that the explosion energy can increase to as high as ~10^51 erg depending on the critical density for the onset of flavor conversions, due to a significant enhancement of the mean energy of electron antineutrinos. Our results confirm previous studies showing such energetic explosions, but for the first time in three-dimensional configurations. In addition, we predict neutrino and gravitational wave (GW) signals from a nearby supernova explosion aided by flavor conversions. We find that the neutrino event number decreases because of the reduced flux of heavy-lepton neutrinos. In order to detect GWs, next-generation GW telescopes such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope are needed even if the supernova event is located at the Galactic center. These findings show that the neutrino flavor conversions can significantly change supernova dynamics and highlight the importance of further studies on the quantum kinetic equations to determine the conditions of the conversions and their asymptotic states.</description>

      <title>Novel Dark Matter Signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Celestial observations often exhibit inexplicable planetary dependencies when the timing of an observable is projected onto planetary heliocentric positions. This is possible only for incident, non-relativistic streams. Notably, the celebrated dark matter (DM) in the Universe can form streams in our vicinity with speeds of about 240 km/s. Since gravitational impact scales with $1/(\text{velocity})^2$, all solar system objects, including the Sun and the Moon, act as strong gravitational lenses, with their focal planes located within the solar system. Even the Moon can focus penetrating particles toward the Earth at speeds of up to approximately 400 km/s, covering a large portion of the phase space of DM constituents. Consequently, the unexpected planetary dependencies of solar system observables may provide an alternative to Zwicky's tension regarding the overestimated visible cosmic mass. In this work, an overlooked but unexpected planetary dependency of any local observable serves as an analogue to Zwicky's cosmic measurements, particularly if a similar mysterious behavior has been previously noted. Thus, a persistent, unexpected planetary dependency represents a new tension between observation and expectation. The primary argument supporting DM in line with Zwicky's paradigm is this planetary dependency, which, on a local scale, constitutes the novel tension between observation and expectation. In particular, the recurrent planetary dependency of diverse observables mirrors Zwicky's cosmic tension with the overestimated visible mass. No other approach accounts for so many otherwise striking and mysterious observations in physics and medicine.</description>

      <title>Gamma rays from star clusters and implications for the origin of Galactic cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Star clusters are often invoked as contributors to the flux of Galactic cosmic rays and as sources potentially able to accelerate particles to $\sim$PeV energies. The gamma radiation with $E\gtrsim$ TeV recently observed from selected star clusters has profound implications for the origin of Galactic cosmic rays.
  Aims. We show that if the gamma rays observed from the Cygnus cocoon and Westerlund 1 are of hadronic origin, then the cosmic rays escaping the cluster at energies $\gtrsim$ 10 TeV must cross a grammage inside the cluster that exceeds the Galactic grammage. At lower energies, depending on the model adopted to describe the production of gamma rays, such grammage may exceed or be comparable with the grammage inferred from propagation on Galactic scales.
  Methods. The flux of gamma rays is analytically computed for a few models of injection of cosmic rays in star clusters, and compared with the flux measured from selected clusters.
  Results. In all models considered here, comparing the inferred and observed gamma ray fluxes at $E\gtrsim$ TeV, we conclude that CRs must traverse a large grammage inside or around the cluster before escaping. Clearly these implications would not apply to a scenario in which gamma rays are produced due to radiative losses of leptons in the cluster. Leptonic models typically require weaker magnetic fields, which in turn result in maximum energies of accelerated particles much below $\sim$ PeV.
  Conclusions. We conclude that if gamma ray emission in SCs is a generic phenomenon and if this radiation is due to hadronic interactions, either star clusters cannot contribute but a small fraction of the total cosmic ray flux at the Earth, or their contribution to the grammage cannot be neglected and the paradigm of Galactic transport should be profoundly revisited.</description>

Abstract: We apply the recently developed analysis of 16 years of INTEGRAL/SPI data including a dark matter spatial template to derive bounds on dark matter candidates lighter than WIMPs (like sterile neutrinos or axion-like particles) decaying into line or continuum electromagnetic final state channels. The bounds obtained are the strongest to date for dark matter masses between $\sim $60 keV and $\sim$16 MeV experiencing two-body decays producing photon lines.</description>

      <title>QCD axion bubbles in the presence of ALP resonant conversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The QCD axion bubbles can form due to an explicit breaking of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry in the early Universe. In this paper, we investigate the modified formation of QCD axion bubble in the presence of axionlike particle (ALP), considering its resonant conversion to QCD axion. We consider a general scenario where the QCD axion mixes with ALP before the QCD phase transition. In this scenario, the energy density of the ALP can be adiabatic transferred to the QCD axion at a temperature $T_R$, resulting in the suppression of the cosmic background temperature $T_B$ at which the energy density of the QCD axion equals that of the radiation. The QCD axion bubbles form when the QCD axions arise during the QCD phase transition. Finally, we briefly discuss the impact of the formation of QCD axion bubbles on the formation of primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>The decay $B\to K+\nu+\bar{\nu}$ at Belle II and a massless bino in R-parity-violating supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, \texttt{Belle II} announced evidence for the decay $B^+\to K^+ +\nu +\bar{\nu}$ at the $3.5\,\sigma$ significance, and measured the corresponding decay branching ratio to be $2.7\,\sigma$ above the Standard Model prediction. Here, we provide a theoretical explanation based on a massless bino in R-parity-violating (RPV) supersymmetry. With a single non-vanishing RPV coupling $\lambda'_{i23/i32}$, $\lambda'_{i13/i33}$, or $\lambda'_{i12/i22}$, where $i=1,2,3$, the decay $B^+\to K^+ +\overset{\scriptscriptstyle(-)}{\nu_i}+ \tilde{\chi}^0_1$ can be induced, which would lead to the same signature as $B^+\to K^+ +\nu +\bar{\nu}$. Taking into account both theoretical and experimental uncertainties, we derive the regions of the parameter space spanned by the RPV couplings and sfermion masses that could accommodate the new measurement at various significance levels and obey the existing bounds simultaneously.</description>

      <title>$R^2$ corrections to holographic heavy meson dissociation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the $R^2$ corrections to the dissociation of heavy quarkonium in the Gauss-Bonnet gravitational background. We analyze the impact of Gauss-Bonnet parameter $\lambda_{GB}$ on the spectral function of charmonium and bottomonium, and examine how $\lambda_{GB}$ affects the dissociation of heavy quarkonium. Our results show that $\lambda_{GB}$ reduces the peak height and increases the peak width of the spectral function, suggesting that $\lambda_{GB}$ enhances the dissociation of heavy quarkonium. We also discuss how the dissociation of heavy quarkonium varies with the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density and find the dissociation will be easier in more perfect plasma. Additionally, we observe that the temperature decreases the peak height and widens the peak, thereby accelerating the dissociation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symbol letters are crucial for analytically calculating Feynman integrals in terms of iterated integrals. We present a novel method to construct the symbol letters for a given integral family without prior knowledge of the canonical differential equations. We provide a program package implementing our algorithm, and demonstrate its effectiveness in solving non-trivial problems with multiple loops and legs. Using our method, we successfully bootstrap the canonical differential equations for a two-loop five-point family with two external masses and for a three-loop four-point family with two external masses, which were previously unknown in the literature. We anticipate that our method can be applied to a wide range of cutting-edge calculations in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09528v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a unique topological portal between quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and a dark sector characterized by a global symmetry breaking, which connects three QCD to two dark pions. When gauged, it serves as the leading portal between the two sectors, providing an elegant, self-consistent scenario of light thermal inelastic dark matter. The inherent antisymmetrization leads to diminished annihilations at later times and suppressed direct detection. However, novel collider signatures offer tremendous prospects for discovery at Belle II.</description>

      <title>Finite-energy sum rules at finite chemical potential and zero temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we explore the effect of chemical potential at zero temperature in the implementation of in-medium effects in the perturbative sector in finite energy sum rules. For this purpose, we explore the axial, axial-pseudoscalar and pseudoscalar current correlators involving charged pions. The inclusion of non-normal ordered condensates with chemical potential effects in the operator mixing is considered. As a result, the contribution of the operator mixing with chemical potential dependence cancels all the explicit chemical potential contribution of the perturbative sector, aligned with the so-called "silver blaze problem". We find an abrupt transition when $\mu=\sqrt{s_0}/2$, with $s_0$ representing the hadronic continuum threshold. Exploring beyond this critical chemical potential we found similarities with low-energy effective meson models at high chemical potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advent of advanced machine learning techniques, boosted object tagging has witnessed significant progress. In this article, we take this field further by introducing novel architectural modifications compatible with a wide array of Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures. Our approach advocates for integrating capsule layers, replacing the conventional decoding blocks in standard GNNs. These capsules are a group of neurons with vector activations. The orientation of these vectors represents important properties of the objects under study, with their magnitude characterizing whether the object under study belongs to the class represented by the capsule. Moreover, capsule networks incorporate a regularization by reconstruction mechanism, facilitating the seamless integration of expert-designed high-level features into the analysis. We have studied the usefulness of our architecture with the LorentzNet architecture for quark-gluon tagging. Here, we have replaced the decoding block of LorentzNet with a capsulated decoding block and have called the resulting architecture CapsLorentzNet. Our new architecture can enhance the performance of LorentzNet by 20 \% for the quark-gluon tagging task.</description>

      <title>Mediator Decay through mixing with Degenerate Spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decay of the mediator particle into standard model (SM) particles plays a significant role in exploring the dark sector scenario.
  We consider such a decay, taking the dark photon mediator as an example that mixes with the SM photon.
  We find that it requires a careful analysis of the decay rate in the presence of an SM vector boson (e.g., $Z$ boson, $\rho$ meson, and true muonium, etc.) nearly degenerate with the mediator particle in mass.
  The decay rate of the mediator particle calculated in the mass eigenstate basis {\bf does not} agree with the correct result, given by the imaginary parts of the poles for the vector boson propagators, when the mixing parameter is smaller than a specific value.
  In such a case, the decay rate calculated by treating the mixing as a perturbative parameter is in agreement with the correct result.
  We clarify specific values for the mixing parameter quantitatively using several concrete examples of the SM vector bosons degenerate with the dark photon.
  When the mass mixing between the vector boson and dark photon is smaller (larger) than the decay width of the vector boson, the latter (former) method to calculate the decay rate of the mediator particle gives the correct result.</description>

      <title>Axi-Higgs portal Dark Matter via Wess-Zumino mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the axion portal between the visible and the dark sector, where the dark matter is charged under an abelian extension of the Standard Model. In general, such models are anomalous and are rendered gauge invariant by a St{\"u}ckelberg axion through Wess-Zumino/Green-Schwarz mechanism. Scenarios such as this naturally exist in TeV scale string theory completions of Standard Model. This axion mixes with other Goldstone bosons in the model to give a physical axi-Higgs which becomes massive upon breaking the anomalous gauge group. Such axi-Higgs fields charged under the anomalous symmetry act as mediators for the dark matter annihilation to Standard Model particles and can lead to an efficient freeze-out mechanism. Here, we show that the St{\"u}ckelberg axion, and the resultant axi-Higgs, with its appropriate shift symmetry cancels the quantum anomalies and also generates the observed relic density for the dark matter. Moreover, we show that the relevant parameter space in our model, where photon production dominates, is safe from {\it Fermi}LAT, Cherenkov Telescope Array, and H.E.S.S. indirect detection experiments.</description>

Abstract: This paper describes my personal appreciation for some of the great research achievements of Mitya Diakonov, Vitya Petrov, and Maxim Polyakov and how my own research career has followed the paths they opened. Among the topics where they have been the most influential have been the pursuit and study of the exotic pentaquark. The search for exotics may require a complementary approach, such as experimental and theoretical activity. Here, I would like to focus on a story of $N(1680)$ in which I was involved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the extended local hidden gauge formalism to study the meson-meson interactions with the quark constituents $cc\bar c\bar c$, $cc\bar c\bar b/\bar c\bar c cb$, $cc\bar b\bar b/\bar c\bar c bb$, $bb\bar c\bar b/\bar b\bar b cb$, and $bb\bar b\bar b$, where the exchanged mesons are the fully-heavy vector mesons $J/\psi$, $B_c^*$, and $\Upsilon$. We solve the coupled-channel Bethe-Salpeter equation to derive two poles in the $bb\bar{c}\bar{b}$ system and two poles in the $cc\bar{c}\bar{b}$ system. There are also four charge-conjugated poles in the $\bar{b}\bar{b}cb$ and $\bar{c}\bar{c}cb$ systems. In the $bb\bar{c}\bar{b}$ system, one pole corresponds to a sub-threshold bound state when the cutoff momentum is set to $\Lambda &gt; 850$ MeV. The other pole in this system corresponds to a sub-threshold bound state when $\Lambda &gt; 1100$ MeV. In the $cc\bar{c}\bar{b}$ system, the two poles correspond to sub-threshold bound states only when $\Lambda &gt; 1550$ MeV and $\Lambda &gt; 2650$ MeV. This makes them difficult to identify as deeply-bound hadronic molecules. We propose investigating the two poles of the $bb\bar{c}\bar{b}$ system in the $ \mu^+\mu^-B_c^-$channel at the LHC.</description>

Abstract: We discuss neutrino sector in models with two Higgs doublet and one singlet scalar fields under local $U(1)_{L_\alpha- L_\beta}$ symmetry. A neutrino mass matrix is formulated for these models where the matrix is generated via type-I seesaw mechanism introducing right-handed neutrinos. The neutrino mass matrix has more degrees of freedom compared to minimal scenarios which have only one new scalar field, but its structure is still restricted by the symmetry. Then it is find that sum of neutrino mass can be lower than minimal scenarios and it is easier to satisfy observed constraints. In addition, we can fit neutrino data for $U(1)_{L_e - L_{\mu(\tau)}}$ cases which are disfavored in minimal models. Furthermore, some correlations among sum of neutrino mass and CP violating phases are still found although we have more free parameters.</description>

Abstract: Coherence, which represents the superposition of orthogonal states, is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics and can also be precisely defined within quantum resource theory. Thus exploring quantum coherence in neutrino oscillations can not only help in examining the intrinsic quantum nature but can also explore their potential applications in quantum information technologies. Previous studies on quantum coherence have focused on neutrino flavor oscillations (FO). However, FO imply that neutrinos have mass and this can lead to the generation of a tiny but finite magnetic dipole moment of neutrinos through quantum loop diagrams at higher orders of perturbative expansion of the interaction. This electromagnetic property of neutrinos can induce spin flavor oscillations (SFO) in the presence of an external magnetic field and hence is expected to enrich the study of coherence. In this work, we investigate quantum coherence in neutrino SFO with three flavor mixing within the interstellar as well as intergalactic magnetic fields, quantified by the $l_1$ norm and the relative entropy of coherence, and express these measures in terms of neutrino SFO probabilities. For FO, coherence measures can sustain higher values (say, within 50% of the maximum) over distances of several kilometers, which are relevant for terrestrial experiments like reactor and accelerator neutrinos. However, for SFO, we find that the coherence scale can extend to astrophysical distances, spanning from kiloparsecs to gigaparsecs.</description>

Abstract: The charm ($D$) and charm-strange ($D_s$) mesons are investigated in a variational scheme using Gaussian trial wave functions. The Hamiltonian contains Song and Lin potential with a constant term dependent on radial and orbital quantum numbers. The Gaussian wave function used has a dependence on radial distance $r$, radial quantum number $n$, orbital quantum number $l$ and a trial parameter $\mu$. The obtained spectra of $D$ and $D_s$ mesons are in good agreement with other theoretical models and available experimental masses. The mass spectra of $D$ and $D_s$ mesons are also used to plot Regge trajectories in the ($J$, $M^2$) and ($n_r$, $M^2$) planes. In ($J$, $M^2$) plane, both natural and unnatural parity states of $D$ and $D_s$ mesons are plotted. The trajectories are parallel and equidistant from each other. The two-body strong decays of $D$ and $D_s$ are analyzed in the framework of heavy quark effective theory using computed masses. The strong decay widths are given in terms of strong coupling constants. These couplings are also estimated by comparing them with available experimental values for observed states. Also, the partial decay width ratios of different states are analyzed and used to suggest assignments to the observed states. We have assigned the spin-parity to newly observed $D^*_{s2}(2573)$ as the strange partner of $D^*_2(2460)$ identified as $1^3P_2$, $D_1^*(2760)$ and $D^*_{s1}(2860)$ as $1^3D_1$, $D^*_3(2750)$ and $D^*_{s3}(2860)$ as $1^3D_3$, $D_2(2740)$ as $1D_2$, $D_0(2550)$ as $2^1S_0$, $D^*_1(2660)$ and $D^*_{s1}(2700)$ as $2^3S_1$, $D^*_J(3000)$ as $2^3P_0$, $D_J(3000)$ as $2P_1$, $D^*_2(3000)$ as $1^3F_2$ states.</description>

Abstract: We study the infrared structure of the Standard Model (SM) restricted to the first generation of fermions, including the full SM gauge group, up to three-loop order, and determine the resulting cusp and collinear anomalous dimensions for all gauge groups and particles of the theory. We observe that starting from three loops, the resulting cusp anomalous dimensions include terms involving two distinct couplings, contrary to previous claims in the literature. We give a detailed explanation of this observation and explore the origin of these terms. We provide a supplementary file where all infrared anomalous dimensions calculated in this work are collected. Our results are consistent with the existing literature wherever comparisons are possible.</description>

      <title>The Revival of $U(1)_{L_e-L_\mu}$: A Natural Solution for $(g-2)_\mu$ with a Sub-GeV Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The experiments searching for a hidden gauge sector with a leptophilic neutral gauge boson have already ruled out $U(1)_{L_e-L_\mu}$ as a feasible extension of the Standard Model (SM) gauge group ($\mathcal{G}_{\rm SM}$) for explaining the observed discrepancy in $(g-2)_\mu$. The paper proposes a simple extension of the minimal particle content of $\mathcal{G}_{\rm SM}\otimes U(1)_{L_e-L_\mu}$ with a TeV-scale scalar leptoquark $S_1$. Due to the non-trivial transformation of $S_1$ under $U(1)_{L_e-L_\mu}$, the model generates additional one-loop contributions to $(g-2)_\mu$, reviving the considered gauge extension within the experimentally allowed regions of the parameter space. The model can also accommodate a viable Dark Matter (DM) candidate $\chi$ -- a vector-like SM-singlet fermion in the sub-GeV mass regime. The theory provides a natural framework to test the proposed DM phenomenology through electron excitation signals. Moreover, the DM-specific observables and $(g-2)_\mu$ being connected through the New Physics (NP) parameters, the future beam dump experiments hunting for light, feebly interacting particles and the DM direct detection experiments are complementary to each other for constraining/falsifying the model.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal asymmetries in lepton and heavy-quark pair production in UPCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Azimuthal modulations in lepton and heavy-quark pair production in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of highly charged ions are investigated. The modulations in the azimuthal angles of the sum and difference of the transverse momenta of the pair of particles in the final state, as well as of the transverse impact parameter, arise from the collisions of unpolarized and polarized photons. A full description of the cross section in terms of Generalized Transverse Momentum Dependent parton distributions (GTMDs) for photons is given including a careful consideration of the Fourier transform to impact parameter space. In particular, this leads to a feed-in mechanism among harmonics of different orders, which in principle generates harmonics of all (even) orders. Wherever comparable, our analytical results for the azimuthal modulations agree with those presented in other papers on this topic. Compared to these other works, we separate effects that arise from the anisotropies of the GTMDs from those that do not and retain terms proportional to the mass of the produced particles, as they are relevant for muon, charm and bottom quark production. We show that the normalized differential cross section changes considerably with the produced particle mass, which should be discernible in UPCs at RHIC and LHC. For the numerical results we adopt several models for the photon GTMD correlator, and find that all of them are in fairly good agreement with each other and with UPC data from STAR. We also present results for various azimuthal modulations for RHIC kinematics, where we compare $e^+ e^-$ production with the production of heavier particles, and for LHC kinematics, focusing on $\mu^+ \mu^-$ production. These results exhibit interesting mass-dependent features in the asymmetries that may help study the anisotropies arising from the underlying photon GTMD description.</description>

      <title>Isospin breaking corrections in $2\pi$ production in tau decays and $e^+e^-$ annihilation: consequences for the muon $g-2$ and CVC tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the isospin-breaking corrections relating the $e^+e^-$ hadronic cross-section and the tau decay spectral function, focusing on the di-pion channel, that gives the dominant contribution to the hadronic vacuum polarization piece of the muon $g-2$. We test different types of electromagnetic and weak form factors and show that both, the Gounaris-Sakurai and a dispersive-based approach, describe accurately $\tau$ lepton and $e^+e^-$ data (less when KLOE measurements are included in the fits) and comply reasonably well with analyticity constraints. From these results we obtain the isospin-breaking contribution to the conserved vector current (CVC) prediction of the ${\rm BR}(\tau \to \pi\pi\nu_{\tau})$ and to the $2\pi$ hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon $g-2$, in agreement with previous determinations and with similar precision. Our results abound in the convenience of using tau data-based results in the updated data-driven prediction of the muon $g-2$ in the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the process $e^+e^- \rightarrow W^+W^-$ with the heavy right-handed neutrino exchange at 1 TeV future lepton colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09418v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study potential contribution of the heavy right-handed neutrino exchange in the process $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow W^{+}W^{-}$. This process is sensitive to heavy neutrinos with masses larger than $\sqrt{s}$. The Monte Carlo simulation of the studied process is performed assuming the Seesaw type-I model, where heavy right-handed neutrinos (heavy neutral leptons, HNL) are introduced in the leptonic sector. Within the Standard Model (SM), the process has a large cross section described by diagrams with $s$-channel $Z / \gamma$ exchange and $t$-channel active neutrino exchange. Respectively, the $t$-channel right-handed neutrino exchange amplitude will interfere with these SM amplitudes. However, the angular distributions of the $W$ boson production and decay are different for the right-handed neutrino and SM amplitudes. That can be used to evaluate potential HNL contribution using the extended likelihood method. The simulation of the $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow W^{+}W^{-}$ process is performed at the 1 TeV center-of-mass energy and polarisation $P_{e^+e^-}$ of (20 %, -80 %), which is a standard option for the future linear $e^+e^-$ collider ILC. Both $W$ bosons are reconstructed from two hadronic jets. Simulation of the SM background processes is also done. The beam-induced backgrounds and the initial state radiation (ISR) effects are taken into account. The majority of background processes are effectively suppressed by the cuts on the invariant masses of two and four jets. Finally, we obtain upper limits on the mixing parameter $|V_{eN}|^2$ as a function of $M(N)$.</description>

      <title>Sensitivities to New Resonance Couplings to $W$-Bosons at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a search strategy at the HL-LHC for a new neutral particle $X$ that couples to $W$-bosons, using the process $p p \rightarrow W^{\pm} X (\rightarrow W^{+} W^{-})$ with a tri-$W$-boson final state. Focusing on events with two same-sign leptonic $W$-boson decays into muons and a hadronically decaying $W$-boson, our method leverages the enhanced signal-to-background discrimination achieved through a machine-learning-based multivariate analysis. Using the heavy photophobic axion-like particle (ALP) as a benchmark, we evaluate the discovery sensitivities on both production cross section times branching ratio $\sigma(p p \rightarrow W^{\pm} X) \times \textrm{Br}(X \rightarrow W^{+} W^{-})$ and the coupling $g_{aWW}$ for the particle mass over a wide range of 170-3000 GeV at the HL-LHC with center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 14$ TeV and integrated luminosity $\mathcal{L} = 3$ $\textrm{ab}^{-1}$. Our results show significant improvements in discovery sensitivity, particularly for masses above 300 GeV, compared to existing limits derived from CMS analyses of Standard Model (SM) tri-$W$-boson production at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. This study demonstrates the potential of advanced selection techniques in probing the coupling of new particles to $W$-bosons and highlights the HL-LHC's capability to explore the physics beyond the SM.</description>

      <title>Axion-induced pair production: a new strategy for axion detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit and update the axion-induced pair production process in a nuclear electric field mediated by the axion-electron coupling, $a+{{}^{A}_{Z}X} \rightarrow {{}^{A}_{Z}X} + e^{+} + e^{-}$. This process emerges as one of the most efficient channels for detecting axions with energies above a few MeV in large underground detectors. It is particularly relevant for detecting axions produced in nuclear reactions, such as the $p+d~\rightarrow~{ }^3 \mathrm{He}~+~a(5.5\,\mathrm{MeV})$ reaction in the solar pp-chain, and for axions originating in supernovae. Despite recent interest in detecting high-energy axions, the pair production process has received limited attention, even in scenarios where it is the dominant detection channel. This study fills this gap by demonstrating that pair production is a highly effective detection mechanism for high-energy axions. We apply our results to axions from supernovae and the solar 5.5 MeV line, recasting the current bounds of Borexino and comparing the detection capabilities of the JUNO and Hyper-Kamiokande detectors.</description>

      <title>Transverse densities of the energy-momentum tensor and the gravitational form factors the pion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present general features of the transverse densities of the stress-energy-momentum tensor $\Theta^{\mu\nu}$ in the pion. We show positivity of the transverse density of $\Theta^{++}$ (analogous to the positivity of the transverse density of the electromagnetic current $J^+$) and discuss its consequences in conjunction with analyticity and quark-hadron duality, as well as the connection to $\pi\pi$ scattering at low energies. Our analysis takes into account the perturbative QCD effects, dominating at high momenta (or low transverse coordinate $b$), the effects of Chiral Perturbation Theory, dominating at low momenta (high $b$), and meson dominance in the intermediate region. We incorporate constraints form analyticity, leading to sum rules for the spectral densities of the corresponding form factors, which {\em i.a.} are relevant for the high-momentum (or the low-$b$) asymptotics. With the obtained high- and low-$b$ behavior, we deduce that the scalar (trace-anomaly) gravitational transverse density $\Theta^{\mu}_\mu(b)$ must change sign, unlike the case of the positive definite $J^+(b)$ or $\Theta^{++}(b)$. We also discuss the transverse pressure in the pion, which is positive and singular at low $b$, and negative at high $b$, in harmony with the stability criterion. The results for the form factors for space-like momenta are compared to the recent lattice QCD data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a purely gravitational origin of observed baryon asymmetry and dark matter (DM) abundance from asymmetric Hawking radiation of light primordial black holes (PBH) in presence of a non-zero chemical potential, originating from the space-time curvature. Considering the PBHs are described by a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m metric, and are produced in a radiation dominated Universe, we show, it is possible to simultaneously explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry along with right DM abundance satisfying bounds from big bang nucleosynthesis, cosmic microwave background and gravitational wave energy density due to PBH density fluctuation. We also obtain the parameter space beyond the semiclassical approximation, taking into account the quantum effects on charged PBH dynamics due to memory burden.</description>

Abstract: Recent anomalies in $B$-meson decays, such as deviations in $R_{D^{(*)}}$ and $B\to K\nu{\bar\nu}$, suggest possible lepton flavor universality violation and new exotic interactions. In this work, we explore these anomalies within a non-minimal SU(5) grand unified theory (GUT) framework, which introduces a 45-dimensional Higgs representation predicting exotic scalar particles, including the leptoquark $R_2$ and diquark $S_6$. The $R_2$ leptoquark addresses charged current anomalies in $b\to c\tau\nu$ transitions, the $S_6$ diquark contributes to nonleptonic neutral current processes, such as $B\to K\pi$ while at the loop level, the exchange of a leptoquark and diquark contributes to $B\to K\nu{\bar\nu}$ offering solutions to longstanding puzzles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that single-field freeze-in dark matter barely leaves footprints in dark matter direct detection and collider experiments. This situation can be altered in two-field context. In this work we propose a two-field freeze-in dark matter model through Higgs portal. The observed dark matter relic abundance is obtained by a decay of scalar mediator thermalized in the early Universe. While there is a lack of direct dark matter signals, the scalar mediator is in the reach of HL-LHC either through vector boson fusion or Mono-Z channel. Within allowed scalar mass window of 10-50 GeV, we use improved cuts to derive both $2\sigma$ exclusion and $5\sigma$ discovery limits, depending on the value of Higgs portal coupling. If verified, this scalar mediator signal allows us to infer the freeze-in dark matter.</description>

Abstract: By capturing the characteristics of the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude for the pion excitation state, we construct an algebraic model to provide the overall features of the pion first excitation state parton distribution amplitude and distribution function. We find that, at the hadronic scale, the distribution amplitude of the excited state exhibits nodes, while the distribution function is unimodal, with a peak at $x=1/2$ and distinct concave and convex fluctuations in the valence region. These findings provide new insights into the partonic structure of excited mesons and contribute significantly to our understanding of hadronic excitations.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of domain walls formed through the spontaneous breaking of an approximate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in a scalar field, focusing on their collapse under the influence of quantum and thermal corrections induced by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-violating Yukawa coupling to Dirac fermions in the thermal bath. The thermal effects render the potential bias between the true and false vacua temperature-dependent and may lead to notable variations in the annihilation temperature of domain walls, in addition to the shift caused by temperature-independent quantum corrections. These modifications could substantially alter the gravitational wave spectrum produced by collapsing domain walls, potentially providing observable signatures for future gravitational wave detection experiments.</description>

Abstract: We explore the potential of reactor neutrino-induced Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) data from the CONUS+ experiment to investigate both Standard Model (SM) and Beyond Standard Model (BSM) scenarios. Alongside CE$\nu$NS, elastic neutrino-electron scattering (E$\nu$ES) events are also included in our analysis, enabling more stringent constraints on new physics. Within the SM, we examine the weak mixing angle as a precision test of the electroweak sector. For BSM scenarios, we constrain the parameter space of light mediators arising from neutrino generalized interactions (NGI), while also setting limits on the electromagnetic properties of neutrinos, including their charge radius, millicharge, and magnetic moment.</description>

Abstract: We continue examining statistical data assimilation (SDA), an inference methodology, to infer solutions to neutrino flavor evolution, for the first time using real - rather than simulated - data. The model represents neutrinos streaming from the Sun's center and undergoing a Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) resonance in flavor space, due to the radially-varying electron number density. The model neutrino energies are chosen to correspond to experimental bins in the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) and Borexino experiments, which measure electron-flavor survival probability at Earth. The procedure successfully finds consistency between the observed fluxes and the model, if the MSW resonance - that is, flavor evolution due to solar electrons - is included in the dynamical equations representing the model.</description>

      <title>Universal Gravitational Wave Signatures of Cosmological Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological solitonic objects such as monopoles, cosmic strings, domain walls, oscillons and Q-balls often appear in theories of the early Universe. We demonstrate that such scenarios are generically accompanied by a novel production source of gravitational waves stemming from soliton isocurvature perturbations. The resulting induced universal gravitational waves (UGWs) reside at lower frequencies compared to gravitational waves typically associated with soliton formation. We show that UGWs from axion-like particle (ALP) oscillons, originating from ALP misalignment, extend the frequency range of produced gravitational waves by more than two orders of magnitude regardless of the ALP mass and decay constant and can be observable in upcoming gravitational wave experiments. UGWs open a new route for gravitational wave signatures in broad classes of cosmological theories.</description>

      <title>Axion-like Universal Gravitational Wave Interpretation of Pulsar Timing Array Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Formation of cosmological solitons is generically accompanied by production of gravitational waves (GWs), with a universal GW background expected at frequency scales below that of non-linear dynamics. Beginning with a general phenomenological description of GWs associated with soliton formation, we demonstrate that universal GW background from axion-like particle (ALP) solitonic oscillons provides a viable interpretation to the recent NANOGrav 15 year pulsar timing array data, which does not suffer from the overproduction of primordial black holes. We show that pulsar timing array data displays preference for models where formed solitons do not strongly interact or cluster. Coincidence observations with Nancy Roman telescope will allow to discriminate between distinct scenarios of cosmological solitons.</description>

      <title>Generating functional of correlators of twist-$2$ operators in $\mathcal{N} = 1$ SUSY Yang-Mills theory, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present paper is the first installment where, extending our previous work in pure Yang-Mills (YM) theory, we compute the generating functional of correlators of collinear twist-$2$ operators that enter the components of balanced superfields -- i.e., superfields with an equal number of dotted and undotted indices in their spinor representation -- in $\mathcal{N} = 1$ SUSY SU($N$) YM theory in Minkowskian and Euclidean space-time, in the conformal limit and renormalization-group (RG) improved form, and to the leading and next-to-leading order in the large-$N$ expansion. Moreover, we compare our asymptotic RG-improved generating functional to the next-to-leading large-$N$ order with the corresponding nonperturbative object arising from the glueball/gluinoball one-loop effective action, which it should be asymptotic to at short distances because of the asymptotic freedom. Remarkably, we find that both have the structure of the logarithm of a functional superdeterminant. Hence, our large-$N$ computation sets strong ultraviolet asymptotic constraints on the nonperturbative solution of large-$N$ $\mathcal{N} = 1$ SUSY YM theory that may be a pivotal guide for the search of such a solution.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the presence of $\mathrm{a}_1(1420)$ and $\omega(782)$ in $\tau^-\to\pi^-\pi^-\pi^+\nu_\tau$ at Belle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19264v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present preliminary results of a partial-wave analysis of $\tau^-\to\pi^-\pi^-\pi^+\nu_\tau$ using data from the Belle experiment at the KEKB $\mathrm{e}^+\mathrm{e}^-$ collider. We validate our model with a model-independent analysis. We see the $\mathrm{a}_1(1420)$ and a G-parity-violating $1^-[\omega(782)\pi]_\mathrm{P}$ wave in tauon decays. Our results will improve models used in simulation studies necessary for measuring the electric and magnetic dipole moments and Michel parameters of the $\tau$.</description>

      <title>State preparation of lattice field theories using quantum optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the application of quantum optimal control (QOC) techniques to state preparation of lattice field theories on quantum computers. As a first example, we focus on the Schwinger model, quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions. We demonstrate that QOC can significantly speed up the ground state preparation compared to gate-based methods, even for models with long-range interactions. Using classical simulations, we explore the dependence on the inter-qubit coupling strength and the device connectivity, and we study the optimization in the presence of noise. While our simulations indicate potential speedups, the results strongly depend on the device specifications. In addition, we perform exploratory studies on the preparation of thermal states. Our results motivate further studies of QOC techniques in the context of quantum simulations for fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Ultra-light dark matter with non-canonical kinetics reopening the mass window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fuzzy dark matter (FDM) with mass around $10^{-22}$ eV is viewed as a promising paradigm in understanding the structure formation of the local universe at small scales. Recent observations, however, begin to challenge FDM in return. We focus on the arguments between the solution to CDM small-scale curiosities and recent observations on matter power spectrum, and find its implication on an earlier formation of small-scale structure. In this article, we propose a scheme of k-ULDM scalar field with a differently-evolving sound speed, thanks to the non-canonical kinetics. With the help of the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) theory, we illustrate to change the behavior of the quantum pressure term countering collapse, therefore change the history of structure growth. We find that it can truly reopen the ULDM mass window closed by the Lyman-$\alpha$ problem. We will discuss such examples in this paper, while more possibilities remain to be explored.</description>

      <title>Field redefinition and its impact in relativistic hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15387v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the impact of field redefinition on the spectrum of linearized perturbations in relativistic hydrodynamics. We observe that the spectrum of hydrodynamics modes is never affected by the local field redefinition, however, the spectrum of the non-hydrodynamic modes is affected. Through an appropriate all-order redefinition, non-hydrodynamic modes can be eliminated, leading to a new frame where the spectrum contains only hydrodynamic modes. We also observe that the resulting stress-energy tensor may have an infinite series in momentum space, with a convergence radius linked to the eliminated non-hydrodynamic mode. In certain special cases, higher-order terms in the stress-energy tensor under field redefinition may cancel, indicating that non-hydrodynamic modes are mere artefacts of the fluid variable choice and hold no physical significance, even if they appear to violate physical constraints. Using a special toy example, we find a criterion to distinguish between physical and unphysical non-hydrodynamic modes.</description>

      <title>Strong parity-violation effects induced by large-amplitude motions: A quantum-dynamics study of substituted chiral methanols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An enhanced mechanism is proposed for the large-amplitude-motion-induced parity-violating frequency by integrating the exact quantum dynamics method with the relativistic electronic structure theory. The torsional wavefunctions and PV frequency shifts are obtained by the exact quantum dynamics method. The potential energy curve and PV energy along the torsional coordinates are calculated using the extended atomic mean-field two-component Hamiltonian. The predicted PV frequency shift for the torsional transition of CFClBrOH is approximately 100 times larger than that of the conventional C-F stretching mode of CHFClBr. The maximum PV frequency shift (3.1 Hz) is obtained in the CHBrIOH molecule.</description>

      <title>On the consistency of Lorentz-Violating Yang-Mills theories: Gauge invariance and non-perturbative effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous investigations on the renormalizability properties of Lorentz-violating Yang-Mills (LVYM) theories in the Landau gauge have pointed out the necessity of the inclusion of a mass-like term for the gauge fields. If one aims at generalizing the theory to a more complicated gauge, such a mass-like term can bring severe issues regarding gauge-dependence of correlation functions of observables. We propose a Lorentz-violating Yang-Mills theory supplemented by a gauge-invariant mass term which generalizes the model in the Landau gauge. We discuss the foundational aspects of the model and highlight how it simplifies in the Landau gauge. Following the recent literature in pure Yang-Mills theories, we remark how the proposed massive extension of LVYM theories can be used as an effective model to access infrared properties within perturbation theory. Finally, we present a BRST-invariant formulation of the so-called Refined Gribov-Zwanziger action in the presence of Lorentz-violating terms in linear covariant gauges and the underlying tree-level gauge-field propagator which is enriched by the non-perturbative information carried by the elimination of Gribov copies.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Oscillation Tomography of the Earth with the Hyper-Kamiokande Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12344v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using PREM as a reference model for the Earth density distribution we investigate the sensitivity of the Hyper-Kamiokande (HK) detector to deviations of the Earth i) core average density $\bar{\rho}_C$, ii) lower mantle average density $\bar{\rho}_{lman}$) and iii) upper mantle average density $\bar{\rho}_{uman}$, from their respective PREM densities. The analysis is performed by studying the effects of the Earth matter on the oscillations of atmospheric $\nu_{\mu}$, $\nu_e$, $\bar{\nu}_\mu$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$. We implement the constraints on the variations of $\rho_C$, $\rho_{lman}$ and $\rho_{uman}$ following from the precise knowledge of the Earth mass $M_\oplus$ and moment of inertia $I_\oplus$, as well as from the requirement that the Earth be in hydrostatic equilibrium (EHE). These constraints limit in the case of the three layer Earth density structure we are considering the maximal positive deviation of $\bar{\rho}_C$ from its PREM value to $10\%$. Considering the case of normal ordering (NO) of neutrino masses, we present results which illustrate the dependence of sensitivity to the core, lower and upper mantle average densities on the energy and zenith angle resolutions and on the value of $\theta_{23}$. We show, in particular, that in the ''nominal'' case of neutrino energy resolution $E_{res} = 30\%$ and zenith angle resolution $\theta_{zres} = 20^\circ$ and for, e.g., $\sin^2\theta_{23}=0.45~(0.58)$, HK can determine the average core density $\bar{\rho}_C$ at $2\sigma$ C.L. after 6500 days of operation with an uncertainty of (-14.5\%)/+39.5\% ((-9.3\%/+31.7\%). In the ''more favorable'' case of $E_{res}= 20\%$ and $\theta_{zres} = 10^\circ$, and if $\sin^2\theta_{23}=0.58~(0.45)$, the core density would be determined at $2\sigma$ C.L. with an uncertainty of (-8.3\%)/+9.8\% ((-9.2\%)/+11.3\%).</description>

      <title>One-loop Matching Factors for Singlet Quasi-Parton Distribution Functions in the Hybrid-Ratio Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The one loop matching kernels between parton distribution functions (PDFs) for parton $i=u,d,s,g$ and their corresponding quasi-PDFs are computed at one loop in the hybrid-ratio scheme. We found that, in addition to the conservation of the quasi-quark number for each flavor, the second moment $\langle x \rangle_{\tilde{i}}=\langle x \rangle_i$ of quasi-PDF of parton $i$ (denoted as $\tilde{i}$) and PDF of parton $i$ is the same in our approach. This is demonstrated numerically using the CTEQ14 global analysis as input. However, because the quark-quark mixing kernels are not flavor blind, the notion of non-singlet quasi-PDFs is no longer valid. One has to work with the four sets of quasi-PDFs simultaneously to extract the corresponding PDFs.</description>
