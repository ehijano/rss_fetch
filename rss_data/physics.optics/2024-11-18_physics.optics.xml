      <title>Comparative Study of InGaAs and GaAsSb Nanowires for Room Temperature Operation of Avalanche Photodiodes at 1.55 {\mu}m</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: III V semiconductor nanowire based photodetectors have significant potential for remote sensing and LiDAR applications, particularly due to their ability to operate at 1.55 {\mu}m. Achieving room temperature operation and near unity absorption using these nanowires at 1.55 {\mu}m is crucial for single photon detection, which offers a promising solution to the challenges posed by the existing superconducting nanowire single photon detectors. Key materials suited for this wavelength include lattice matched In0.53Ga0.47As and Ga0.5As0.5Sb to InP. This study reports a comparison between InGaAs and GaAsSb nanowires to achieve high absorption efficiency at room temperature. Through optimized nanowire arrangement and geometry, we aim to maximize absorption. Our approach features a comparative analysis of patterned InGaAs and GaAsSb nanowires with absorption characteristics modeled using finite difference time domain simulations to enhance absorption at the target wavelength. We also present the complete workflow for nanowire fabrication, modeling, and simulation, encompassing the production of tapered nanowire structures and measurement of their absorption efficiency. Our experimental results show that tapered InGaAs and GaAsSb nanowires exhibit an absorption efficiency of 93% and 92%, respectively, at room temperature around 1.55 {\mu}m.</description>

      <title>Interrogating the Ballistic Regime in Liquids with Rotational Optical Tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accessing the ballistic regime of single particles in liquids remains an experimental challenge that shrouds our understanding of the particle-liquid interactions on exceedingly short time scales. We demonstrate the ballistic measurements of rotational probes to observe these interactions in the rotational regime within microscopic systems. This study uses sensitive high-bandwidth measurements of polarisation from light scattered by orientation-locked birefringent probes trapped within rotational optical tweezers. The particle-liquid interactions in the ballistic regime are decoupled from the optical potential allowing direct studies of single-particle rotational dynamics. This enabled us to determine the dissipation of rotational inertia and observe and validate rotational hydrodynamic effects in a previously inaccessible parameter space. Furthermore, the fast angular velocity thermalisation time enables calibration-free viscometry using less than 50ms of data. This methodology will provide a unique way of studying rotational hydrodynamic effects and enable ultra-fast microrheometry in systems out-of-equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Visualization of atomistic optical waves in crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The refractive index of a matter is foundational to quantify the light-matter interaction of the medium. However, the classical description of refractive index is based on macroscopic homogenization and is limited to describing the local optical response of materials. A complete quantum description of light-matter interaction should consider nonlocality and multiple-scattering of optical responses at the atomistic lattice level. Recently, the deep microscopic optical band structure was introduced as a quantum generalization of refractive index of a medium. This quantum description unveils multiple optical eigenmodes in crystalline solids and hidden microscopic optical waves at the lattice level. In this work, we unravel the microscopic optical waves in silicon carbide. We predict and visualize hidden microscopic optical eigenwaves, which can be nonplanar and inhomogeneous even near the optical limit. Also, the nonlocal macroscopic dielectric constant of the crystal is analyzed using the microscopic optical waves as the basis. Our work establishes a general framework for picoscale electrodynamics applicable to other materials including two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>The Magnetic Dislocation in Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dislocation created in the topological material lays the foundation of many significant findings to control light but requires delicate fabrication of the material. To extend its flexibility and reconfigurability, we propose the magnetic dislocation concept and unveil its properties in a representative model, which effectively combines the topological defect and edge mode at the magnetic domain wall. The results include distinct localization modes and robust light trapping phenomena with the rainbow feature where the eigen-energy of each light-trapping state can be linearly tuned by the magnetic dislocation. The conversion from the trapping state to edge modes can be harnessed by further adiabatically pumping light across an amount of the magnitude of the magnetic dislocation. Our work solves a fundamental problem by introducing magnetic dislocation with new light-manipulation flexibility, which may be implemented in a variety of platforms in photonic, acoustics, and optomechanics with dynamic modulations and synthetic dimensions.</description>

      <title>Nonresonant Raman control of material phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Important advances have recently been made in the search for materials with complex multi-phase landscapes that host photoinduced metastable collective states with exotic functionalities. In almost all cases so far, the desired phases are accessed by exploiting light-matter interactions via the imaginary part of the dielectric function through above-bandgap or resonant mode excitation. Nonresonant Raman excitation of coherent modes has been experimentally observed and proposed for dynamic material control, but the resulting atomic excursion has been limited to perturbative levels. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to overcome this challenge by employing nonresonant ultrashort pulses with low photon energies well below the bandgap. Using mid-infrared pulses, we induce ferroelectric reversal in lithium niobate and phase switching in tin selenide and characterize the large-amplitude mode displacements through femtosecond Raman scattering, second harmonic generation, and x-ray diffraction. This approach, validated by first-principle calculations, defines a novel method for synthesizing hidden phases with unique functional properties and manipulating complex energy landscapes at reduced energy consumption and ultrafast speeds.</description>

      <title>Indium tin oxide combined with anti-reflective coatings with high transmittance for wavelengths &lt; 400 nm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transparent and conductive properties of indium tin oxide (ITO) thin films, make them an attractive coating for optically integrated ion traps. However, the relatively low transmittance for wavelengths $&lt;$ 400 nm, high scattering and high production temperature limits the usability in trapped-ion-based quantum technologies. Here we present ITO coatings and a combined ITO + anti-reflective (AR) coating system optimized for an ion trap applied using ion beam sputtering (IBS). The coatings feature a high transmittance for wavelengths $&lt;$ 400 nm and additional wavelengths up to 1000 nm, low scattering and low production temperature $&lt;$ 150 $^{\circ}$C. The transmission, reflection and absorption spectra are simulated and the resistance, transmittance and scattering at 370 nm are measured for different ITO coating thicknesses and the ITO + AR coating system. For the ITO + AR coating system a resistance of 115 $\pm$ 5 $\Omega/\Box$, transmittance of 80$\%$ and scattering of 0.012 $\pm$ 0.002$\%$ at 370 nm is achieved.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of Tessellation Structured Illumination Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) overcomes the optical diffraction limit by folding high-frequency components into the baseband of the optical system, where they can be extracted and then repositioned to their original location in the Fourier domain. Although SIM is considered superior to other super-resolution (SR) methods in terms of compatibility with live cell imaging and optical setup simplicity, its reliance on image reconstruction restricts its temporal resolution and may introduce distortions in the super-resolved image. These inherent drawbacks are exacerbated in extended-SIM im-plementations, where spatial resolution surpasses the diffraction limit by more than 2-fold. Here, we present and demon-strate the Tessellation Structured Illumination Microscopy (TSIM) framework, which introduces a revived image recon-struction paradigm. With TSIM both the temporal resolution limit and the reconstruction artifacts that impact extended-SIM, are alleviated, without compromising the achievable spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>The Spatial Complexity of Optical Computing and How to Reduce It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Similar to algorithms, which consume time and memory to run, hardware requires resources to function. For devices processing physical waves, implementing operations needs sufficient "space," as dictated by wave physics. How much space is needed to perform a certain function is a fundamental question in optics, with recent research addressing it for given mathematical operations, but not for more general computing tasks, e.g., classification. Inspired by computational complexity theory, we study the "spatial complexity" of optical computing systems in terms of scaling laws - specifically, how their physical dimensions must scale as the dimension of the mathematical operation increases - and propose a new paradigm for designing optical computing systems: space-efficient neuromorphic optics, based on structural sparsity constraints and neural pruning methods motivated by wave physics (notably, the concept of "overlapping nonlocality"). On two mainstream platforms, free-space optics and on-chip integrated photonics, our methods demonstrate substantial size reductions (to 1%-10% the size of conventional designs) with minimal compromise on performance. Our theoretical and computational results reveal a trend of diminishing returns on accuracy as structure dimensions increase, providing a new perspective for interpreting and approaching the ultimate limits of optical computing - a balanced trade-off between device size and accuracy.</description>

      <title>The 2024 Active Metamaterials Roadmap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active metamaterials are engineered structures that possess novel properties that can be changed after the point of manufacture. Their novel properties arise predominantly from their physical structure, as opposed to their chemical composition and can be changed through means such as direct energy addition into wave paths, or physically changing/morphing the structure in response to both a user or environmental input. Active metamaterials are currently of wide interest to the physics community and encompass a range of sub-domains in applied physics (e.g. photonic, microwave, acoustic, mechanical, etc.). They possess the potential to provide solutions that are more suitable to specific applications, or which allow novel properties to be produced which cannot be achieved with passive metamaterials, such as time-varying or gain enhancement effects. They have the potential to help solve some of the important current and future problems faced by the advancement of modern society, such as achieving net-zero, sustainability, healthcare and equality goals. Despite their huge potential, the added complexity of their design and operation, compared to passive metamaterials creates challenges to the advancement of the field, particularly beyond theoretical and lab-based experiments. This roadmap brings together experts in all types of active metamaterials and across a wide range of areas of applied physics. The objective is to provide an overview of the current state of the art and the associated current/future challenges, with the hope that the required advances identified create a roadmap for the future advancement and application of this field.</description>

      <title>A reconfigurable non-linear active metasurface for coherent wave down-conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces can manipulate the amplitude and phase of electromagnetic waves, offering applications ranging from antenna design and cloaking to imaging and communication. Additionally, temporal, and non-linear metasurfaces have the potential to adjust the frequency of impinging waves, driving advancements in frequency conversion, sensing, and quantum systems. Here, we report the demonstration of a non-linear active electronic-photonic metasurface that transfers information from an impinging optical wave to a millimeter-wave (mm-wave) beam. The proof-of-concept metasurface is designed to radiate a steerable 28GHz beam when illuminated with an optical wave at 193THz and consists of optically synchronized electronic-photonic chips tiled on a printed circuit board containing a microstrip patch antenna array. Input light, modulated with a data-encoded mm-wave carrier, is coupled into electronic-photonic chips using microlenses. Within each chip, the mm-wave signal is detected, phase-adjusted, amplified, and routed to an off-chip antenna. Beam-steering over a range of 60$^{\circ}$ in elevation and azimuth and data transmission at 2Gb/s over a fiber-wireless link is demonstrated. Free-space optical synchronization can significantly reduce the complexity of large-scale metasurfaces composed of non-uniform or randomly placed elements, is compatible with scalable architectures, and facilitates data transfer and mm-wave beam shaping, allowing for large-scale high-bandwidth and energy-efficient links with reduced complexity for the next generation communication, computation, sensing and quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Measurement and feed-forward correction of the fast phase noise of lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lasers are the workhorse of quantum engineering in the atomic-molecular-optic community. However, phase noise of the laser, which can be especially large in popular semiconductor-based lasers, can limit fidelity of operation. Here, we present a fully-fiberized instrument detecting and correcting the fast, sub-microsecond, phase fluctuations of lasers. We demonstrate a measurement noise floor of less than 0.1 Hz$^{2}$/Hz, and a noise suppression of more than 20 dB for Fourier frequencies in the 1 to 10 MHz region (reaching up to 30 dB at 3 MHz), where noise is critical for Rydberg-based quantum gates. Finally, we observe the improvement offered by this fast phase noise eater on a Raman transition driven by two such stabilized lasers. These measurement and correction techniques are important tools for high-fidelity manipulation of the excited electronic states of atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>Mixing High Harmonic Generation and X-ray Second Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate the mixing of laser-driven high harmonic generation (HHG) and x-ray second harmonic generation (SHG) in gas-phase atoms, highlighting its potential as a powerful spectroscopic tool for studying atomic and molecular systems. Our simulations confirm the generation of HHG with x-ray SHG (HHG-XSHG) from atomic core electrons through the rescattering of electrons from x-ray two-photon excitation and subsequent tunneling ionization in an optical laser field. The resulting HHG-XSHG spectrum features a broadband multi-peak structure and a distinct spectral cutoff in the x-ray regime. These findings indicate that HHG-XSHG is a valuable technique for probing core-electron dynamics, generating attosecond x-ray pulses, and exploring nonlinear interactions, effectively merging laser-driven attosecond technology with nonlinear x-ray methodologies provided by x-ray free-electron lasers.</description>

      <title>Transmission eigenvalue distribution in disordered media from anisotropic field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10355v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A field theory for the distribution of transmission eigenvalues through a disordered medium is developed in details. The central equation of this theory is a self-consistent transport equation for a $2\times 2$ matrix radiance. This equation determines the transmission eigenvalue distribution not only in the diffusive regime but also in the quasiballistic regime, where the radiance is expected to be significantly anisotropic in the material bulk. We show that the matrix transport equation can be solved analytically in this regime. We also show that, in addition to the finite-width waveguide, our equation is able to predict the transmission eigenvalue distribution through an infinite slab.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Field Theory of Wave Transmission Statistics in Disordered Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10360v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a field theory to characterize the mean distribution of transmission eigenvalues for coherent wave propagation through a disordered medium. Unlike the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar (DMPK) theory, our approach does not rely on the isotropy hypothesis, which assumes uniform field intensity across scattering channels. As a result, it accurately predicts the transmission eigenvalue distribution both in the diffusive and quasiballistic regime. In addition, it proves to be more versatile than the DMPK theory, allowing for the incorporation of physical effects such as absorption or partial channel control with minimal adjustments to the formalism. Although these effects are commonly encountered in experiments on complex media, until now there has been no ab initio theory addressing them. Our predictions are numerically validated against transmission eigenvalue distributions computed from the microscopic wave equation.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-Driven Morphing and Control of Topological Modes in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and nonlinearity can each delocalize topological zero modes (TZMs) from the boundary. To overcome the challenge of precise parameter tuning imposed by the NHSE-induced delocalization and to enhance the capacity of TZMs limited by nonlinearity-induced partial delocalization in Hermitian systems, we develop non-Hermitian nonlinear topological interface models. This model consists of both Hermitian and non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains, incorporating nonreciprocal hopping and nonlinearity. When the nonlinearity is applied to both chains, the TZM becomes fully delocalized, extending across the entire lattice of two chains without the need for precise parameter tuning. By adjusting nonlinear coefficients in both chains, the wavefunction profile and plateaus across the entire lattice can be effectively controlled and customized through inherent configuration and intensity of the nonlinearity. Furthermore, the spectral localizer is utilized to demonstrate the topological protection of these extended non-Hermitian TZMs, confirming their robustness against disorder. Their dynamical stability under external pumping is also validated. Our findings provide a deeper insight into how nonlinearity and NHSE affect the behavior of topological modes, opening new possibilities for enhancing their capacity and performance in compact devices.</description>

      <title>BICEP/Keck XIX: Extremely Thin Composite Polymer Vacuum Windows for BICEP and Other High Throughput Millimeter Wave Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave refracting telescopes targeting the degree-scale structure of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have recently grown to diffraction-limited apertures of over 0.5 meters. These instruments are entirely housed in vacuum cryostats to support their sub-kelvin bolometric detectors and to minimize radiative loading from thermal emission due to absorption loss in their transmissive optical elements. The large vacuum window is the only optical element in the system at ambient temperature, and therefore minimizing loss in the window is crucial for maximizing detector sensitivity. This motivates the use of low-loss polymer materials and a window as thin as practicable. However, the window must simultaneously meet the requirement to keep sufficient vacuum, and therefore must limit gas permeation and remain mechanically robust against catastrophic failure under pressure. We report on the development of extremely thin composite polyethylene window technology that meets these goals. Two windows have been deployed for two full observing seasons on the BICEP3 and BA150 CMB telescopes at the South Pole. On BICEP3, the window has demonstrated a 6% improvement in detector sensitivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Paraxial propagation of a quasi-monochromatic light wave with two circular polarizations in a defocusing Kerr medium with anomalous dispersion inside a waveguide of annular cross-section was considered. In the phase-separated mode, the dynamics is similar to a flow of immiscible fluids. For some initial conditions with relative gliding of the fluids along the interface, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in its ``quantum'' variant is developed. Numerical simulations of the corresponding coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations have shown formation of specific structures at the nonlinear stage of the instability. Similar structures have been known in the theory of binary Bose-Einstein condensates, but for optics they were presented for the first time.</description>

      <title>Ultrashort laser-induced nuclear reactions: initiating decay of helium nuclei and subsequent fusion reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel method to construct particle accelerators targeting light atoms and nuclei using high-power femtosecond laser pulses. Initially, we confine light atoms within the laser pulse envelope due to longitudinal polarization forces, allowing them to acquire kinetic energies of several GeV. Subsequently, an external electric field separates the nuclei at the cathode, concentrating helium nuclei in a small area. The kinetic energy of the 1.88 GeV impacts, exceeding the alpha particle binding energy (28 MeV) by two orders of magnitude, induces powerful gamma radiation and neutron emission from decay processes. This experiment marks a demonstration of a laser-induced decay method for helium nuclei for the first time. Moreover, helium isotopes or deuterium nuclei trapped on the cathode show significantly reduced Coulomb repulsion, enabling subsequent nuclear fusion reactions and substantial nuclear energy release.</description>

      <title>Concatenation of Kerr solitary waves in Ceramic YAG: application to coherent Raman imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17040v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A coherent concatenation of multiple Townes solitons may lead to a stable infrared and visible broadband filament in ceramic YAG polycrystal. This self-trapped soliton train is leveraged to implement self-referenced multiplex coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering imaging. Simulations and experiments illustrating the filamentation process and the concatenation of focusing-defocusing cycles in ceramic and crystal YAG are presented. In addition, our simulations and experiments further examine the dependence of the filamentation onset location and supercontinuum generation upon peak input power. Understanding this dependence is key for implementation of viable CARS imaging techniques, due to the comparatively exceptional ability of YAG to generate supercontinuum which can enable higher-sensitivity imaging without delay lines.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Real-Time Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging: Multi-Pixel Parallelism for FPGA-Accelerated Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLI) is a widely used technique in the biomedical field for measuring the decay times of fluorescent molecules, providing insights into metabolic states, protein interactions, and ligand-receptor bindings. However, its broader application in fast biological processes, such as dynamic activity monitoring, and clinical use, such as in guided surgery, is limited by long data acquisition times and computationally demanding data processing. While deep learning has reduced post-processing times, time-resolved data acquisition remains a bottleneck for real-time applications. To address this, we propose a method to achieve real-time FLI using an FPGA-based hardware accelerator. Specifically, we implemented a GRU-based sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model on an FPGA board compatible with time-resolved cameras. The GRU model balances accurate processing with the resource constraints of FPGAs, which have limited DSP units and BRAM. The limited memory and computational resources on the FPGA require efficient scheduling of operations and memory allocation to deploy deep learning models for low-latency applications. We address these challenges by using STOMP, a queue-based discrete-event simulator that automates and optimizes task scheduling and memory management on hardware. By integrating a GRU-based Seq2Seq model and its compressed version, called Seq2SeqLite, generated through knowledge distillation, we were able to process multiple pixels in parallel, reducing latency compared to sequential processing. We explore various levels of parallelism to achieve an optimal balance between performance and resource utilization. Our results indicate that the proposed techniques achieved a 17.7x and 52.0x speedup over manual scheduling for the Seq2Seq model and the Seq2SeqLite model, respectively.</description>

      <title>Enhanced sensitivity of sub-THz thermomechanical bolometers exploiting vibrational nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common approach to detecting weak signals or minute quantities involves leveraging on the localized spectral features of resonant modes, where sharper lines (i.e. high Q-factors) enhance transduction sensitivity. However, maximizing the Q-factor often introduced technical challenges in fabrication and design. In this work, we propose an alternative strategy to achieve sharper spectral features by using interference and nonlinearity, all while maintaining a constant dissipation rate. Using far-infrared thermomechanical detectors as a test case, we demonstrate that signal transduction along an engineered response curve slope effectively reduces the detector's noise equivalent power (NEP). This method, combined with an optimized absorbing layer, achieves sub-pW NEP for electrical read-out detectors operating in the sub-THz range.</description>

Abstract: Single-mode fibers are used in fiber-optic gyroscopes to measure the Sagnac effect and are planned to be used in forthcoming experiments on the gravitationally induced phase shift in single photons. However, current theoretical models of such experiments are limited to ray-optics approximations or, if based on wave optics, to a restricted class of fiber alignments. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper develops a comprehensive perturbative scheme to solve for electromagnetic modes, i.e., monochromatic solutions to Maxwell's equations, of arbitrarily bent step-index fibers in general stationary space-times. This leads to transport equations for the electromagnetic phase and polarization that include the gravitational redshift, the Sagnac effect, a generalization of Rytov's law to curved space, a gravitational Faraday effect in the form of shift-induced gyrotropy, as well as inverse spin Hall effects caused by fiber bending, gravitational acceleration, and space-time curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alkali-noble-gas comagnetometers have become an essential tool for tests of fundamental physics and offer a compact platform for precision gyroscopy. They are, however, limited by technical noise at low frequencies, commonly due to their limited suppression of magnetic noise. Here we investigate a new method for co-magnetometry between a single noble gas and alkali species. While similar to well-known devices using self-compensation, our scheme introduces magnetic pulses that controllably perturb the noble gas and pulsed optical pumping to polarise the alkali atoms. These applied pulses allow our scheme to measure, rather than just suppress, the effect of magnetic noise thereby offering reduced cross-talk. We show numerically that our scheme retrieves four signals (rotations and magnetic fields on two transverse axes) with similar sensitivity to a single axis device. We also present a proof-of-principle experiment based on a 87Rb-129Xe cell. Our data shows a low magnetic-rotation cross-talk of $0.2 \pm 0.1\mu$Hz$/$pT, which is already on par with the most sensitive devices relying on self-compensation.</description>
