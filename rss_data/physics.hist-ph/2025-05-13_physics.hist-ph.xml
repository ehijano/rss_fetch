      <title>The fallacies of LCDM falsifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, numerous arguments have emerged suggesting that the LCDM (Lambda Cold Dark Matter) model may be inconsistent with observational data, requiring more or less radical revisions. Notable examples include the Hubble tension, the discrepancy between early and late-universe measurements of the Hubble constant, as well as tensions in measurements of cosmic structure growth. These issues have led some to question the validity of the LCDM framework and consider possible modifications or alternative models.
  However, upon closer inspection, many of these critiques stem from methodological or interpretive disagreements rather than from clear falsifications in the strict Popperian sense. Karl Popper proposed that scientific theories must be testable and falsifiable; in other words, a theory should be rejected if it fails a specific, reproducible test. Yet, many of the alleged inconsistencies within LCDM, while statistically significant, are not definitive falsifications but rather indicators of areas needing refinement or more complex modeling within the same framework.
  Thus, I review the recent claims about LCDM's limitations and analyze why they often reflect individual biases or philosophical preferences, rather than rigorous scientific falsifications. For example, alternative cosmological models such as MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics) or models incorporating new physics like quintessence or modified gravity are sometimes advocated based on theoretical appeal rather than direct evidence from critical tests. In many cases, these arguments for falsifying LCDM reveal more about subjective interpretations of data than about concrete observational contradictions.</description>

      <title>\`As vezes, solucionar uma crise depende de ampli\'a-la: a contribui\c{c}\~ao de Louis de Broglie \`a F\'isica Qu\^antica</title>

Abstract: Faz-se uma breve reconstru\c{c}\~ao hist\'orica de alguns pontos que, de algum modo, contribu\'iram para o trabalho seminal de Louis de Broglie. Em particular, enfatiza-se a relev\^ancia de sua tese de doutorado, principalmente por seu valor epistemol\'ogico, ao ampliar a crise que havia sido introduzida na descri\c{c}\~ao da radia\c{c}\~ao pelo \textit{quantum} de Planck, abrindo caminho para sua solu\c{c}\~ao.
  A brief historical reconstruction of some points that, in some way, contributed to Louis de Broglie's seminal work is made. In particular, the relevance of his doctoral thesis is emphasized, mainly for its epistemological value, in expanding the crisis that had been introduced in the description of radiation by Planck's quantum, paving the way for its solution.</description>

      <title>Naturalistic Metaphysics and the Parity Thesis: Why Scientific Realism Doesn't Lead to Realism about Metaphysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work, Nina Emery has defended the view that, in the context of naturalistic metaphysics, one should maintain the same epistemic attitude towards science and metaphysics. That is, naturalists who are scientific realists ought to be realists about metaphysics as well; and naturalists who are antirealists about science should also be antirealists about metaphysics. We call this the `parity thesis'. This paper suggests that the parity thesis is widely, albeit often implicitly, accepted among naturalistically inclined philosophers, and essentially for reasons similar to Emery's. Then, reasons are provided for resisting Emery's specific inference from scientific realism to realism about metaphysics. The resulting picture is a more nuanced view of the relationship between science and metaphysics within the naturalistic setting than the one which is currently most popular.</description>

      <title>The Duality of Whittaker Potential Theory: Fundamental Representations of Electromagnetism and Gravity, and Their Orthogonality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.08309v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: E. T. Whittaker produced two papers in 1903 and 1904 that, although sometimes considered mere mathematical statements (Barrett, 1993), held important implications for physical theory. The Whittaker 1903 paper united electrostatic and gravitational attraction as resulting from longitudinal waves - waves whose wavefronts propagate parallel to their direction. The Whittaker 1904 paper showed that electromagnetic waves resulted from the interference of two such longitudinal waves or scalar potential functions. Although unexplored, the implications of these papers are profound: gravitational lensing, gravitational waves, the Aharonov-Bohm effect, the existence of a hyperspace above or behind normal space, the elimination of gravitational and point charge singularities, MOND, and the expansion of the universe. This last implication can be related to the recent finding that black holes with posited vacuum energy interior solutions alongside cosmological boundaries have a cosmological coupling constant of k=3, meaning that black holes gain mass-proportional to a3 in a parameterization equation within a Robertson-Walker cosmology and are a cosmological accelerated expansion species (Farrah et al., 2023). This expansion and many features of General Relativity can be explained by the mass-proportionality and preferred direction of the longitudinal waves within the two underlying non-local Whittaker potentials (Titleman, 2022). Whittaker potential theory also offers a simple explanation for expansion of the universe - it is produced as longitudinal motion within the Whittaker potentials only when dynamic electromagnetism is separate from time-static gravity in intergalactic space.</description>

      <title>Rationally warranted promise: the virtue-economic account of pursuit-worthiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pursuing a scientific idea is often justified by the promise associated with it. Philosophers of science have proposed a variety of approaches to such promise, including more specific indicators. Economic models in particular emphasise the trade-off between an idea's benefits and its costs. Taking up this Peirce-inspired idea, we spell out the metaphor of such a cost-benefit analysis of scientific ideas. We show that it fruitfully urges a set of salient meta-methodological questions that accounts of scientific pursuit-worthiness ought to address. In line with such a meta-methodological framework, we articulate and explore an appealing and auspicious concretisation -- what we shall dub "the virtue-economic account of pursuit-worthiness": cognitive benefits and costs of an idea, we suggest, should be characterised in terms of an idea's theoretical virtues, such as empirical adequacy, explanatory power, or coherence. Assessments of pursuit-worthiness are deliberative judgements in which scientifically competent evaluators weigh and compare the prospects of such virtues, subject to certain rationality constraints that ensure historical and contemporary scientific circumspection, coherence and systematicity. The virtue-economic account, we show, sheds new light on the normativity of scientific pursuit, methodological pluralism in science, and the rationality of historical science.</description>
