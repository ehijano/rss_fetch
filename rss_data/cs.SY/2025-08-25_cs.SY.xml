      <title>Observer-Free Sliding Mode Control via Structured Decomposition: a Smooth and Bounded Control Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an observer-free sliding mode control (SMC) method based on explicit structural compensation via the decomposition \( s = \alpha - \beta \). The proposed formulation eliminates the need for state observers and higher-order derivatives, reduces chattering, and yields smooth, bounded control signal. Simulation results confirms its robustness and stability on benchmark nonlinear systems (pendulum, Van der Pol, Duffing, and networked systems) under noise, disturbances, and parameter variations. A Lyapunov-based stability proof confirms convergence. This method provides a scalable and practical alternative to traditional SMC, well suited for embedded and distributed environments.</description>

      <title>Konzepte zur Effizienzsteigerung von Traktionsmotoren in batterieelektrischen Fahrzeugen durch den Einsatz neuartiger teillastoptimierbarer Motor- und Invertertopologien</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To increase the efficiency of future electric vehicles, it is crucial to reduce drivetrain losses in battery-powered vehicles. This enables either an increase in driving range or overall cost savings by reducing battery capacity while maintaining the same range. Harmonic motor losses account for an avoidable share of more than 30% of the total eDrive losses in standard B6-2L 300 kW iPMSM configurations. These losses result from high-frequency voltage distortion across the motor windings, which can be reduced through various approaches. Of great importance is the classification of cost-neutral and low-cost concepts for loss reduction. The following presents and categorizes approaches to loss reduction that have been developed by research and industry in recent years. In particular, novel part-load-capable motor and inverter concepts are introduced, which enable motor switching or multilevel operation to reduce harmonic losses in the part-load range.</description>

      <title>Solving Three-phase AC Infeasibility Analysis to Near-zero Optimality Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works have shown the use of equivalent circuit-based infeasibility analysis to identify weak locations in distribution power grids. For three-phase power flow problems, when the power flow solver diverges, three-phase infeasibility analysis (TPIA) can converge and identify weak locations. The original TPIA problem is non-convex, and local minima and saddle points are possible. This can result in grid upgrades that are sub-optimal. To address this issue, we reformulate the original non-convex nonlinear program (NLP) as an exact non-convex bilinear program (BLP). Subsequently, we apply the spatial branch-and-bound (SBnB) algorithm to compute a solution with near-zero optimality gap. To improve SBnB performance, we introduce a bound tightening algorithm with variable filtering and decomposition, which tightens bounds on bilinear variables. We demonstrate that sequential bound tightening (SBT) significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of Gurobi's SBnB algorithm. Our results show that the proposed method can solve large-scale three-phase infeasibility analysis problems with &gt;5k nodes, achieving an optimality gap of less than 10e-4. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by utilizing the developed presolve routine for bounding, we can reduce the runtime of SBnB by up to 97%.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Switching Models for Truck-only Delivery and Drone-assisted Truck Delivery under Demand Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating drones into truck delivery systems can improve customer accessibility, reduce operational costs, and increase delivery efficiency. However, drone deployment incurs costs, including procurement, maintenance, and energy consumption, and its benefits depend on service demand. In low-demand areas, drone-assisted trucks may underutilize resources due to high upfront costs. Accurately predicting demand is challenging due to uncertainties from unforeseen events or infrastructure disruptions. To address this, a market entry and exit real option approach is used to optimize switching between truck-only and drone-assisted delivery under stochastic demand. Results show that deploying multiple drones per truck offers significant cost advantages in high-demand regions. Using the proposed dynamic switching model, deterministic and stochastic approaches reduce costs by 17.4% and 31.3%, respectively, compared to immediate cost-saving switching. Sensitivity analysis reveals asymmetric effects of stochastic parameters on entry and exit timings. A stochastic multiple-options model is further developed to dynamically switch between truck-only and drone-assisted delivery with varying drone numbers. Applying these models to Miami-Dade County, we evaluate dynamic switching costs for three major logistics operators. This study highlights the potential benefits of dynamic delivery switching and provides insights for optimizing logistics operations.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Analysis and Predictive Control of Descriptor Systems with Application to Power and Water Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite growing interest in data-driven analysis and control of linear systems, descriptor systems--which are essential for modeling complex engineered systems with algebraic constraints like power and water networks--have received comparatively little attention. This paper develops a comprehensive data-driven framework for analyzing and controlling discrete-time descriptor systems without relying on explicit state-space models. We address fundamental challenges posed by non-causality through the construction of forward and backward data matrices, establishing data-based sufficient conditions for controllability and observability in terms of input-output data, where both R-controllability and C-controllability (R-observability and C-observability) have been considered. We then extend Willems' fundamental lemma to incompletely controllable systems. These methodological advances enable Data-Enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) to achieve output tracking in descriptor systems and to maintain performance under incomplete controllability conditions, as demonstrated in two case studies: i) Frequency regulation in an IEEE 9-bus power system with 3 generators, where DeePC maintained the frequency stability of the power system despite deliberate violations of R-controllability; and ii) Pressure head control in an EPANET water network with 3 tanks, 2 reservoirs, and 117 pipes, where output tracking was successfully enforced under algebraic constraints.</description>

      <title>A Joint Delay-Energy-Security Aware Framework for Intelligent Task Scheduling in Satellite-Terrestrial Edge Computing Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a two-stage optimization framework for secure task scheduling in satellite-terrestrial edge computing networks (STECNs). The framework jointly considers secure user association and task offloading to balance transmission delay, energy consumption, and physical-layer security. To address the inherent complexity, we decouple the problem into two stages. In the first stage, a secrecy-aware user association strategy is designed by discretizing artificial noise (AN) power ratios and identifying feasible links that satisfy secrecy constraints, resulting in a set of candidate secure associations. In the second stage, we formulate a delay-energy-aware task scheduling problem as an integer linear program and solve it using a heuristic Mayfly Algorithm (MA) to obtain low-complexity, high-quality solutions. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework in achieving secure and efficient task scheduling under dynamic satellite environments.</description>

      <title>Resilient Control for Networked Switched Systems With/Without ACK: An Active Quantized Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the quantized control problem for switched systems under denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
  Considering the system's defensive capability and the computational resources of quantizers and controllers, four control strategies are proposed. These strategies incorporate different combinations of controllers (active and passive), quantizers (centered on the origin or custom-designed), and network configurations (with or without ACK signals). For each strategy, specific update laws for the encoder and decoder are designed to avoid quantization saturation.
  Furthermore, the uniformity of encoder and decoder operations is maintained by transmitting additional information to the decoder. To achieve asymptotic stability, sufficient conditions concerning the switching signal and DoS attack constraints are derived by taking into account the asynchronous behaviors. The proposed active quantization strategy with the ACK signal leverages the system model information to compute the control signal in real-time, allowing for possible convergence of the system state despite DoS attack. Additionally, a well-designed switching signal is suggested to further mitigate the impact of DoS attack. A passive quantization strategy with ACK signal is also developed as a simplified version of the active quantized control strategy, providing the foundation for a strategy without ACK signal. Inspired by time-triggered and event-triggered mechanisms, the passive quantization strategy without ACK signal is investigated, with two feasible update laws for the quantizer. Finally, two simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies.</description>

      <title>Performance analysis for cone-preserving switched systems with constrained switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies cone-preserving linear discrete-time switched systems whose switching is governed by an automaton. For this general system class, we present performance analysis conditions for a broadly usable performance measure. In doing so, we generalize several known results for performance and stability analysis for switched and positive switched systems, providing a unifying perspective. We also arrive at novel $\ell_1$-performance analysis conditions for positive switched systems with constrained switching, for which we present an application-motivated numerical example. Further, the cone-preserving perspective provides insights into appropriate Lyapunov function selection.</description>

      <title>Wide-Area Power System Oscillations from Large-Scale AI Workloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a new dynamic power profiling approach for modeling AI-centric datacenter loads and analyzing their impact on grid operations, particularly their potential to induce wide-area grid oscillations. We characterize the periodic stochastic power fluctuations inherent to large-scale AI workloads during both the training and fine-tuning stages, driven by the state-of-the-art GPU computing architecture designs. These sustained, large power fluctuations, unlike conventional load ramping, act as persistent forcing inputs capable of interacting with and amplifying local and inter-area oscillation modes. Using the WECC 179-bus system as a test case, we examine the amplitude and variability of oscillatory responses under different factors, ranging from system strength, penetration level, fluctuation frequency range, individual datacenter size, to geographical deployment. Simulation results show that, notably, narrower fluctuation bands, larger single-site capacities, or dispersed siting can intensify oscillations across multiple modes. Our models and numerical studies provide a quantitative basis for integrating AI-dominant electricity demands into grid oscillation studies, and further support the development of new planning and operational measures to power the continuous AI load growth.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-based Control via Y-wise Affine Neural Networks (YANNs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm based on Y-wise Affine Neural Networks (YANNs). YANNs provide an interpretable neural network which can exactly represent known piecewise affine functions of arbitrary input and output dimensions defined on any amount of polytopic subdomains. One representative application of YANNs is to reformulate explicit solutions of multi-parametric linear model predictive control. Built on this, we propose the use of YANNs to initialize RL actor and critic networks, which enables the resulting YANN-RL control algorithm to start with the confidence of linear optimal control. The YANN-actor is initialized by representing the multi-parametric control solutions obtained via offline computation using an approximated linear system model. The YANN-critic represents the explicit form of the state-action value function for the linear system and the reward function as the objective in an optimal control problem (OCP). Additional network layers are injected to extend YANNs for nonlinear expressions, which can be trained online by directly interacting with the true complex nonlinear system. In this way, both the policy and state-value functions exactly represent a linear OCP initially and are able to eventually learn the solution of a general nonlinear OCP. Continuous policy improvement is also implemented to provide heuristic confidence that the linear OCP solution serves as an effective lower bound to the performance of RL policy. The YANN-RL algorithm is demonstrated on a clipped pendulum and a safety-critical chemical-reactive system. Our results show that YANN-RL significantly outperforms the modern RL algorithm using deep deterministic policy gradient, especially when considering safety constraints.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of using multiple agents to harvest data from a collection of sensor nodes (targets) scattered across a two-dimensional environment. These targets transmit their data to the agents that move in the space above them, and our goal is for the agents to collect data from the targets as efficiently as possible while moving to their final destinations. The agents are assumed to have a continuous control action, and we leverage reinforcement learning, specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Lagrangian Penalty (LP), to identify highly effective solutions. Additionally, we enhance the controller's robustness by incorporating regularization at each state to smooth the learned policy. We conduct a series of simulations to demonstrate our approach and validate its performance and robustness.</description>

      <title>Advancing rail safety: An onboard measurement system of rolling stock wheel flange wear based on dynamic machine learning algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rail and wheel interaction functionality is pivotal to the railway system safety, requiring accurate measurement systems for optimal safety monitoring operation. This paper introduces an innovative onboard measurement system for monitoring wheel flange wear depth, utilizing displacement and temperature sensors. Laboratory experiments are conducted to emulate wheel flange wear depth and surrounding temperature fluctuations in different periods of time. Employing collected data, the training of machine learning algorithms that are based on regression models, is dynamically automated. Further experimentation results, using standards procedures, validate the system's efficacy. To enhance accuracy, an infinite impulse response filter (IIR) that mitigates vehicle dynamics and sensor noise is designed. Filter parameters were computed based on specifications derived from a Fast Fourier Transform analysis of locomotive simulations and emulation experiments data. The results show that the dynamic machine learning algorithm effectively counter sensor nonlinear response to temperature effects, achieving an accuracy of 96.5 %, with a minimal runtime. The real-time noise reduction via IIR filter enhances the accuracy up to 98.2 %. Integrated with railway communication embedded systems such as Internet of Things devices, this advanced monitoring system offers unparalleled real-time insights into wheel flange wear and track irregular conditions that cause it, ensuring heightened safety and efficiency in railway systems operations.</description>

      <title>Vector preference-based contextual bandits under distributional shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider contextual bandit learning under distribution shift when reward vectors are ordered according to a given preference cone. We propose an adaptive-discretization and optimistic elimination based policy that self-tunes to the underlying distribution shift. To measure the performance of this policy, we introduce the notion of preference-based regret which measures the performance of a policy in terms of distance between Pareto fronts. We study the performance of this policy by establishing upper bounds on its regret under various assumptions on the nature of distribution shift. Our regret bounds generalize known results for the existing case of no distribution shift and vectorial reward settings, and scale gracefully with problem parameters in presence of distribution shifts.</description>

      <title>LLM-Assisted Semantic Alignment and Integration in Collaborative Model-Based Systems Engineering Using SysML v2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-organizational collaboration in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) faces many challenges in achieving semantic alignment across independently developed system models. SysML v2 introduces enhanced structural modularity and formal semantics, offering a stronger foundation for interoperable modeling. Meanwhile, GPT-based Large Language Models (LLMs) provide new capabilities for assisting model understanding and integration. This paper proposes a structured, prompt-driven approach for LLM-assisted semantic alignment of SysML v2 models. The core contribution lies in the iterative development of an alignment approach and interaction prompts, incorporating model extraction, semantic matching, and verification. The approach leverages SysML v2 constructs such as alias, import, and metadata extensions to support traceable, soft alignment integration. It is demonstrated with a GPT-based LLM through an example of a measurement system. Benefits and limitations are discussed.</description>

Abstract: For a large class of Lur'e systems with time-varying nonlinearities and feedthrough we consider several well-posedness issues, namely: existence, continuation, blow-up in finite-time, forward completeness and uniqueness of solutions. Lur'e systems with feedthrough are systems of forced, nonlinear ordinary differential equations coupled with a nonlinear algebraic equation determining the output of the system. The presence of feedthrough means that the algebraic equation is implicit in the output, and, in general, the output may not be expressible by an analytic formula in terms of the state and the input. Simple examples illustrate that the well-posedness properties of such systems are not necessarily guaranteed by assumptions sufficient for the corresponding well-posedness properties of Lur'e systems without feedthrough. We provide sufficient conditions for the well-posedness properties mentioned above, using global inversion theorems from real analysis and tools from non-smooth analysis and differential inclusions. The theory is illustrated with examples.</description>

      <title>NOSTRA: A noise-resilient and sparse data framework for trust region based multi objective Bayesian optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) struggles with sparse (non-space-filling), scarce (limited observations) datasets affected by experimental uncertainty, where identical inputs can yield varying outputs. These challenges are common in physical and simulation experiments (e.g., randomized medical trials and, molecular dynamics simulations) and are therefore incompatible with conventional MOBO methods. As a result, experimental resources are inefficiently allocated, leading to suboptimal designs. To address this challenge, we introduce NOSTRA (Noisy and Sparse Data Trust Region-based Optimization Algorithm), a novel sampling framework that integrates prior knowledge of experimental uncertainty to construct more accurate surrogate models while employing trust regions to focus sampling on promising areas of the design space. By strategically leveraging prior information and refining search regions, NOSTRA accelerates convergence to the Pareto frontier, enhances data efficiency, and improves solution quality. Through two test functions with varying levels of experimental uncertainty, we demonstrate that NOSTRA outperforms existing methods in handling noisy, sparse, and scarce data. Specifically, we illustrate that, NOSTRA effectively prioritizes regions where samples enhance the accuracy of the identified Pareto frontier, offering a resource-efficient algorithm that is practical in scenarios with limited experimental budgets while ensuring efficient performance.</description>

      <title>TinyML Towards Industry 4.0: Resource-Efficient Process Monitoring of a Milling Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of industry 4.0, long-serving industrial machines can be retrofitted with process monitoring capabilities for future use in a smart factory. One possible approach is the deployment of wireless monitoring systems, which can benefit substantially from the TinyML paradigm. This work presents a complete TinyML flow from dataset generation, to machine learning model development, up to implementation and evaluation of a full preprocessing and classification pipeline on a microcontroller. After a short review on TinyML in industrial process monitoring, the creation of the novel MillingVibes dataset is described. The feasibility of a TinyML system for structure-integrated process quality monitoring could be shown by the development of an 8-bit-quantized convolutional neural network (CNN) model with 12.59kiB parameter storage. A test accuracy of 100.0% could be reached at 15.4ms inference time and 1.462mJ per quantized CNN inference on an ARM Cortex M4F microcontroller, serving as a reference for future TinyML process monitoring solutions.</description>

      <title>Data-conforming data-driven control: avoiding premature generalizations beyond data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven and adaptive control approaches face the problem of introducing sudden distributional shifts beyond the distribution of data encountered during learning. Therefore, they are prone to invalidating the very assumptions used in their own construction. This is due to the linearity of the underlying system, inherently assumed and formulated in most data-driven control approaches, which may falsely generalize the behavior of the system beyond the behavior experienced in the data. This paper seeks to mitigate these problems by enforcing consistency of the newly designed closed-loop systems with data and slowing down any distributional shifts in the joint state-input space. This is achieved through incorporating affine regularization terms and linear matrix inequality constraints to data-driven approaches, resulting in convex semi-definite programs that can be efficiently solved by standard software packages. We discuss the optimality conditions of these programs and then conclude the paper with a numerical example that further highlights the problem of premature generalization beyond data and shows the effectiveness of our proposed approaches in enhancing the safety of data-driven control methods.</description>

      <title>Non-asymptotic Error Analysis of Subspace Identification for Deterministic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16761v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The subspace identification method (SIM) has been extensively employed in the identification of discrete-time multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. This paper focuses on the analysis of perturbation errors for the system matrices in state-space models and the corresponding system poles, under two unified SIMs, based on a single finite-length input/output sample trajectory. Specifically, we derive non-asymptotic upper bounds on these errors, providing a unified perspective across various SIM variants. Furthermore, we prove that SIMs become ill-conditioned for MIMO systems when the state-to-output dimensionality ratio $n/m$ is large, regardless of system parameters. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to validate the non-asymptotic results and the ill-conditionedness of SIMs.</description>

      <title>AI-Powered CPS-Enabled Urban Transportation Digital Twin: Methods and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present methods and applications for the development of digital twins (DT) for urban traffic management. While the majority of studies on the DT focus on its ``eyes," which is the emerging sensing and perception like object detection and tracking, what really distinguishes the DT from a traditional simulator lies in its ``brain," the prediction and decision making capabilities of extracting patterns and making informed decisions from what has been seen and perceived. In order to add value to urban transportation management, DTs need to be powered by artificial intelligence and complement with low-latency high-bandwidth sensing and networking technologies, in other words, cyberphysical systems (CPS). We will first review the DT pipeline enabled by CPS and propose our DT architecture deployed on a real-world testbed in New York City. This paper can be a pointer to help researchers and practitioners identify challenges and opportunities for the development of DTs; a bridge to initiate conversations across disciplines; and a road map to exploiting potentials of DTs for diverse urban transportation applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new task-space Non-singular Terminal Super-Twisting Sliding Mode (NT-STSM) controller with adaptive gains for robust trajectory tracking of a 7-DOF robotic manipulator. The proposed approach addresses the challenges of chattering, unknown disturbances, and rotational motion tracking, making it suited for high-DOF manipulators in dexterous manipulation tasks. A rigorous boundedness proof is provided, offering gain selection guidelines for practical implementation. Simulations and hardware experiments with external disturbances demonstrate the proposed controller's robust, accurate tracking with reduced control effort under unknown disturbances compared to other NT-STSM and conventional controllers. The results demonstrated that the proposed NT-STSM controller mitigates chattering and instability in complex motions, making it a viable solution for dexterous robotic manipulations and various industrial applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) for tracking is a recently introduced approach, which extends standard MPC formulations by incorporating an artificial reference as an additional optimization variable, in order to track external and potentially time-varying references. In this work, we analyze the performance of such an MPC for tracking scheme without a terminal cost and terminal constraints. We derive a transient performance estimate, i.e. a bound on the closed-loop performance over an arbitrary time interval, yielding insights on how to select the scheme's parameters for performance. Furthermore, we show that in the asymptotic case, where the prediction horizon and observed time interval tend to infinity, the closed-loop solution of MPC for tracking recovers the infinite horizon optimal solution.</description>

      <title>IDSO-Managed Bid-Based Transactive Distribution Systems Design for DER Participation in Wholesale Markets While Preserving T-D Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Participation of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in bid-based Transactive Energy Systems (TES) at the distribution systems facilitates strongly coupled, bidirectional interactions between Transmission-Distribution (T-D) systems. Capturing these interactions is critical for ensuring seamless integration within an Integrated Transmission and Distribution (ITD) framework. This study proposes a methodology to preserve such tight T-D linkages by developing an Independent Distribution System Operator (IDSO) managed bid-based TES design for unbalanced distribution systems. The proposed design operates within the ITD paradigm and permits DER participation in the Wholesale Power Market (WPM) through IDSO while preserving tight T-D linkages. To this end, this research offers the following key contributions: a novel bid/offer prequalification-cum-aggregation method to ensure a grid-safe and value-based aggregation of DERs' bids and offers for WPM participation through IDSO; and a retail pricing mechanism that reflects the true value of procuring or offering additional units of power within the distribution system. Case studies are conducted on a modified IEEE 123-bus radial feeder populated with a high DER concentration to validate the proposed frameworks' effectiveness in coordinating the DERs efficiently and reliably.</description>

      <title>TAGA: A Tangent-Based Reactive Approach for Socially Compliant Robot Navigation Around Human Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robot navigation in densely populated environments presents significant challenges, particularly regarding the interplay between individual and group dynamics. Current navigation models predominantly address interactions with individual pedestrians while failing to account for human groups that naturally form in real-world settings. Conversely, the limited models implementing group-aware navigation typically prioritize group dynamics at the expense of individual interactions, both of which are essential for socially appropriate navigation. This research extends an existing simulation framework to incorporate both individual pedestrians and human groups. We present Tangent Action for Group Avoidance (TAGA), a modular reactive mechanism that can be integrated with existing navigation frameworks to enhance their group-awareness capabilities. TAGA dynamically modifies robot trajectories using tangent action-based avoidance strategies while preserving the underlying model's capacity to navigate around individuals. Additionally, we introduce Group Collision Rate (GCR), a novel metric to quantitatively assess how effectively robots maintain group integrity during navigation. Through comprehensive simulation-based benchmarking, we demonstrate that integrating TAGA with state-of-the-art navigation models (ORCA, Social Force, DS-RNN, and AG-RL) reduces group intrusions by 45.7-78.6% while maintaining comparable success rates and navigation efficiency. Future work will focus on real-world implementation and validation of this approach.</description>

      <title>Hyper Yoshimura: How a slight tweak on a classical folding pattern unleashes meta-stability for deployable robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deployable structures inspired by origami have provided lightweight, compact, and reconfigurable solutions for various robotic and architectural applications. However, creating an integrated structural system that can effectively balance the competing requirements of high packing efficiency, simple deployment, and precise morphing into multiple load-bearing configurations remains a significant challenge. This study introduces a new class of hyper-Yoshimura origami, which exhibits a wide range of kinematically admissible and locally metastable states, including newly discovered symmetric "self-packing" and asymmetric "pop-out" states. This metastability is achieved by breaking a design rule of Yoshimura origami that has been in place for many decades. To this end, this study derives a new set of mathematically rigorous design rules and geometric formulations. Based on this, forward and inverse kinematic strategies are developed to stack hyper-Yoshimura modules into deployable booms that can approximate complex 3D shapes. Finally, this study showcases the potential of hyper-Yoshimura with a meter-scale pop-up cellphone charging station deployed at our university's bus transit station, along with a 3D-printed, scaled prototype of a space crane that can function as an object manipulator, solar tracking device, or high-load-bearing structure. These results establish hyper-Yoshimura as a promising platform for deployable and adaptable robotic systems in both terrestrial and space environments.</description>

Abstract: Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods have recently shown successful results for conditional sampling of generative diffusion models. In this paper we propose a new diffusion posterior SMC sampler achieving improved statistical efficiencies, particularly under outlier conditions or highly informative likelihoods. The key idea is to construct an observation path that correlates with the diffusion model and to design the sampler to leverage this correlation for more efficient sampling. Empirical results conclude the efficiency.</description>

      <title>Contrastive-KAN: A Semi-Supervised Intrusion Detection Framework for Cybersecurity with scarce Labeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10808v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, cybersecurity and intrusion detection systems are vital for the secure and reliable operation of IoT and IIoT environments. A key challenge in this domain is the scarcity of labeled cyberattack data, as most industrial systems operate under normal conditions. This data imbalance, combined with the high cost of annotation, hinders the effective training of machine learning models. Moreover, the rapid detection of attacks is essential, especially in critical infrastructure, to prevent large-scale disruptions. To address these challenges, we propose a real-time intrusion detection system based on a semi-supervised contrastive learning framework using the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). Our method leverages abundant unlabeled data to effectively distinguish between normal and attack behaviors. We validate our approach on three benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15, BoT-IoT, and Gas Pipeline, using only 2.20%, 1.28%, and 8% of labeled samples, respectively, to simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing contrastive learning-based approaches. We further compare KAN with a traditional multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating KAN's superior performance in both detection accuracy and robustness under limited supervision. KAN's ability to model complex relationships, along with its learnable activation functions, is also explored and visualized, offering interpretability and the potential for rule extraction. The method supports multi-class classification and proves effective in safety, critical environments where reliability is paramount.</description>

      <title>Optimal Batch-Size Control for Low-Latency Federated Learning with Device Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a popular approach for collaborative machine learning in sixth-generation (6G) networks, primarily due to its privacy-preserving capabilities. The deployment of FL algorithms is expected to empower a wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, e.g., autonomous driving, augmented reality, and healthcare. The mission-critical and time-sensitive nature of these applications necessitates the design of low-latency FL frameworks that guarantee high learning performance. In practice, achieving low-latency FL faces two challenges: the overhead of computing and transmitting high-dimensional model updates, and the heterogeneity in communication-and-computation (C$^2$) capabilities across devices. To address these challenges, we propose a novel C$^2$-aware framework for optimal batch-size control that minimizes end-to-end (E2E) learning latency while ensuring convergence. The framework is designed to balance a fundamental C$^2$ tradeoff as revealed through convergence analysis. Specifically, increasing batch sizes improves the accuracy of gradient estimation in FL and thus reduces the number of communication rounds required for convergence, but results in higher per-round latency, and vice versa. The associated problem of latency minimization is intractable; however, we solve it by designing an accurate and tractable surrogate for convergence speed, with parameters fitted to real data. This approach yields two batch-size control strategies tailored to scenarios with slow and fast fading, while also accommodating device heterogeneity. Extensive experiments using real datasets demonstrate that the proposed strategies outperform conventional batch-size adaptation schemes that do not consider the C$^2$ tradeoff or device heterogeneity.</description>
