      <title>J-VAR: the northern variable sky in 7 filters -- First Data Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. The analysis of variability of astronomical sources is of extraordinary interest, as it allows the study of astrophysical phenomena in real time. This paper presents the Javalambre Variability Survey (J-VAR) which leverages the narrow band filters available at the Javalambre Auxiliary Survey Telescope (JAST80) at the Observatorio Astrof\'isico de Javalambre (OAJ).
  Methods. The JAST80 equipped with T80Cam, providing a field of view of 2\,square degrees and a pixel scale of 0.55\,arcsec/pixel has been designed for wide-field studies. The main characteristic is the availability of a variety of narrow band filters strategically located on stellar spectral features (the $J0395$ in correspondence of the Ca H+K doublet, the $J0515$ of the Mg $b$ triplet, the $J0660$ of the H$\alpha$ line, and the $J0861$ of the Ca~triplet). This project combines, for the first time, the wide-field with a variety of narrow band filters for a unique variability survey, observing each field 11~times with a standardised observing sequence. The median limiting magnitude for individual exposures are 19.1 mag in $J0395$ and $J0515$, $19.6$ mag in $J0660$ and $J0861$, $19.8$ mag in $i$, and $20.2$ in $g$ and $r$. The typical FWHM of the $r$-band images is $1.5$ arcsec.
  Results. This article introduces the first data release of J-VAR including more than 6000 individual asteroids, 10\,detected optical transients (4\,discovered supernovae), and 1.3 million light curves of point-sources. On average, J-VAR delivers an unprecedented $\sim$5000 light curves per square degree of 11\,epochs in 7\,bands, opening research opportunities for theoretical studies and new discoveries alike.</description>

      <title>The ASPIICS solar coronagraph aboard the Proba-3 formation flying mission. Scientific objectives and instrument design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the scientific objectives and instrument design of the ASPIICS coronagraph launched aboard the Proba-3 mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) on 5 December 2024. Proba-3 consists of two spacecraft in a highly elliptical orbit around the Earth. One spacecraft carries the telescope, and the external occulter is mounted on the second spacecraft. The two spacecraft fly in a precise formation during 6 hours out of 19.63 hour orbit, together forming a giant solar coronagraph called ASPIICS (Association of Spacecraft for Polarimetric and Imaging Investigation of the Corona of the Sun). Very long distance between the external occulter and the telescope (around 144 m) represents an increase of two orders of magnitude compared to classical externally occulted solar coronagraphs. This allows us to observe the inner corona in eclipse-like conditions, i.e. close to the solar limb (down to 1.099 Rs) and with very low straylight. ASPIICS will provide a new perspective on the inner solar corona that will help solve several outstanding problems in solar physics, such as the origin of the slow solar wind and physical mechanism of coronal mass ejections.</description>

      <title>Two-sided-loop jet originates from the filament internal reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection driving two-sided-loop jet is typically associated with interactions between an emerging bipole and the overlying horizontal magnetic field, or between filaments from separate magnetic systems. Leveraging high temporal and spatial resolution observations from ground-based and space-borne instruments, we have identified a two-sided-loop jet originating from magnetic reconnection between threads within a single filament. Our observations show that as two initially crossing filamentary threads within the filament converge, reconnection takes place at their intersection. In the Doppler images, distinct redshift and blueshift signals are observed at the locations where the filament threads intersected. This process generates a two-sided-loop jet with outflow speeds of \speed{22.2} and \speed{62.5}. Following reconnection, the original crossing threads transform into two parallel threads that subsequently separate at speeds of \speed{2.8} and \speed{8.3}. This observation offers a new perspective on the mechanisms responsible for jet formation.</description>

      <title>On the Encounter Rate of Open Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probable past and future close encounters of open clusters with known characteristics over 64 million years have been calculated by integrating the orbits of cluster centers in the Galactic potential using the _galpy_ package. It has been shown that in the Galactic neighborhood of the Sun, pairwise cluster encounters at distances comparable to or smaller than their sizes occur at a characteristic rate of 35 to 40 events per 1 Myr. Close encounters between open clusters with a significant age difference occur at a rate of 15 events per Myr. It can be expected that in the Galaxy as a whole, such events occur an order of magnitude more frequently per unit time. Thus, dynamical interactions between stellar ensembles of different ages may not be too rare and could influence the properties of stellar populations. A pair of clusters with similar ages: HSC 1428 and Gulliver 22 was identified as a likely physically bound binary cluster system. A forecast of expected close encounters over the next 32 Myr has been provided for 490 pairs of clusters. Currently, 29 pairs of clusters are at their closest approach.</description>

      <title>Pinching of ICME Flux Rope: Unprecedented Multipoint Observations of Internal Magnetic Reconnection during Gannon's Superstorm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extreme solar storm of May 10, 2024, during the 25th solar cycle, which recorded a symmetric H component index (Sym-H) reaching -500 nT, was the strongest since the 2003 Halloween storm. This event offered a unique opportunity for unprecedented multipoint observation of the complex interaction of Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (ICME) from different vantage points. Utilizing NASA's Wind, ACE, DSCOVR, THEMIS-C, STEREO-A, MMS, and ISRO's recently launched Aditya-L1 spacecraft, we comprehensively investigated the spatio-temporal variations in interplanetary plasma and magnetic field parameters. Our study reveals large-scale quasi-steady magnetic reconnection within the interior of the ICME flux rope, possibly triggered by interactions between multiple ICMEs. A current sheet (CS) forms within the flux rope, enabling internal magnetic reconnection between concentric magnetic surfaces, which leads to a sharp reversal of the IMF By component, as observed at the L1 point. Concurrently, reconnection exhaust and enhanced electron and ion fluxes were detected with the CS, extending over 200 RE (1.3 million km) along the GSE-y direction. This finding sheds new light on the role of internal reconnection in ICME evolution, highlighting its pivotal role in modifying the morphology of the ICME magnetic structure and exerting severe space weather effects on Earth.</description>

      <title>The Aromatic Infrared Bands around the Wolf-Rayet Binary WR140 Revealed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have analyzed the aromatic infrared bands (AIBs) in the 6-11.2 $\mu$m range around the Wolf-Rayet binary WR140 (d=1.64 kpc) obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MRS). In WR140's circumstellar environment, we have detected AIBs at 6 $\mu$m and 7.7 $\mu$m which are attributed to C-C stretching modes. These features have been detected in the innermost dust shell (Shell1; ~2100 au from WR140), the subsequent dust shell (Shell2; ~5200 au), and ``off-shell'' regions in the MRS coverage. The 11.2 $\mu$m AIB, which is associated with the C-H out-of-plane bending mode, has been tentatively detected in Shell2 and the surrounding off-shell positions around Shell2. We compared the AIB features from WR140 to spectra of established AIB feature classes A, B, C, and D. The detected features around WR140 do not agree with these established classes. The peak wavelengths and full width half maxima (FWHMs) of the 6 $\mu$m and 7.7 $\mu$m features are, however, consistent with those of R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars with hydrogen-poor conditions. We discuss a possible structure of carbonaceous compounds and environments where they form around WR140. It is proposed that hydrogen-poor carbonaceous compounds initially originate from the carbon-rich WR wind, and the hydrogen-rich stellar wind from the companion O star may provide hydrogen to these carbonaceous compounds.</description>

      <title>A magnetic white dwarf formed through a binary merger within 35 million years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarfs (WDs) represent the final evolutionary stage of most stars, typically originating from progenitor stars with masses below approximately 8 $M_{\odot}$ to 10 $M_{\odot}$. Formation through single-star evolution generally requires at least 25 Myr, with the youngest WDs often near the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 $M_{\odot}$. In contrast, WDs formed via binary channels, such as mergers or mass transfer, can develop smaller masses in a shorter timescale and may exhibit unique characteristics, including strong surface magnetic fields and rapid rotation. Accurately determining the ages of these WDs is essential for understanding their formation. A valuable method involves studying WDs in star clusters, where member stars share the same age and chemical composition, allowing for precise constraints on the formation times and metallicities of the WDs' progenitors. Here we report a WD found in the open cluster RSG 5, which is only 35 Myr old. The WD's mass is lower than 1.05 $M_{\odot}$, indicating it may not have formed through single-star evolution. The WD possesses an exceptionally strong surface magnetic field ($\ge 200$ MG), a short rotational period ($\sim 6.5$ min), and, most notably, a co-rotating half-ring of ionized circumstellar debris. This distinctive feature provides evidence for a binary merger origin, a scenario further substantiated by our stellar evolution models.</description>

      <title>Solar models with protosolar accretion and turbulent mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (abridged) Recent analyses have reported low lithium but high beryllium abundances on the solar surface; however, standard solar models (SSMs) predict Li abundances that are ~30$\sigma$ away from the observed value. In this study, we aim to develop solar models and compare them with the Li and Be abundance constraints. We examine the effect of protosolar accretion and turbulent mixing below the base of the surface convective zone. We compute ~200 solar evolutionary models for each case to optimize input parameters using target quantities, similar to the SSM framework. We confirm that turbulent mixing helps reproduce the surface Li and Be abundances within ~0.6$\sigma$ by enhancing burning. It suppresses gravitational settling, leading to a better matching of the He surface abundance ($\lesssim$0.3$\sigma$) and a smaller compositional gradient. We derive a new protosolar helium abundance $Y_{\rm proto}=0.2651\pm0.0035$. Turbulent mixing decreases the central metallicity ($Z_{\mathrm{center}}$) by $\approx$4.4%, even though accretion increases $Z_{\rm center}$ by $\approx$4.4%, as suggested by our previous study. Unfortunately, the reduction in $Z_{\rm center}$ implies that our models do not reproduce constraints on observed neutrino fluxes by $6.2\sigma$ for $^8{\rm B}$ and $2.7\sigma$ for CNO. Including turbulent mixing in solar models appears indispensable to reproduce the observed atmospheric abundances of Li and Be. However, the resulting tensions in terms of neutrino fluxes, even in the models with the protosolar accretion, show that the solar modeling problem remains, at least partly. We suggest that improved electron screening, as well as other microscopic properties, may help alleviate this problem. An independent confirmation of the neutrino fluxes measured by the Borexino experiment would also be extremely valuable.</description>

      <title>Solar Flare Ion Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes that the ion temperature is several times the local electron temperature in the hot onset phase and at the above-the-loop region of solar flares. The paper considers: the evidence of spectral line Doppler widths ("non-thermal" broadening); evidence for "universal" ion and electron temperature increase scaling relations for magnetic reconnection in the solar wind, Earth's magnetopause, Earth's magnetotail and numerical simulations; and thermal equilibration times for onset and above-the-loop densities, which are much longer than previous estimates based on soft X-ray flare loops. We conclude that the ion temperature is likely to reach 60 MK or greater and that it may represent a substantial part of spectral line widths, significantly contributing to solving the long-standing issue of the excess nonthermal broadening in flare lines.</description>

      <title>An AGB star as the source of the abundance pattern of hyper-metal-poor star HE 1327-2326</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abridged. HE 1327-2326 (HE 1327), with [Fe/H]=-5.2, is one of the most metal-poor stars detected and a candidate to be the offspring of the first stars. Numerous efforts have been made to match its abundance pattern. However, no model satisfactorily explains its entire surface chemical composition. The high CNO pattern with [N/Fe]&gt;[C/Fe]&gt;[O/Fe], the light element 'slide' (between Na and Si), and the presence of Sr and Ba in HE 1327 is reminiscent of those asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars that undergo third dredge-up, hot bottom burning, and s-processing, suggesting that AGBs may have been progenitors of the star. We assume that, where HE 1327 formed, the interstellar medium was well-mixed, and adopt an initial stellar composition based on the observed chemical evolution of the early universe. We calculated models of hyper-metal-poor AGB stars and compared their yields to the observed abundances of HE 1327. Our 3 Msun models match 13 of the 14 measured elements in HE1327. They are also consistent with the seven elements with upper limits. The only discrepancy is O, underproduced by 0.5-1.0 dex. Unlike the SN models, the AGB models also match Sr and Ba. Our model predicts high abundances of P and Pb, which would be useful in testing the AGB scenario. We propose that HE 1327 is the oldest known object that shows nucleosynthetic evidence of the first AGB stars. With lifetimes as short as 200 Myr, these stars may have formed and polluted the universe very early. Recent Pop III star formation simulations support their formation, and their strong N production is qualitatively consistent with recent JWST observations showing high N/O ratios just 440 Myr after the Big Bang. Importantly, our results also suggest that the interstellar medium may have shown some degree of homogeneity and mixing even at these early epochs.</description>

      <title>No evidence of intrinsic linear polarization in Nova Vel 2025 (V572 Vel)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on polarimetric observations of V572 Vel (Nova Vel 2025) conducted on June 26th and July 21st, 2025, shortly after its nova eruption was discovered. Our measurements in the I$_C$ band revealed an average linear polarization of 1.60$\pm$0.03\% at position angle of 132.2\degr. To distinguish between intrinsic and interstellar polarization, we also measured 86 field stars in the nova's vicinity, finding an average polarization of 1.25$\pm$0.61\% at a nearly identical position angle of 132\degr. The strong consistency between the nova's polarization and that of the surrounding field stars suggests that the observed polarization is predominantly interstellar in origin. We found no significant evidence of an intrinsic polarization component, which would typically arise from an asymmetric distribution of ejected material. Further multi-band observations are recommended to confirm these findings.</description>

      <title>Complex spectral variability and hints of a luminous companion in the Be star + black hole binary candidate ALS 8814</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emission-line binary ALS 8814 was recently proposed as a Be star + black hole (BH) binary based on large-amplitude radial velocity (RV) variations of a Be star and non-detection of spectroscopic features from a luminous companion. We reanalyze low- and medium-resolution LAMOST spectra of ALS 8814 and show that the system's spectroscopic variability is considerably more complex than previously recognized. Inspection of the system's trailed spectra reveals the presence of a second set of absorption lines that move in anti-phase with the Be star. In addition, the emission and absorption lines exhibit inconsistent RV variability, suggesting that they trace different stars. Using spectral disentangling, we recover the spectrum of a rapidly rotating companion whose broad, shallow lines were previously undetected. Time-variability in the emission lines complicates interpretation of the disentangled spectrum, such that the physical parameters of the components are still uncertain, but we find with simulations that emission line variability alone is unlikely to explain all signatures of the companion. The system's high Gaia RUWE value suggests a third luminous companion, making ALS 8814 a likely hierarchical triple. Although it is unlikely to contain a BH, the system is unusual, with the largest RV semi-amplitude observed in any known classical Be star and a companion that does not appear to be stripped. More extensive spectroscopic monitoring and high-resolution imaging will be necessary to fully characterize the system's orbital architecture, stellar parameters, and evolutionary status.</description>

      <title>Glitch analysis and asteroseismic modelling of subgiant $\mu$ Herculis: confirming and interpreting the $\Gamma_1$ peak as the helium glitch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurements of pressure-mode and mixed-mode oscillation frequencies in subgiant stars offer a unique opportunity to probe their internal structures -- from the surface to the deep interior -- and to precisely determine their global properties. We have conducted a detailed asteroseismic analysis of the benchmark subgiant $\mu$ Herculis using eight seasons of radial velocity observations from the SONG telescope, and have determined its mass, radius, age, and surface helium abundance to be $1.105_{-0.024}^{+0.058}$ M$_\odot$, $1.709_{-0.015}^{+0.030}$ R$_\odot$, $8.4_{-0.1}^{+0.4}$ Gyr, and $0.242^{+0.006}_{-0.021}$, respectively. We have demonstrated that simultaneously fitting the helium glitch properties, oscillation frequencies, and spectroscopic observables yields a more accurate inference of the surface helium abundance and hence stellar age. A significant discrepancy between the observed extent of the helium ionization zone and that predicted by stellar models is identified and examined, underscoring potential limitations in the current modelling of stellar interiors. Our analysis confirms that the helium glitch originates from the region between the two stages of helium ionisation, i.e. from the $\Gamma_1$ peak, rather than from the second helium ionisation zone itself. Within the conventional formalism, this implies that the glitch analysis characterises the region located between the two helium ionisation zones.</description>

      <title>Tertiary Tides with Eccentric Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within hierarchical triple stellar systems, there exists a tidal process unique to them, known as tertiary tides. In this process, the tidal deformation of a tertiary in a hierarchical triple drains energy from the inner binary, causing the inner binary's orbit to shrink. Previous work has uncovered the rate at which tertiary tides drain energy from inner binaries, as a function of orbital and tidal parameters, for hierarchical triples in which the orbits are all circular and coplanar. However, not all hierarchical triples have orbits which are circular and coplanar, which requires an understanding of what happens when this condition is relaxed. In this paper, we study how eccentricities affect tertiary tides, and their influence on the subsequent dynamical evolution of the host hierarchical triple. We find that eccentricities in the outer orbit undergo tidal circularisation as quickly as binary tidal synchronisation, and are therefore trivial, but that eccentricities in the inner binary completely change the behaviour of tertiary tides, draining energy from the outer orbit as well as the inner orbit. As with the circular orbit case, tertiary tides become significant when the tertiary is large enough to come close to filling its Roche Lobe, and dominate tidal evolution when interactions between the inner binary pair are weak. Empirical equations that approximate this behaviour are provided for ease of implementing this process in other stellar evolution codes, and the implications of these results are discussed.</description>

      <title>The survey of DA double white dwarf candidates based on DESI EDR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mergers of double white dwarfs are considered significant potential progenitors of type Ia supernovae. Although there is no direct observational evidence to definitively determine the formation pathways of SNe Ia, studying the physical properties of DWDs provides valuable insights into their evolutionary processes, interaction modes, and merger mechanisms, which are essential for understanding the explosion mechanisms of SNe Ia. This study aims to identify DWD candidates through spectroscopic radial velocity measurements and analyze their physical properties based on DESI EDR. We crossmatched DESI EDR with the Gaia EDR3 to select DA. We measured the spectroscopic RV using the cross-correlation function and assessed the significance of RV variability using a chi-squared-based variability method. Spectroscopic Teff and log g were derived by fitting the hydrogen Balmer lines, with 3D convection corrections applied. Orbital periods and semi-amplitudes were obtained through a Lomb-Scargle analysis of the RV time series. We interpolated WD cooling models and applied Monte Carlo simulations to calculate masses, cooling ages, radii, and their associated uncertainties. We also analyzed their photometric and spectral energy distribution properties to derive photometric temperatures and radii, which were then compared with the corresponding spectroscopic parameters. We identified 33 DA DWD candidates with significant RV variability, including 28 new discoveries. Among them, we found an extremely low-mass DWD candidate and a potential triple system. For these candidates, we measured key physical parameters including Teff, log g, mass, and radius, and estimated the orbital periods based on the available data. Of these, 17 candidates exhibit relatively clear periodic RV variability in the current data, and we report their best-fitting periods and RV semi-amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Long-term evolution of the SN 2009ip-like transient SN 2016cvk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interacting transient SN 2016cvk (ASASSN-16jt) is a member of the peculiar SN 2009ip-like events. We present our follow-up data and aim to draw conclusions about the physical nature of the progenitor system. Our spectrophotometric data set of SN 2016cvk covers the ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared wavelength region extending to +1681 d from the light curve peak; the data is analysed and compared to other SN 2009ip-like transients. Archival data reveals pre-outbursts of the progenitor with the first detection at -1219 d. The light curve evolution of SN 2016cvk consists of two consecutive luminous events A and B with peak magnitudes of M_V &lt; -15.6 and M_r = -18.3 mag, respectively. The spectra are dominated by Balmer emission lines that have a complex, multi-component evolution similar to other SN 2009ip-like targets. SN 2016cvk is among the first detected SN 2009ip-like events that show early `flash ionisation' features of C III, N III, and He II, lasting for 16 +/- 5 d. Our late-time +405 d spectrum shows forbidden [Ca II], [Fe II], and [O I] features with the latter detected particularly clearly for a SN 2009ip-like event. The evolution of SN 2016cvk is similar to other SN 2009ip-like transients, with some uncommon traits. The lack of a double-peaked structure in the Balmer lines is likely caused by differences in the circumstellar medium structure or viewing angle. The flash features in the early spectra propose abundances consistent with a red, yellow, or blue supergiant progenitor rather than for example a luminous blue variable. The detection of [O I] in the +405 d spectrum suggests possible evidence of nucleosynthesised material generated in a SN explosion.</description>

      <title>PIMMS: Pulsation-Informed Magnetic Mapping of Stars with Zeeman-Doppler Imaging I. Formalism and numerical tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02152v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Magneto-asteroseismology is a novel technique allowing for more precise determinations of internal properties of magnetic pulsating stars, but requires an accurate characterisation of the surface magnetic field, not previously possible with Zeeman-Doppler Imaging (ZDI) due to the time-dependent surface velocity of pulsating stars. Aims. We aim to develop a new version of ZDI, which creates an additional surface velocity map, that includes the time-dependent velocities of surface elements due to pulsations. Methods. We present a new code, PIMMS: Pulsation-Informed Magnetic Mapping of Stars, which uses a surface-integrated line profile model that accounts for the additional Doppler shifts of local lines caused by pulsations. It is then possible to fit this model to spectropolarimetric observations, reconstructing maps of the surface brightness, magnetic field, and the velocity field due to the combination of pulsation and rotation. In this paper, we present and test PIMMS extensively, to understand its limitations and data requirements. Results. We find that PIMMS can accurately reproduce the magnetic fields and brightness distributions of realistic models of pulsating hot stars. The required number of observations is higher than that required for ZDI of a non-pulsating star due to the additional velocity map that must be disentangled from surface brightness variations. PIMMS is now ready to be applied to real stars.</description>

      <title>Active region upflows in various coronal structures and their coupling to the lower atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma upflows with a Doppler shift exceeding -10 km/s at active region (AR) boundaries are considered potential sources of the nascent slow solar wind. We investigate the driving mechanisms of a pair of coronal upflow regions on the western and eastern peripheries of an AR, which have different magnetic topologies and surroundings. It is aimed to explore how these upflows couple to the lower atmosphere. Using observations of the Fe XII 19.51 nm line from Hinode, we identified two upflow regions at the western and eastern boundaries of a decaying AR. Context images for the two regions were obtained by the High Resolution Imager (HRI) telescope of the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) on board the Solar Orbiter mission. Other instruments on Solar Orbiter and other observatories provide diagnostics to the lower atmosphere. Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) extrapolations were used to examine the magnetic field configuration associated with the AR upflows. The eastern upflow region, located over the AR moss, displays small-scale dynamic fibril structures, whereas the western region hosts fan-like loops. We found blueshifted Ne VIII emission at the eastern site, in contrast to redshifted Ne VIII profiles in the west. Magnetic field extrapolations reveal a pseudostreamer topology connecting both these regions. Moreover, low transition-region lines show systematically reduced redshift below the eastern footpoint. The observations support the scenario in which both upflows are driven by pressure imbalances created by coronal reconnection, leading to a continuous upflow above approximately 0.6 MK (i.e., Ne VIII line formation temperature). Meanwhile, mass flows in the lower transition region beneath the eastern upflow region appear to respond passively to the pressure-driven coronal upflows.</description>

      <title>The incidence of magnetism in blue and yellow straggler stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our understanding of the generation of magnetic fields in intermediate-mass and massive OBA stars remains limited. Some theories have proposed that their magnetic fields could be a result of strong binary interactions, including stellar mergers. Blue stragglers, which lie well beyond the main sequence turn-off point on the colour-magnitude diagram of stellar clusters, are widely theorised to be merger products or interacting binaries and therefore can be considered excellent test targets to get insights into the origin of magnetic fields in stars with radiative envelopes. We search for the presence of magnetic fields in a sample of blue and yellow stragglers listed in the Gaia DR2-based catalogue of blue stragglers in open clusters. We measured the mean longitudinal magnetic field from HARPSpol spectra of five blue stragglers and three yellow stragglers using the least-squares deconvolution technique. We present the first observational evidence that blue and yellow stragglers possess magnetic fields of the order of a hundred to a few hundred Gauss. The targets in our sample belong to open clusters of very different ages and metallicities, but we do not detect any relationship between the presence or strength of the detected magnetic field and the cluster characteristics. For the first time, using high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations, a definite detection of a magnetic field is achieved in a Be-shell star, HD61954. The two yellow stragglers, HD62329 and HD65032, appear to be members in binary systems, whereas the blue straggler HD62775 is possibly a triple system. HD62329 and HD65032 exhibit in their spectra weak Nd III 6145 lines, which are usually prominent in magnetic Ap and Bp stars.</description>

      <title>Exploring giant barium stars: $^{12}\rm{C}/^{13}\rm{C}$ ratio and elemental abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barium (Ba) stars belong to binary systems that underwent mass transfer events. As a consequence, their envelopes were enriched with material synthesized in the interiors of their evolved companions via \textit{slow} neutron-capture nucleosynthesis, the $s$-process. As post-interacting binaries, Ba stars figure as powerful tracers of the $s$-process. In this study, we conduct a classical local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis for a sample of 180 Ba giant stars to find complementary insights for the $s$-process, in form of elemental abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, as well as the $^{12}\rm{C}/^{13}\rm{C}$ ratio. We found carbon abundances systematically larger than those observed in normal giants, with [C/Fe] ratios ranging within from $-0.30$ to $+0.60$~dex. As expected, the [C/Fe] ratios increase for lower metallicity regimes and are strongly correlated with the average $s$-process abundances. Nitrogen abundances have a flat behavior around $\rm{[N/Fe]}\sim+0.50$~dex and are moderately correlated with sodium abundances. Except for HD~107541, the entire sample shows $\rm{C/O}&lt;1$. We found $^{12}\rm{C}/^{13}\rm{C}&lt;20$ for $\sim80\%$ of the sampled stars and $^{12}\rm{C}/^{13}\rm{C}&gt;60$ for three objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are known drivers of large-scale waves in the low corona. However, wave dynamics in the extended corona and inner heliosphere remain largely unexplored. Here, we report the first observational and numerical evidence of coherent global compressive oscillations in the outer corona and inner heliosphere, revealed by white-light SOHO/LASCO C3 data and an MHD simulation. Analyzing the CME event of 2012 July 23 using Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD), we isolate two distinct wave signatures: (1) a directional fast-mode shock-like compressive wave that dissipates completely within ~3 hours, and (2) a large-scale global circular wavefront consistent with fast-mode MHD behavior, lasting ~7 hours and extending across the LASCO C3 field of view, marking the first detection of such a global oscillation. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized component of CME-driven wave activity, providing new constraints on the dynamics of the extended corona and inner heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Mapping atmospheric features of the planetary-mass brown dwarf SIMP 0136 with JWST NIRISS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze James Webb Space Telescope Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph time-series spectroscopy data to characterize the atmosphere of the planetary-mass brown dwarf SIMP J01365662+093347. Principal component analysis reveals that 81\% of spectral variations can be described by two components, implying that variability within a single rotational phase is induced by at least three distinct spectral regions. By comparing our data to a grid of Sonora Diamondback atmospheric models, we confirm that the time-averaged spectrum cannot be explained by a single model but require a linear combination of at least three regions. Projecting these models onto the principal component plane shows that the overall variability is highly correlated with changes in temperature, cloud coverage, and possibly effective metallicity. We also extract brightness maps from the lightcurve and establish North-South asymmetry in the atmosphere. A combined multidimensional analysis of spectro-photometric variability links the three spectral regions to three atmospheric layers. Forsterite cloud and water abundance at each level form unique harmonics of atmospheric variability observed in different spectral bands. Atmospheric retrievals on the time-averaged spectrum are consistent with an optically thick iron cloud deck beneath a patchy forsterite cloud layer and with the overall adiabatic curve. We also demonstrate two new analysis methods: a regionally-resolved spectra retrieval that relies on multi-wavelength spherical harmonics maps, and a method to constrain brightness maps using Doppler information present in the spectra. Future observations of variable brown dwarfs of higher spectral resolution or spanning multiple rotations should help break mapping degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Very Massive, Rapidly Spinning Binary Black Hole Progenitors through Chemically Homogeneous Evolution -- The Case of GW231123</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the over 200 gravitational wave detections reported so far, GW231123 is a remarkable event that not only holds the record for the most massive black hole merger, but also exhibits extreme spins. Its origin is actively debated. Proposed scenarios include dynamical formation involving a sequence of mergers, Population III stars, accretion in an AGN disk and also more exotic explanations including primordial black holes and cosmic strings, each facing different challenges. Recent work showed that the incoming black holes of GW231123 can be formed out of massive rapidly rotating collapsing helium stars. Here, we address the question how such very massive rapidly rotating helium stars can be formed in very close binary systems. For this we explore chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) involving progenitors with masses above the pair-instability mass gap. We compute a grid of detailed massive binary models with the stellar evolution code MESA to follow the early evolution of binary progenitors and show that: (i) very massive ($M_i &gt; 140\, M_\odot$) CHE binaries at low metallicity ($Z=10^{-5}$) naturally produce rapidly rotating progenitors with high masses and high spins matching the properties of the black holes in GW231123 and (ii) the maximum spin of the progenitors is bound by their critical rotation rate leading to a tight correlation between the dimensionless spin and mass, $a \propto M^{-0.9}$, in models that have no hydrogen left. We conclude that the CHE channel appears to be a viable and natural scenario to produce progenitors. We compare and discuss the differences with earlier studies and comment on the large uncertainties in the final fate and collapse.</description>

      <title>Multi-messengers from the radioactive decay of $r$-process nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radioactive $\beta$-decay of nuclei synthesized in the rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process) releases a variety of particles, including electrons, $\gamma$-rays, neutrinos, and neutrons. These particles provide a rich set of multi-messenger signals that carry information about the astrophysical environments where neutron-rich nucleosynthesis occurs. In this work, we calculate from first principles the emission spectra resulting from the $\beta$-decay of $r$-process nuclei. Our approach incorporates detailed nuclear structure and decay data to model the energy distributions of each particle species. We couple the spectra with a nuclear reaction network simulation to obtain the temporal evolution of these distributions. We find that the emission distributions vary significantly in time and are non-thermal, with substantial average energies. We investigate these nuclear signals as a direct probe of heavy element formation and show that they are complementary observables to kilonova.</description>

      <title>Binding energy distributions of alcohols, thiols, and their precursors on interstellar water ice surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binding energy (BE) is a critical parameter in astrochemical modeling, governing the retention of species on interstellar dust grains and their subsequent chemical evolution. However, conventional models often rely on single-valued BEs, overlooking the intrinsic distribution arising from diverse adsorption sites. In this study, we present BEs for monohydric alcohols, thiols, and their plausible precursors, including aldehydes and thioaldehydes. We incorporate a distribution of BEs to capture the realistic variation in adsorption strengths. The quantum chemical calculations provide a range of BE values rather than a single estimate, ensuring a more precise description of molecular diffusion and surface chemistry. The BE trend of analogous species provides qualitative insight into the dominant reaction pathways and key precursors that drive the formation of larger molecules under interstellar conditions. Oxygen-bearing species generally exhibit higher BEs than their sulfur analogues, primarily due to stronger interactions, further influencing molecular adsorption and reactivity. We implemented BE distributions in astrochemical models, revealing significant effects on predicted abundances and establishing a more accurate framework for future astrochemical modeling.</description>

      <title>First-principles response simulation of wide-gap CdTe-DSDs for the FOXSI solar sounding rocket experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a wide-gap CdTe double-sided strip detector (CdTe-DSD) for the fourth and fifth flights of the Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager sounding rocket experiment (FOXSI-4/FOXSI-5). This detector features a 30 um strip width and a variable gap width from 30 um to 70 um, enabling position resolution finer than the strip pitch by inducing charge sharing across adjacent strip electrodes and utilizing this shared energy information for position reconstruction. However, this wide-gap configuration introduces complex detector responses, such as charge loss in the gap regions and electric field distortion near the electrodes, requiring a more advanced modeling approach for interpreting observation results in FOXSI-4/FOXSI-5 and for further optimization of future detector design. To address these complexities, we have constructed a first-principles simulation framework to model the detector response. The simulation integrates Geant4-based Monte Carlo simulations of energy deposition, finite element calculations of electric and weighting fields using COMSOL Multiphysics, charge transport modeling incorporating trapping and diffusion, and calculation of the induced charge on the electrodes based on the Shockley-Ramo theorem. By introducing a surface conductive layer, which causes electric field distortion, the model successfully reproduces the experimentally observed charge loss on the cathode side. In addition, the model reproduces the distinct charge sharing behavior on the cathode and anode sides. These results validate the effectiveness of the model in characterizing the wide-gap CdTe-DSD.</description>

      <title>Hunting pre-stellar cores with APEX: overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [Abridged] $Context.$ Pre-stellar cores are centrally concentrated starless cores on the verge of star formation and they represent the initial conditions for star and planet formation. Pre-stellar cores host an active organic chemistry and isotopic fractionation, kept stored into thick icy mantles, which can be inherited by the future protoplanetary disks and planetesimals. So far, only a few have been studied in detail, with special attention being paid to L1544 in the Taurus Molecular Cloud. $Aims.$ The aim is to identify nearby ($&lt;$200 pc) pre-stellar cores in an unbiased way, to build a sample that can then be studied in detail. $Methods.$ We first used the Herschel Gould Belt Survey archival data, selecting all those starless cores with central H$_2$ number densities higher than or equal to 3$\times$10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$, the density of L1544 within the Herschel beam. The selected 40 (out of 1746) cores have then been observed in N$_2$H$^+$(3-2) and N$_2$D$^+$(4-3) using the APEX antenna. $Results.$ A total of 17 bona-fide (i.e., with a deuterium fraction larger than 10%) pre-stellar cores have been identified. Other 16 objects can also be considered pre-stellar, as they are dynamically evolved starless cores, but their deuterium fraction is relatively low ($&lt;$10%). The remaining 7 objects have been found associated with very young stellar objects. $Conclusions.$ Dust continuum emission, together with spectroscopic observations of N$_2$H$^+$(3-2) and N$_2$D$^+$(4-3), is a powerful tool to identify pre-stellar cores in molecular clouds. Detailed modeling of the physical structure of the objects is now required for reconstructing the chemical composition as a function of radius. This work has provided a statistically significant sample of 33 pre-stellar cores, a crucial step in the understanding of the process of star and planet formation.</description>

      <title>Local extraction of three-dimensional magnetic reconnection X-lines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is one of the most important magnetic energy conversion processes observed in laboratory and space plasmas. It describes the breaking and joining of magnetic field lines, leading to the release of magnetic energy and the acceleration of charged particles. Finding regions where fast reconnection occurs is key to understanding this process. However, identifying such reconnection events within a turbulent environment in three dimensions remains a challenge. In this work, we develop a new framework for identifying magnetic reconnection using 3D turbulent plasma simulations. First, we apply bifurcation lines from fluid visualization to magnetic fields and show that they can be identified with X-lines of magnetic reconnection. For reconnection configurations with magnetic guide fields, we introduce a novel concept of quasi X-lines (QXL). Using the spatial information of X-lines in numerical simulations, we present a local technique to estimate the reconnection rate, obtaining a distribution that features a local maximum near the normalized value 0.1. Additionally, we provide an alternative tool to highlight current sheets in turbulent plasma by measuring magnetic shear layers as the second invariant of the shear strain tensor. These methods, avoiding traditional reliance on global methods, electric fields and current density, offer a new perspective to the quantitative study of magnetic reconnection in plasmas with complex magnetic field topologies. Validated across various plasma simulation models, including kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) and resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), our approach enables efficient exploration of magnetic field dynamics in turbulent plasma environments.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Stellar Feedback and Cloud Structure in the $\rho$ Ophiuchi A Region with ALMA and JWST: Discovery of Substellar Cores, C$^{18}$O Striations, and Protostellar Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In clustered star-forming regions, stellar feedback-such as HII regions/photon-dominated regions (PDRs), and protostellar jets/outflows-shapes cloud structures and influences star formation. Using high-resolution ALMA millimeter and JWST infrared data, we analyze the cloud structure and the impact of stellar feedback in the nearest dense cluster-forming region Oph A. All 6 known Class 0/I and 2 of 6 Flat Spectrum/Class II objects are detected in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. Additionally, we newly detected 7 substellar cores, three of which show compact near-infrared emission, suggesting they are young substellar objects. The remaining cores, with masses of 0.01 Msun and high densities, are likely gravitationally bound. They appear connected by faint CO finger-like structures extending from the triple Class 0 system VLA1623-2417 Aa+Ab+B, suggesting they may have been ejected from the close binary VLA1623 Aa+Ab. 12CO and near-infrared data reveal multiple protostellar outflows. From the comparison, we identified several new outflows/jets, and shocked structures associated to the GSS30 large bipolar bubble. Strong 12CO emission traces the eastern edge of the Oph A ridge, forming part of the expanding HII/PDR bubble driven by the nearby Herbig Be star S1. The northern ridge appears blown out, with warm gas flowing toward GSS 30, injecting additional turbulent momentum. Several C18O striations in the S1 bubble align with magnetic fields, and position-velocity diagrams show wave-like patterns, possibly reflecting magnetohydrodynamic waves. Stellar feedback significantly influences Oph A's cloud structure.</description>

      <title>Mysteries of Capotauro - investigating the puzzling nature of an extreme F356W-dropout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST has uncovered a diverse population of extreme near-infrared dropouts, including ultra high-redshift ($z&gt;15$) galaxy candidates, dust-obscured galaxies challenging dust production theories, sources with strong Balmer breaks - possibly compact AGN in dense environments - and cold, sub-stellar Galactic objects. This work presents Capotauro, a F356W-dropout in the CEERS survey with F444W AB magnitude of $\sim27.68$ and a sharp $&gt;3$ mag flux drop between $3.5{-}4.5\,\mu$m, undetected below $3.5\,\mu$m. We combine JWST/NIRCam, MIRI, and NIRSpec/MSA data with HST/ACS and WFC3 observations to perform a spectro-photometric analysis of Capotauro using multiple SED-fitting codes. Our setup tests $z\geq15$ as well as $z&lt;10$ dusty, Balmer-break or strong-line galaxy solutions, and the possibility of Capotauro being a Milky Way sub-stellar object. Among extragalactic options, our analysis favors interpreting the sharp drop as a Lyman break at $z\sim32$, consistent with the epoch of formation of the first stars and black holes, with only $\sim0.5\%$ of the posterior volume at $z&lt;25$. Lower-redshift solutions struggle to reproduce the extreme break, suggesting that if Capotauro lies at $z&lt;10$, it must show a non-standard combination of strong dust attenuation and/or Balmer breaks, making it a peculiar interloper. Alternatively, its properties match a very cold (Y2-Y3 type) brown dwarf or a free-floating exoplanet with a record-breaking combination of low temperature and large distance ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}&lt;300\,\mathrm{K}$, $d\gtrsim130\,\mathrm{pc}$, up to $\sim2\,\mathrm{kpc}$). While current data cannot determine its nature, Capotauro emerges as a remarkably unique object in all plausible scenarios, and a compelling target for follow-up.</description>

      <title>Are Local Group Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies the First Safe Planet-hosting Environments?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore whether Local Group dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies might have hosted Earth-like planets dwelling unexposed for several billions of years to major galactic threats to life, such as supernovae and gamma-ray bursts. To this aim, we developed a novel semiempirical model that exploits the observed chemical abundances and star formation histories of a selected sample of local dSphs, to explore whether their stars may have (i) reached the minimum metallicity to trigger planet formation and (ii) avoided exposure to destructive events long enough to provide time for possible biological development. From our work two scenarios emerge. If planet formation is possible for ${\rm[Fe/H]}\lesssim-1$, then in all dSphs with $5\times10^{3}L_{\odot}\leq L_V\leq2\times10^{7}L_{\odot}$ a fraction $\approx0.1\%-10\%$ of stars might have safely hosted terrestrial planets for more than $1$ Gyr. In this scenario, ancient ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs, $L_V\leq10^{5}L_{\odot}$) would have been the first to reach this condition in the history of the Local Group. Conversely, if planets form for ${\rm[Fe/H]}\geq-0.6$ then they should not exist in UFDs, while only $\approx0.001\%-0.1\%$ of stars in dSphs with $L_V\geq3\times10^{5}L_{\odot}$ would host planets dwelling in safe conditions for long times. Interestingly, we find a "luminosity sweet spot" at $L_V\sim10^{6}L_{\odot}$ where dSphs in our sample safely host terrestrial planets up to $4$ Gyr and in any planet formation scenario explored. In conclusion, planet formation at low metallicity is key to understanding which types of galaxies might have formed Earth-like planets that dwelt unexposed to galactic threats over several billions of years, first in the history of the Local Group.</description>

      <title>Detecting water ice and vapor disks originating from icy planetary bodies around white dwarfs with future PRIMA observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of atmospheres of polluted white dwarfs provide insights into the elemental composition of accreted exoplanets and exo-asteroids. However, they poorly constrain the abundance of ice-forming volatile elements due to the properties of white dwarf atmospheres. Instead of focusing solely on atmospheric observations, we propose observing circumstellar water ice and vapor disks formed by the tidal disruption of icy bodies using the future PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) far-infrared enhanced survey spectrometer. PRIMA has the potential to measure volatile abundances in colder circumstellar regions inaccessible by shorter-wavelength observations. We employ a simple disk emission model with disk parameter ranges inferred from previous observations and disk evolution simulations. We find the 44-$\mu$m water ice feature promising for observing icy disks. For white dwarfs within 60 pc, 1-hour PRIMA observations could detect water ice with a mass above $10^{20}$ g, representing a potential lower limit of circumstellar disk mass. Water vapor rotational lines also abundantly emerge within the PRIMA wavelength coverage, and 5-hour observations for white dwarfs within 20 pc could detect water vapor with a total disk mass $\gtrsim 10^{20}$ g, depending on the H$_2$/H$_2$O ratio. 19 metal polluted white dwarfs within 20 pc and 210 within 60 pc could be optimal targets for water vapor and ice observations, respectively.</description>

      <title>ALMA High-resolution Observation for the Transitional Disk around IRAS 04125+2902</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the youngest transiting planet was discovered around the T Tauri star, IRAS 04125+2902, in the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region. This system is crucial for understanding the early stages of planet formation. We used Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 6 data to investigate the IRAS 04125+2902 system in detail. The dust continuum emission reveals a ring-gap transitional disk structure with an inclination of 35.6$^{\circ}$. In addition, two-dimensional super-resolution imaging based on Sparse Modeling and the one-dimensional modeling of disk brightness distribution suggest the existence of an inner emission, which may be attributed to an inner disk, although free-free emission from the central star is not ruled out. Furthermore, we identified the $^{12}$CO $J$=2-1 emission, and the dynamical mass of the central star is estimated to be 0.7-1.0 $M_{\odot}$. The asymmetry of the dust ring and the velocity distortion around the central star are, if at all, weak, suggesting that the inner disk, if it exists, is not highly inclined with respect to the outer disk. Radiative transfer calculations of dust continuum emission suggest that the inner and the outer disk may be misaligned by $\sim$10$^\circ$, which may be confirmed in future observations with higher resolution and sensitivity. Our results suggest that IRAS 04125+2902 is a dynamically complex system, where the binary orbit, outer disk, inner disk, and planetary orbit are mutually misaligned, providing insight into the early orbital evolution of young systems.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of the Radius Gap in a Sample of Kepler, K2 and TESS exoplanets orbiting M Dwarf Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planetary radii are derived for 218 exoplanets orbiting 161 M dwarf stars. Stellar radii are based on an analysis of APOGEE high-resolution near-IR spectra for a subsample of the M-dwarfs; these results are used to define a stellar radius-M$_{\rm K_{\rm s}}$ calibration that is applied to the sample of M-dwarf planet hosts. The planetary radius distribution displays a gap over R$_{\rm p}$$\sim$1.6-2.0 R$_{\oplus}$, bordered by two peaks at R$_{\rm p}$$\sim$1.2-1.6 R$_{\oplus}$ (super-Earths) and 2.0-2.4 R$_{\oplus}$ (sub-Neptunes). The radius gap is nearly constant with exoplanetary orbital period (a power-law slope of m=$+0.01^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$), which is different (2-3$\sigma$) from m$\sim$$-$0.10 found previously for FGK dwarfs. This flat slope agrees with pebble accretion models, which include photoevaporation and inward orbital migration. The radius gap as a function of insolation is approximately constant over the range of S$_{\rm p}$$\sim$20-250 S$_{\oplus}$. The R$_{\rm p}$-P$_{\rm orb}$ plane exhibits a sub-Neptune desert for P$_{\rm orb}$$&lt;$2d, that appears at S$_{\rm p}$$&gt;$120 S$_{\oplus}$, being significantly smaller than S$_{\rm p}$$&gt;$650 S$_{\oplus}$ found in the FGK planet-hosts, indicating that the appearance of the sub-Neptune desert is a function of host-star mass. Published masses for 51 exoplanets are combined with our radii to determine densities, which exhibit a gap at $\rho_{\rm p}$$\sim$0.9$\rho_{\oplus}$, separating rocky exoplanets from sub-Neptunes. The density distribution within the sub-Neptune family itself reveals two peaks, at $\rho_{\rm p}$$\sim$0.4$\rho_{\oplus}$ and $\sim$0.7$\rho_{\oplus}$. Comparisons to planetary models find that the low-density group are gas-rich sub-Neptunes, while the group at $&lt;$$\rho_{\rm p}$$&gt;$$\sim$0.7$\rho_{\oplus}$ likely consists of volatile-rich water worlds.</description>

      <title>Radiative Transfer Modeling of a Shadowed Protoplanetary Disk assisted by a Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present observations and detailed modeling of a protoplanetary disk around the T Tauri star, V1098 Sco. Millimeter wavelength data from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) show a ring of large dust grains with a central cavity that is filled with molecular gas. Near-infrared data with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) detect the scattered starlight from the disk surface and reveal a large shadow that extends over it's entire southern half. We model the ALMA continuum and line data to determine the outer disk geometry and the central stellar mass. Using radiative transfer models, we demonstrate that a misaligned inner disk, tilted in both inclination and position angle with respect to the outer disk, can reproduce the salient scattered light features seen with the VLT. Applying an image threshold algorithm to compare disk morphologies and training a neural network on a set of high signal-to-noise models, we forward model the data and determine the inner disk geometry. We find that the rotation axes of the inner and outer disks are misaligned by 38 degrees and constrain the mass and location of a perturbing planetary or substellar companion. The technique of simulation based inference that is illustrated here is broadly applicable for radiative transfer modeling of other objects.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black hole growth from stellar binary encounters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02316v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains a central problem in astrophysics, with current observations providing only limited constraints on the underlying mechanisms. One possible growth channel is stellar accretion via the Hill's mechanism, wherein a SMBH tidally breaks up a passing binary star, capturing and eventually accreting a member of the binary. We adopt a model to predict capture rates from parameters that include the central number density of stars, the stellar velocity dispersion, the binary fraction, and black hole mass. We then use this model to estimate the growth of SMBHs across a range of galactic environments. In a data set of 30 galaxies of various types and masses, we identify two candidates with SMBHs for which stellar accretion may be a driver of recent growth. Closer to home, a recent analysis of observed hypervelocity stars from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) implicates binary star interactions with a massive black hole. Every hypervelocity star produced in this way leaves a bound partner that may be accreted, providing an active growth channel for the LMC's black hole.</description>

      <title>CAPOS: the bulge Cluster APOgee Survey IX. Spectroscopic Analysis of the Bulge Globular Cluster Terzan 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first detailed spectroscopic analysis of the heavily extincted bulge globular cluster Terzan 2 (Ter 2) based on high-resolution near-infrared spectra obtained as part of the CAPOS (the bulge Cluster APOgee Survey) project. CAPOS focuses on surveying clusters within the Galactic Bulge, using the APOGEE-2S spectrograph, part of the SDSS-IV survey, a component of the second generation Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE-2). For the spectral analysis, we use the Brussels Automatic Code for Characterizing High accUracy Spectra (BACCHUS) code which provides line-by-line elemental abundances. We derive abundances for Fe-peak (Fe, Ni), $\alpha$-(O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti), light-(C, N), odd-Z(Al), and the s-process element (Ce) for four members of the cluster. Our analysis yields a mean metallicity of [Fe/H]= $-$0.84 $\pm$ 0.04, with no evidence for an intrinsic variation. We detect a significant abundance variation only in C and N, indicating the presence of multiple populations. Ter 2 exhibits a typical $\alpha$-enrichment, that follows the trend of Galactic GCs. Additionally, our dynamical analysis reveals that Terzan 2 is a bulge globular cluster with a chaotic orbit that is influenced by the Galactic bar but not trapped by it, displaying both prograde and retrograde motions within the inner bulge region. Overall, the chemical patterns observed in Terzan 2 are in good agreement with those of other CAPOS bulge clusters of similar metallicity.</description>

      <title>Was SNR 0509-67.5 the result of a double detonation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe) occur when a white dwarf (WD) is disrupted by runaway thermonuclear burning. The nature and observable signatures of the mechanism triggering the explosion are still debated. In this work, we study how supernova remnants (SNRs) are impacted by the `double detonation' explosion mechanism, or a helium shell detonation in a sub-Chandrasekhar WD followed by a core detonation. We evolve double detonation SN models to the remnant phase (up to several centuries) and measure the size of substructures formed in the SNR as a result of turbulent activity. We compare our results to small-scale substructures seen in high-resolution optical observations of the SNR 0509-67.5. Substructures dominated by iron in that SNR are observed to be about $40\%$ larger than those dominated by sulfur. This has been shown to be a definitive signature of the explosion of a sub-Chandrasekhar WD by Mandal et al. Comparisons against our suite of SNR models with a range of core and shell masses suggest that the specific substructure sizes in SNR 0509-67.5 are most consistent with the double detonation explosion of a WD with a carbon-oxygen core mass and a helium shell mass of $1M_{\odot}$ and $&gt;0.05M_{\odot}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Sub-Jupiter Gas Giants Orbiting Giant Stars Uncovered using a Bayesian Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Giant stars have been shown to be rich hunting grounds for those aiming to detect giant planets orbiting beyond ~0.5 AU. Here we present two planetary systems around bright giant stars, found by combining the radial-velocity (RV) measurements from the EXPRESS and PPPS projects, and using a Bayesian framework. HIP18606 is a naked-eye (V=5.8 mags) K0III star and is found to host a planet with an orbital period of ~675 days, a minimum mass (Msini) of 0.8 MJ, and a circular orbit. HIP111909 is a bright (V=7.4 mags) K1III star, and hosts two giant planets on circular orbits with minimum masses of Msini=1.2 MJ and Msini=0.8 MJ, and orbital periods of ~490 d and ~890 d, for planets b and c respectively, strikingly close to the 5:3 orbital period ratio. Analysis of 11 known giant star planetary systems arrive at broadly similar parameters to those published, whilst adding a further two new worlds orbiting these stars. With these new discoveries, we have found a total of 13 planetary systems (including three multiple systems) within the 37 giant stars that comprise the EXPRESS and PPPS common sample. Periodogram analyses of stellar activity indicators present possible peaks at frequencies close to proposed Doppler signals in at least two planetary systems, HIP24275 and HIP90988, calling for more long-term activity studies of giant stars. Even disregarding these possible false-positives, extrapolation leads to a fraction of 25-30% of low-luminosity giant stars hosting planets. We find the mass-function exponentially rises towards the lowest planetary masses, however there exists a ~93% probability that a second population of giant planets with minimum masses between 4-5 MJ, is present, worlds that could have formed by the gravitational collapse of fragmenting proto-planetary disks. Finally, our noise modelling reveals a lack of statistical evidence for the presence of correlated noise...(Abridged)</description>

      <title>Energetic Ion Composition as a Means of Investigating the Physical Origins of Alpha Particle Heavy Magnetic Switchbacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic switchbacks are of continuing interest to the scientific community due to the fact that the phenomenon has not been completely understood. Although most of the research into them in the Parker Solar Probe era has largely focused on creating a theoretical framework for causing the field reversal through magnetic interchange reconnection, reconnecting streams of plasma in the solar wind, or shear driven turbulence, it remains unclear to what extent these models may or may not represent the underlying physical reality of magnetic switchbacks. In this paper, we present the results of our study on the energetic ion composition of magnetic switchback events using statistical methods with the aim of obtaining new insights into the underlying physics. In doing so, we find consistent differences in arrival times of the peak flux of different energetic ion species in magnetic switchbacks which are indicative of switchback formed remotely in the solar corona and propagated outwards in the solar wind. We also find that while the data does not directly contradict a linear interchange reconnection model nor the flux rope driven interchange reconnection model, the structure of the plasma within the switchbacks themselves is reminiscent of reconnection produced plasmoids.</description>

      <title>A Unified Phenomenology of Ion Heating in Low-$\beta$ Plasmas: Test-Particle Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07015v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that stochastic and resonant ion heating, often viewed as distinct processes in low-$\beta$ collisionless plasmas, are the far limits of a continuum controlled by nonlinear broadening of turbulent fluctuations, and thus by the normalized cross helicity. We propose a simple empirical formula that captures both regimes, generalizing that commonly used to describe stochastic heating. Simulations of test ions interacting with turbulence confirm our scalings across a wide range of different ion and turbulence properties, including with a steep ion-kinetic transition range as seen in the solar wind. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding ion heating processes across diverse astrophysical environments from black-hole accretion disks to the solar corona, also providing a compact and versatile subgrid model for larger-scale simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Star clusters are interesting laboratories to study star formation, single and binary stellar evolution, and stellar dynamics. We have used the exquisite data from $Gaia$'s data release 3 (DR3) to study 21 relatively rich and nearby open clusters with member numbers ($N_{\rm{cl}}$)$&gt;500$. We have developed a non-parametric method to identify cluster members. Our method works well for clusters located in both sparse and crowded environments, hence, can be applied to a wide variety of star clusters. Since the member classification scheme does not make any assumptions on the expected distributions of potential cluster members, our method can identify members associated with clusters that are oddly shaped or have complex internal spatial or kinematic structures. In addition, since the membership determination does not depend on the proximity to any well-defined sequences on the color-magnitude diagram, this method easily identifies straggler members. Furthermore, for each of these clusters, we estimate essential cluster properties including age, metallicity, distance, and reddening using detailed Markov-Chain Monte Carlo parameter estimation. We report the full posteriors for these important cluster properties for all clusters in our study.</description>

      <title>VAST-MeMeS: Characterising non-thermal radio emission from magnetic massive stars using the Australian SKA Pathfinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic massive stars are stars of spectral types O, B and A that harbour $\sim$ kG strength (mostly dipolar) surface magnetic fields. Their non-thermal radio emission has been demonstrated to be an important magnetospheric probe, provided the emission is fully characterised. A necessary step for that is to build a statistically significant sample of radio-bright magnetic massive stars. In this paper, we present the `VAST project to study Magnetic Massive Stars' or VAST-MeMeS that aims to achieve that by taking advantage of survey data acquired with the Australian SKA Pathfinder telescope. VAST-MeMeS is defined under the `VAriable and Slow Transient' (VAST) survey, although it also uses data from other ASKAP surveys. We found radio detections from 48 magnetic massive stars, out of which, 14 do not have any prior radio detections. We also identified 9 `Main-sequence Radio Pulse Emitter' candidates based on variability and circular polarisation of flux densities. The expanded sample suggests a slightly lower efficiency in the radio production than that reported in earlier work. In addition to significantly expanding the sample of radio-bright magnetic massive stars, the addition of flux density measurements at $\lesssim 1$ GHz revealed that the spectra of incoherent radio emission can extend to much lower frequencies than that assumed in the past. In the future, radio observations spanning wide frequency and rotational phase ranges should be conducted so as to reduce the uncertainties in the incoherent radio luminosities. The results from these campaigns, supplemented with precise estimations of stellar parameters, will allow us to fully understand particle acceleration and non-thermal radio production in large-scale stellar magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>Binary mass transfer in 3D -- Mass Transfer Rate and Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mass transfer is crucial in binary evolution, yet its theoretical treatment has long relied on analytic models whose key assumptions remain debated. We present a direct and systematic evaluation of these assumptions using high-resolution 3D hydrodynamical simulations including the Coriolis force. We simulate streams overflowing from both the inner and outer Lagrangian points, quantify mass transfer rates, and compare them with analytic solutions. We introduce scaling factors, including the overfilling factor, to render the problem dimensionless. The donor-star models are simplified, with either an isentropic initial stratification and adiabatic evolution or an isothermal structure and evolution, but the scalability of this formulation allows us to extend the results for a mass-transferring system to arbitrarily small overfilling factors for the adiabatic case. We find that the Coriolis force -- often neglected in analytic models -- strongly impacts the stream morphology: breaking axial symmetry, reducing the stream cross section, and shifting its origin toward the donor's trailing side. Contrary to common assumptions, the sonic surface is not flat and does not always intersect the Lagrangian point: instead, it is concave and shifted, particularly toward the accretor's trailing side. Despite these structural asymmetries, mass transfer rates are only mildly suppressed relative to analytic predictions and the deviation is remarkably small -- within a factor of two (ten) for the inner (outer) Lagrangian point over seven orders of magnitude in mass ratio. We use our results to extend the widely-used mass-transfer rate prescriptions by Ritter(1988) and Kolb&amp;Ritter(1990), for both the inner and outer Lagrangian points. These extensions can be readily adopted in stellar evolution codes like MESA, with minimal changes where the original models are already in use.</description>

      <title>Subgiants in NGC 188 Reveal that Rotationally Induced Mixing Creates the Main Sequence Li-Dip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The "Li-Dip" is an unexpected, striking, and highly non-standard anomaly of severe lithium depletion observed in mid-F dwarf stars, which has puzzled astronomers for nearly 40 years. Mechanisms proposed to explain the Li-Dip include effects related to rotation, magnetic fields, diffusion, gravity waves, and mass loss. The critical question became, which, if any, might be realistic? Here we show that mixing due to shear induced by stellar angular momentum loss is the unique mechanism driving the Li depletion. Each mechanism leaves a different signature in the subsurface Li distribution. The deepening surface convection zones of subgiants of NGC 188 evolving out of the Li-Dip dredge up the sub-surface material and thus reveal the signature of the responsible mechanism, rotation. Beryllium and boron data have also favored rotational mixing; however, these elements can be extremely difficult or impossible to observe. Our highly complementary approach provides fresh and very feasible perspectives on using Li to probe poorly understood physical mechanisms acting below the stellar surface, thereby improving fundamental understanding of stellar evolution. Rotational mixing may be the dominant mechanism that depletes Li in a wide range of Solar-type stars, including in the Sun. Possible connections to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis are discussed.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of oscillations for axisymmetric solar backgrounds with differential rotation and gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local helioseismology comprises of imaging and inversion techniques employed to reconstruct the dynamic and interior of the Sun from correlations of oscillations observed on the surface, all of which require modeling solar oscillations and computing Green's kernels. In this context, we implement and investigate the robustness of the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method in solving the equation modeling stellar oscillations for realistic solar backgrounds containing gravity and differential rotation. While a common choice for modeling stellar oscillations is the Galbrun's equation, our working equations are derived from an equivalent variant, involving less regularity in its coefficients, working with Lagrangian displacement and pressure perturbation as unknowns. Under differential rotation and axisymmetric assumption, the system is solved in azimuthal decomposition with the HDG method. Compared to no-gravity approximations, the mathematical nature of the wave operator is now linked to the profile of the solar buoyancy frequency N which encodes gravity, and leads to distinction into regions of elliptic or hyperbolic behavior of the wave operator at zero attenuation. While small attenuation is systematically included to guarantee theoretical well-posedness, the above phenomenon affects the numerical solutions in terms of amplitude and oscillation pattern, and requires a judicious choice of stabilization. We investigate the stabilization of the HDG discretization scheme, and demonstrate its importance to ensure the accuracy of numerical results, which is shown to depend on frequencies relative to N, and on the position of the Dirac source. As validations, the numerical power spectra reproduce accurately the observed effects of the solar rotation on acoustic waves.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved protoplanetary disk physics in DQ Tau with JWST</title>

Abstract: Accretion variability is ubiquitous in YSOs. While large outbursts may strongly affect the disk, the effects of moderate bursts are less understood. We aim to study the physical response of the disk around the eccentric binary system DQ Tau to its periodic accretion changes. We organized a multi-wavelength campaign centered on four JWST/MIRI spectra. We targeted three periastrons (high accretion state) and one apastron (quiescence). We used optical and near-infrared spectroscopy and photometry to measure how the accretion luminosity varies. We decomposed the multi-epoch SEDs into stellar, accretion, and rim components. We fitted the solid-state features using various opacity curves and the molecular features using slab models. We find the inner disk of DQ Tau to be highly dynamic. The temperature, luminosity, and location of the inner dust rim vary in response to the movement of stars and the L_acc variations. This causes variable shadowing of the outer disk, leading to an anti-correlation between the rim temperature and the strength of the silicate feature. The dust mineralogy remains constant, dominated by large amorphous olivine and pyroxene grains, with smaller fractions of crystalline forsterite. The excitation of CO (1550-2260 K), HCN (880-980 K), and hot H2O (740-860 K) molecules as well as the luminosity of the [NeII] line correlate with the accretion rate, while the warm (650 K) and cold (170-200 K) H2O components are mostly constant. CO emission, originating from a hot (&gt;1500 K) region likely within the dust sublimation radius, is most sensitive to L_acc changes. In comparison with other T Tauri disks, DQ Tau is highly C-poor and displays moderately inefficient pebble drift. We conclude that even moderate accretion rate changes affect the thermal structure in the planet-forming disk regions on short timescales, providing a crucial benchmark for understanding disk evolution.</description>

      <title>Attempting an accurate age estimate of the open cluster NGC 6633 using CoRoT and Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asteroseismology of solar-like oscillations in giant stars allow the derivation of their masses and radii. For members of open clusters, this provides an age of the cluster that should be identical to the one derived from the colour-magnitude diagram, but independent of the uncertainties that are present for that type of analysis. We aim to identify and measure the properties of giant members of the open cluster NGC6633, and combine these with asteroseismic measurements to derive a precise and self-consistent cluster age. Importantly, we wish to constrain the effects of rotational mixing on stellar evolution, since assumptions about internal mixing can have a significant impact on stellar age estimates. We identify five giant members of NGC6633 using photometry and Gaia data, supplemented by spectroscopic literature measurements. These are combined with asteroseismic measurements from CoRoT data and compared to stellar-model isochrones. This constrains the interior mixing to a low level and enables the most precise, accurate and self-consistent age estimate so far for this cluster. Asteroseismology of the giants and the cluster colour-magnitude diagram provide self-consistent masses of the giant members and their radii constrain the stellar interior mixing to a low level. The [C/N] ratios and Li abundances also suggest that rotation has had very little influence on the evolution of the stars in NGC 6633. This results in an age estimate of 0.55+0.05-0.10 Gyr for NGC6633. Four giant members appear to be in the helium-core burning evolutionary phase as also expected from evolutionary timescales. For the largest giant, the evidence remains inconclusive. A comparison to other age and mass estimates for the same stars in the literature uncovers biases for automated age estimates of helium-core burning stars.</description>

      <title>The fate of rotating massive stars across cosmic times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The initial mass and metallicity of stars both have a strong impact on their fate. Stellar axial rotation also has a strong impact on the structure and evolution of massive stars. In this study, we exploit the large grid of GENEC models, covering initial masses from 9 to 500 $M_{\odot}$ and metallicities ranging from $Z=10^{-5}$ (nearly zero) to 0.02 (supersolar), to determine the impact of rotation on their fate across cosmic times. Using the carbon-oxygen core mass and envelope composition as indicators of their fate, we predict stellar remnants, supernova engines, and spectroscopic supernova types for both rotating and non-rotating stars. We derive rates of the different supernova and remnant types considering two initial mass functions to help solve puzzles such as the absence of observed pair-instability supernovae. We find that rotation significantly alters the remnant type and supernova engine, with rotating stars favouring black hole formation at lower initial masses than their non-rotating counterparts. Additionally, we confirm the expected strong metallicity dependence of the fates with a maximum black hole mass predicted to be below 50 $M_{\odot}$ at SMC or higher metallicities. A pair-instability mass gap is predicted between about 90 and 150 $M_{\odot}$, with the most massive black holes below the gap found at the lowest metallicities. Considering the fate of massive single stars has far-reaching consequences across many different fields within astrophysics, and understanding the impact of rotation and metallicity will improve our understanding of how massive stars end their lives, and their impact on the universe.</description>

      <title>On the origin of V-shaped polarisation spectra in molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend previous theoretical works to gain a better understanding of the origin of observed polarisation degree spectra of molecular clouds, which show a so-called V-shape, i.e. a pronounced minimum around 350~$\mu$m. For this purpose, we present results of two-phase dust models investigated with POLARIS. We also provide a guideline to calculate individual dust temperatures for different grain types in POLARIS. We show that V-shaped polarisation spectra can only be obtained if two dust phases, one dense and cold as well as one warm and dilute phase, are present along the line of sight. We find that the V-shape is the stronger pronounced the larger the density and temperature contrast between both phases is. In contrast to previous results, no correlation between the alignment efficiency of silicate grains and the dust temperature is required; carbonaceous grains are in general assumed to be not aligned with the magnetic field. By matching our model results with actual observations of V-shaped polarisation spectra, we show that in UV-illuminated regions (here the warm and dilute phase) carbon grain destruction might take place. This leads to a more pronounced V-shape with a minimum around 300~$\mu$m. In addition, we show that the dust spectral index and temperature of silicate grains affects the steepness of the polarisation spectrum at long wavelengths. Finally, we present a first polarisation spectrum obtained from a 3D, magneto-hydrodynamical molecular cloud simulation. It shows a flattening or even weakly pronounced minimum around 350~$\mu$m demonstrating the potential of such complex 3D simulations to study polarisation spectra.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the nuclear models informed by PREX and CREX: a view from Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New measurements of the weak charge density distributions of $^{48}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb challenge existing nuclear models. In the post-PREX-CREX era, it is unclear if current models can simultaneously describe weak charge distributions along with accurate measurements of binding energy and charge radii. In this letter, we explore the parameter space of relativistic and non-relativistic models to study the differences between the electric and weak form factors, $\Delta F=F_{ch}-F_{W}$, in $^{48}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb. We show, for the first time, which aspects of mean-field models are the most important in determining the relative magnitude of the neutron skin in lead and calcium nuclei. We carefully disentangle the tension between the PREX-2/CREX constraints and the ability of the RMF and Skyrme models to accurately describe binding energies and charge radii. We find that the nuclear symmetry energy coefficient $S_V$ and the isovector spin-orbit coefficient $b'_4$ play different roles in determining $\Delta F$ of $^{48}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb. Consequently, adjusting $S_V$ or $b'_4$ shifts predicted $\Delta F$ values toward or away from PREX-2/CREX measurements. Additionally, $S_V$ and the slope L are marginally correlated given the prior constraints of our Bayesian inference, allowing us to infer them separately from PREX-2/CREX data.</description>

      <title>STag II: Classification of Serendipitous Supernovae Observed by Galaxy Redshift Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the number of supernovae observed expected to drastically increase thanks to large-scale surveys like the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), it is necessary that the tools we use to classify these objects keep up with this increase. We previously created Supernova Tagging and Classification (STag) to address this problem by employing machine learning techniques alongside logistic regression in order to assign 'tags' to spectra based on spectral features. STag II is a continuation of this work, which now makes use of model supernova spectra combined with real DESI spectra in order to train STag to better deal with realistic data. We also make use of the rlap score as a trustworthiness cut, making for a more robust and accurate supernova classifier than before.</description>

      <title>1000-10,000 M$_\odot$ Primordial Stars Created the Nitrogen Excess in GS 3073 at $z = 5.55$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04435v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope has revealed a wealth of new galaxies just a few hundred Myr after the Big Bang. Some of these galaxies exhibit unusual N/O ratios that are difficult to explain with stellar populations today. While Wolf-Rayet stars in multiple-burst populations, very massive or rapidly-rotating primordial stars, general relativistic explosions of metal-enriched supermassive stars, or the precursors of globular clusters can in principle account for the nitrogen excess in the galaxies GN-z11 and CEERS 1019, no known stars or supernovae can explain the far higher N/O ratio of 0.46 in GS 3073 at redshift $z =$ 5.55. Here we show that the extreme nitrogen abundances in GS 3073 can be produced by 1000 - 10,000 M$_{\odot}$ primordial (Pop III) stars. We find that these are the only candidates that can account for its large N/O ratios and its C/O and Ne/O ratios. GS 3073 is thus the first conclusive evidence in the fossil abundance record of the existence of supermassive Pop III stars at cosmic Dawn.</description>

      <title>ARCANE -- Early Detection of Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) are major drivers of space weather disturbances, posing risks to both technological infrastructure and human activities. Automatic detection of ICMEs in solar wind in situ data is essential for early warning systems. While several methods have been proposed to identify these structures in time series data, robust real-time detection remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present ARCANE - the first framework explicitly designed for early ICME detection in streaming solar wind data under realistic operational constraints, enabling event identification without requiring observation of the full structure. Our approach evaluates the strengths and limitations of detection models by comparing a machine learning-based method to a threshold-based baseline. The ResUNet++ model, previously validated on science data, significantly outperforms the baseline, particularly in detecting high-impact events, while retaining solid performance on lower-impact cases. Notably, we find that using real-time solar wind (RTSW) data instead of high-resolution science data leads to only minimal performance degradation. Despite the challenges of operational settings, our detection pipeline achieves an F1-Score of 0.37, with an average detection delay of 24.5% of the event's duration while processing only a minimal portion of the event data. As more data becomes available, the performance increases significantly. These results mark a substantial step forward in automated space weather monitoring and lay the groundwork for enhanced real-time forecasting capabilities.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the anti-glitch in PSR J1835$-$1106</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14755v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the detection of an anti-glitch with a fractional frequency change of $\Delta\nu/\nu=-3.46(6)\times10^{-9}$ in the rotation-powered pulsar PSR J1835$-$1106 at MJD 55813, based on timing observations collected with the Nanshan 26-m and Parkes 64-m radio telescopes from January 2000 to July 2022. A comparison of the average pulse profiles within $\pm300$ d of the event reveals no significant morphological changes. We also estimate the angular velocity lag between the normal and superfluid components at the time of the glitch, showing that one of the superfluid glitch models is incompatible with PSR J1835$-$1106 due to its insufficient spin-down rate and angular velocity lag. The wind braking scenario offers a viable alternative, consistent with the observed spin-down behavior, glitch amplitude, and post-glitch recovery. High-cadence, high-sensitivity monitoring of similar events is essential to distinguish between internal (superfluid) and external (wind-related) glitch mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Effect of symmetry energy on properties of rapidly rotating neutron stars and universal relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigated universal relations for compact stars rotating at the Keplerian (mass-shedding) limit, which is highly relevant for
  understanding the rapidly rotating objects formed in the aftermath of a neutron star-neutron star merger. Our analysis is based on a
  set of nucleonic equations of state (EoSs) featuring systematic variations in the symmetry energy slope parameter $L_{\rm sym}$ and the
  isoscalar skewness parameter $Q_{\rm sat}$, varied within ranges that are broadly consistent with current laboratory and astrophysical
  constraints. The global observable properties of isolated maximally rotating stars are examined, focusing on the mass-radius relation,
  moment of inertia, quadrupole moment, and the Keplerian (maximum) rotation frequency, as well as their variations in the
  $L_{\rm sym}$-$Q_{\rm sat}$ parameter space. Next, we demonstrate that, in the limit of Keplerian rotation, universal relations remain valid across
  the same set of EoSs characterized by varying $L_{\rm sym}$ and $\Qsat$. In particular, we present explicit results for the moment
  of inertia ($I$) and quadrupole moment ($Q$) as functions of compactness, as well as for the moment of inertia-quadrupole moment
  relation. All of these relations exhibit excellent universality, with deviations typically within a range from a few percent to 10\%
  across a wide range of parameters. Additionally, we verify for our set of EoSs that the universality of $I$-$Q$ holds to higher accuracy
  (at the level of 1\%) in the slow-rotation approximation compared with the Kepler limit, where the relative error increases up to $\lesssim
  10\%$. Our findings support the applicability of $I$-Love-$Q$-type universal relations in observational modeling of maximally rotating
  compact stars and the gravitational wave emitted by them.</description>
