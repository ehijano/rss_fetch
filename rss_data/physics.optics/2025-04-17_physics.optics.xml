      <title>Nonreciprocal and temperature-tunable light absorption in AlAs/ITO/GaAs Hybrid Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The single-band high-efficiency light absorption of nanostructures finds extensive applications in var ious fields such as photothermal conversion, optical sensing, and biomedicine. In this paper, a vertically stacked nanohybrid structure is designed with aluminum arsenide (AlAs), indium tin ox ide (ITO) and gallium arsenide (GaAs) stacked, and the photon absorption characteristics of this structure under near-infrared light at a single wavelength of 1240 nm are exploredbased on the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. When AlAs, ITO, and GaAs are stacked and incident light enters from the GaAs side, a local light enhancement phenomenon occurs. The absorption rate can reach 91.67%, and the temperature change rate reaches 55. 53%, allowing for a wide-range regulation the absorption rate by temperature. In addition, the AlAs/ITO/GaAs sandwich-type hybrid structure also exhibits obvious nonreciprocity. With the change in temperature, the absorption rate of different structural sizes varies differently. The structure can be optimized and designed according to the requirements, providing new ideas for the design of multifunctional optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Superoscillations in Space and Time in Nonseparable Light Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A remarkable phenomenon of superoscillations implies that electromagnetic waves can locally oscillate in space or time faster than the fastest spatial and temporal Fourier component of the entire function. This phenomenon allows to focus light into an arbitrary small hotspot enabling superresolution imaging and optical metrology with accuracy far beyond the Abbey-Reileigh diffraction limit. Here we show that, in band-limited supertoroidal light pulses, the temporal and spatial superoscillations can be observed simultaneously at a specific region in space and at a specific interval in time.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast laser high-aspect-ratio extreme nanostructuring of glass beyond {\lambda}/100</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultimate feature size is key in ultrafast laser material processing. A capacity to signiicantly exceed optical limits and to structure below 100nm is essential to advance ultrafast processing into the field of metamaterials. Such achievement requires to combine the control of optical near-fields and of material reactions, while preserving the exibility of long working distances, compatible with a mature laser process. Using sub-ps and ps non-diffractive Bessel beams, we demonstrate unprecedented feature sizes below a hundredth of the incident 1$\mu$m wavelength over an extended focus depth of tens of $\mu$m. Record features sizes, down to 7nm, result from self-generated near-field light components initiated by cavities induced by far-field radiation in a back-surface illumination geometry. This sustains the generation of more confined near-field evanescent components along the laser scan with nm pitch, perpendicular to the incident field direction, driving by local thermal ablation a super-resolved laser structuring process. The near-field pattern is replicated with high robustness, advancing towards a 10nm nanoscribing tool with a $\mu$m-sized laser pen. The process is controllable by the field orientation. The non-diffractive irradiation develops evanescent fields over the focusing length, resulting in a high aspect ratio trenching with nm section and $\mu$m depth. Higher energy doses trigger the self-organization of quasi-periodic patterns seeded by spatially modulated scattering, similarly to optical modelocking. A predictive multipulse simulation method validates the far-field-induced near-field electromagnetic scenario of void nanochannel growth and replication, indicating the processing range and resolution on the surface and in the depth.</description>

      <title>Single Complex-Frequency Resonance Mode in an Engineered Disordered Time-Varying Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a straightforward mechanism for achieving unique $k$-space resonance modes in one-dimensional time-varying cavities where periodic temporal modulation creates momentum band gaps through Floquet dynamics. By engineering the synergy between cavity resonance conditions and Floquet mode formation in photonic time crystals, we demonstrate the emergence of a single dominant momentum state that exhibits remarkable robustness against temporal disorder. Through analytical modeling and numerical verification, we show that the interplay between time-varying medium and cavity boundary conditions leads to amplification of specific waves followed by spatial mode selection. This engineered resonance mechanism enables insensitivity to initial wave source configuration and strong temporal disorder immunity. Our findings give a simple mechanism for exploiting narrow momentum bandgaps, and establish a foundation for developing high-quality temporal cavity lasers and advancing extreme temporal predictability in time-modulated systems.</description>

      <title>Phase field model of Coulomb explosion damage in solid induced by ultrashort laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much experimental evidence reveals that Coulomb explosion governs non-thermal material removal under femtosecond or even shorter laser pulses, and non-thermal laser damage has been a topic widely discussed. Nevertheless, there is still no continuum mechanical model capable of describing the evolution of such damage. In this study, we develop a model that characterizes solid damage through a phase field variable governed by Allen-Cahn dynamics. The parameter of the model is defined by a conceptual mechanism: during Coulomb explosion, electron pressure surpasses the interatomic barrier potential, dissociates material from the solid surface as small equivalent particles and resulting in localized damage. The numerical simulation validates the model's availability and demonstrate its ability to predict damage morphology under varying laser conditions. This work advances the understanding of non-thermal ablation and provides a tool for optimizing ultrafast laser processing.</description>

      <title>Arrayed waveguide gratings in lithium tantalate integrated photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arrayed Waveguide Gratings (AWGs) are widely used photonic components for splitting and combining different wavelengths of light. They play a key role in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems by enabling efficient routing of multiple data channels over a single optical fiber and as a building block for various optical signal processing, computing, imaging, and spectroscopic applications. Recently, there has been growing interest in integrating AWGs in ferroelectric material platforms, as the platform simultaneously provide efficient electro-optic modulation capability and thus hold the promise for fully integrated WDM transmitters. To date, several demonstrations have been made in the X-cut thin-film lithium niobate ($\mathrm{LiNbO}_3$) platform, yet, the large anisotropy of $\mathrm{LiNbO}_3$ complicates the design and degrades the performance of the AWGs. To address this limitation, we use the recently developed photonic integrated circuits (PICs) based on thin-film lithium tantalate ($\mathrm{LiTaO}_3$), a material with a similar Pockels coefficient as $\mathrm{LiNbO}_3$ but significantly reduced optical anisotropy, as an alternative viable platform. In this work, we manufacture $\mathrm{LiTaO}_3$ AWGs using deep ultraviolet lithography on a wafer-scale. The fabricated AWGs feature a channel spacing of 100 GHz, an insertion loss of &lt; 4 dB and crosstalk of &lt; -14 dB. In addition, we demonstrate a cyclic AWG, as well as a multiplexing and demultiplexing AWG pair for the first time on $\mathrm{LiTaO}_3$ platform. The wafer-scale fabrication of these AWGs not only ensures uniformity and reproducibility, but also paves the way for realizing volume-manufactured integrated WDM transmitters in ferroelectric photonic integrated platforms.</description>

      <title>Seeing Beyond Dark-Field RGB Capabilities: Deep Spectral Extrapolation of Ultrasmall Plasmonic Nanogaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localized surface plasmons can confine light within a deep-subwavelength volume comparable to the scale of atoms and molecules, enabling ultrasensitive responses to near-field variations. On the other hand, this extreme localization also inevitably amplifies the unwanted noise from the response of local morphological imperfections, leading to complex spectral variations and reduced consistency across the plasmonic nanostructures. Seeking uniform optical responses has therefore long been a sought-after goal in nanoplasmonics. However, conventional probing techniques by dark-field (DF) confocal microscopy, such as image analysis or spectral measurements, can be inaccurate and time-consuming, respectively. Here, we introduce SPARX, a deep-learning-powered paradigm that surpasses conventional imaging and spectroscopic capabilities. In particular, SPARX can batch-predict broadband DF spectra (e.g., 500-1000 nm) of numerous nanoparticles simultaneously from an information-limited RGB image (i.e., below 700 nm). It achieves this extrapolative inference beyond the camera's capture capabilities by learning the underlying physical relationships among multiple orders of optical resonances. The spectral predictions only take milliseconds, achieving a speedup of three to four orders of magnitude compared to traditional spectral acquisition, which may take from hours to days. As a proof-of-principle demonstration for screening identical resonances, the selection accuracy achieved by SPARX is comparable to that of conventional spectroscopy techniques. This breakthrough paves the way for consistent plasmonic applications and next-generation microscopies.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast switching of telecom photon-number states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A crucial component of photonic quantum information processing platforms is the ability to modulate, route, convert, and switch quantum states of light noiselessly with low insertion loss. For instance, a high-speed, low-loss optical switch is crucial for scaling quantum photonic systems that rely on measurement-based feed-forward approaches. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast all-optical switching of heralded photon-number states using the optical Kerr effect in a single-mode fiber. A local birefringence is created by a high-intensity pump pulse at a center wavelength of 1030nm that temporally overlaps with the 1550nm photon-number states in the fiber. By taking advantage of the dispersion profile of commercially available single-mode fibers, we achieve all-optical switching of photon-number states, with up to 6 photons, with a switching resolution of 2.3ps. A switching efficiency of &gt;99% is reached with a signal-to-noise ratio of 32,000.</description>

      <title>Reentrant phase transition in quasiperiodic photonic waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anderson transition in quasiperiodic potentials and the associated mobility edges have been a central focus in quantum simulation across multidisciplinary physical platforms. While these transitions have been experimentally observed in ultracold atoms, acoustic systems, optical waveguides, and superconducting junctions, their interplay between quasiperiodic potential and long-range hopping remains unexplored experimentally. In this work, we report the observation of localization-delocalization transition induced by the hopping between the next-nearest neighboring sites using quasiperiodic photonic waveguides. Our findings demonstrate that increasing the next-nearest hopping strength induces a reentrant phase transition, where the system transitions from an initially extended phase into a localized phase before eventually returning to an extended phase. This remarkable interplay between hopping and quasiperiodic potential in the lattice models provides crucial insights into the mechanism of Anderson transition. Furthermore, our numerical simulation reveals that this phase transition exhibits a critical exponent of $\nu \simeq 1/3$, which is experimentally observable for system sizes $L\sim10^3$ - $10^4$. These results establish a framework for direct observation of the Anderson transition and precise determination of its critical exponents, which can significantly advance our understanding of localization physics in quasiperiodic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shallow water waves are a striking example of nonlinear hydrodynamics, giving rise to phenomena such as tsunamis and undular waves. These dynamics are typically studied in hundreds-of-meter-long wave flumes. Here, we demonstrate a chip-scale, quantum-enabled wave flume. The wave flume exploits nanometer-thick superfluid helium films and optomechanical interactions to achieve nonlinearities surpassing those of extreme terrestrial flows. Measurements reveal wave steepening, shock fronts, and soliton fission -- nonlinear behaviors long predicted in superfluid helium but never previously directly observed. Our approach enables lithography-defined wave flume geometries, optomechanical control of hydrodynamic properties, and orders of magnitude faster measurements than terrestrial flumes. Together, this opens a new frontier in hydrodynamics, combining quantum fluids and nanophotonics to explore complex wave dynamics at microscale.</description>

      <title>Hopf Exceptional Points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points at which eigenvalues and eigenvectors of non-Hermitian matrices coalesce are ubiquitous in the description of a wide range of platforms from photonic or mechanical metamaterials to open quantum systems. Here, we introduce a class of Hopf exceptional points (HEPs) that are protected by the Hopf invariants (including the higher-dimensional generalizations) and which exhibit phenomenology sharply distinct from conventional exceptional points. Saliently, owing to their $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant related to the Witten anomaly, three-fold HEPs and symmetry-protected five-fold HEPs act as their own ``antiparticles". Furthermore, based on higher homotopy groups of spheres, we predict the existence of multifold HEPs and symmetry-protected HEPs with non-Hermitian topology captured by a range of finite groups (such as $\mathbb{Z}_3$, $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, or $\mathbb{Z}_{24}$) beyond the periodic table of Bernard-LeClair symmetry classes.</description>

      <title>Separating orders of response in transient absorption and coherent multi-dimensional spectroscopy by intensity variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpretation of time-resolved spectroscopies such as transient absorption (TA) or two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy often relies on the perturbative description of light-matter interaction. In many cases the third order of nonlinear response is the leading and desired term. When pulse amplitudes are high, higher orders of light-matter interaction can both distort lineshapes and dynamics and provide valuable information. Here, we present a general procedure to separately measure the nonlinear response orders in both TA and 2D spectroscopies, using linear combinations of intensity-dependent spectra. We analyze the residual contamination and random errors and show how to choose optimal intensities to minimize the total error in the extracted orders. For an experimental demonstration, we separate the nonlinear orders in the 2D electronic spectroscopy of squaraine polymers up to 11$^{th}$ order.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a novel concept for measuring time-varying electric field transients of petahertz-scale photons down to a single-photon regime. We observe a clear transition from classical to quantum nature of light that agrees with our Monte Carlo model. We reach unprecedented yoctojoule-level sensitivity and a dynamic range exceeding 90 decibels. We utilize this capability to measure time-dependent intrapulse light coherence - a regime inaccessible to conventional, time-averaged spectroscopy. This opens new avenues for quantum information, cryptography, and quantum light-matter interactions on sub-cycle time scales with attosecond precision.</description>

      <title>Coherent frequency combs from electrons colliding with a laser pulse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Highly coherent and powerful light sources capable of generating soft x-ray frequency combs are essential for high precision measurements and rigorous tests of fundamental physics. In this work, we derive the analytical conditions required for the emission of coherent radiation from an electron beam colliding with a laser pulse, modeled as a plane wave. These conditions are applied in a series of numerical simulations, where we show that a soft x-ray frequency comb can be produced if the electrons are regularly spaced and sufficiently monoenergetic. High quality beams of this kind may be produced in the near future from laser-plasma interactions or linear accelerators. Furthermore, we highlight the advantageous role of employing few-cycle laser pulses in relaxing the stringent monoenergeticity requirements for coherent emission. The conditions derived here can also be used to optimize coherent emission in other frequency ranges, such as the terahertz domain.</description>

      <title>Superfluorescent upconversion nanoparticles as an emerging second generation quantum technology material</title>

Abstract: Superfluorescence (SF) in lanthanide doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) is a room-temperature quantum phenomenon, first discovered in 2022. In a SF process, the many emissive lanthanide ions within a single UCNP are coherently coupled by an ultra-short (ns or fs) high-power excitation laser pulse. This leads to a superposition of excited emissive states which decrease the emissive lifetime of the UCNP by a factor proportional to the square of the number of lanthanide ions which are coherently coupled. This results in a dramatic decrease in UCNP emission lifetime from the microsecond regime to the nanosecond regime. Thus SF offers a tantalizing prospect to achieving superior upconversion photon flux in upconversion materials, with potential applications such as imaging and sensing. This perspective article contextualizes how SF-UCNPs can be regarded as a second generation quantum technology, and notes several challenges, opportunities, and open questions for the development of SF-UCNPs.</description>

      <title>Transverse orbital angular momentum: setting the record straight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24375v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of the transverse orbital angular momentum (tOAM) associated with spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) pulses has been the subject of recent debate. We demonstrate that the approaches to tOAM presented in several recent papers are incorrect and lead to unphysical results, including erroneous claims of zero total tOAM. We emphasize the importance of calculating the OAM of any extended physical object at a common instant of time, and reemphasize the special status of the centre of energy as a reference point for all OAM calculations. The theory presented in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193901 (2021)] is the only correct classical field-based framework that both agrees with experiments and provides a self consistent understanding of transverse OAM in spatiotemporal light fields.</description>

      <title>Infrared Phonon Thermoreflectance in Polar Dielectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate dielectric materials for thermoreflectance-based thermal sensing by extracting key optical parameters using temperature-dependent spectroscopic ellipsometry in the mid-infrared regime. Leveraging optical phonon resonances, we demonstrate that the thermoreflectance coefficients in polar dielectrics rival, and in some cases exceed by an order of magnitude, those observed in commonly used metals that are typically used as temperature transducers in thermoreflectance measurements. We introduce a transducer figure of merit (FOM) that combines pump absorption and probe reflectance modulation at different wavelengths. Our findings reveal that materials such as sapphire and aluminum nitride can outperform metals by up to two orders of magnitude. These results position dielectric materials as compelling candidates for next-generation thermal metrology, broadening the design space for optical thermometry, with strong implications for high-resolution thermal mapping and characterization of layered device structures based on phonon probing.</description>

      <title>Multi-channel Single-Pixel Imaging for a Composite Motion Target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-pixel imaging (SPI) exhibits cost-effectiveness, broad spectrum, and stable sub-Nyquist sampling reconstruction, enabling applications across diverse imaging fields.However, due to the inherent reconstruction mechanism, SPI is not well-suited for high-speed moving targets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel, universal SPI configuration for tracking and imaging moving objects.Unlike traditional motion compensation methods, our approach enables the recovery of targets undergoing arbitrary motion, including translation, rotation, periodic, or non-periodic movements, within a two-dimensional plane without increasing the number of modulation frames.By leveraging the centroid positions from multiple wavelength channels, we determine the target's motion state from a kinematic perspective. Moreover, we developed an adapted reconstruction method, the (P-IT) pseudo-inverse transformation method, which allows for the efficient reconstruction of objects with composite motion. With a maximum flip rate of 20 kHz for the digital micromirror device (DMD), the theoretical perception frame rate can reach up to 2222 Hz, comparable to that of conventional motion-compensated SPI for purely translational objects.</description>

      <title>Bloch phonon-polaritons with anomalous dispersion in polaritonic Fourier crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently suggested concept of a polaritonic Fourier crystal (PFC) is based on a harmonically-corrugated mirror substrate for a thin pristine polaritonic crystal layer. The propagating polaritons in PFC experience a harmonic and mode-selective momentum modulation leading to a manifestation of Bloch modes with practically zero inter-mode scattering. PFC was first demonstrated for the hyperbolic phonon-polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) within its Type II Reststrahlen band (RB-II) where the in-plane components of the dielectric permittivity tensor are isotropic and negative, while the out-of-plane component is positive. By contrast, a Type I Reststrahlen band (RB-I) is characterized by negative out-of-plane and positive in-plane permittivity components, and consequently, the inversion of field symmetry of phonon-polaritons compared to RB-II. Behavior of such RB-I modes in a polaritonic crystal is yet to be explored. Here, we employ a biaxial crystal alpha-phase molybdenum trioxide ({\alpha}-MoO3) and near-field imaging to study polaritonic Bloch modes in a one-dimensional PFC within the RB-I where the mid-infrared phonon-polaritons in {\alpha}-MoO3 have anomalous dispersion and negative phase velocity. Surprisingly, we observe a manifestation of Bloch waves as a dispersionless near-field pattern across the first Brillouin zone, in contrast to RB-II case demonstrated with in-plane isotropic hBN. We attribute this difference to the opposite field symmetry of the lowest-order phonon-polariton mode in the two RBs, leading to a different momentum modulation regime in the polaritonic Fourier crystal. Our results reveal the importance of mode symmetry for polaritonic crystals in general and for the emerging field of Fourier crystals in particular, which promise new ways to manipulate the nanolight.</description>
