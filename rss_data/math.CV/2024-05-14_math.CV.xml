      <title>On estimation of Hankel determinants for certain class of starlike functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, we consider two subclasses starlike and convex functions, denoted by $\mathcal{S}_{\mathcal{B}}^{*}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{B}}$ respectively, associated with a bean-shaped domain. Further, we estimate certain sharp initial coefficients, as well as second, third and fourth-order Hankel determinants for functions belonging to the class $\mathcal{S}_{\mathcal{B}}^{*}$. Additionally, we compute sharp second and third-order Hankel determinants for functions belonging to the $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{B}}$ class.</description>

      <title>New criteria for starlikeness in the unit disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that the condition ${\operatorname{Re}} \left[1+\frac{zf''(z)}{f'(z)}\right]&gt;0$, $z\in{\mathbb D}$, implies that $f$ is starlike function (i.e. convexity implies starlikeness). If the previous condition is not satisfied for every $z\in {\mathbb D}$, then it is possible to get new criteria for starlikeness by using $\left|\arg\left[\alpha+\frac{zf''(z)}{f'(z)}\right]\right|$, $z\in{\mathbb D}$, where $\alpha&gt;1.$</description>

      <title>Toeplitz operators on the proper images of bounded symmetric domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a bounded symmetric domain in $\mathbb C^n$ and $f :\Omega \to \Omega^\prime$ be a proper holomorphic mapping factored by (automorphisms) a finite complex reflection group $G.$ We define an appropriate notion of the Hardy space $H^2(\Omega^\prime)$ on $\Omega^\prime$ which can be realized as a closed subspace of an $L^2$-space on the \v{S}ilov boundary of $\Omega^\prime$. We study various algebraic properties of Toeplitz operators (such as the finite zero product property, commutative and semi-commutative property etc.) on $H^2(\Omega^\prime)$. We prove a Brown-Halmos type characterization for Toeplitz operators on $H^2(\Omega^\prime),$ where $\Omega^\prime$ is an image of the open unit polydisc in $\mathbb C^n$ under a proper holomorphic mapping factored by an irreducible finite complex reflection group.</description>

      <title>On the subadditivity of generalized Kodaira dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goals of this paper are of two aspects. Firstly, we introduce the notion of generalized numerical Kodaira dimension with multiplier ideal sheaf and establish the subadditivity inequalities in terms of this notion, which can be used to give an analytic proof of O. Fujino's result on the subadditivity of the log Kodaira dimensions. Secondly, motivated by Zhou-Zhu's subadditivity of generalized Kodaira dimensions, we adopt another definition of generalized Kodaira dimension with multiplier ideal sheaf and show they are equal by using Okounkov bodies. As one application, we show that the superadditivity part in Zhou-Zhu's setting also holds true. As another application, we give an alternative proof of Zhou-Zhu's subadditivity formula, in the case when the singular metric $h_L$ has analytic singularities, by using generalized Iitaka fibrations.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous CR-manifold in $\mathbb{C}^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study holomorphically homogeneous model submanifolds CR-type (1, 3) complex space $\mathbb C^4$. One finds moduli space of five-dimensional model surfaces Bloom-Graham type ((2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)). It is shown that there exists unique model surface of this type with property of holomorphical homogeneous, which is equivalent to tube surface $\mathcal C$ with affin homogeneous base. One describes and classifies with respect to model surfaces the orbits relative to the group of holomorhical automorphisms of $\mathcal C$</description>

      <title>An infinite dimensional balanced embedding problem III: Asymptotics near infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our study on the logarithmic balanced model metric initiated in our previous work. By a non-trivial refinement of the set of tools developed in our previous work, we are able to confirm partially a conjecture we made in our previous work on the asymptotic behavior of the balanced metric near infinity.</description>

Abstract: We propose a way to connect complex analysis and convex analysis. As applications, we derive some results about $L^2$-estimate for $d$-equation and prove some curvature positivity related to convex analysis from well known $L^2$-estimate for $\bar\partial$-equation or the results we prove in complex analysis.</description>

      <title>Quaternionic Cartan coverings and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the topological foundation for solvability of Multiplicative Cousin problems formulated on an axially symmetric domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb H.$ In particular, we provide a geometric construction of quaternionic Cartan coverings, which are generalizations of (complex) Cartan coverings as presented in Section 4 of [FP]. Because of the requirements of symmetry inherent to the domains of definition of quaternionic regular functions, the existence of quaternionic Cartan coverings of $\Omega$ is not a consequence of existence of complex Cartan coverings, because for the latter there are no requirements for the symmetries with respect to the real axis. Due to the special role of the real axis, also the covering restricted to $\Omega \cap \mathbb R$ has to have additional properties. All these required properties were achieved by starting from a particular symmetric tiling of the symmetric set $\Omega \cap (\mathbb R + i\mathbb R)$. Finally we provide an application of these results to prove the vanishing of 'antisymmetric' cohomology groups of planar symmetric domains for $n \geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Mahler's problem and Turyn polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mahler's problem asks for the largest possible value of the Mahler measure, normalized by the $L_2$ norm, of a polynomial with $\pm1$ coefficients and large degree. We establish a new record value in this problem exceeding $0.95$ by analyzing certain Turyn polynomials, which are defined by cyclically shifting the coefficients of a Fekete polynomial by a prescribed amount. It was recently established that the distribution of values over the unit circle of Fekete polynomials of large degree is effectively modeled by a particular random point process. We extend this analysis to the Turyn polynomials, and determine expressions for the asymptotic normalized Mahler measure of these polynomials, as well as for their normalized $L_q$ norms. We also describe a number of calculations on the corresponding random processes, which indicate that the Turyn polynomials where the shift is approximately $1/4$ of the length have Mahler measure exceeding $95\%$ of their $L_2$ norm. Further, we show that these asymptotic values are not disturbed by a small change to make polynomials having entirely $\pm1$ coefficients, which establishes the result on Mahler's problem.</description>

      <title>Slow-growing counterexamples to the strong Eremenko Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $f\colon\mathbb{C} \to\mathbb{C}$ be a transcendental entire function. In 1989, Eremenko asked the following question concerning the set $I(f)$ of points that tend to infinity under iteration: can every point of $I(f)$ be joined to $\infty$ by a curve in $I(f)$? This is known as the strong Eremenko conjecture and was disproved in 2011 by Rottenfu{\ss}er, R\"uckert, Rempe and Schleicher. The function has relatively small infinite order: it can be chosen such that $\log \log \,\lvert f(z)\rvert = (\log \lvert z\rvert)^{1+o(1)}$ as $f(z)\to \infty$. Moreover, $f$ belongs to the \emph{Eremenko--Lyubich class $\mathcal{B}$}. Rottenfu{\ss}er et al also show that the strong Eremenko conjecture does hold for any $f\in\mathcal{B}$ of finite order. We consider how slow a counterexample $f\in\mathcal{B}$ can grow. Suppose that $\Theta\colon [t_0,\infty)\to [0,\infty)$ satisfies $\Theta(t) \to 0$ and \[ (\log t)^{-\beta \Theta(\log t)}/\Theta(t) \to 0 \quad\text{ as $t\to \infty$} \] for some $0&lt;\beta&lt;1$, along with a certain regularity assumption. Then there exists a counterexample $f\in\mathcal{B}$ as above such that \[ \log \log \vert f(z)\vert = O ( (\log \vert z \vert)^{1 + \Theta( \log \vert z \vert )}) \] as $\vert f(z)\vert \to\infty$. The hypotheses are satisfied, in particular, for $\Theta(t) = 1/(\log \log t)^{\alpha}$, for any $\alpha&gt;0$.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we establish an $L^2$ extension theorem for Nakano semi-positive singular Hermitian metrics on holomorphic vector bundles, and the strong openness and stability properties of the multiplier submodule sheaves associated to Nakano semi-positive singular Hermitian metrics on holomorphic vector bundles.
  We solve affirmatively a question of Lempert on the preservation of Nakano semi-positivity under limit of an increasing metrics based on Deng-Ning-Wang-Zhou's characterization of Nakano positivity.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study the integral means spectrum (IMS) functionals on Teichmuller spaces. We show that the IMS functionals on the closure of the universal Teichmuller space and on the asymptotic universal Teichmuller space are both continuous. During the proof, we obtain some new results about the universal asymptotic Teichmuller space.</description>

      <title>Mappings of finite distortion on metric surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate basic properties of mappings of finite distortion $f:X \to \mathbb{R}^2$, where $X$ is any metric surface, i.e., metric space homeomorphic to a planar domain with locally finite $2$-dimensional Hausdorff measure. We introduce lower gradients, which complement the upper gradients of Heinonen and Koskela, to study the distortion of non-homeomorphic maps on metric spaces. We extend the Iwaniec-\v{S}ver\'ak theorem to metric surfaces: a non-constant $f:X \to \mathbb{R}^2$ with locally square integrable upper gradient and locally integrable distortion is continuous, open and discrete. We also extend the Hencl-Koskela theorem by showing that if $f$ is moreover injective then $f^{-1}$ is a Sobolev map.</description>

      <title>The Riemann hypothesis and dynamics of Backtracking New Q-Newton's method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new variant of Newton's method -- named Backtracking New Q-Newton's method (BNQN) -- was recently introduced by the second author. This method has good convergence guarantees, specially concerning finding roots of meromorphic functions. This paper explores using BNQN for the Riemann xi function. We show in particular that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to that all attractors of BNQN lie on the critical line. We also explain how an apparent relation between the basins of attraction of BNQN and Voronoi's diagram can be helpful for verifying the Riemann hypothesis or finding a counterexample to it. Some illustrating experimental results are included, which convey some interesting phenomena. The experiments show that BNQN works very stably with highly transcendental functions like the Riemann xi function and its derivatives. Based on insights from the experiments, we discuss some concrete steps on using BNQN towards the Riemann hypothesis. Ideas and results from this paper can be extended to other zeta functions.</description>
