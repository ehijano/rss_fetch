      <title>Phase transitions in a holographic superfluid model with non-linear terms beyond the probe limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the holographic s-wave superfluid model with 4th and 6th power self-interaction terms $\lambda |\psi|^4$ and $\tau |\psi|^6$ with considering the full back-reaction of the matter fields on the metric in the 3+1 dimensional bulk. The self-interaction terms are good at controlling the condensate to realize various phase transitions, such as the zeroth-order, first-order, and second-order phase transitions within the single condensate s-wave superfluid model. Therefore, in this work, we are able to investigate the influence of the back-reaction strength on the various phase transitions, including the zeroth and first order phase transitions. In addition, we confirm that the influence of the 4th and 6th power terms on the superfluid phase transition in the case of finite back-reaction are qualitative the same as in the probe limit, thus present universality. We also plot the special value $\lambda_s$ of the parameter $\lambda$ at different back-reaction strength, below which the condensate grows to an opposite direction and is important in controlling the order of the superfluid phase transitions. Comparing the influence of the back-reaction parameter and that of the higher-order nonlinear coefficients, we see that the back-reaction strength brings in both the effective couplings similar to the 4th power and 6th power terms.</description>

      <title>The MORRIS Experiment: Magnetic Levitation as a New Probe of Non-Newtonian Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MORRIS (Magnetic Oscillatory Resonator for Rare-Interaction Studies) and propose the first tabletop search for non-Newtonian gravity due to a Yukawa-like fifth force using a magnetically levitated particle. Our experiment comprises a levitated sub-millimeter magnet in a superconducting trap that is driven by a time-periodic source. Featuring short-, medium-, and long-term stages, MORRIS will admit increasing sensitivities to the force coupling strength $\alpha$, optimally probing screening lengths of $\lambda \sim 1\,\mathrm{mm}$. Our short-term setup provides a proof-of-principle study, with our medium- and long-term stages respectively constraining $\alpha \lesssim 10^{-4}$ and $\alpha \lesssim 10^{-5}$, leading over existing bounds. Our projections are readily recastable to concrete models predicting the existence of fifth forces, and our statistical analysis is generally applicable to well-characterized sinusoidal driving forces. By leveraging ultralow dissipation and heavy test masses, MORRIS opens a new window onto tests of small-scale gravity and searches for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first calculation of the high-energy corrections to the process of isolated photon production in association with two jets. These corrections both stabilise the perturbative behaviour in $m_{j_1j_2}$ and lead to a significantly improved description of data from a recent ATLAS measurement.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Cold QCD: Review and Future Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review examines data from hadron-nucleus collisions, primarily focusing on hard processes like Drell-Yan, heavy flavor and quarkonium production. It highlights observed modifications of particle yields as functions of momentum and rapidity, aiming to clarify the underlying QCD effects in cold nuclear matter (CNM). The paper outlines strategies for future experiments, including the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), to distinguish between these effects. Key questions address the universality of suppression mechanisms and the role of non-perturbative physics, providing a road map for upcoming nuclear data.</description>

      <title>Doubly charged Higgs boson at same-sign lepton colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the search for doubly charged Higgs bosons in the Georgi-Machacek (GM) model at same-sign lepton colliders. The dominant production mode is vector boson fusion, through which the particle is singly produced and decays into a pair of same-sign $W$ bosons if the triplet vacuum expectation value is sufficiently large, as allowed in the GM model. Considering the leptonic decays of the $W$ bosons, we discuss the discovery reach of the signal and a method to extract the mass of the doubly charged Higgs boson. It is impossible to construct the transverse mass of the decay product to obtain the mass because of the neutrinos radiated from the initial-state leptons. Alternatively, we propose to make use of the invariant mass of the same-sign leptons. We perform $\chi^2$ fitting using the analytical formula for the invariant mass distribution and demonstrate that this approach is effective in extracting the information on the mass. We also compare the process with pair production processes at the opposite-sign lepton colliders.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Waves as Complementary Probe of Dark Matter Indirect Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel cosmological probe of dark matter (DM) through inflationary primordial gravitational wave (GW) measurements highlighting its complementarity with traditional indirect detection. In scenarios like early matter domination (EMD), the thermal DM relic is diluted and then replenished via non-thermal production, leaving characteristic imprints on the primordial GW spectrum, inducing frequency-dependent suppressions in the GW amplitudes. By analysing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and employing Fisher forecast, we show that upcoming GW experiments have good potential to probe the DM parameter space involving its mass and annihilation cross-section. We show, for instance, LISA will be sensitive to DM mass range $[2\times 10^2-10^5]$ GeV. Furthermore, we identify a significant overlap of the GW missions' sensitivity reaches with the projected reach of future indirect searches like CTA with gamma rays, ANTARES, KM3NeT with neutrinos. In those overlapping regions of interests, we forecast on the GW experiments to estimate the precision of measurements. We show, for instance, that DM mass of $10^5$ GeV with an annihilation cross-section of $10^{-24}~{\rm cm}^3{\rm /s}$, and a mass of $10^4$ GeV with an annihilation cross-section of $2\times10^{-25}~{\rm cm}^3{\rm /s}$, lie within the projections of CTA. We find that whilst the former can be probed by ET with $\sim 1\%$ uncertainties, the latter can be probed by $\mu$-ARES with $\sim 7 \%$ uncertainties. Similarly, DM mass of $10^5$ GeV, with cross-section $10^{-23}~{\rm cm}^3{\rm /s}$ lies within the projection of ANTARES and KM3NeT, which can be probed by ET with $\sim 1\%$ uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Implications of recent $\left(g-2\right)_{\mu}$ measurements for MeV-GeV dark sector searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent theoretical and experimental studies of the muon magnetic moment indicate the absence of the previously reported discrepancy, providing a vital opportunity to constrain potential BSM physics. In this work, we explore the MeV-GeV mass range, where existing exclusion limits remain relatively loose. We analyze both scalar and pseudoscalar as well as vector and axial vector mediators. We demonstrate that the new bounds are not only comparable to - but in several cases, significantly more stringent than - the constraints obtained from previous collider experiments, even when near-future projections are considered.</description>

      <title>System size dependence of charged hadrons directed flow at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV using a multi-phase transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The directed flow ($v_1$) of charged hadrons ($h^{\pm}$) in symmetric collision systems (O+O, Cu+Cu, Zr+Zr, Ru+Ru, Au+Au, and U+U) at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} =$ 200 GeV using string-melting version of A Multiphase Transport (AMPT-SM) model is reported. The $v_1$ as a function of pseudo-rapidity ($\eta$) is obtained for transverse momentum ($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) ranges of 0.2-2.0 GeV/$c$ and 2.0-5.0 GeV/$c$. The dependence of $v_1$-slope ($dv_1/d\eta$) at mid-rapidity on $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ range, collision centrality, and system size are discussed particularly in the context of the hard-soft asymmetry in the flow profiles of produced particles. In the AMPT-SM model, a system size independence of the magnitude of $dv_1/d\eta$ between Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at low-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ is observed, and this finding is similar to the observation from the STAR experiment at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} =$ 200 GeV. In contrast, a strong centrality and system size dependence, with the opposite sign of $dv_1/d\eta$, is found for the high-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ charged hadrons. The AMPT-SM model demonstrates a clear violation of the expected scaling of charged hadrons $(dv_1/d\eta)/A^{1/3}$ across different colliding systems.</description>

      <title>Imaging the charge distributions of flavor-symmetric and -asymmetric mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the internal structure of a comprehensive set of pseudoscalar and vector mesons, including both flavor-symmetric and flavor-asymmetric systems, by reconstructing their charge distributions from electromagnetic form factors. To achieve this, we employ a Maximum Entropy Method optimized for charge distributions, utilizing previously published form factor data obtained within the Dyson-Schwingers and Bethe-Salpeter equations framework. Furthermore, we calculate the average distance between the valence quark and antiquark that constitute the meson, interpreting it as an estimate for both the meson's spatial size and the typical range of quark motion. Our results reveal that this distance for the lightest quarkonia is approximately five times larger than that for the heaviest. Moreover, due to spin effects, vector mesons exhibit sizes that are 5-15\% larger than their pseudoscalar counterparts.</description>

      <title>Lepton flavor violating top quark FCNC at the $\mu$TRISTAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate charged lepton flavor violating top quark flavor-changing neutral current interactions at the proposed asymmetric muon-electron collision stage of the $\mu$TRISTAN collider, operating at a center-of-mass energy of 346 GeV. Specifically, we study the process $\mu^{+} e^{-} \rightarrow t q$ ($t \overline{q} + \overline{t}q$) with $q = u, c$, within the framework of three classes of four-fermion contact interactions: scalar, vector, and tensor operators. A cut-based analysis is performed using boost-invariant kinematic observables, followed by a likelihood-based statistical treatment to derive projected sensitivities for each operator. For an integrated luminosity of $100~\text{fb}^{-1}$, the projected constraints improve upon current LHC bounds on the corresponding effective couplings by approximately an order of magnitude. Projections for $1~\text{ab}^{-1}$ indicate even stronger sensitivity, indicating improved reach at higher luminosity. Additionally, we explore the impact of initial-state beam polarization on these projections, showing how it can further enhance sensitivity to specific operator structures.</description>

      <title>Determination of $|V_{\rm cb}|$ using Bayesian analysis of the $B \rightarrow D^{*}\ell {\bar \nu}_\ell$ semileptonic decay width with four-loop QCD corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $|V_{\rm cb}|$ is an important Standard Model parameter, whose value can be determined by using the semi-leptonic decay $B\rightarrow D^{*}\ell{\bar \nu}_\ell$. The perturbative QCD (pQCD) corrections to the $B \to D^{*}$ transform form factor ${\cal F}(w)$ has been known up to the N$^3$LO level, whose magnitude remains sensitive to the choice of renormalization scale $\mu_r$. To improve the precision of ${\cal F}(w)$ and hence $|V_{\rm cb}|$, we first apply the single-scale approach of Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC) to eliminate the conventional (Conv.) renormalization scale dependence of the short-distance parameter $\eta_A$ and then predict the contribution of its unknown N$^4$LO term via Bayesian analysis. In this paper, we adopt two probabilistic models for Bayesian analysis: the Cacciari-Houdeau model (CH model) and the geometric behavior model (GB model). It is shown that by using the PMC series in combination with Bayesian analysis, one can achieve high degree of reliability in estimating unknown higher-order terms. A more convergent behavior is achieved by applying the PMC, confirmed by the predicted N$^4$LO contributions: for the CH model, $\eta_A|_{\rm Conv.}^{\rm N^4LO}=\{-0.0032,+0.0052\}$ and $\eta_A|_{\rm PMC}^{\rm N^4LO}=\{-0.0004,+0.0004\}$; for the GB model, $\eta_A|_{\rm Conv.}^{\rm N^4LO}=\{-0.0049,+0.0075\}$ and $\eta_A|_{\rm PMC}^{\rm N^4LO}=\{-0.0007,+0.0007\}$. Comparing with the latest experimental measurements, we obtain $|V_{\rm cb}||_{\rm PMC}=(40.58^{+0.53}_{-0.57})\times10^{-3}$, which is consistent for both CH and GB models and in good agreement with the PDG world average, $|V_{\rm cb}|_{\rm PDG}=(41.1\pm1.2)\times10^{-3}$ within errors.</description>

      <title>The Scotogenic Model with Two Inert Doublets: Parameters Space and Electroweak Precision Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study a scotogenic extension of the Standard Model featuring two inert scalar doublets and three singlet Majorana fermions, where neutrino masses are generated radiatively at one loop. The lightest among the Majorana fermions and neutral scalars can serve as dark matter candidates. We explore the parameter space, considering theoretical constraints (perturbativity, unitarity, vacuum stability) and experimental limits (lepton flavor violation, Higgs measurements, electroweak precision observables). Our analysis identifies regions where sizable Yukawa couplings naturally arise due to constructive interference in the scalar sector. Additionally, we estimate the oblique parameters, finding that only $\Delta T$ is sensitive to charged mass splittings, while $\Delta S$ and $\Delta U$ remain small across the viable parameter space. However, 60\% of the viable parameter space is excluded by the recent CMS measurement of the $W$ boson mass, since the shift $\Delta M_W$ depends on the oblique parameters, particularly $\Delta T$ that is sensitive to scalar mass splittings.</description>

      <title>Hadronic decays of possible pseudoscalar $P$-wave $D\bar{D}^\ast/\bar{D}D^\ast$ molecular state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the new structure $G(3900)$ observed by the BESIII collaboration in the $e^+e^-\to D\bar{D}$ was identified to be the $P$-wave $D\bar{D}^\ast/\bar{D}D^\ast$ vector molecular resonance using a unified meson exchange model. Apart from the vector $P$-wave state, a possible pseudoscalar $P$-wave molecular state of the $D\bar{D}^\ast/\bar{D}D^\ast$ (called $G_0(3900)$ for short) was also predicted, which is likely to be observed in the future experiments. Within the molecular framework, we calculated the partial decay widths for a series of hadronic decays of the $G_0$, including $G_0\to \omega(\rho^0) J/\psi $, $\pi^+\pi^- \eta_c (1S)$, $\pi^+\pi^- \chi_{c1} (1P)$, and $D^0\bar{D}^0\pi^0$. Under present model parameters, the hidden-charm decay modes are dominated by the $G_0\to\omega J/\psi$ and $G_0\to\pi^+\pi^-\eta_c (1S)$, and the partial widths can reach 1 MeV and 0.1 MeV, respectively. The open-charm channel $G_0\to D^0\bar{D}^0\pi^0$ exhibit a rather small decay rate ($\sim 0.1~\mathrm{keV}$). In terms of our present predictions, we suggest BESIII and Belle II to search for the pseudoscalar $P$-wave $D\bar{D}^\ast / \bar{D}D^\ast$ molecular state with $J^{PC} = 0^{-+}$ in the hidden-charm processes $e^+e^-\to \omega J/\psi$ or $e^+e^-\to \pi^+\pi^-\eta_c(1S)$.</description>

      <title>Existence of nuclear modifications on longitudinal-transverse structure function ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been assumed that nuclear modification does not exist in the longitudinal-transverse structure function ratio $R_N=F_L^N/(2xF_1^N)$ in lepton deep inelastic scattering. This assumption is widely used in obtaining structure functions of the ``nucleon" from nuclear data such as the deuteron ones. However, nuclear modifications do exist theoretically at least at medium- and large-$x$ regions because nucleons in a nucleus move in any direction, which is not necessary the longitudinal direction of the virtual-photon or weak-boson momentum in lepton scattering. Because of this transverse motion, the nucleon's transverse and longitudinal structure functions should mix with each other in nuclei with the mixture probability proportional to the nucleon's transverse momentum squared $\vec p_T^{\,\, 2}/Q^2$. In this work, numerical results are explicitly shown on such nuclear modifications in the deuteron. These nuclear modifications are important for determining precise structure functions of the nucleon. Furthermore, modifications of $R_N$ should be investigated also at small $x$ by the future electron-ion collider to find interesting gluon dynamics in nuclei. Hopefully, this nuclear effect on $R_N$ could be found by future experimental measurements at lepton accelerator facilities.</description>

      <title>The fine structure constant: a review of measurement results and possible space-time variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A brief description of the main methods for determining the fine structure constant is given. It is shown that the exact value of the fine structure constant is important for the new International System of Units (SI) and for fundamental metrology. Recent measurement results and theoretical calculations of the fine structure constant, as well as its possible space-time variations, are presented. The results of laboratory experiments on the search for long-term variations of the fine structure constant are described. The astrophysical and cosmological observational data on possible variability of the fine structure constant are displayed. The possibility of slightly lower values of the fine structure constant in the remote past as compared to its modern value, as well as the existence of unresolved problems related to possible space-time variations of the fine structure constant and the spread of the results of its precise laboratory measurements, are mentioned. Despite the absence of experimentally confirmed long-term variations of the fine structure constant at a high level of accuracy, possible practical applications of the results are noted, namely, the construction of an optical frequency standard with high stability and frequency reproduction accuracy based on the ytterbium-171 ion and a laser frequency synthesizer which may replace the caesium frequency standard.</description>

      <title>Jet Reconstruction with Mamba Networks in Collider Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel end-to-end framework for jet reconstruction in high-energy collider events, leveraging the efficiency and long-range modeling capabilities of the Mamba architecture. Our model unifies instance segmentation, classification, and kinematic regression into a single multi-task learning system, enabling a sophisticated multi-level reconstruction that simultaneously identifies primary heavy jets ($t$, $H$, $W/Z$) and their constituent sub-jets. To facilitate supervised learning for this complex task, we develop a novel method for assigning final-state hadrons to their ancestor colored partons using a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming solver, which generates high-fidelity ground-truth labels. The model achieves high classification accuracy, with an Average Precision score of 0.569 for $W/Z$-jets and 0.568 for $b$-jets, and shows exceptional precision in kinematic reconstruction. Furthermore, we show that the model not only maintains stable performance in high-pileup environments but also successfully reconstructs the mass peaks of beyond the standard model particles. This work presents a powerful and versatile new tool for comprehensive event reconstruction at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Simplifying Strangeness Fluctuations through Balance Functions in Proton-Proton Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements of event-by-event fluctuations of multistrange baryons and kaons in proton-proton collisions by ALICE have been proposed as sensitive probes to distinguish between thermal and string-based hadronization mechanisms. We demonstrate that two key observables -- the normalized net-$\Xi$ second-order cumulant and the net-$K$--net-$\Xi$ Pearson correlation coefficient -- can be re-expressed in terms of balance function integrals, thereby revealing their underlying microscopic content, and relating them to balance functions previously measured by ALICE. This allows us to show that both observables probe the same physics and primarily measure the impact of strangeness conservation on hadronization. We compare both sets of ALICE data with two contrasting models, PYTHIA and Thermal-FIST. Importantly, while Thermal-FIST can reproduce the magnitude of fluctuation observables, it fails to describe the shape of the measured balance functions. Our findings highlight the importance of balance functions as precision tools for testing hadronization models in small collision systems and propose a robust baseline for future studies exploring hadronization dynamics in QCD matter.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Electroweak Supersymmetry from the Generalized Minimal Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the Electroweak Supersymmetry (EWSUSY) scenario within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) under the Generalized Minimal Supergravity (GmSUGRA) framework, given that the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon may now be consistent with the Standard Model (SM) prediction, we consider both signs of the Higgsino mass parameter, $\mu &lt; 0$ and $\mu &gt; 0$. A comprehensive scan of the parameter space is performed, subject to the experimental constraints from the LHC SUSY searches, Planck 2018 relic density, and LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) direct detection limits. We identify the viable regions featuring neutralino dark matter production via coannihilation with stau, chargino, stop, sbottom, and gluino, as well as through $A$-funnel, Higgs-resonance, and $Z$-resonance mechanisms. Notably, the $\mu &lt; 0$ scenario yields a broader allowed parameter space, including for the first time sbottom-neutralino coannihilation solutions in GmSUGRA, which are absent for $\mu &gt; 0$. While the Higgs-pole and $Z$-pole regions for $\mu &gt; 0$ are largely excluded by the current LZ bounds, substantial viable regions remain for $\mu &lt; 0$. Gluino coannihilation scenarios are strongly constrained by the current LHC data. The characteristic mass ranges of interest include sbottoms (0.7-1.3~TeV), stops (up to 1.0~TeV for $\mu &gt; 0$ and 1.3~TeV for $\mu &lt; 0$), staus and charginos (up to 1.5~TeV), and pseudoscalar Higgs bosons in the $A$-funnel (0.4-1.4~TeV). Moreover, the supersymmetric contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment remain within a $2\sigma$ deviation from the SM prediction. And our findings suggest that significant portions of the parameter space can be probed at the future LHC SUSY searches and upcoming dark matter direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Z and Higgs Factory Implications of Two Higgs Doublets with First-Order Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of future electron-positron colliders, such as FCC-ee and CEPC, to probe 2-Higgs-doublet models (2HDMs) that facilitate a strong first-order electroweak phase transition (SFOEWPT), a necessary condition for electroweak baryogenesis. Focusing on a 2HDM in the CP-conserving limit, we identify parameter regions consistent with an SFOEWPT and evaluate their compatibility with projected precision electroweak and Higgs measurements, as well as searches for exotic Higgs bosons. We show that radiative corrections to $e^+e^-\to hZ$ production introduce deviations in the cross section that are resolvable with the anticipated sub-percent precision at lepton colliders even when experimental outcomes of the LHC and $Z$ pole measurements are in agreement with the SM. This underscores the opportunities of a precision lepton collider to explore BSM quantum corrections to the Higgs sector more broadly.</description>

      <title>Search for dark-matter axions beyond the quantum limit: the Cosmological Axion Sarov Haloscope (CASH) proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Firmly established in astrophysical observations, dark matter evades direct detection in experiments. Axions and axion-like particles are among the leading dark-matter candidates, and numerous attempts to detect them in laboratories have been performed. Here, we propose to advance these efforts substantially, extending the sensitivity for dark-matter axions in the mass range $(38-54)~\mu$eV down to the axion-photon couplings $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\lesssim \left(10^{-14}-10^{-15}\right)$ GeV$^{-1}$, motivated by generic models of Quantum Chromodynamics axion. Single-photon detectors operating at ultra-low temperatures are key elements of the experiment. The projected sensitivity will be reached in one year of data taking with magnetic field of $(1-10)$ T, making Cosmological Axion Sarov Haloscope (CASH) the most sensitive haloscope in this mass range.</description>

      <title>A hybrid nonet with $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ or a tetraquark 81-plet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confirming the existence of hybrid states remains challenging due to their experimental indistinguishability from tightly bound tetraquarks and loosely bound molecules. To address this issue, we employ QCD sum rules to systematically investigate the $\pi_1(1600)$ and $\eta_1(1855)$ as candidate tetraquark states with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC} = 1^{-+}$. Within the hybrid framework, an $SU(3)$ flavor nonet is expected, featuring two isoscalar configurations, $q\bar{q}g$ and $s\bar{s}g$, where $q = u/d$. In contrast, the tetraquark scenario predicts an $SU(3)$ flavor 81-plet comprising three isoscalar states: $qq\bar{q}\bar{q}$, $qs\bar{q}\bar{s}$, and $ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$. Our analysis yields a mass of $2.22^{+0.18}_{-0.26}$ GeV for the $ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$ tetraquark state, which is expected to decay predominantly into the $\phi\phi$ and $\eta f_1(1420)$ final states. Therefore, experimental scrutiny of their invariant mass spectra is pivotal for distinguishing between hybrid and tetraquark interpretations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the complete one-loop corrected Higgs mass within the Standard Model. It is crucial to identify the observable mass as the renormalized one that depends on the external momentum. The correction is finite and dominated by the loops involving W bosons, Z boson and top quark. These contributions exhibit a power-law running with momentum, which may be verifiable at the Large Hadron Collider.</description>

      <title>Saddle-point method for resummed form factors in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the form factor appearing in QCD resummation formalism for event shape distributions in the two-jet (or Sudakov) region. We present an analytic formula for the inverse transform of the form factor, namely from the conjugate moment space to the (physical) momentum space, based on the saddle-point method. The saddle-point itself is determined by means of an analytic recursion method as well as by standard numerical methods. The results we have found are in very good agreement with the exact (numerical) evaluation of the inverse transform, while they significantly differ from classical analytical formulations of resummation in momentum space. The latter are based on a Taylor expansion of the form factor around the free-theory saddle point.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic polarizabilities of the spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ baryons in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory (HB$\chi$PT), a non-relativistic effective field theory that treats baryons as heavy static sources, to calculate the electromagnetic polarizabilities of spin-3/2 baryons in two sectors: the light-flavor decuplet baryons and singly heavy sextet baryons. We derive the analytical expressions up to $\mathcal{O}\left(p^3\right)$. Our results indicate that the long-range chiral corrections provide substantial contributions to the polarizabilities. In addition, magnetic dipole (M1) transitions of the baryons can significantly affect the magnetic polarizabilities and may even reverse their signs. For the decuplet baryons, the $\Delta^+$ and $\Delta^0$ exhibit the largest electric polarizabilities. Their values, $\alpha_E(\Delta^+) = (17.4 \pm 9.5)\times 10^{-4} \, \mathrm{fm}^3$ and $\alpha_E(\Delta^0) = (16.9 \pm 9.2)\times 10^{-4} \, \mathrm{fm}^3$, significantly exceed those typically observed for nucleons. Meanwhile, the electric polarizabilities of spin-3/2 singly heavy baryons are comparable to those of their spin-1/2 partners.</description>

Abstract: Non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) is used to calculate the relativistic correction to the amplitude for exclusive photoproduction of vector Quarkonia in the near-threshold region within the generalized parton distribution (GPD) framework. The relativistic corrections are found to be large for $J/\psi$. Cross-sections for both $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ are calculated with the former being compared to the data. We also demonstrate the presence of endpoint divergences for the relativistic correction away from the near-threshold regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a causality analysis on the dispersion relation of hydrodynamics with spin well as shear and bulk viscosity, including the relaxation times for all these quantities. We find that the interplay of the three relaxational scales, for shear and bulk viscosity as well as polarization, leads to non-trivial effects on the dispersion relation. Unexpectedly, the presence of polarization leads to lower effective viscosity and a longer relaxation time, and the presence of viscosity leads to lower limits as well as upper ones on the group velocity and constraints relating polarization to viscosity relaxation times. We conclude with a qualitative discussion on how these results impact phenomenology, specifically the low effective viscosity in strongly interacting matter as well as shear-vorticity coupling.</description>

      <title>Qumode Tensor Networks for False Vacuum Decay in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: False vacuum decay in scalar quantum field theory (QFT) plays a central role in cosmology and particle physics but has remained intractable for classical simulation due to its non-perturbative, highly entangled dynamics. We present a novel method for Hamiltonian simulation of false-vacuum decay in a self-interacting scalar QFT, based on a spatial discretisation into a lattice of bosonic modes. Each mode has a continuous or quasi-continuous local Hilbert space whose dimension is large enough to capture the self-interactions in the Hamiltonian. We refer to these local modes generically as ``qumodes'', echoing the ideal case in which the lattice would be realised on a continuous-variable quantum computer. Here we show that the same framework can be implemented on a tensor network, in which case the qumodes are quasi-continuous, corresponding to the local sites of the network having a very high dimensional Hilbert space. Using a time-evolving block decimation algorithm with Trotterised time evolution, we capture the real-time dynamics of the scalar field. In (1+1)-dimensions, we initialise a metastable vacuum and observe the coherent entanglement growth that seeds true-vacuum bubble nucleation. Our approach establishes the qumode network as a scalable framework for non-equilibrium scalar QFT phenomena and paves the way for higher-dimensional studies and continuous-variable quantum computing implementations.</description>

      <title>Standardizing a larger, higher-quality, homogeneous sample of reverberation-mapped H$\beta$ active galactic nuclei using the broad-line region radius-luminosity relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a high-quality, homogeneous sample of 157 H$\beta$ reverberation-mapped active galactic nuclei (RM AGNs) spanning redshifts $0.00308 \leq z \leq 0.8429$, which is approximately 3.8 times larger than the previously available high-quality homogeneous sample. Using the broad-line region radius$-$luminosity relation ($R-L$), which involves the broad H$\beta$ line time delay and the monochromatic luminosity at 5100\,\AA\,, we show that the sample is standardizable by using six spatially flat and nonflat cosmological models. The inferred cosmological model parameters are consistent within 2$\sigma$ uncertainties with those from better established baryon acoustic oscillation and Hubble parameter measurements, with the exception of two nonflat models that are ruled out by other data. The $R-L$ relation slope is found to be flatter ($\gamma=0.428 \pm 0.025$ in the flat $\Lambda$CDM model) than the slope expected from a simple photoionization model as well as the slope found previously for the smaller homogeneous sample. In addition, we find a mild dependence of H$\beta$ $R-L$ relation parameters as well as its intrinsic scatter on the Eddington ratio by comparing the $R-L$ relations for low- and high-accreting equal-sized subsamples. A future analysis of a larger homogeneous sample containing a broader range of luminosities and Eddington ratios is necessary to confirm the standardizability of H$\beta$ AGNs.</description>

      <title>Dark Bondi Accretion Aided by Baryons and the Origin of JWST Little Red Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravothermal core collapse of self-interacting dark matter halos provides a compelling mechanism for seeding supermassive black holes in the early Universe. In this scenario, a small fraction of a halo, approximately $1\%$ of its mass, collapses into a dense core, which could further evolve into a black hole. We demonstrate that this process can account for the origin of JWST little red dots (LRDs) observed at redshifts $z\sim4-11$, where black holes with masses of $10^7{\rm\,M_\odot}$ can form within $500{\rm\,Myr}$ after the formation of host halos with masses of $10^{9}{\rm\,M_\odot}$. Even if the initial collapse region triggering general-relativistic instability has a mass on the order of one solar mass, the resulting seed can grow into an intermediate-mass black hole via Eddington accretion of baryonic gas. Subsequently, it can continue to grow into a supermassive black hole through dark Bondi accretion of dark matter particles. In this scenario, the majority of the black hole's mass originates from dark matter accretion rather than baryonic matter, naturally explaining the overmassive feature of LRDs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study analyzes an 11-year cosmic ray dataset of positrons and antiprotons for planetary dependencies related to gravitationally focused dark matter streams. By projecting event timestamps onto planetary heliocentric longitudes, structured flux modulations are found. The results resemble previously reported planetary relationships in solar and terrestrial observables. This supports the possibility that streaming dark matter particles are focused toward Earth by solar system bodies, including the Moon. The findings suggest further searches using other cosmic ray channels, including existing very high-energy gamma ray data.</description>

      <title>Imaging nuclear shape through anisotropic and radial flow in high-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most atomic nuclei exhibit ellipsoidal shapes characterized by quadrupole deformation $\beta_2$ and triaxiality $\gamma$, and sometimes even a pear-like octupole deformation $\beta_3$. The STAR experiment introduced a new "imaging-by-smashing" technique [arXiv:2401.06625, arXiv:2501.16071] to image the nuclear global shape by colliding nuclei at ultra-relativistic speeds and analyzing outgoing debris. Features of nuclear shape manifest in collective observables like anisotropic flow $v_n$ and radial flow via mean transverse momentum $[p_T]$. We present new measurements of the variances of $v_n$ ($n=2$, 3, and 4) and $[p_T]$, and the covariance of $v_n^2$ with $[p_T]$, in collisions of highly deformed $^{238}$U and nearly spherical $^{197}$Au. Ratios of these observables between these two systems effectively suppress common final-state effects, isolating the strong impact of uranium's deformation. Comparing results with state-of-the-art hydrodynamic model calculations, we extract $\beta_{2U}$ and $\gamma_{U}$ values consistent with those deduced from low-energy nuclear structure measurements. Measurements of $v_3$ and its correlation with $[p_T]$ also provide the first experimental suggestion of a possible octupole deformation for $^{238}$U. These findings provide significant support for using high-energy collisions to explore nuclear shapes on femtosecond timescales, with broad implications for both nuclear structure and quark-gluon plasma studies.</description>

      <title>Investigating QED Effects on the Thin Accretion Disk Properties Around Rotating Euler-Heisenberg Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Einstein Euler Heisenberg (EEH) black hole model represents an extension of classical black hole solutions in general relativity by incorporating quantum electrodynamic (QED) corrections. These corrections are introduced through the inclusion of the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian, which accounts for the nonlinear effects of QED in the presence of strong electromagnetic fields. This study investigates the observational properties of a thin accretion disk surrounding the electrically charged rotating EEH black hole. By exploring the influence of the spin parameter and charge on key dynamical quantities such as the energy, angular momentum, angular velocity, and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of a test particle it becomes possible to analyze the radiative flux, temperature distribution, and differential luminosity of the thin accretion disk in the spacetime of the charged rotating EEH black hole. The results are compared to those of Kerr and Kerr Newman black holes in General relativity, revealing that QED corrections are found to increase the ISCO radius. Specifically, for a fixed electric charge, an increasing spin parameter leads to a larger ISCO radius compared to the standard Kerr black holes as a result of additional electromagnetic corrections introduced by the Euler Heisenberg theory. Conversely, when the spin parameter is held constant, an increase in the electric charge reduces the ISCO radius. Additionally, thin accretion disks around charged EEH rotating black holes exhibit higher temperatures and greater efficiency when the spin parameter is fixed and the electric charge is increased.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Simulation of Rotating Nuclei using Quantum Variational Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum variational algorithms (QVAs) are becoming increasingly potent tools for simulating quantum many-body systems, in particular, on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. The application of QVAs, more especially the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), to schematic model simulation is examined in this work. The cranked Nilsson-Strutinsky (CNS) framework serves as a foundation for comprehending high-spin phenomena in deformed nuclei. Using single-particle level spacings, pairing correlations, cranking (rotational) terms, and particle-number conservation, we build five increasingly complex CNS-like models. Quantum-classical hybrid procedures are used to solve these Hamiltonians after mapping them to qubit operators. Key metrics such as ground state energy, angular momentum expectation values $J_x$, and entanglement entropy are used to compare the results to exact diagonalization (ED). With variational errors typically $&lt;0.005$, our results show agreement in energy and angular momentum predictions. Notably, we find slight variances in entanglement entropy between the ED and VQE results, which are influenced by numerical precision and ansatz expressivity. These results open the door to investigating larger, more realistic CNS-type systems through more expressive ansatz and validate the use of variational quantum algorithms in modelling rotational nuclear structure.</description>

      <title>Radiatively Corrected Starobinsky Inflation and Primordial Gravitational Waves in Light of ACT Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonminimal coupling between the inflaton and the Ricci scalar plays a crucial role in shaping the predictions of single-field inflationary models. While a quartic potential with such coupling represents one of the simplest realizations compatible with cosmological observations, it generically receives important radiative corrections when the inflaton interacts with other fields, particularly those involved in the reheating process. In this work, we focus on radiative corrections arising from bosonic scalar couplings and study their impact on inflationary dynamics within the nonminimally coupled quartic potential framework. We demonstrate that bosonic corrections, unlike fermionic ones, yield predictions more compatible with the latest constraints from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6, especially when combined with Planck and BICEP/Keck data. We begin with a general model involving a gauge-singlet real scalar inflaton coupled to a complex scalar field, which could be the Standard Model Higgs or a GUT Higgs. As a concrete realization, we also investigate the case where the inflaton serves as a dark matter candidate through a Higgs portal interaction while highlighting its potential to generate observable levels of primordial gravitational waves. Notably, the nonminimally coupled inflation model studied here is field-theoretically equivalent to the Starobinsky model, and the inclusion of quantum corrections from scalar fields leads to characteristic imprints in the $(n_s, r)$ plane, allowing for refined constraints on scalar couplings from current and future observations.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Horizons at the Edge of Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What if supersymmetry is not something to be hidden, but something to be reached? We introduce the Supersymmetric Horizon Stabilization (SHS): a conceptually unified and analytically controlled framework for embedding metastable de Sitter vacua and trans-Planckian inflation within effective $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity. Built from a logarithmic K\"ahler potential modified by nilpotent constraints, SHS yields a framework that connects the early universe's inflationary phase, intermediate metastable acceleration, and a final supersymmetric fixed point.
  We classify all viable models by imposing four essential criteria: absence of ghosts, de Sitter metastability, smooth Minkowski transitions, and asymptotic supersymmetry. The resulting scalar dynamics exhibit exponential field-space profiles, $\tau(\varphi) \sim e^{-\Delta\varphi}$, reconciling trans-Planckian excursions with bounded moduli. This structure ensures finite geodesic distance, stabilizes the gravitino mass, and suppresses light towers -- evading both the Gravitino and Swampland Distance Conjectures. Meanwhile, the divergent Euclidean cost of reaching the supersymmetric endpoint realizes the AdS and Generalized Swampland Distance Conjectures, confirming that the infrared boundary lies at infinite dynamical distance despite controlled scalar evolution.
  From this behavior emerges the Supersymmetric Horizon Conjecture: that consistent gravitational EFTs may begin and end with supersymmetry -- both at the origin and the asymptotic edge of cosmic evolution -- not as a fine-tuned remnant, but as a geometric boundary condition. SHS also supports localized features that transiently enhance scalar fluctuations, enabling efficient production of primordial black holes with masses far exceeding those in conventional inflationary scenarios.</description>

      <title>Self-Interacting Dark-Matter Spikes and the Final-Parsec Problem: Bayesian constraints from the NANOGrav 15-Year Gravitational-Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A self-interacting dark-matter (SIDM) density spike around merging supermassive black holes (SMBHs) may be able to supply the dynamical friction needed to shrink binaries from $\sim 1\, \mathrm{pc}$ to $\sim 10^{-2} \,\mathrm{pc}$, thereby resolving the long-standing ``final-parsec problem.'' Embedding the binary-halo system in a cosmological population model, we evolve the inspiral under the combined influence of gravitational-wave (GW) emission and SIDM drag, compute the resulting nanohertz GW background, and confront it with the NANOGrav 15 year pulsar-timing data. A six-parameter Bayesian analysis, performed with a Gaussian-process-accelerated Markov chain Monte Carlo, yields posterior constraints on the cross-section per unit mass and maximum circular velocity values that were consistent with independent galaxy-rotation and cluster-lensing limits. Within this parameter space, the SIDM spike remains intact, supplies sufficient friction to overcome the stellar depletion barrier, and produces a characteristic-strain spectrum that matches the NANOGrav signal as well as phenomenological astrophysical models.</description>

Abstract: The false vacuum decay rate is of important meaning in understanding the Universe, such as the symmetry breaking process in the early universe and the age of our universe, which is conventionally calculated with the saddle-point approximation in the field theory. Utilizing the extension of the Wigner function in quantum field theory, we numerically calculate the decay rate of the false vacuum through path integral. We study the decay rate for the thermal fluctuation scenarios and its dependence on the potential shape, and found that the false vacuum decay occurs following an exponentially decay rate, and the speed of vacuum decay decreases when the initial energy of the system decreases and the potential height increase. The discrepancy between the simulation results and the theoretical prediction of finite temperature effective field theory is observed.</description>

Abstract: We consider the monodromy group of the differential systems for multiloop integrals. We describe a simple heuristic method to obtain the monodromy matrices as functions of space-time dimension $d$. We observe that in a special basis the elements of these matrices are Laurent polynomials in $z=\exp(i\pi d)$ with integer coefficients, i.e., the monodromy group is a subgroup of $GL(n,\mathbb{Z}[z,1/z])$. We derive bilinear relations for monodromies in $d$ and $-d$ dimensions which follow from the twisted Riemann bilinear relations and check that the found monodromy matrices satisfy them.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Sign-Reversal: Non-Parametric Reconstruction of Interacting Dark Energy with DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A direct interaction between dark energy and dark matter provides a natural and important extension to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We perform a non-parametric reconstruction of the vacuum energy ($w=-1$) interacting with cold dark matter using the cosmological data from DESI DR2, Planck CMB, and three SNIa samples (PP, DESY5, and Union3). By discretizing the coupling function $\beta(z)$ into 20 redshift bins and assuming a Gaussian smoothness prior, we reconstruct $\beta(z)$ without assuming any specific parameterization. The mean reconstructed $\beta(z)$ changes sign during cosmic evolution, indicating an energy transfer from cold dark matter to dark energy at early times and a reverse flow at late times. At high redshifts, $\beta(z)$ shows a $\sim 2\sigma$ deviation from $\Lambda$CDM. At low redshifts, the results depend on the SNIa sample: CMB+DESI and CMB+DESI+PP yield $\beta(z)$ consistent with zero within $2\sigma$, while CMB+DESI+DESY5 and CMB+DESI+Union3 prefer negative $\beta$ at $\sim2\sigma$. Both $\chi^2$ tests and Bayesian analyses favor the $\beta(z)$ model, with CMB+DESI DR2+DESY5 showing the most significant support through the largest improvement in goodness of fit ($\Delta\chi^2_{\rm MAP}=-17.76$) and strongest Bayesian evidence ($\ln\mathcal{B} = 5.98 \pm 0.69$). Principal component analysis reveals that the data effectively constrain three additional degrees of freedom in the $\beta(z)$ model, accounting for most of the improvement in goodness of fit. Our results demonstrate that the dynamical dark energy preference in current data can be equally well explained by such a sign-reversal interacting dark energy, highlighting the need for future observations to break this degeneracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter are investigated by the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (RBHF) theory with the covariant chiral nuclear forces up to the next-to-leading order~(NLO). A fitting scheme to ensure the naturalness of the low-energy constants is proposed, which plays a crucial role in the proper description of nuclear matter. With a momentum cutoff $\Lambda=590$ MeV, the empirical saturation energy and density, as well as the incompressibility coefficient at the saturation density are reproduced well. The EoSs show less dependence on the momentum cutoff and become softer at densities above saturation density, in comparison with the previous leading order results. Given the good description for the saturation properties of nuclear matter, the present work encourages future studies of the finite nuclei in the framework of the RBHF theory with the NLO covariant chiral nuclear forces.</description>

Abstract: We numerically investigate the stability of universal properties at continuous phase transitions against perturbations of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm used to simulate the system. We consider the three dimensional XY model as test bed, and both local (single site Metropolis) and global (single cluster) updates, introducing deterministic truncation-like perturbations and stochastic perturbations in the acceptance probabilities. In (almost) all the cases we find a remarkable stability of the universal properties, even against large perturbations of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, with critical exponents and scaling curves consistent with those of the standard XY model within statistical uncertainties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new observable to probe the collective nature of the radial expansion of the quark-gluon plasma. This observable, dubbed $v_{02}(p_T)$, represents the correlation of the spectrum with elliptic flow, in the same way as the recently measured $v_0(p_T)$ represents the correlation of the spectrum with the transverse momentum per particle. The advantage of $v_{02}(p_T)$ over $v_0(p_T)$ is that it is measured using a three-particle cumulant, as opposed to a pair correlation, which significantly reduces the sensitivity to nonflow effects. We predict non-trivial differences between $v_{02}(p_T)$ and $v_0(p_T)$ in semi-central Pb+Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) on the basis of hydrodynamic simulations. A hint of these differences can be seen in the modification of $p_T$ spectra observed by ALICE in event-shape-engineered events a decade ago.</description>

      <title>UrQMD Simulations of Higher-order Cumulants in Au+Au Collisions at High Baryon Density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High moments of conserved quantities such as net-baryon, net-electric charge, and net-strangeness in heavy-ion collisions are sensitive to fluctuations caused by the QCD critical point (CP). The event-by-event analysis of high moments of the conserved charges has been widely used in experiments to search for the CP, especially in the RHIC-STAR experiment.
  In order to establish a {\it dynamical non-critical base line}, especially at the high baryon density region, we have performed a systematic analysis of the proton multiplicity distributions from Au+Au collisions at 3 $\leq$ $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ $\leq$ 9.2 GeV collisions. The results on beam energy, centrality and rapidity width dependence of proton (factorial) cumulants, up to the $4^{th}$ order, are extracted from the calculations of the hadronic transport model UrQMD. In addition, the effects of initial volume fluctuation is also discussed. These results will be important when we do physics analysis the RHIC beam energy scan (BES) data, especially for the fixed-target data and experimental data from future CBM experiment at FAIR.</description>

      <title>Testing the Lense-Thirring Precession Origin of the QPO in Swift J1727.8$-$1613</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive spectral and timing analysis of the newly discovered black hole transient Swift J1727.8$-$1613, based on broadband (2$-$150 keV) observations from $Insight$-HXMT during its 2023 outburst. We use the flexible, energy-conserving SSsed model to model both the outer disc and inner, complex Comptonisation, using the expected disc emissivity to constrain the inner disc radius, $r_{cor}$. This decreases from 45 $R_{\rm g}$ to 9 $R_{\rm g}$ duing the transition from the hard to hard intermediate and then soft intermediate state. We plot $r_{cor}$ versus the centroid frequency of the strong quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs; $\nu_{\rm c}$) seen in these data to test the inner hot flow Lense-Thirring (LT) precession model. The overall slope of the observed trend is in strong agreement with the predictions of LT precession, despite the complexities of accretion behavior, though there is an offset in absolute value which may indicate that the system parameters are still not well determined. The inner radius of the hot flow is consistent with a constant value throughout most of the outburst, indicating that changes in the jet (e.g. the discrete ejections) do not strongly affect the radiated power. Either the jet kinetic power is not a large fraction of the accretion power or the jet is instead mostly powered by the spin energy of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Matter effects on flavor transitions of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos based on typical propagation schemes</title>

Abstract: Precise measurements of the flavor ratio of high energy astronomical neutrinos (HANs) would be promising in the following decades. Then matter effects and new physics effects on the flavor transition of HANs could be tested. In this paper, we examine matter effects on the flavor composition of HANs. The effects are dependent on propagation schemes and sources of neutrinos. We consider propagations in environments with adiabatically varying and constant electron density. In the adiabatic case, the matter influence on the flavor composition of HANs at Earth is noticeable at the electron density 10$^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$ in the cases of muon damping and neutron decaying sources. In contrast, in the constant density case, the matter effect can be neglected even at the density 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$. Thus, observations from next-generation neutrino telescopes may set stringent constraints on the adiabatic propagation scheme.</description>

      <title>Effect of spacetime geometry on neutrino oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10945v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Propagation of fermions in spacetime requires a spin connection, which can be split into a universal gravitational part and a non-universal ``contorsion'' part. The latter is non-dynamical and can be eliminated from the theory, leaving an effective four-fermion interaction with unknown coupling constants. The generic form of the contorsion-fermion coupling, and thus the four-fermion interaction, breaks chiral symmetry. This interaction affects all fermions -- in particular neutrinos passing through matter will notice a contribution to their effective Hamiltonian, just like the MSW effect coming from weak interactions, but diagonal in the mass basis rather than the flavor basis. Then there is a possibility that this geometrical contribution is not negligible for neutrinos passing through normal matter, provided the coupling constants are not too small. We calculate the matter potential due to this interaction and thus write the conversion and survival probabilities including its effect. We plot conversion probabilities of $\nu_\mu$ to $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\tau$ for a baseline of 1300 km, as well as their dependence on the CP phase, with and without the geometrical interaction. We also plot the survival probability of reactor $\bar{\nu}_e$ for different baselines.</description>

Abstract: This work presents the first detailed numerical predictions of CP violation in antitriplet charmed baryon decays. Adopting the flavor $SU(3)_F$ symmetry and the final state re-scattering framework, we relate the CKM-suppressed amplitudes to the leading ones, which are proportional to $\lambda_b$ and $\lambda_d$, respectively, with $\lambda_q = V_{uq}V^*_{cq}$. Larger-than-expected CP violations are found, reaching the order of $10^{-3}$, similar in magnitude to those in $D^0 \to \pi^+\pi^- ,K^+K^-$. This opens a promising avenue for observing CP violation in charmed baryon decays and testing the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>New Laboratory Constraints on Neutrinophilic Mediators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrinophilic mediators are well-motivated messenger particles that can probe some of the least known sectors of fundamental physics involving nonstandard interactions of neutrinos with themselves and potentially with dark matter. In particular, light mediators coupling to the active neutrinos will induce new decay modes of the Standard Model mesons (e.g., $\pi^\pm, K^\pm \to \ell^\pm + \nu + \phi$), charged leptons (e.g., $\tau^\pm \to \pi^\pm + \nu + \phi$), and gauge bosons (e.g., $Z \to \nu + \bar\nu + \phi$). A common lore is that these decays suffer from infrared divergences in the limit of the vanishing mediator mass, i.e., $m_\phi \to 0$. Here, we show that including the 1-loop contributions of these mediators to the standard 2-body decays (e.g., $\pi^\pm,\,K^\pm \to \ell^\pm + \nu$, etc.), the infrared divergence from the 3-body decay cancels out exactly by virtue of the Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg theorem. Including these cancellation effects, we then update the existing laboratory constraints on neutrinophilic scalar mediators, thereby extending the limits far beyond the decaying parent particle mass and excluding a wider range of parameter space. These new ``physical'' limits derived here have significant implications for the future detection prospects of nonstandard neutrino (self-)interactions.</description>

      <title>Strong CP and Flavor in Multi-Higgs Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of multi-Higgs doublet extensions of the Standard Model that solves the strong CP problem with profound consequences for the flavor sector. The Yukawa matrices are constrained to have many zero entries by a "Higgs-Flavor" symmetry, $G_{\rm HF}$, that acts on Higgs and quark fields. The violation of both CP and $G_{\rm HF}$ occurs in the Higgs mass matrix so that, for certain choices of $G_{\rm HF}$ charges, the strong CP parameter $\bar{\theta}$ is zero at tree-level. Radiative corrections to $\bar{\theta}$ are computed in this class of theories. They vanish in realistic two-Higgs doublet models with $G_{\rm HF} = \mathbb{Z}_3$. We also construct realistic three-Higgs models with $G_{\rm HF} = \rm U(1)$, where the one-loop results for $\bar{\theta}$ are model-dependent. Requiring $\bar{\theta}&lt; 10^{-10}$ has important implications for the flavor problem by constraining the Yukawa coupling and Higgs mass matrices. Contributions to $\bar{\theta}$ from higher-dimension operators are computed at 1-loop and can also be sufficiently small, although the hierarchy problem of this class of theories is worse than in the Standard Model.</description>

Abstract: In light of the recent data for $\bar{B}_{(s)}\to D^{(*)}_{(s)}P$ and $\bar{B}_{(s)}\to D_{(s)}V$ decays, we perform a model-independent phenomenological analysis in the presence of quasi-elastic rescattering. With the Wilson coefficients including contributions beyond the standard model, lifetimes of $B$ meson as well as the $B^0_d-\bar{B}^0_d$ mixing are investigated for clarifying correlations among the observables. We show that parameter regions for quasi-elastic rescattering, the size of color-suppressed tree amplitudes and new physics are constrained due to the lifetime data. As a consequence, it is revealed that this scenario can be testable by the future LHCb measurement of width difference in $B^0_d-\bar{B}^0_d$ mixing and semi-leptonic CP asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Probing neutrino mass ordering with supernova neutrinos at NO$\nu$A including the effect of sterile neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05213v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the possibility of probing the mass ordering sensitivity as a function of supernova distance in the context of the ongoing neutrino experiment NO$\nu$A. We provide a detailed study of the active-active and active-sterile mixing frameworks, illustrating how supernova neutrinos can be used to realize the existence of sterile neutrinos. Interestingly, we infer that observation of the NC channel alone can differentiate between the presence and absence of sterile neutrinos. Our results indicate that the primary channel of NO$\nu$A can distinguish normal mass ordering from inverted mass ordering at $5 \sigma$ confidence level for a supernova explosion occurring at a distance of 5 kpc. Additionally, we examine the impact of systematic uncertainties on mass ordering sensitivity, showing that higher levels of systematics lead to a reduction in sensitivity. Similarly, the inclusion of energy smearing significantly diminishes ordering sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Region analysis of $H\to \gamma \gamma $ via a bottom quark loop</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $H\to \gamma\gamma$ decay is an ideal process to study the structure of next-to-leading power logarithms induced by quarks due to its simple initial and final states. We perform a region analysis of this process up to two-loop level to inspect the origins of the logarithms. To deal with the endpoint singularities that are prevalent for the next-to-leading power logarithms, we have adopted two different kinds of regulators to exhibit the advantages and disadvantages of each regulator. In the analytic regulator we have chosen, the power of the propagator is changed by $\eta$. And the endpoint singularities are regulated in the form of $1/\eta$. These poles cancel between the collinear and anti-collinear sectors since there is no soft mode in such a regulator. In the $\Delta$ regulator, the soft sector is important. The leading and next-to-leading logarithms can be inferred from only this sector. Moreover, the symmetry between the collinear and anti-collinear sectors is preserved. After imposing a cut on the bottom quark transverse momentum, the leading order result is finite in each sector. We also discuss the next-to-next-to-leading power contributions and find that the potential factorization formulae involve two-dimensional endpoint singularities. Our region analysis could help to develop sophisticated factorization and resummation schemes beyond leading power.</description>

      <title>Topological Sum Rules and Spectral Flows of Chiral and Gravitational Axion-like Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03182v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the structure of off-shell effective actions arising from chiral and gravitational anomalies, focusing on the $JJJ_A$ (axial-vector/vector/vector) and $J_A TT $ (axial-vector/stress-energy tensors) correlators, relevant in the analysis of anomaly-driven interactions in perturbation theory. Our approach relies on conformal field theory in momentum space, extended to chiral anomalies. The analysis centers on the presence of both particle poles and anomaly poles within these interactions, characterizing their behavior both in the conformal and non conformal limits. Through explicit computations, we show that universal sum rules in the longitudinal sector regulate these interactions for all kinematic conditions, extending previous analysis, and we discuss the resulting spectral flow, an area law of the absorptive part of the anomaly form factors as one moves away from or returns to the conformal point. These features are absent in the local effective action of anomaly interactions, commonly used in the description of axion-like particles. The spectral densities in both cases are shown to be self-similar. Our results further show that anomaly poles correspond to true particle poles only in the conformal limit, when the interaction describes a massless S-matrix process supported on a null-surface. Under these conditions, they can be effectively described by two kinetically mixed pseudoscalar fields propagating on the light-cone. These studies find application in polarized deeply inelastic scattering, axion-like dark matter and analogue systems such as topological materials.</description>

Abstract: Assuming that (1) the universe underwent a post-inflationary accelerated expansion phase driven by a fluid with equation of state $P=w\rho$ and $-1&lt;w&lt;-1/3$, that (2) the cosmic horizon in an accelerating, quasi-de Sitter universe has a temperature inversely proportional to the proper size of the horizon, and that (3) we are static observers, we calculate the frozen-in density of a stable particle of mass $m$ produced by the cosmic horizon that does not undergo any number-changing processes in the late universe. We find that, as a function of the equation of state and the temperature when radiation domination starts and the quasi-de Sitter phase ends, the mass of the dark matter producing the observed cosmological abundance via this mechanism ranges from 10 keV up to close to the Planck scale.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the first observation of $CP$ violation in baryon decays, we study the relations for $CP$ asymmetries of bottom baryon decays. It is found that all the $CP$ violation ratios of two $U$-spin conjugate decay channels satisfy a simple equation in the $U$-spin limit. As examples, we present the $U$-spin conjugate channels in the four-body decays of bottom baryons. The $CP$ violation ratios between them might provide predictions for unobserved channels and be tested in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic baryon decays $\Xi_b\rightarrow \Xi_c \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell $ in perturbative QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a detailed analysis of the semileptonic $\Xi_b\rightarrow \Xi_c \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell$ decays within the perturbative QCD framework. In our study, the $\Xi_b\rightarrow \Xi_c$ transition form factors are calculated using several popular models for baryonic light-cone distribution amplitudes. These form factors are then employed to analyze a range of observable quantities for the semileptonic processes via the helicity formalism. Our work presents predictions for the branching fractions of these decays for both the $\tau$ and $e$ channels. Notably, the obtained lepton flavor universality ratio, $\mathcal{R}_{\Xi_c}\approx 0.3$, may offer new insights into the $\mathcal{R}^{(*)}$ puzzle. Furthermore, we investigate various angular observables, such as forward-backward asymmetries, lepton-side convexity parameters, and polarization asymmetries, which provide complementary information regarding potential new physics in $b$-baryonic semileptonic transitions. The numerical results for these angular observables are presented as both functions of $q^2$ and as averaged values. We observe that the lepton mass plays a significant role in shaping the angular distributions, affecting most of the observables under consideration. These results are expected to be valuable for both current and future experimental investigations of semileptonic heavy-to-heavy baryon decays.</description>

      <title>Exotic Decays and Collider Signatures of pNGB Scalars in the $SU(5)/SO(5)$ Composite Higgs Model</title>

Abstract: The nature of the Higgs boson, whether it is elementary or composite, will be investigated through precision measurements at the collider experiments. In composite Higgs scenarios, the Higgs may manifest as a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) arising from a strongly interacting sector. The $SU(5)/SO(5)$ Composite Higgs Model features a rich scalar sector, with the decay patterns of the scalars being heavily influenced by the way fermions are embedded in various representations of $SU(5)$. We discuss how masses of the pNGB scalars and their couplings depend functionally on the compositeness scale and the parameters of the strong sector. Unique decay modes of the scalars emerge from the model when the mixing among the various pNGB scalars is non-negligible. We present a comprehensive and thorough analysis of the fermiophilic and fermiophobic decay modes of the pNGB scalars. Significant differences are observed in the decay patterns of the two singly charged scalars. Further, the decay of one pNGB to another on-shell pNGB when masses exceed about $1$ TeV presents a rich phenomenology, leading to distinctive signatures at the colliders. In this context, the future muon collider offers a promising avenue for detecting pNGB scalars with masses greater than $1$ TeV, especially in final states involving multiple jets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Though some LHC searches for new physics exceed the TeV scale, there may be discoveries waiting to be made at much lower masses. We outline a simple quirk model, motivated by models that address the hierarchy problem through neutral naturalness, in which new electroweakly charged states with masses as low as 100 GeV have not yet been probed by the LHC. We also describe a novel search strategy which is complementary to current search methods. In particular, we show its potential to discover natural quirks over regions of parameter space that present methods will leave unexplored, even after the LHC's high-luminosity run.</description>

      <title>Tensor hybrid charmonia</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass and current coupling of the tensor hybrid charmonia $H_{\mathrm{c}} $ and $\widetilde{H}_{\mathrm{c}}$ with quantum numbers $J^{\mathrm{PC} }=2^{-+}$ and $2^{++}$, as well as their full widths are calculated in the context of the QCD sum rule method. The spectral parameters of these states are computed using the QCD two-point sum rule approach including dimension-12 terms $ \sim \langle g_{s}^{3}G^{3}\rangle ^{2} $. The full decay widths of the charmonia $H_{\mathrm{c}}$ and $\widetilde{H}_{\mathrm{c}}$ are evaluated by considering their kinematically allowed decay channels. In the case of the hybrid state $H_{\mathrm{c}} $ decays to $D^{(\pm )}D^{\ast (\mp )}$, $D^{0} \overline{D}^{\ast 0}$, and $D_{s}^{(\pm )}D_{s}^{\ast (\mp )} $ mesons are taken into account. The processes $\widetilde{H}_{\mathrm{c}} \to D^{(\ast)+}D^{(\ast )-}$, $D^{(\ast) 0}\overline{D}^{(\ast) 0}$, and $ D_{s}^{(\ast)+}D_{s}^{(\ast) -} $ are employed to estimate the full width of the hybrid charmonium $\widetilde{H}_{\mathrm{c}}$. The partial widths of these decays are computed by means of the QCD three-point sum rule method which is necessary to calculate strong couplings at the relevant hybrid-meson-meson vertices. Our predictions $m=(4.16\pm 0.14)~\mathrm{GeV}$ , and $\widetilde{m}=(4.5\pm 0.1)~\mathrm{GeV}$ for the masses and $\Gamma \left[ H_{\mathrm{c}}\right] =(160\pm 30)~\mathrm{MeV}$, and $\Gamma \left[ \widetilde{H }_{\mathrm{c}}\right] =(206\pm 33)~\mathrm{MeV}$ for the full width of these hybrid charmonia can be useful to study and interpret various resonances in the $4-5~\mathrm{GeV}$ mass range.</description>

      <title>$B$ meson decays to vector charmonium(like) states and a $K$ meson: the role of final-state interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A series of vector charmonium(like) states, accompanied by a $K$ meson, have been observed in the decays of $B$ meson. These processes are color-suppressed at the quark level, as inferred from topological diagram analysis. In this work, we calculate the branching fractions of the decays $B \to \psi K$, where $\psi$ denotes the charmonium(like) states $\psi(1S)$, $\psi(2S)$, $\psi(4040)$, $\psi(3770)$, and $\psi(4160)$. Our analysis incorporates both short-distance (naive factorization approach) and long-distance (final-state interactions) contributions. Within reasonable parameters, our results align with experimental data except for the $ \psi(4160)$, suggesting its possible exotic nature. Furthermore, we find that long-distance contributions dominate these decay processes, highlighting the crucial role of final-state interactions in the productions of charmonium(like) states in $B$ decays.</description>

      <title>One-loop pseudoscalar mass in a 2HDM with a $Z_3$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A two-Higgs doublet model with a discrete $Z_3$ symmetry acquires, in its scalar and gauge sectors, an accidental continuous $U(1)$ symmetry. One therefore finds, after spontaneous symmetry breaking of those symmetries, that a massless pseudoscalar arises, as expected by Goldstone's theorem. In the fermion sector, however, it is possible to obtain Yukawa matrix textures which distinguish between the $Z_3$ and $U(1)$ symmetries, so one expects loop corrections to originate a non-zero pseudoscalar mass for the $Z_3$ case. We perform an explicit calculation that shows that at one-loop the pseudoscalar remains massless for all but one tested $Z_3$ Yukawa matrices. The pseudoscalar mass thus found is highly suppressed by the hierarchy of fermion masses.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the electromagnetic structure and intrinsic dynamics of spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ hidden-charm pentaquarks: A comprehensive QCD analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the electromagnetic properties$-$ specifically, the magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole, and magnetic octupole moments$-$ of six hidden-charm pentaquark states: $[u u][d c] \bar c$, $[dd][u c] \bar c$, $[u u][s c] \bar c$, $[dd] [s c] \bar c$, $[s s][u c] \bar c$, and $[s s][d c] \bar c$. Employing the framework of QCD light-cone sum rules and utilizing two distinct diquark-diquark-antiquark interpolating currents, we focus on pentaquark configurations with spin-parity quantum numbers $\mathrm{J^P =\frac{3}{2}^-}$. From the numerical results, we observe significant deviations between the magnetic dipole moment predictions obtained using different diquark-diquark-antidiquark structures. These results suggest that multiple pentaquark states with identical quantum numbers and quark constituents may exhibit distinct magnetic dipole moments, depending on their internal quark configurations. The obtained electromagnetic moments, particularly the variations in magnetic dipole moments, may provide insights into the internal structure of hidden-charm pentaquark states.</description>

      <title>Scattering Entanglement Entropy and Its Implications for Electroweak Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the connection between the entanglement entropy in scattering processes and the dynamics of electroweak phase transitions. Recent work has shown that the scattering entanglement entropy can provide new insight into Standard Model parameters. In this study, we propose that the maximum of the entanglement entropy in scattering amplitudes may serve as a diagnostic for first-order electroweak phase transitions in the early universe. We analyze a simplified extension of the Standard Model consisting of the Higgs boson $h$ coupled to $O(N)$ real singlet scalars $S$ via the Higgs portal coupling $\lambda_{hS}$. By explicitly calculating the maximum entanglement entropy, we demonstrate that it grows with increasing $\lambda_{hS}$, and that both first-order and strong first-order electroweak phase transitions are favored in regions of parameter space with large maximum entropy. Our results suggest that entanglement-based observables may encode meaningful information about the underlying dynamics of electroweak symmetry breaking and provide a novel perspective on phase transition phenomena.</description>

      <title>Power corrections in the determination of heavy meson LCDAs: A renormalon-based estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At leading power accuracy the QCD light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) for a heavy meson can be matched onto the LCDAs in the framework of heavy-quark effective theory (HQET) through a factorization formula. We examine the power corrections to this factorization in the renormalon model, which can associate the power corrections originating from high-twist contributions to the divergent series in a matching kernel. Our analysis indicates that the dominant power corrections originate from the virtual part of the vertex bubble chain diagrams, which generate poles at $w=n+\frac{1}{2},\forall n\in \mathbb{N}$ and $w=1$ in the Borel plane. Employing phenomenological models for both HQET and QCD LCDA, we present a numerical estimate. The results indicate that the power corrections in the peak region are approximately $22\%$ for the D meson and $7\%$ for the $\overline{\mathrm{B}}$ meson. These findings showcase the magnitude and the potential importance of power corrections in achieving high-precision phenomenological predictions for heavy mesons.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos from Primordial Black Holes in Theories with Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum gravity scale within the dark dimension scenario ($M_* \sim 10^{9}~{\rm GeV}$) roughly coincides with the energy scale of the KM3-230213A neutrino ($E_\nu \sim 10^{8}~{\rm GeV}$). We propose an interpretation for this intriguing coincidence in terms of Hawking evaporation of five-dimensional (5D) primordial black holes (PBHs). 5D PBHs are bigger, colder, and longer-lived than 4D PBHs of the same mass. For brane observers, PBHs decay essentially invisibly (only through gravitationally coupled modes), with a possible hot (temperature $\sim 10^{8}~{\rm GeV}$) flare of Standard Model particles in the final-stage emission. As a consequence, constraints on the density of PBHs relative to that of dark matter from null searches of Hawking evaporation can be avoided. We show that Hawking evaporation of 5D PBHs can accommodate the KM3-230213A neutrino event, evade constraints from upper limits on the gamma-ray flux, and remain consistent with IceCube upper limits on the partial decay width of superheavy dark matter particles into neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of the three-flavor quark-meson diquark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the properties of the two- and three-flavor quark-meson diquark (QMD) model as a renormalizable low-energy effective model for color superconductivity in dense QCD. The effective degrees of freedom are scalars, pseudo-scalars, diquarks, and quarks. The parameters in the scalar/pseudo-scalar sector can be determined by matching the meson pole masses and decay constants to their observed values using the on-shell renormalization scheme. The remaining parameters are in the diquark sector and a priori unknown. In principle, they can be calculated from QCD, but we consider them free. We renormalize the thermodynamic potential in the 2SC phase for two flavors and in the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase for three flavors, determining the counterterms of the couplings in the diquark sector. We derive a set of renormalization group equations for these couplings that are used to improve the thermodynamic potential. As an application, we calculate the gap and the speed of sound in the ideal CFL phase. It is shown that the gap approaches a constant as $\mu_B\rightarrow\infty$ and that the speed of sound relaxes to the conformal limit from above.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an analysis of coincident particle production in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions. In particular, we present the first detailed and differential predictions for coincident $\rho^0$ meson production in association with muon pair production, motivated by the recent ATLAS measurement of this process. These are found to describe the data very well, including the dependence of the coincidence fraction on the ZDC selection and/or other kinematic constraints on the muons. Differential predictions at the level of various kinematic variables are presented, and the calculation is made publicly available in the SuperChic MC generator. We also present general results for coincident two-photon initiated production focussing on muon and electron pair production; while the former is rather suppressed, the latter will be ubiquitous at threshold. The impact of coincident production on exclusivity vetos in ultraperipheral measurements is in addition discussed.</description>

      <title>Accelerating multijet-merged event generation with neural network matrix element surrogates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficient simulation of multijet final states presents a serious computational task for analyses of LHC data and will be even more so at the HL-LHC. We here discuss means to accelerate the generation of unweighted events based on a two-stage rejection-sampling algorithm that employs neural-network surrogates for unweighting the hard-process matrix elements. To this end, we generalise the previously proposed algorithm based on factorisation-aware neural networks to the case of multijet merging at tree-level accuracy. We thereby account for several non-trivial aspects of realistic event-simulation setups, including biased phase-space sampling, partial unweighting, and the mapping of partonic subprocesses. We apply our methods to the production of Z+jets final states at the HL-LHC using the Sherpa event generator, including matrix elements with up to six final-state partons. When using neural-network surrogates for the dominant Z+5 jets and Z+6 jets partonic processes, we find a reduction in the total event-generation time by more than a factor of 10 compared to baseline Sherpa.</description>

      <title>New resonances at LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the large QCD background, tt spectroscopy is poorly doing at LHC with the exception of a toponium type candidate observed with high statistical significance by CMS. Our previous work offers an alternate interpretation of this narrow resonance as a Kaluza Klein graviton. For heavy scalars, following ATLAS, we describe how the top loop contribution to the gluon-gluon fusion mechanisms could produce a dip rather than a bump in the mass distribution, which prevents genuine searches for heavy resonances. It seems that A420 and H650 resonances, indicated by other channels, as described in our previous work, start to be visible in the tt channel in RUN2 analyses presented by ATLAS and CMS. An NMSSM interpretation does not seem excluded, although the mass difference between these two resonances comes as a surprise. The KK graviton scenario is updated from our previous work, offering promising discoveries at RUN3. This scenario also offers excellent prospects for producing new narrow resonances at future $e^+e^-$ colliders. The present note summarizes these arguments and describes available indications, complementing our collection of evidences for BSM resonances in view of electing a future collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to test quantum entanglement and Bell nonlocality at an Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). By computing the spin correlations in quark-antiquark pairs produced via photon-gluon fusion, we find that longitudinally polarized photons produce maximal entanglement at leading order, while transversely polarized photons generate significant entanglement near the threshold and in the ultra-relativistic regime. Compared to hadron colliders, the EIC provides a cleaner experimental environment for measuring entanglement through the $\gamma^\ast g \to q\bar{q}$ channel, offering a strong signal and a promising avenue to verify Bell nonlocality. This study extends entanglement measurements to the EIC, presenting new opportunities to explore the interplay of quantum information phenomena and hadronic physics in the EIC era.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Freeze-In and Small-Scale Observables: Novel Mass Bounds and Viable Particle Candidates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The suppression of cosmological structure at small scales is a key signature of dark matter (DM) produced via freeze-in in the low-mass regime. We present a comprehensive analysis of its impact, incorporating recent constraints from Milky Way satellite counts, strong gravitational lensing with JWST data, and the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. We adopt a general strategy to translate existing warm dark matter (WDM) bounds into lower mass limits for a broad class of DM candidates characterized by quasi-thermal phase space distributions. The benefits of this approach include computational efficiency and the ability to explore a wide range of models. We derive model-independent bounds for DM produced via two-body decays, scatterings, and three-body decays, and apply the framework to concrete scenarios such as the Higgs portal, sterile neutrinos, axion-like particles, and the dark photon portal. Results from specific models confirm the validity of the model-independent analysis.</description>

      <title>Scalar Triple-Heavy Tetraquark States With Quark Content $cc\bar{c}\bar{s}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the scalar triple-heavy tetraquark states with quark content $cc\bar{c}\bar{s}$, $\eta_{c}D_{s}$ molecular state and $[cc]_{A(T)}[\bar{c}\bar{s}]_{A(T)}$ compact tetraquark states, by the QCD sum rule method. First, we construct the needed interpolating currents, $J^{M}(x)$, $J^{T_{1}}(x)$, and $J^{T_{2}}(x)$. Then, we derive the sum rules for the masses and the current coupling constants. Finally, we numerically analyze these sum rules, and find $m_{M}=4.9392^{+0.0851}_{-0.0817}~\mbox{GeV}$, and $\lambda_{M}=2.8857^{+0.5729}_{-0.4928}\times10^{-2}~\mbox{GeV}^{5}$ for the mass and the current coupling constant of the $\eta_{c}D_{s}$ molecular state, $m_{T_{1}}=5.0774^{+0.0708}_{-0.0641}~\mbox{GeV}$, and $\lambda_{T_{1}}=1.0436^{+0.1862}_{-0.1573}\times10^{-1}~\mbox{GeV}^{5}$ for the mass and the current coupling constant of the $[cc]_{A}[\bar{c}\bar{s}]_{A}$ compact tetraquark state, $m_{T_{2}}=5.0679^{+0.0839}_{-0.0721}~\mbox{GeV}$, and $\lambda_{T_{2}}=2.0316^{+0.4119}_{-0.3119}\times10^{-1}~\mbox{GeV}^{5}$ for the mass and the current coupling constant of the $[cc]_{T}[\bar{c}\bar{s}]_{T}$ compact tetraquark state.</description>

      <title>Schwinger Effect in a Twice Anisotropic Holographic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the Schwinger effect in a twice anisotropic holographic QCD model that incorporates both spatial and magnetic anisotropies. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we calculate the total potential of a particle-antiparticle pair to evaluate how these anisotropies affect the holographic Schwinger effect. Our calculations reveal that the magnetic field, characterized by parameters $c_B$ and $q_3$, consistently enhances the Schwinger effect by lowering and narrowing the potential barrier. In contrast, increasing the spatial anisotropy, parameterized by $\nu$, raises and widens the barrier, thereby suppressing the process. These findings suggest the significance of treating both anisotropies concurrently for a realistic description of particle production in HIC.</description>

      <title>Investigating DUNE oscillations sensitivity to Pseudo-Dirac Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the sensitivity of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) to sterile neutrino oscillations within a $3+$(pseudo-Dirac pair) framework. We first consider a pair of two sterile neutrinos forming a pseudo-Dirac pair, then we consider a low-scale seesaw realization, that we name ``Linear-Inverse Seesaw" model. This scenario features two nearly degenerate sterile neutrino states at the keV scale, characterized by a small mass splitting arising from a small amount of lepton number violation. In this scenario, the oscillation behavior can be described in three distinct regimes depending on the sterile-sterile mass-squared difference : low ($&lt; 1\,\mathrm{eV}^2$), resonant ($1$--$100\,\mathrm{eV}^2$), and high ($&gt; 100\,\mathrm{eV}^2$) regimes, recovering in both low- and high-mass regimes an effective non-unitarity of the leptonic mixing matrix. A distinctive feature of this framework is that observable effects persist even in the low-mass limit, unlike the case of standard $3+1$ scenarios, due to rapid oscillation averaging from larger keV-scale splittings. We leverage the complementarity of both near and far detectors to explore the sensitivity for $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\mu$ disappearance and $\nu_e$ and $\nu_{\tau}$ appearance oscillation probabilities. Our analysis reveals that DUNE can achieve significant improvements over current experimental constraints, especially in neutrino appearance modes. Additionally, we show that new CP-violating phases associated with the sterile sector can dramatically alter the sensitivity, with destructive interference potentially suppressing signals by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Power-like potentials: from the Bohr-Sommerfeld energies to exact ones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.00327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For one-dimensional power-like potentials $|x|^m, m &gt; 0$ the Bohr-Sommerfeld Energies (BSE) extracted explicitly from the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition are compared with the exact energies. It is shown that for the ground state as well as for all positive parity states the BSE are always above the exact ones contrary to the negative parity states where BSE remain above the exact ones for $m&gt;2$ but they are below them for $m &lt; 2$. The ground state BSE as the function of $m$ are of the same order of magnitude as the exact energies for linear $(m=1)$, quartic $(m=4)$ and sextic $(m=6)$ oscillators but relative deviation grows with $m$ reaching the value 4 at $m=\infty$. For physically important cases $m=1,4,6$ for the $100$th excited state BSE coincide with exact ones in 5-6 figures.
  It is demonstrated that modifying the right-hand-side of the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition by introducing the so-called {\it WKB correction} $\gamma$ (coming from the sum of higher order WKB terms taken at the exact energies) to the so-called exact WKB condition one can reproduce the exact energies. It is shown that the WKB correction is small, bounded function $|\gamma| &lt; 1/2$ for all $m \geq 1$, it is slow growing with increase in $m$ for fixed quantum number, while it decays with quantum number growth at fixed $m$. For the first time for quartic and sextic oscillators the WKB correction and energy spectra (and eigenfunctions) are written explicitly in closed analytic form with high relative accuracy $10^{-9 \ -11}$ (and $10^{-6}$).</description>

Abstract: We construct an explicit model of inhomogeneous gravitational collapse leading to a naked singularity in which gravitational absorption is both efficient and observable.

      <title>Probing fermionic asymmetric dark matter cores using global neutron star properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is possible for asymmetric dark matter (ADM) to accumulate in neutron star interiors and affect their global properties. Considering the effects of this accumulation, neutron star mass-radius measurements can deliver new insights into the cold dense matter equation of state (EoS). In this paper, we employ Bayesian parameter estimation using real and synthetic neutron star mass-radius data to infer constraints on the combined baryonic matter and fermionic ADM EoS, where the fermionic ADM forms a core in the neutron star interior. Using currently available mass-radius data, we find that the lower bound of the ratio between ADM effective self-repulsion strength ($g_\chi/m_\phi$) and particle mass ($m_\chi$) can be constrained at the 68\% (95\%) credible level to $10^{-6.59}$ ($10^{-7.77}$). We also find that, if neutron star mass-radius measurement uncertainties are reduced to the 2\% level, the constraints on the lower bound of the ratio of $g_\chi/m_\phi$ to $m_\chi$ can be improved to $10^{-6.49}$ and $10^{-7.68}$ at the 68\% and 95\% credible levels, respectively. However, all other combinations, of $m_\chi$, $g_\chi$, and the ADM mass-fraction, $F_\chi$, (i.e., the ratio of the gravitational ADM mass to the gravitational mass of the neutron star) are unconstrained. Furthermore, in the pressure-energy density and mass-radius planes, the inferences which include the possibility of fermionic ADM cores are nearly identical with the inferences that neglect fermionic ADM for $F_\chi \leq 1.7\%$ and neutron star mass-radius uncertainties $\geq 2\%$. Therefore, we find that neutron star mass-radius measurements can constrain the ratio of $g_\chi/m_\phi$ to $m_\chi$ and that neutron stars with ADM are indistinguishable from purely baryonic stars. This implies that neutron stars with ADM are equally as consistent with the available mass-radius data as neutron stars without ADM.</description>

      <title>Dark matter searches at BESIII</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) is a new type of invisible matter introduced to explain various features of recent astrophysical observations, including galaxy rotation curves and other fundamental characteristics of our universe. DM may couple to ordinary matter via portals, which open up possibilities for new particles, such as axion-like particle, light Higgs boson, dark photon, and spin-1/2 fermions. If the masses of these particles lie in the MeV to GeV range, they can be explored by high-intensity electron-positron collider experiments, such as the BESIII experiment. BESIII has accumulated a huge amount of datasets at several energy points, including the $J/\psi$, $\psi(3686)$, and $\psi(3770)$ resonances. BESIII has recently explored the possibility for axion-like particle and light Higgs boson through radiative $J/\psi$ decays, dark photon via the initial-state radiation process, and a massless dark photon in $\Lambda_c$ decays. This report highlights the latest results from the BESIII experiment on these topics.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Categorical Construction of Instanton Density in Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07195v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the inception of lattice QCD, a natural definition for the Yang-Mills instanton on lattice has been long sought for. In a recent work, one of authors showed the natural solution has to be organized in terms of bundle gerbes in higher homotopy theory / higher category theory, and introduced the principles for such a categorical construction. To pave the way towards actual numerical implementation in the near future, nonetheless, an explicit construction is necessary. In this paper we provide such an explicit construction for $SU(2)$ gauge theory, with technical aspects inspired by L\"{u}scher's 1982 geometrical construction. We will see how the latter is in a suitable sense a saddle point approximation to the full categorical construction. The generalization to $SU(N)$ will be discussed. The construction also allows for a natural definition of lattice Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theory in three spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>Enhanced nuclear Schiff and electric dipole moments in nuclei with an octupole deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18943v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deformed nuclei exhibit enhanced moments that violate time-reversal invariance ($T$) and parity ($P$). This paper focuses on the enhanced nuclear electric dipole moment (EDM) and Schiff moment present in nuclei with octupole deformation (pear-shaped nuclei). These moments, which are proportional to the octupole deformation, have a collective nature and are large in the intrinsic frame that rotates with the nucleus. However, in a state with definite angular momentum and parity, $T$ and $P$ conservation forbid their expectation values in the laboratory frame, as nuclear rotation causes them to vanish. In nuclei with octupole deformation, close opposite-parity rotational states with identical spin are mixed by $T$,$P$-violating nuclear forces. This mixing polarises the nuclear axis along the nuclear spin, allowing moments from the intrinsic frame to manifest in the laboratory frame, provided the nuclear spin $I$ is sufficiently large. Using half-life data for $E1$ transitions from the NuDat database, we calculate the intrinsic nuclear EDM $d_{\text{int}}$ for a range of nuclei theorised to exhibit octupole deformation. From these values, we independently estimate the intrinsic nuclear Schiff moment $S_{\text{int}}$ and the octupole deformation parameter $\beta_{3}$. Finally, we compare the magnitude of these collective moments in the laboratory frame with the contributions from valence nucleons, providing an estimate of the nuclear EDM and Schiff moment components unrelated to octupole deformation. The uncertainty of our estimates may exceed a factor of 10.</description>

      <title>Free streaming of warm wave dark matter in modified expansion histories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In models of warm dark matter, there is an appreciable population of high momentum particles in the early universe, which free stream out of primordial over/under densities, thereby prohibiting the growth of structure on small length scales. The distance that a dark matter particle travels without obstruction, known as the free streaming length, depends on the particle's mass and momentum, but also on the cosmological expansion rate. In this way, measurements of the linear matter power spectrum serve to probe warm dark matter as well as the cosmological expansion history. In this work, we focus on ultra-light wave wave dark matter (WWDM) characterized by a typical comoving momentum $q_\ast$ and mass $m$. We first derive constraints on the WWDM parameter space $(q_\ast, m)$ using Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations due to a combination of the free-streaming effect and the white-noise effect. We next assess how the free streaming of WWDM is affected by three modified expansion histories: early matter domination, early dark energy, and very early dark energy.</description>

      <title>Prospects for probing dark matter particles and primordial black holes with the Hongmeng mission using the 21 cm global spectrum at cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probing dark matter particles and primordial black holes remains a pivotal challenge in modern cosmology. Exotic energy injections from dark matter annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking evaporation can alter the thermal and ionization histories of the early universe, leaving distinctive imprints on the 21 cm global spectrum. We assess the potential of the upcoming space project, the Hongmeng mission, to probe dark matter particles and PBHs using the 21 cm global spectrum. Under ideal conditions with 1000 hours of integration time and negligible foreground residuals, the Hongmeng project can reach sensitivities to dark matter annihilation cross sections and decay lifetimes to $\langle \sigma v \rangle \sim 10^{-28}\,\mathrm{cm^3\,s^{-1}}$ and $\tau \sim 10^{28}\,\mathrm{s}$, respectively, for dark matter particles with a mass of $10\,\mathrm{GeV}$. It can also probe PBHs with masses of $10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$ and abundances as low as $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \simeq 10^{-6}$. These results indicate that the Hongmeng mission can improve current constraints on dark matter annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking radiation by nearly two orders of magnitude. Moreover, the Hongmeng mission surpasses current limits on sub-GeV dark matter probing and enables the probing of Hawking radiation from PBHs with masses above $10^{17}\,\mathrm{g}$, which remain undetectable through conventional cosmological means. Overall, the upcoming Hongmeng project holds great promise for advancing the investigation of both dark matter and PBHs, potentially deepening our understanding of the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Constraining circular polarization of high-frequency gravitational waves with CMB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circular polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) offers a promising probe of the parity-violating physics of the early universe. In this paper, we propose a novel method to constrain the primordial circular polarization of high-frequency gravitational waves (GW) in the GHz range. An efficient conversion of gravitons to photons in a transverse cosmological magnetic field at the epoch of last scattering can generate excess chiral photons if the GW background is chiral in nature. This excess radiation distorts the CMB thermal black-body spectrum, which can be estimated by measuring the V-Stokes parameter in the CMB polarization. Using current upper limits on the angular power spectrum of circular polarization $C_l^{VV}$ from the CLASS, MIPOL, and SPIDER experiments, we obtain the most stringent constraints on the characteristic strain and circular polarization of the isotropic background of stochastic GWs at ${40\,\rm GHz}$ and ${150\,\rm GHz}$, respectively. Our work, therefore, provides an interesting possibility to constrain the circular polarization of high-frequency GWs using the V-mode polarization measurements of CMB.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Regression as a Sustainable Data-driven Background Estimate Method at the (HL)-LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07289v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we evaluate the performance of a data-driven background estimate method based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). A realistic background spectrum from a search conducted by CMS is considered, where a large sub-region below the trigger threshold is included. It is found that the $L_2$ regularisation can serve as a set of hyperparameters and control the overall modelling performance to satisfy common standards established by experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In addition, we show the robustness of this method against increasing luminosity via pseudo-experiments matching the expected luminosity at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). While traditional methods relying on empirical functions have been challenged during LHC Run 2 already, a GPR-based technique can offer a solution that is valid through the entire lifetime of the (HL)-LHC.</description>

      <title>Bounds on complex structure moduli values for perturbative control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: String compactification in the framework of the low energy effective supergravity requires the perturbative control in both the large volume and the weak coupling expansions. However, the corrected K\"ahler potential generated by the coupling of the complex structure moduli to some lattice structure (which is typical in the presence of a tower of states) may diverge in the large field limit, resulting in the lost of the perturbative control. Such a diverging behavior is allowed by the Sp$(2(h^{2,1}+1))$ symmetry, and can be found in the explicitly calculable models in which a slight modification by the coupling between the lattice and the gauge field does not affect the diverging behavior. This is similar to the large internal volume condition in the Einstein frame, where the SL$(2, \mathbb{Z})$ symmetry of the axio-dilaton looks to allow the correction to the K\"ahler potential to diverge in the weak coupling limit but it just means that the dilaton field value must be bounded from above to keep the internal volume in the string frame sufficiently large. In order to keep the perturbative control, the value of the complex structure moduli also has the upper bound, which is determined by the volume of the internal manifold and the string coupling constant, hence the Kaluza-Klein and the string mass scales. The form and the interpretation of the bounds are quite similar to those of the distance conjecture, preventing the descent of a tower of states by the upper bounds on the moduli values.</description>

      <title>Diversifying halo structures in two-component self-interacting dark matter models via mass segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), through gravothermal evolution driven by elastic self-scatterings, offers a compelling explanation for the observed diversity of inner halo densities. In this work, we investigate SIDM dynamics in a two-component dark matter model with mass ratios of order unity, motivated by an asymmetric dark matter framework that naturally evades constraints from relic abundance and mediator decay, while enabling strong, velocity-dependent self-interactions. We show that cross-component scatterings significantly enhance mass segregation, driving the formation of dense, core collapsed-like halos. This effect couples naturally to SIDM-induced diversity, introducing a new mechanism for generating structural variations beyond those arising from gravothermal evolution alone. Our results reveal a novel mechanism for reconciling SIDM with small-scale observational tensions by enabling shifts in central densities while preserving the flexibility to generate diverse halo structures. We further highlight that halo structural diversity may serve as a diagnostic of dark sector composition, opening a new observational window into the particle nature of SIDM.</description>

      <title>Analogue of Chern-Simons invariant in non-metricity gravity and axion cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a pseudo-scalar quantity, which is an analogue of the Chern-Simons invariant, in the framework of non-metricity gravity. By considering the coupling between the pseudo-scalar quantity and the axion, we give scenarios which may solve the problems of the axion misalignment, the $S_8$ problem, and the beginning of inflation. When the phase transition associated with the spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry of the electroweak theory or grand unified theories (GUTs) occurs, the pseudo-scalar quantity has a non-trivial value, which induces the misalignment of the axion field and axion particles are produced. If the gradient of the potential is small, the $S_8$ problem might be solved. We also propose a mechanism which induces inflation by the misalignment of the axion field generated by the phase transition of the GUTs.</description>

      <title>Cosmology in Extended Parameter Space with DESI Data Release 2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillations: A 2$\sigma$+ Detection of Nonzero Neutrino Masses with an Update on Dynamical Dark Energy and Lensing Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain constraints in a 12 parameter cosmological model using the recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release (DR) 2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data, combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectra (Planck Public Release, PR, 4) and lensing (Planck PR4 + Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release (DR) 6) data, uncalibrated Type Ia Supernovae (SNe) data from Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 5 (DESY5) samples, and Weak Lensing (WL: DES Year 1) data. The cosmological model consists of six $\Lambda$CDM parameters, and additionally, the dynamical dark energy parameters ($w_0$, $w_a$), the sum of neutrino masses ($\sum m_{\nu}$), the effective number of non-photon radiation species ($N_{\rm eff}$), the scaling of the lensing amplitude ($A_{\rm lens}$), and the running of the scalar spectral index ($\alpha_s$). Our major findings are the following: i) With CMB+BAO+DESY5+WL, we obtain the first 2$\sigma$+ detection of a nonzero $\sum m_{\nu} = 0.19^{+0.15}_{-0.18}$ eV (95%). Replacing DESY5 with Pantheon+ still yields a $\sim$1.9$\sigma$ detection. ii) The cosmological constant lies at the edge of the 95% contour with CMB+BAO+Pantheon+, but is excluded at 2$\sigma$+ with DESY5, leaving evidence for dynamical dark energy dataset-dependent and inconclusive. iii) With CMB+BAO+SNe+WL, $A_{\rm lens} = 1$ is excluded at $&gt;2\sigma$, while it remains consistent with unity without WL data - suggesting that the existence of lensing anomaly with Planck PR4 likelihoods may depend on non-CMB datasets. iv) The Hubble tension persists at 3.6-4.2$\sigma$ with CMB+BAO+SNe; WL data has minimal impact.</description>

      <title>Bracketing the soliton-halo relation of ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In theories of ultralight dark matter, solitons form in the inner regions of galactic halos. The observational implications of these depend on the soliton mass. Various relations between the mass of the soliton and properties of the halo have been proposed. We analyze the implications of these relations, and test them with a suite of numerical simulations. The relation of Schive et al. 2014 is equivalent to $(E/M)_{\rm sol}=(E/M)_{\rm halo}$ where $E_{\rm sol (halo)}$ and $M_{\rm sol (halo)}$ are the energy and mass of the soliton (halo). If the halo is approximately virialized, this relation is parametrically similar to the evaporation/growth threshold of Chan et al. 2022, and it thus gives a rough lower bound on the soliton mass. A different relation has been proposed by Mocz et al. 2017, which is equivalent to $E_{\rm sol}=E_{\rm halo}$, so is an upper bound on the soliton mass provided the halo energy can be estimated reliably. Our simulations provide evidence for this picture, and are in broad consistency with the literature, in particular after accounting for ambiguities in the definition of $E_{\rm halo}$ at finite volume.</description>

      <title>Divergences in the effective interaction between Chern-Simons bosons and fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the vector extension of the Standard Model (SM) with Chern-Simons type interaction. This extension contains a new massive vector boson (Chern-Simons boson) that does not interact directly with fermions of the SM. We consider the effective loop interaction of a new vector boson with fermions of the SM and its renormalizability in an arbitrary gauge. Our analysis shows that loop divergences cannot be eliminated in the effective interaction between Chern-Simons bosons and fermions of the same flavor, whereas the effective loop interaction with fermions of different flavors remains well-defined. The interaction terms between the Chern-Simons boson and fermions of the same flavor, characterised by divergent prefactors, have been identified. These interactions should be treated within the framework of effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of black and white holes in ensemble of Planckons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Tsallis-Cirto non-extensive statistics with $\delta=2$ describes the processes of splitting and merging of black holes and their thermodynamics. Here we consider a toy model, which matches this generalized statistics and extends it by providing the integer valued entropy of the black hole, $S_{\rm BH}(N)=N(N-1)/2$. In this model the black hole consists of $N$ the so-called Planckons -- objects with reduced Planck mass $m_{\rm P}=1/\sqrt{8\pi G}$ -- so that its mass is quantized, $M=Nm_{\rm P}$. The entropy of each Planckon is zero, but the entropy of black hole with $N$ Planckons is provided by the $N(N-1)/2$ degrees of freedom -- the correlations between the gravitationally attracted Planckons. This toy model can be extended to a charged Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole, which consists of charged Planckons. Despite the charge, the statistical ensemble of Planckons remains the same, and the RN black hole with $N$ Planckons has the same entropy as the electrically neutral hole, $S_{\rm RNBH}(N)=N(N-1)/2$. This is supported by the adiabatic process of transformation from the RN to Schwarzschild black hole by varying the fine structure constant. The adiabaticity is violated in the extreme limit, when the gravitational interaction between two Planckons is compensated by the repulsion between their electric charges, and the RN black hole loses stability. The entropy of a white hole formed by the same $N$ Planckons has negative entropy, $S_{\rm WH}(N)=-N(N-1)/2$.</description>
