      <title>Differential equations for a class of semiclassical orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider semiclassical orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle associated with a weight function that satisfy a Pearson-type differential equation involving two polynomials of degree at most three. Structure relations and difference equations for these orthogonal polynomials are found, and, as a consequence, explicit first and second order differential equations are derived. Among the applications, differential equations for a family of polynomials that generalizes the Jacobi polynomials on the unit circle and the modified Bessel polynomials are established. It is also shown that in some cases the Verblunsky coefficients satisfy a discrete Painlev\'e II equation.</description>

      <title>Classification of the real Painlev\'{e} I transcendents by zeros and connection problem: an asymptotic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior and connection problem of Painlev\'e I (PI) equation through a detailed analysis of the Stokes multipliers associated with its solutions. Focusing on the regime where the derivative at the real zeros of the solution becomes large, we apply the complex WKB method to derive full asymptotic expansions of the Stokes multipliers. These expansions allow us to classify real solutions of PI according to their behavior at the zeros, distinguishing between oscillatory, separatrix, and singular types solutions on the negative real axis. Furthermore, we resolve the connection problem between the large negative asymptotics and the location of positive zeros by establishing full asymptotic expansions of the zero parameters. Our approach enables the construction of a precise phase diagram in the $(r,b)$-plane, where $r$ is the location of a zero and $b$ is the derivative at that point. Numerical simulations are provided to validate the theoretical results. This work extends prior studies on monodromy asymptotics and contributes a comprehensive framework for understanding the global structure of real PI solutions through their local zero data.</description>

      <title>Mizohata-Takeuchi inequalities for orthonormal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish some weighted $L^2$ inequalities for Fourier extension operators in the setting of orthonormal systems. In the process we develop a direct approach to such inequalities based on generalised Wigner distributions, complementing the Schatten duality approach that is prevalent in the wider context of estimates for such orthonormal systems. Our results are set within a broader family of tentatively suggested ($L^p$) inequalities of Mizohata-Takeuchi type. For $p$ a power of two at least, such weighted inequalities may be recast as questions of co-positivity of tensor forms. For $p\leq 1$ we provide some evidence that they may hold in reverse provided the orthonormal sequence is complete.</description>

      <title>One-sided Rellich inequalities, Regularity problem and uniform rectifiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset \mathbb R^{n+1}$, $n\geq1$, be a bounded open set satisfying the interior corkscrew condition with a uniformly $n$-rectifiable boundary but without any connectivity assumptions. We establish the estimate $$ \Vert \partial_\nu u_f \Vert_{M} \lesssim \Vert \nabla_H f \Vert_{L^1(\partial\Omega)}, \quad \mbox{for all $f\in\operatorname{Lip}(\partial\Omega)$} $$ where $u_f$ is the solution to the Dirichlet problem with boundary data $f$, $\partial_\nu u_f$ is the normal derivative of $u_f$ at the boundary in the weak sense, $\Vert \cdot \Vert_{M}$ denotes the total variation norm and $\nabla_H f$ is the Haj{\l}asz-Sobolev gradient of $f$.
  Conversely, if $\Omega\subset \mathbb R^{n+1}$ is a corkscrew domain with $n$-Ahlfors regular boundary and the previous inequality holds for solutions to the Dirichlet problem on $\Omega$, then $\partial\Omega$ must satisfy the weak-no-boxes condition introduced by David and Semmes. Hence, in the planar case, the one-sided Rellich inequality characterizes the uniform rectifiability of $\partial\Omega$.
  We also show solvability of the regularity problem in weak $L^1$ for bounded corkscrew domains with a uniformly $n$-rectifiable boundary, that is $$\Vert N(\nabla u_f) \Vert_{L^{1,\infty}(\partial\Omega)} \lesssim \Vert \nabla_H f\Vert_{L^1(\partial\Omega)},\quad \mbox{for all $f\in\operatorname{Lip}(\partial\Omega)$}$$ where $N$ is the nontangential maximal operator. As an application of our results, we prove that for general elliptic operators, the solvability of the Dirichlet problem does not imply the solvability of the regularity problem.</description>

      <title>Frobenius theorem and fine structure of tangency sets to non-involutive distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a complete answer to the question whether Frobenius' Theorem can be generalized to surfaces below the $C^{1,1}$ threshold. We study the fine structure of the tangency set in terms of involutivity of a given distribution and we highlight a tradeoff behavior between the regularity of a tangent surface and that of the tangency set. First of all, we prove a Frobenius-type result, that is, given a $k$-dimensional surface $S$ of class $C^1$ and a non-involutive $k$-distribution $V$, if $E$ is a Borel set contained in the tangency set $\tau(S,V)$ of $S$ to $V$ and $\mathbb1_E\in W^{s,1}(S)$ with $s&gt;1/2$ then $E$ must be $\mathscr{H}^k$-null in $S$. In addition, if $S$ is locally a graph of a $C^1$ function with gradient in $W^{\alpha,q}$ and if a Borel set $E \subset \tau(S,V)$ satisfies $ \mathbb1_E\in W^{s,1}(S)$ with \[ s \in \bigl(0,\tfrac{1}{2}\bigr]\qquad\text{and}\qquad\alpha \;&gt;\; 1 - \Bigl(2 - \tfrac{1}{q}\Bigr) \, s, \] then $\mathscr{H}^k(E) = 0$. We show this exponents' condition to be sharp by constructing, for any $\alpha &lt; 1 - \bigl(2 - \tfrac{1}{q}\bigr) s$, a surface $S $ in the same class as above and a set $E \subset \tau(S,V)$ with $\mathbb1_E \in W^{s,1}(S)$ and $\mathscr{H}^k(E) &gt; 0$. Our methods combine refined fractional Sobolev estimates on rectifiable sets, a Stokes-type theorem for rough forms on finite-perimeter sets, and a generalization of the Lusin's Theorem for gradients.</description>

      <title>H\"older continuity and Fourier asymptotics of spectral measures for 1D Schr\"odinger operators under exponentially decaying perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish $\frac{1}{2}$-H\"older continuity, or even the Lipschitz property, for the spectral measures of half-line discrete Schr\"odinger operators under suitable boundary conditions and exponentially decaying small potentials. These are the first known examples, apart from the free case, of Schr\"odinger operators with Lipschitz continuous spectral measures, as a direct consequence of the Dirichlet boundary condition. Notably, we show that the asymptotic behavior of the time-averaged quantum return probability, either $\log (t) / t$ or $1 / t$, as in the case of the free Laplacian, remains unchanged in this setting. Furthermore, we prove the persistence of the purely absolutely continuous spectrum and the $\frac{1}{2}$-H\"older continuity of the spectral measure for (Diophantine) quasi-periodic operators under exponentially decaying small perturbations. These results are optimal and hold for all energies.</description>

      <title>Parabolic Singular Integrals with Nonhomogeneous Kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.12830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish $L^2$ boundedness of all "nice" parabolic singular integrals on "Good Parabolic Graphs", aka {\em regular} Lip(1,1/2) graphs. The novelty here is that we include non-homogeneous kernels, which are relevant to the theory of parabolic uniform rectifiability. Previously, the third named author had treated the case of homogeneous kernels. The present proof combines the methods of that work (which in turn was based on methods described in Christ's CBMS lecture notes), with the techniques of Coifman-David-Meyer.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic error in the eigenfunction expansion for the Green's function of a Sturm-Liouville problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.10887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic error arising when approximating the Green's function of a Sturm-Liouville problem through a truncation of its eigenfunction expansion, both for the Green's function of a regular Sturm-Liouville problem and for the Green's function associated with the Hermite polynomials, the associated Laguerre polynomials, and the Jacobi polynomials, respectively. We prove that the asymptotic error obtained on the diagonal can be expressed in terms of the coefficients of the related second-order Sturm-Liouville differential equation, and that the suitable scaling exponent which yields a non-degenerate limit on the diagonal depends on the asymptotic behaviour of the corresponding eigenvalues. We further consider the asymptotic error away from the diagonal and analyse which scaling exponents ensure that it remains at zero. For the Hermite polynomials, the associated Laguerre polynomials, and the Jacobi polynomials, a Christoffel-Darboux type formula, which we establish for all classical orthogonal polynomial systems, allows us to obtain a better control away from the diagonal than what a sole application of known asymptotic formulae gives. As a consequence of our study for regular Sturm-Liouville problems, we identify the fluctuations for the Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion of Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Surfaces associated with first-order ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04489v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A link between first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and 2-dimensional Riemannian manifolds is explored. Given a first-order ODE, an associated Riemannian metric on the variable space is defined, and some properties of the resulting surface are studied, including a connection between Jacobi fields and Lie point symmetries. In particular, it is proven that if the associated surface is flat, then the ODE can be integrated by quadratures.
  Next, deformations of the associated surfaces are considered. A relation between some Jacobi fields on the deformed surface and integrability of the ODE is established, showing that there is a class of vector fields, beyond Lie point symmetries, which are useful for solving first-order ODEs. As a result, it is concluded that the deformation into a constant curvature surface leads to the integrability of the given ODE.</description>

      <title>Banach's Indicatrix Reloaded</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Banach famously related the smoothness of a function to the size of its level sets. More precisely, he showed that a continuous function is of bounded variation exactly when its "indicatrix" is integrable. In a similar vein, we connect the smoothness of the function -- measured now by its integral modulus of continuity -- to the structure of its superlevel sets. Our approach ultimately reduces to a continuum incidence problem for quantifying the regularity of open sets. The pay off is a refinement of Banach's original theorem and an answer to a question of Garsia--Sawyer.</description>
