      <title>Membrane-mediated interactions between arc-shaped particles strongly depend on membrane curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Besides direct molecular interactions, proteins and nanoparticles embedded in or adsorbed to membranes experience indirect interactions that are mediated by the membranes. These membrane-mediated interactions arise from the membrane curvature induced by the particles and can lead to assemblies of particles that generate highly curved spherical or tubular membranes shapes, but have mainly been quantified for planar or weakly curved membranes. In this article, we systematically investigate the membrane-mediated interactions of arc-shaped particles adsorbed to a variety of tubular and spherical membrane shapes with coarse-grained modelling and simulations. We determine both the pairwise interaction free energy, with includes entropic contributions due to rotational entropy loss at close particle distances, and the pairwise interaction energy without entropic components from particle distributions observed in the simulations. For membrane shapes with small curvature, the membrane-mediated interaction free energies of particle pairs exceed the thermal energy kT and can lead to particle ordering and aggregation. The interactions strongly decrease with increasing curvature of the membrane shape and are minimal for tubular shapes with membrane curvatures close to the particle curvature.</description>

      <title>A Unified Intracellular pH Landscape with SITE-pHorin: a Quantum-Entanglement-Enhanced pH Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An accurate map of intracellular organelle pH is crucial for comprehending cellular metabolism and organellar functions. However, a unified intracellular pH spectrum using a single probe is still lack. Here, we developed a novel quantum entanglement-enhanced pH-sensitive probe called SITE-pHorin, which featured a wide pH-sensitive range and ratiometric quantitative measurement capabilities. Subsequently, we measured the pH of various organelles and their sub-compartments, including mitochondrial sub-spaces, Golgi stacks, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, peroxisomes, and endosomes in COS-7 cells. For the long-standing debate on mitochondrial compartments pH, we measured the pH of mitochondrial cristae as 6.60 \pm 0.40, the pH of mitochondrial intermembrane space as 6.95 \pm 0.30, and two populations of mitochondrial matrix pH at approximately 7.20 \pm 0.27 and 7.50 \pm 0.16, respectively. Notably, the lysosome pH exhibited a single, narrow Gaussian distribution centered at 4.79 \pm 0.17. Furthermore, quantum chemistry computations revealed that both the deprotonation of the residue Y182 and the discrete curvature of deformed benzene ring in chromophore are both necessary for the quantum entanglement mechanism of SITE-pHorin. Intriguingly, our findings reveal an accurate pH gradient (0.6-0.9 pH unit) between mitochondrial cristae and matrix, suggesting prior knowledge about \Delta pH (0.4-0.6) and mitochondrial proton motive force (pmf) are underestimated.</description>

      <title>Navigating the nexus: a perspective of centrosome -cytoskeleton interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A structural relationship between the centrosome and cytoskeleton has been recognized for many years. Centrosomes typically reside near the nucleus, establishing and maintaining the nucleus-centrosome axis. This spatial arrangement is critical for determining cell polarity during interphase and ensuring the proper assembly of the spindle apparatus during mitosis. Centrosomes also engage in physical interactions with various components of the cytoskeleton, balancing internal cellular architecture and polarity in a manner specific to tissue type and developmental stage. Numerous crosslinking proteins facilitate these interactions, promoting both cytoskeletal and centrosomal nucleation. This article provides an overview of how cytoskeletal elements and centrosomes coordinate their actions to regulate complex cellular functions such as cell migration, adhesion, and division. The reciprocal influence between cytoskeletal dynamics and centrosomal positioning underscores their integral roles in cellular organization and function.</description>
