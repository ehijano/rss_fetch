      <title>Fast Structured Orthogonal Dictionary Learning using Householder Reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and investigate algorithms for the structured orthogonal dictionary learning problem. First, we investigate the case when the dictionary is a Householder matrix. We give sample complexity results and show theoretically guaranteed approximate recovery (in the $l_{\infty}$ sense) with optimal computational complexity. We then attempt to generalize these techniques when the dictionary is a product of a few Householder matrices. We numerically validate these techniques in the sample-limited setting to show performance similar to or better than existing techniques while having much improved computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Train-On-Request: An On-Device Continual Learning Workflow for Adaptive Real-World Brain Machine Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) are expanding beyond clinical settings thanks to advances in hardware and algorithms. However, they still face challenges in user-friendliness and signal variability. Classification models need periodic adaptation for real-life use, making an optimal re-training strategy essential to maximize user acceptance and maintain high performance. We propose TOR, a train-on-request workflow that enables user-specific model adaptation to novel conditions, addressing signal variability over time. Using continual learning, TOR preserves knowledge across sessions and mitigates inter-session variability. With TOR, users can refine, on demand, the model through on-device learning (ODL) to enhance accuracy adapting to changing conditions. We evaluate the proposed methodology on a motor-movement dataset recorded with a non-stigmatizing wearable BMI headband, achieving up to 92% accuracy and a re-calibration time as low as 1.6 minutes, a 46% reduction compared to a naive transfer learning workflow. We additionally demonstrate that TOR is suitable for ODL in extreme edge settings by deploying the training procedure on a RISC-V ultra-low-power SoC (GAP9), resulting in 21.6 ms of latency and 1 mJ of energy consumption per training step. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first demonstration of an online, energy-efficient, dynamic adaptation of a BMI model to the intrinsic variability of EEG signals in real-time settings.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Signal Sampling with Adaptive Subspace Reconstruction for Spatially-Irregular Sensor Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Choosing an appropriate frequency definition and norm is critical in graph signal sampling and reconstruction. Most previous works define frequencies based on the spectral properties of the graph and use the same frequency definition and $\ell_2$-norm for optimization for all sampling sets. Our previous work demonstrated that using a sampling set-adaptive norm and frequency definition can address challenges in classical bandlimited approximation, particularly with model mismatches and irregularly distributed data. In this work, we propose a method for selecting sampling sets tailored to the sampling set adaptive GFT-based interpolation. When the graph models the inverse covariance of the data, we show that this adaptive GFT enables localizing the bandlimited model mismatch error to high frequencies, and the spectral folding property allows us to track this error in reconstruction. Based on this, we propose a sampling set selection algorithm to minimize the worst-case bandlimited model mismatch error. We consider partitioning the sensors in a sensor network sampling a continuous spatial process as an application. Our experiments show that sampling and reconstruction using sampling set adaptive GFT significantly outperform methods that used fixed GFTs and bandwidth-based criterion.</description>

      <title>Multicarrier Spread Spectrum Communications with Noncontiguous Subcarrier Bands for HF Skywave Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing traffic over the high-frequency (HF) band poses significant challenges to establishing robust communication links. While existing spread-spectrum HF transceivers are, to some degree, robust against harsh HF channel conditions, their performance significantly degrades in the presence of strong co-channel interference. To improve performance in congested channel conditions, we propose a filter-bank based multicarrier spread-spectrum waveform with noncontiguous subcarrier bands. The use of noncontiguous subcarriers allows the system to at once leverage the robustness of a wideband system while retaining the frequency agility of a narrowband system. In this study, we explore differences between contiguous and noncontiguous systems by considering their respective peak-to-average power ratios (PAPRs) and matched-filter responses. Additionally, we develop a modified filter-bank receiver structure to facilitate both efficient signal processing and noncontiguous channel estimation. We conclude by presenting simulated and over-the-air results of the noncontiguous waveform, demonstrating both its robustness in harsh HF channels and its enhanced performance in congested spectral conditions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing HAP Networks with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents and analyzes a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-based high-altitude platform (HAP) network. Stochastic geometry is used to model the arbitrary locations of the HAPs and RISs as a homogenous Poisson point process. Considering that the links between the HAPs, RISs, and users are $\kappa$--$\mu$ faded, the coverage and ergodic capacity of the proposed system are expressed. The analytically derived performance measures are verified through Monte Carlo simulations. Significant improvements in system performance and the impact of system parameters are demonstrated in the results. Thus, the proposed system concept can improve connectivity and data offloading in smart cities and dense urban environments.</description>

      <title>Wavenumber-Domain Near-Field Channel Estimation: Beyond the Fresnel Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the near-field context, the Fresnel approximation is typically employed to mathematically represent solvable functions of spherical waves. However, these efforts may fail to take into account the significant increase in the lower limit of the Fresnel approximation, known as the Fresnel distance. The lower bound of the Fresnel approximation imposes a constraint that becomes more pronounced as the array size grows. Beyond this constraint, the validity of the Fresnel approximation is broken. As a potential solution, the wavenumber-domain paradigm characterizes the spherical wave using a spectrum composed of a series of linear orthogonal bases. However, this approach falls short of covering the effects of the array geometry, especially when using Gaussian-mixed-model (GMM)-based von Mises-Fisher distributions to approximate all spectra. To fill this gap, this paper introduces a novel wavenumber-domain ellipse fitting (WDEF) method to tackle these challenges. Particularly, the channel is accurately estimated in the near-field region, by maximizing the closed-form likelihood function of the wavenumber-domain spectrum conditioned on the scatterers' geometric parameters. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed scheme against both the distance and angles of arrival.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Computation via 2D Movable Antenna Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has emerged as a promising technology for improving the performance of wireless communication systems, which enables local movement of the antennas to create more favorable channel conditions. In this letter, we advance its application for over-the-air computation (AirComp) network, where an access point is equipped with a two-dimensional (2D) MA array to aggregate wireless data from massive users. We aim to minimize the computation mean square error (CMSE) by jointly optimizing the antenna position vector (APV), the receive combining vector at the access point and the transmit coefficients from all users. To tackle this highly non-convex problem, we propose a two-loop iterative algorithm, where the particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach is leveraged to obtain a suboptimal APV in the outer loop while the receive combining vector and transmit coefficients are alternately optimized in the inner loop. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MA-enhanced AirComp network outperforms the conventional network with fixed-position antennas (FPAs).</description>

      <title>Exploiting Beam-Split in IRS-aided Systems via OFDMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In wideband systems operating at mmWave frequencies, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) equipped with many passive elements can compensate for channel propagation losses. Then, a phenomenon known as the beam-split (B-SP) occurs in which the phase shifters at the IRS elements fail to beamform at a desired user equipment (UE) over the total allotted bandwidth (BW). Although B-SP is usually seen as an impairment, in this paper, we take an optimistic view and exploit the B-SP effect to enhance the system performance via an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). We argue that due to the B-SP, when an IRS is tuned to beamform at a particular angle on one frequency, it also forms beams in different directions on other frequencies. Then, by opportunistically scheduling different UEs on different subcarriers (SCs), we show that, almost surely, the optimal array gain that scales quadratically in the number of IRS elements can be achieved on all SCs in the system. We derive the achievable throughput of the proposed scheme and deduce that the system also enjoys additional multi-user diversity benefits on top of the optimal beamforming gain over the full BW. Finally, we verify our findings via numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Geometric Clustering for Hardware-Efficient Implementation of Chromatic Dispersion Compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power efficiency remains a significant challenge in modern optical fiber communication systems, driving efforts to reduce the computational complexity of digital signal processing, particularly in chromatic dispersion compensation (CDC) algorithms. While various strategies for complexity reduction have been proposed, many lack the necessary hardware implementation to validate their benefits. This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the tap overlapping effect in CDC filters for coherent receivers, introduces a novel Time-Domain Clustered Equalizer (TDCE) technique based on this concept, and presents a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation for validation. We developed an innovative parallelization method for TDCE, implementing it in hardware for fiber lengths up to 640 km. A fair comparison with the state-of-the-art frequency domain equalizer (FDE) under identical conditions is also conducted. Our findings highlight that implementation strategies, including parallelization and memory management, are as crucial as computational complexity in determining hardware complexity and energy efficiency. The proposed TDCE hardware implementation achieves up to 70.7\% energy savings and 71.4\% multiplier usage savings compared to FDE, despite its higher computational complexity.</description>

      <title>SLiCK: Exploiting Subsequences for Length-Constrained Keyword Spotting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: User-defined keyword spotting on a resource-constrained edge device is challenging. However, keywords are often bounded by a maximum keyword length, which has been largely under-leveraged in prior works. Our analysis of keyword-length distribution shows that user-defined keyword spotting can be treated as a length-constrained problem, eliminating the need for aggregation over variable text length. This leads to our proposed method for efficient keyword spotting, SLiCK (exploiting Subsequences for Length-Constrained Keyword spotting). We further introduce a subsequence-level matching scheme to learn audio-text relations at a finer granularity, thus distinguishing similar-sounding keywords more effectively through enhanced context. In SLiCK, the model is trained with a multi-task learning approach using two modules: Matcher (utterance-level matching task, novel subsequence-level matching task) and Encoder (phoneme recognition task). The proposed method improves the baseline results on Libriphrase hard dataset, increasing AUC from $88.52$ to $94.9$ and reducing EER from $18.82$ to $11.1$.</description>

      <title>Joint Semantic Knowledge Distillation and Masked Acoustic Modeling for Full-band Speech Restoration with Improved Intelligibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech restoration aims at restoring full-band speech with high quality and intelligibility, considering a diverse set of distortions. MaskSR is a recently proposed generative model for this task. As other models of its kind, MaskSR attains high quality but, as we show, intelligibility can be substantially improved. We do so by boosting the speech encoder component of MaskSR with predictions of semantic representations of the target speech, using a pre-trained self-supervised teacher model. Then, a masked language model is conditioned on the learned semantic features to predict acoustic tokens that encode low level spectral details of the target speech. We show that, with the same MaskSR model capacity and inference time, the proposed model, MaskSR2, significantly reduces the word error rate, a typical metric for intelligibility. MaskSR2 also achieves competitive word error rate among other models, while providing superior quality. An ablation study shows the effectiveness of various semantic representations.</description>

      <title>Cislunar Communication Performance and System Analysis with Uncharted Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Moon and its surrounding cislunar space have numerous unknowns, uncertainties, or partially charted phenomena that need to be investigated to determine the extent to which they affect cislunar communication. These include temperature fluctuations, spacecraft distance and velocity dynamics, surface roughness, and the diversity of propagation mechanisms. To develop robust and dynamically operative Cislunar space networks (CSNs), we need to analyze the communication system by incorporating inclusive models that account for the wide range of possible propagation environments and noise characteristics. In this paper, we consider that the communication signal can be subjected to both Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise, but also to different fading conditions. First, we analyze the communication link by showing the relationship between the brightness temperatures of the Moon and the equivalent noise temperature at the receiver of the Lunar Gateway. We propose to analyze the ergodic capacity and the outage probability, as they are essential metrics for the development of reliable communication. In particular, we model the noise with the additive symmetric alpha-stable distribution, which allows a generic analysis for Gaussian and non-Gaussian signal characteristics. Then, we present the closed-form bounds for the ergodic capacity and the outage probability. Finally, the results show the theoretically and operationally achievable performance bounds for the cislunar communication. To give insight into further designs, we also provide our results with comprehensive system settings that include mission objectives as well as orbital and system dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many data-driven applications, higher-order relationships among multiple objects are essential in capturing complex interactions. Hypergraphs, which generalize graphs by allowing edges to connect any number of nodes, provide a flexible and powerful framework for modeling such higher-order relationships. In this work, we introduce hypergraph diffusion wavelets and describe their favorable spectral and spatial properties. We demonstrate their utility for biomedical discovery in spatially resolved transcriptomics by applying the method to represent disease-relevant cellular niches for Alzheimer's disease.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Vision-Based Localization: A New Approach to Localizability Analysis Using Stochastic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant algorithmic advances in vision-based positioning, a comprehensive probabilistic framework to study its performance has remained unexplored. The main objective of this paper is to develop such a framework using ideas from stochastic geometry. Due to limitations in sensor resolution, the level of detail in prior information, and computational resources, we may not be able to differentiate between landmarks with similar appearances in the vision data, such as trees, lampposts, and bus stops. While one cannot accurately determine the absolute target position using a single indistinguishable landmark, obtaining an approximate position fix is possible if the target can see multiple landmarks whose geometric placement on the map is unique. Modeling the locations of these indistinguishable landmarks as a Poisson point process (PPP) $\Phi$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$, we develop a new approach to analyze the localizability in this setting. From the target location $\mathbb{x}$, the measurements are obtained from landmarks within the visibility region. These measurements, including ranges and angles to the landmarks, denoted as $f(\mathbb{x})$, can be treated as mappings from the target location. We are interested in understanding the probability that the measurements $f(\mathbb{x})$ are sufficiently distinct from the measurement $f(\mathbb{x}_0)$ at the given location, which we term localizability. Expressions of localizability probability are derived for specific vision-inspired measurements, such as ranges to landmarks and snapshots of their locations. Our analysis reveals that the localizability probability approaches one when the landmark intensity tends to infinity, which means that error-free localization is achievable in this limiting regime.</description>

Abstract: We present an overview of ongoing research endeavors focused on in-band full-duplex (IBFD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems and their applications. In response to the unprecedented demands for mobile traffic in concurrent and upcoming wireless networks, a paradigm shift from conventional cellular networks to distributed communication systems becomes imperative. Cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) emerges as a practical and scalable implementation of distributed/network MIMO systems, serving as a crucial physical layer technology for the advancement of next-generation wireless networks. This architecture inherits benefits from co-located massive MIMO and distributed systems and provides the flexibility for integration with the IBFD technology. We delineate the evolutionary trajectory of cellular networks, transitioning from conventional half-duplex multi-user MIMO networks to IBFD CF-mMIMO. The discussion extends further to the emerging paradigm of network-assisted IBFD CF-mMIMO (NAFD CF-mMIMO), serving as an energy-efficient prototype for asymmetric uplink and downlink communication services. This novel approach finds applications in dual-functionality scenarios, including simultaneous wireless power and information transmission, wireless surveillance, and integrated sensing and communications. We highlight various current use case applications, discuss open challenges, and outline future research directions aimed at fully realizing the potential of NAFD CF-mMIMO systems to meet the evolving demands of future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Multimodal Speech Representations for the Assessment of Schizophrenia Symptoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal schizophrenia assessment systems have gained traction over the last few years. This work introduces a schizophrenia assessment system to discern between prominent symptom classes of schizophrenia and predict an overall schizophrenia severity score. We develop a Vector Quantized Variational Auto-Encoder (VQ-VAE) based Multimodal Representation Learning (MRL) model to produce task-agnostic speech representations from vocal Tract Variables (TVs) and Facial Action Units (FAUs). These representations are then used in a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) based downstream prediction model to obtain class labels and an overall severity score. The proposed framework outperforms the previous works on the multi-class classification task across all evaluation metrics (Weighted F1 score, AUC-ROC score, and Weighted Accuracy). Additionally, it estimates the schizophrenia severity score, a task not addressed by earlier approaches.</description>

      <title>Atomic Norm Minimization-based DoA Estimation for IRS-assisted Sensing Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is expected to play a pivotal role in future wireless sensing networks owing to its potential for high-resolution and high-accuracy sensing. In this work, we investigate a multi-target direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation problem in a semi-passive IRS-assisted sensing system, where IRS reflecting elements (REs) reflect signals from the base station to targets, and IRS sensing elements (SEs) estimate DoA based on echo signals reflected by the targets. {First of all, instead of solely relying on IRS SEs for DoA estimation as done in the existing literature, this work fully exploits the DoA information embedded in both IRS REs and SEs matrices via the atomic norm minimization (ANM) scheme. Subsequently, the Cram\'er-Rao bound for DoA estimation is derived, revealing an inverse proportionality to $MN^3+NM^3$ under the case of identity covariance matrix of the IRS measurement matrix and a single target, where $M$ and $N$ are the number of IRS SEs and REs, respectively. Finally, extensive numerical results substantiate the superior accuracy and resolution performance of the proposed ANM-based DoA estimation method over representative baselines.</description>

      <title>Learning Latent Wireless Dynamics from Channel State Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel data-driven machine learning (ML) technique to model and predict the dynamics of the wireless propagation environment in latent space. Leveraging the idea of channel charting, which learns compressed representations of high-dimensional channel state information (CSI), we incorporate a predictive component to capture the dynamics of the wireless system. Hence, we jointly learn a channel encoder that maps the estimated CSI to an appropriate latent space, and a predictor that models the relationships between such representations. Accordingly, our problem boils down to training a joint-embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) that simulates the latent dynamics of a wireless network from CSI. We present numerical evaluations on measured data and show that the proposed JEPA displays a two-fold increase in accuracy over benchmarks, for longer look-ahead prediction tasks.</description>

Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are an alternative application of metasurfaces as active reconfigurable antennas with advanced analog signal processing and beamforming capabilities, which have been proposed to replace conventional antenna arrays for next generation transceivers. Motivated by this, we investigate the bit error probability (BEP) optimization in a DMA-based system, propose an iterative optimization algorithm, which adjusts the transmit precoder and the weights of the DMA elements, prove its convergence and derive complexity.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming and Illumination Pattern Design for Beam-Hopping LEO Satellite Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since hybrid beamforming (HBF) can approach the performance of fully-digital beamforming (FDBF) with much lower hardware complexity, we investigate the HBF design for beam-hopping (BH) low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications (SatComs). Aiming at maximizing the sum-rate of totally illuminated beam positions during the whole BH period, we consider joint beamforming and illumination pattern design subject to the HBF constraints and sum-rate requirements. To address the non-convexity of the HBF constraints, we temporarily replace the HBF constraints with the FDBF constraints. Then we propose an FDBF and illumination pattern random search (FDBF-IPRS) scheme to optimize illumination patterns and fully-digital beamformers using constrained random search and fractional programming methods. To further reduce the computational complexity, we propose an FDBF and illumination pattern alternating optimization (FDBF-IPAO) scheme, where we relax the integer illumination pattern to continuous variables and after finishing all the iterations we quantize the continuous variables into integer ones. Based on the fully-digital beamformers designed by the FDBF-IPRS or FDBF-IPAO scheme, we propose an HBF alternating minimization algorithm to design the hybrid beamformers. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes can achieve satisfactory sum-rate performance for BH LEO SatComs.</description>

      <title>Emo-DPO: Controllable Emotional Speech Synthesis through Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current emotional text-to-speech (TTS) models predominantly conduct supervised training to learn the conversion from text and desired emotion to its emotional speech, focusing on a single emotion per text-speech pair. These models only learn the correct emotional outputs without fully comprehending other emotion characteristics, which limits their capabilities of capturing the nuances between different emotions. We propose a controllable Emo-DPO approach, which employs direct preference optimization to differentiate subtle emotional nuances between emotions through optimizing towards preferred emotions over less preferred emotional ones. Instead of relying on traditional neural architectures used in existing emotional TTS models, we propose utilizing the emotion-aware LLM-TTS neural architecture to leverage LLMs' in-context learning and instruction-following capabilities. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our proposed method outperforms the existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Distributed Maximum Consensus Without Accuracy Loss</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In distributed networks, calculating the maximum element is a fundamental task in data analysis, known as the distributed maximum consensus problem. However, the sensitive nature of the data involved makes privacy protection essential. Despite its importance, privacy in distributed maximum consensus has received limited attention in the literature. Traditional privacy-preserving methods typically add noise to updates, degrading the accuracy of the final result. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel distributed optimization-based approach that preserves privacy without sacrificing accuracy. Our method introduces virtual nodes to form an augmented graph and leverages a carefully designed initialization process to ensure the privacy of honest participants, even when all their neighboring nodes are dishonest. Through a comprehensive information-theoretical analysis, we derive a sufficient condition to protect private data against both passive and eavesdropping adversaries. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating that it not only preserves perfect privacy but also maintains accuracy, outperforming existing noise-based methods that typically suffer from accuracy loss.</description>

      <title>Self-Updating Vehicle Monitoring Framework Employing Distributed Acoustic Sensing towards Real-World Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent emergence of Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology has facilitated the effective capture of traffic-induced seismic data. The traffic-induced seismic wave is a prominent contributor to urban vibrations and contain crucial information to advance urban exploration and governance. However, identifying vehicular movements within massive noisy data poses a significant challenge. In this study, we introduce a real-time semi-supervised vehicle monitoring framework tailored to urban settings. It requires only a small fraction of manual labels for initial training and exploits unlabeled data for model improvement. Additionally, the framework can autonomously adapt to newly collected unlabeled data. Before DAS data undergo object detection as two-dimensional images to preserve spatial information, we leveraged comprehensive one-dimensional signal preprocessing to mitigate noise. Furthermore, we propose a novel prior loss that incorporates the shapes of vehicular traces to track a single vehicle with varying speeds. To evaluate our model, we conducted experiments with seismic data from the Stanford 2 DAS Array. The results showed that our model outperformed the baseline model Efficient Teacher and its supervised counterpart, YOLO (You Only Look Once), in both accuracy and robustness. With only 35 labeled images, our model surpassed YOLO's mAP 0.5:0.95 criterion by 18% and showed a 7% increase over Efficient Teacher. We conducted comparative experiments with multiple update strategies for self-updating and identified an optimal approach. This approach surpasses the performance of non-overfitting training conducted with all data in a single pass.</description>

      <title>Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Coexistence of Semantic and Bit Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the sixth generation (6G) of cellular networks, the demands for capacity and connectivity will increase dramatically to meet the requirements of emerging services for both humans and machines. Semantic communication has shown great potential because of its efficiency, and suitability for users who only care about the semantic meaning. But bit communication is still needed for users requiring original messages. Therefore, there will be a coexistence of semantic and bit communications in future networks. This motivates us to explore how to allocate resources in such a coexistence scenario. We investigate different uplink multiple access (MA) schemes for the coexistence of semantic users and a bit user, namely orthogonal multiple access (OMA), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). We characterize the rate regions achieved by those MA schemes. The simulation results show that RSMA always outperforms NOMA and has better performance in high semantic rate regimes compared to OMA. We find that RSMA scheme design, rate region, and power allocation are quite different in the coexistence scenario compared to the bit-only communication, primarily due to the need to consider the understandability in semantic communications. Interestingly, in contrast to bit-only communications where RSMA is capacity achieving without any need for time sharing, in the coexistence scenario, time sharing helps enlarging RSMA rate region.</description>

      <title>Interpretable ECG Analysis for Myocardial Infarction Detection through Counterfactuals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of ECG signal analysis, the opaque nature of deep learning models poses challenges to their integration into clinical practice. This study aims to address these challenges by investigating the application of counterfactual explanations to make machine learning models more interpretable for clinicians, particularly in the context of differentiating control group subjects from myocardial infarction patients. Utilizing the PTB-XL dataset, we developed a methodology for systematic feature extraction and refinement to prepare for counterfactual analysis. This led to the creation of the Visualizing Counterfactual Clues on Electrocardiograms (VCCE) method, designed to improve the practicality of counterfactual explanations in a clinical setting. The validity of our approach was assessed using custom metrics that reflect the diagnostic relevance of counterfactuals, evaluated with the help of two cardiologists. Our findings suggest that this approach could support future efforts in using ECGs to predict patient outcomes for cardiac conditions, achieving interpretation validity scores of 23.29 $\pm$ 1.04 and 20.28 $\pm$ 0.99 out of 25 for high and moderate-quality interpretations, respectively. Clinical alignment scores of 0.83 $\pm$ 0.12 for high-quality and 0.57 $\pm$ 0.10 for moderate-quality interpretations underscore the potential clinical applicability of our method. The methodology and findings of this study contribute to the ongoing discussion on enhancing the interpretability of machine learning models in cardiology, offering a concept that bridges the gap between advanced data analysis techniques and clinical decision-making.

      <description>arXiv:2403.06818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future communication systems are envisioned to employ intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) and the millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency band to provide reliable high-rate services. For mobile users, the time-varying channel state information (CSI) requires adequate adjustment of the reflection pattern of the IRS. We propose a novel codebook-based user tracking (UT) algorithm for IRS-assisted mmWave communication, allowing suitable reconfiguration of the IRS unit cell phase shifts, resulting in a high reflection gain. The presented algorithm acquires the direction information of the user based on a peak likelihood-based direction estimation. Using the direction information, the user's trajectory is extrapolated to proactively update the adopted codeword and adjust the IRS phase shift configuration accordingly. Furthermore, we conduct a theoretical analysis of the direction estimation error and utilize the obtained insights to design a codebook specifically optimized for direction estimation. Our numerical results reveal a lower direction estimation error of the proposed UT algorithm when employing our designed codebook compared to codebooks from the literature. Furthermore, the average achieved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as well as the average effective rate of the proposed UT algorithm are analyzed. The proposed UT algorithm requires only a low overhead for direction and channel estimation and avoids outdated IRS phase shifts. Furthermore, it is shown to outperform two benchmark schemes based on direct phase shift optimization and hierarchical codebook search, respectively, via computer simulations.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Split Computing with Wake-Up Radios: Architecture and Design via Digital Twinning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01815v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing leverages the sparsity of temporal data to reduce processing energy by activating a small subset of neurons and synapses at each time step. When deployed for split computing in edge-based systems, remote neuromorphic processing units (NPUs) can reduce the communication power budget by communicating asynchronously using sparse impulse radio (IR) waveforms. This way, the input signal sparsity translates directly into energy savings both in terms of computation and communication. However, with IR transmission, the main contributor to the overall energy consumption remains the power required to maintain the main radio on. This work proposes a novel architecture that integrates a wake-up radio mechanism within a split computing system consisting of remote, wirelessly connected, NPUs. A key challenge in the design of a wake-up radio-based neuromorphic split computing system is the selection of thresholds for sensing, wake-up signal detection, and decision making. To address this problem, as a second contribution, this work proposes a novel methodology that leverages the use of a digital twin (DT), i.e., a simulator, of the physical system, coupled with a sequential statistical testing approach known as Learn Then Test (LTT) to provide theoretical reliability guarantees. The proposed DT-LTT methodology is broadly applicable to other design problems, and is showcased here for neuromorphic communications. Experimental results validate the design and the analysis, confirming the theoretical reliability guarantees and illustrating trade-offs among reliability, energy consumption, and informativeness of the decisions.</description>

Abstract: Addressing the communication and sensing demands of sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication system, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has garnered traction in academia and industry. With the sensing limitation of single base station (BS), multi-BS cooperative sensing is regarded as a promising solution. The coexistence and overlapped coverage of macro BS (MBS) and micro BS (MiBS) are common in the development of 6G, making the cooperative sensing between MBS and MiBS feasible. Since MBS and MiBS work in low and high frequency bands, respectively, the challenges of MBS and MiBS cooperative sensing lie in the fusion method of the sensing information in high and low-frequency bands. To this end, this paper introduces a symbol-level fusion method and a grid-based three-dimensional discrete Fourier transform (3D-GDFT) algorithm to achieve precise localization of multiple targets with limited resources. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MBS and MiBS cooperative sensing scheme outperforms traditional single BS (MBS/MiBS) sensing scheme, showcasing superior sensing performance</description>

Abstract: The problems of uniform linear array (with uniform mutual coupling) calibration and Toeplitz covariance matrix estimation are re-examined for application in the receive arrays of modern High Frequency Over-the-Horizon Radars (HF OTHR). Specifics of these arrays, operating predominantly in the "over-sampled" (d/$\lambda$ &lt; 0.5) regime, are exploited along with the recent findings in the Toeplitz Inverse Eigenvalue problem (ToIEP), Random Matrix Theory, and the "Expected Likelihood" methodology developed earlier to advance the problem solution. In this paper we re-evaluate the benchmark efficiency of the "blind" calibration and analyze several techniques that are based on certain properties of the Toeplitz covariance matrix and "over-sampled" uniform antenna arrays, but do not require matrix estimation. In Part II we analyze the case of the unknown symmetric and Hermitian Toeplitz matrices and introduce techniques for joint antenna calibration and Toeplitz covariance matrix estimation.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information Analysis of Neuromorphic Coding for Distributed Wireless Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wireless spiking neural networks (WSNNs) allow energy-efficient communications, especially when considering edge intelligence and learning for both terrestrial beyond 5G/6G and space networking systems. Recent research work has revealed that distributed wireless SNNs (DWSNNs) show good performance in terms of inference accuracy and low energy consumption of edge devices, under the constraints of limited bandwidth and spike loss probability. Following this reasoning, this technology can be promising for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in space applications, where the energy constraint is predominant. In this work, we focus on neuromorphic impulse radio (IR) transmission techniques for DWSNNs, quantitatively evaluating the features of different coding algorithms that can be viewed as IR modulations. Specifically, the main contribution of this work is the evaluation of information-theoretic measures that may help in quantifying performance trade-offs among existing neuromorphic coding techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a secure wire-line telephone system that employs physical layer security (PLS) to protect against wiretapping. The system generates artificial noise (AN) in both transmission directions and uses a telephone hybrid circuit to effectively suppress the AN for the purpose of secure communication. Furthermore, we analyze the secrecy capacity of the system and evaluate its performance through theoretical analysis and practical experiments. The results demonstrate that the proposed system can significantly enhance communication security while preserving the integrity of legitimate signals. The results also validate that the proposed system is a robust and effective solution for securing wire-line telephone communications.</description>

      <title>Improving occupant comfort through real-time Predictive control of Indoor environment using Predicted-Mean Vote model and MLP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) index is a widely accepted method in the building automation sector because it can precisely estimate indoor thermal comfort levels depending on a variety of environmental parameters. This study suggests an experimental setup for automated real-time optimization of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) operations in closed spaces utilizing PMV-based modelling and Multilayer perceptron (MLP) based prediction, with an experimental setup which includes ESP32 and BME280 sensor. The main objective of this paper is to employ the MLP algorithm and predicted mean vote model to dynamically predict comfort differences considering the fluctuations in environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity. The proposed method is implemented across various settings, encompassing both an anechoic chamber and laboratory environments. The findings indicate that the proposed approach effectively enhances the management of HVAC systems in confined areas, leading to higher energy efficiency and enhanced indoor thermal comfort. The effectiveness of the suggested solution is supported by experimental validation, which shows that significant energy savings are achieved while maintaining comfort levels for occupants within.</description>

      <title>Leveraging parallelizability and channel structure in THz-band, Tbps channel-code decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As advancements close the gap between current device capabilities and the requirements for terahertz (THz)-band communications, the demand for terabit-per-second (Tbps) circuits is on the rise. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving Tbps data rates in THz-band communications by focusing on the baseband computation bottleneck. We propose leveraging parallel processing and pseudo-soft information (PSI) across multicarrier THz channels for efficient channel code decoding. We map bits to transmission resources using shorter code-words to enhance parallelizability and reduce complexity. Additionally, we integrate channel state information into PSI to alleviate the processing overhead of soft decoding. Results demonstrate that PSI-aided decoding of 64-bit code-words halves the complexity of 128-bit hard decoding under comparable effective rates, while introducing a 4 dB gain at a $10^{-3}$ block error rate. The proposed scheme approximates soft decoding with significant complexity reduction at a graceful performance cost.</description>

      <title>Dataset of Pathloss and ToA Radio Maps With Localization Application</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11777v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present a collection of radio map datasets in dense urban setting, which we generated and made publicly available. The datasets include simulated pathloss/received signal strength (RSS) and time of arrival (ToA) radio maps over a large collection of realistic dense urban setting in real city maps. The two main applications of the presented dataset are 1) learning methods that predict the pathloss from input city maps (namely, deep learning-based simulations), and, 2) wireless localization. The fact that the RSS and ToA maps are computed by the same simulations over the same city maps allows for a fair comparison of the RSS and ToA-based localization methods.</description>

      <title>CSI-GPT: Integrating Generative Pre-Trained Transformer with Federated-Tuning to Acquire Downlink Massive MIMO Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, how to reliably acquire downlink channel state information (CSI) with low overhead is challenging. In this work, by integrating the generative pre-trained Transformer (GPT) with federated-tuning, we propose a CSI-GPT approach to realize efficient downlink CSI acquisition. Specifically, we first propose a Swin Transformer-based channel acquisition network (SWTCAN) to acquire downlink CSI, where pilot signals, downlink channel estimation, and uplink CSI feedback are jointly designed. Furthermore, to solve the problem of insufficient training data, we propose a variational auto-encoder-based channel sample generator (VAE-CSG), which can generate sufficient CSI samples based on a limited number of high-quality CSI data obtained from the current cell. The CSI dataset generated from VAE-CSG will be used for pre-training SWTCAN. To fine-tune the pre-trained SWTCAN for improved performance, we propose an online federated-tuning method, where only a small amount of SWTCAN parameters are unfrozen and updated using over-the-air computation, avoiding the high communication overhead caused by aggregating the complete CSI samples from user equipment (UEs) to the BS for centralized fine-tuning. Simulation results verify the advantages of the proposed SWTCAN and the communication efficiency of the proposed federated-tuning method.

      <title>Pre-Training and Personalized Fine-Tuning via Over-the-Air Federated Meta-Learning: Convergence-Generalization Trade-Offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For modern artificial intelligence (AI) applications such as large language models (LLMs), the training paradigm has recently shifted to pre-training followed by fine-tuning. Furthermore, owing to dwindling open repositories of data and thanks to efforts to democratize access to AI models, pre-training is expected to increasingly migrate from the current centralized deployments to federated learning (FL) implementations. Meta-learning provides a general framework in which pre-training and fine-tuning can be formalized. Meta-learning-based personalized FL (meta-pFL) moves beyond basic personalization by targeting generalization to new agents and tasks. This paper studies the generalization performance of meta-pFL for a wireless setting in which the agents participating in the pre-training phase, i.e., meta-learning, are connected via a shared wireless channel to the server. Adopting over-the-air computing, we study the trade-off between generalization to new agents and tasks, on the one hand, and convergence, on the other hand. The trade-off arises from the fact that channel impairments may enhance generalization, while degrading convergence. Extensive numerical results validate the theory.</description>

      <title>Predictability of Performance in Communication Networks Under Markovian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13196v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the emergence of time-critical applications in modern communication networks, there is a growing demand for proactive network adaptation and quality of service (QoS) prediction. However, a fundamental question remains largely unexplored: how can we quantify and achieve more predictable communication systems in terms of performance? To address this gap, this paper introduces a theoretical framework for defining and analyzing predictability in communication systems, with a focus on the impact of observations for performance forecasting. We establish a mathematical definition of predictability based on the total variation distance between forecast and marginal performance distributions. A system is deemed unpredictable when the forecast distribution, providing the most comprehensive characterization of future states using all accessible information, is indistinguishable from the marginal distribution, which depicts the system's behavior without any observational input. This framework is applied to multi-hop systems under Markovian conditions, with a detailed analysis of Geo/Geo/1 queuing models in both single-hop and multi-hop scenarios. We derive exact and approximate expressions for predictability in these systems, as well as upper bounds based on spectral analysis of the underlying Markov chains. Our results have implications for the design of efficient monitoring and prediction mechanisms in future communication networks aiming to provide deterministic services.</description>

      <title>Decentralised Gradient-based Variational Inference for Multi-sensor Fusion and Tracking in Clutter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the task of tracking multiple objects in clutter under a distributed multi-sensor network with time-varying connectivity. Designed with the same objective as the centralised variational multi-object tracker, the proposed method achieves optimal decentralised fusion in performance with local processing and communication with only neighboring sensors. A key innovation is the decentralised construction of a locally maximised evidence lower bound, which greatly reduces the information required for communication. Our decentralised natural gradient descent variational multi-object tracker, enhanced with the gradient tracking strategy and natural gradients that adjusts the direction of traditional gradients to the steepest, shows rapid convergence. Our results verify that the proposed method is empirically equivalent to the centralised fusion in tracking accuracy, surpasses suboptimal fusion techniques with comparable costs, and achieves much lower communication overhead than the consensus-based variational multi-object tracker.</description>
