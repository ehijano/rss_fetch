      <title>The satisfiability threshold and solution space of random uniquely extendable constraint satisfaction problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the satisfiability threshold and solution-space geometry of random constraint satisfaction problems defined over uniquely extendable (UE) constraints. Motivated by a conjecture of Connamacher and Molloy, we consider random $k$-ary UE-SAT instances in which each constraint function is drawn, according to a certain distribution $\pi$, from a specified subset of uniquely extendable constraints over an $r$-spin set. We introduce a flexible model $H_n(\pi,k,m)$ that allows arbitrary distributions $\pi$ on constraint types, encompassing both random linear systems and previously studied UE-SAT models. Our main result determines the satisfiability threshold for a wide family of distributions $\pi$. Under natural reducibility or symmetry conditions on $\operatorname{supp}(\pi)$, we prove that the satisfiability threshold of $H_n(\pi,k,m)$ coincides with the classical $k$-XORSAT threshold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a new exponent for the Sum-Product conjecture on $\mathbb{R} $. Namely for $A \subset \mathbb{R}$ finite, \[
  \max \left\{ \left\lvert A+A \right\rvert , \left\lvert AA \right\rvert \right\} \gg_{\epsilon} \left\lvert A \right\rvert ^{\frac{4}{3} + \frac{10}{4407} - \epsilon} .\] We also provide new exponents for $A \subset \mathbb{R} $ finite and convex, namely \[
  \left\lvert A+A \right\rvert \gg_{\epsilon} \left\lvert A \right\rvert ^{\frac{46}{29} - \epsilon}, \] and \[
  \left\lvert A-A \right\rvert \gg_{\epsilon} \left\lvert A \right\rvert ^{\frac{8}{5} + \frac{1}{3440} -\epsilon} .\]</description>

      <title>Hamiltonicity of Bell and Stirling Colour Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G$ and a positive integer $k$, the $k$-Bell colour graph of $G$ is the graph whose vertices are the partitions of $V$ into at most $k$ independent sets, with two of these being adjacent if there exists a vertex $x$ such that the partitions are identical when restricted to $V - \{x\}$. The $k$-Stirling Colour graph of $G$ is defined similarly, but for partitions into exactly $k$ independent sets.
  We show that every graph on $n$ vertices, except $K_n$ and $K_n - e$, has a Hamiltonian $n$-Bell colour graph, and this result is best possible. It is also shown that, for $k \geq 4$, the $k$-Stirling colour graph of a tree with at least $k+1$ vertices is Hamiltonian, and the 3-Bell colour graph of a tree with at least 3 vertices is Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Representation theory and cycle statistics for random walks on the symmetric group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use representation theory of $S_n$ to analyze the mixing of permutation cycle type statistics $a_j(\sigma) = ${# of $j$-cycles of $\sigma$} for any fixed $j$ and $\sigma$ resulting from a random $i$-cycle walk on $S_n$. We also derive analogous results for the random star transposition walk. Our approach uses the method of moments; a key ingredient is a new formula for the coefficients in the irreducible character decomposition of the $S_n$-class function $(a_j)^r(\sigma)=\{(\text{# of $j$-cycles of $\sigma$})^r\}$ for any positive integers $r,j$ when $n\geq 2rj$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a formal version of the numbers of vertices, edges, and faces for infinite planar regular triangular meshes of degree r&gt;6. These numbers are defined via Euler summation of sequences obtained from iterated expansions of a convex combinatorial disk. We prove that these formal quantities satisfy the classical Euler formula, providing a combinatorial analogue of Euler's formula for infinite planar graphs.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Complete Bipartite Graphs via Resistance Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of resistance distance, introduced by Klein and Randi\'c, has become a fundamental concept in spectral graph theory and network analysis, as it captures both the structural and electrical properties of a graph. The associated resistance spectrum serves as a graph invariant and plays an important role in problems related to graph isomorphism. For an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, the resistance distance $R_G(u,v)$ between two distinct vertices $u$ and $v$ is defined as the effective resistance between them when each edge of $G$ is replaced by a $1\,\Omega$ resistor. The multiset of all resistance distances over unordered pairs of distinct vertices is called the \emph{resistance spectrum} of $G$, denoted by $\operatorname{RS}(G)$. A graph $G$ is said to be \emph{determined by its resistance spectrum} if, for any graph $H$, the equality $\operatorname{RS}(H)=\operatorname{RS}(G)$ implies that $H$ is isomorphic to $G$. Complete bipartite graphs, denoted by $K_{m,n}$, are highly symmetric and constitute an important class of graphs in graph theory. In this paper, by exploiting properties of resistance distances, we prove that the complete bipartite graphs $K_{n,n}$, $K_{n,n+1}$, $K_{2,n}$, and $K_{m,n}$ with $m&gt;3n+1$ are uniquely determined by their resistance spectra.</description>

      <title>Parking Function Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the notion of parking function polytopes and study their geometric and combinatorial structure, including normal fans, face posets, and $h$-polynomials, as well as their connections to other classes of polytopes. To capture their combinatorial features, we introduce generalizations of ordered set partitions, called binary partitions and skewed binary partitions. Using properties of preorder cones, we characterize the skewed binary partitions that are in bijection with the cones of the normal fan of a parking function polytope. This description of the normal fan yields an explicit formula for the $h$-polynomials of simple parking function polytopes in terms of generalized Eulerian polynomials. Finally, we relate parking function polytopes to several well-known polytopes, leading to additional results, including formulas for their volumes and Ehrhart polynomials.</description>

      <title>Absolute incidence theorems and tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a precise definition of incidence theorems in plane projective geometry and introduce the notion of ``absolute incidence theorems,'' which hold over any ring. Fomin and Pylyavskyy describe how to obtain incidence theorems from tilings of an orientable surface; they call this result the ``master theorem''. Instances of the master theorem are always absolute incidence theorems. As most classically known incidence theorems are instances of the master theorem, they are absolute incidence theorems. We give an explicit example of an incidence theorem involving 13 points that is not an absolute incidence theorem, and therefore is not an instance of the master theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential Freiman dimension of a finite set $A \subset \mathbb{R}^{m}$, introduced by Green and Tao in 2006, represents the largest positive integer $d$ for which $A$ contains the vertices of a non-degenerate $d$-dimensional parallelepiped. For every $d \geq 1$, we precisely determine the largest constant $C_{d}&gt;0$ (exponential in $d$) for which $$|A+A| \geq C_{d}|A| - O_{d}(1)$$ holds for all sets $A$ with exponential Freiman dimension $d$.</description>

      <title>Cyclic impartial games with carry-on moves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an impartial combinatorial game, both players have the same options in the game and all its subpositions. The classical Sprague-Grundy Theory was developed for short impartial games, where players have a finite number of options, there are no special moves, and an infinite run is not possible. Subsequently, many generalizations have been proposed, particularly the Smith-Frankel-Perl Theory devised for games where the infinite run is possible, and the Larsson-Nowakowski-Santos Theory able to deal with entailing moves that disrupt the logic of the disjunctive sum. This work presents a generalization that combines these two theories, suitable for analyzing cyclic impartial games with carry-on moves, which are particular cases of entailing moves where the entailed player has no freedom of choice in their response. This generalization is illustrated with sc green-lime hackenbush, a game inspired by the classic green hackenbush.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sylvester-Gallai theorem states that for a finite set of points in the plane, if every line determined by any two of these points also contains a third, then the set is necessarily made of collinear points. In this paper, we first provide a counterexample in the plane when the point set is countably infinite but bounded. Then we consider a variant of the Sylvester-Gallai theorem where instead of a finite point set we have a finite family of convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d\geq 2$). Finally, we present another variant of the Sylvester-Gallai theorem, when instead of point sets we have a finite family of line-segments in the plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G_1, \dots, G_k$ be finite-dimensional vector spaces over a prime field $\mathbb{F}_p$. Let $V$ be a variety inside $G_1 \times \cdots \times G_k$ defined by a multilinear map. We show that if $|V| \geq c |G_1| \cdots |G_k|$, then $V$ contains a subvariety defined by at most $K(\log_{p} c^{-1} + 1)$ multilinear forms, where $K$ depends on $k$ only. This result is optimal up to multiplicative constant and is relevant to the partition vs. analytic rank problem in additive combinatorics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say that a poset $Q$ contains a copy (resp.~an induced copy) of a poset $P$ if there is an injection $f : P \to Q$ such that for any $x,y \in P$, $f(x)\leq f(y)$ in $Q$ if (resp.~if and only if) $x\leq y$ in $P$. Let $\mathcal{Q}=\{Q_{n} : n\geq 1\}$ be a family of posets such that $Q_n\subseteq Q_{n+1}$ and $|Q_n|&lt;|Q_{n+1}|$ for each $n$. For given $k$ posets $P_1, P_2, \dots , P_k$, the \emph{weak (resp.~strong) poset Ramsey number for $t$-chains} is the smallest number $n$ such that for any coloring of $t$-chains in $Q_n\in \mathcal{Q}$ with $k$ colors, say $1,2, \dots, k$, there is a monochromatic (resp.~induced) copy of the poset $P_i$ in color $i$ for some $1\leq i\leq k$. In this paper, we give several lower and upper bounds on the weak and strong poset Ramsey number for $t$-chains.</description>

      <title>Sub-$n^k$ Deterministic algorithm for minimum $k$-way cut in simple graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a \emph{deterministic exact algorithm} for the \emph{minimum $k$-cut problem} on simple graphs.
  Our approach combines the \emph{principal sequence of partitions (PSP)}, derived canonically from ideal loads, with a single level of \emph{Kawarabayashi--Thorup (KT)} contractions at the critical PSP threshold~$\lambda_j$.
  Let $j$ be the smallest index with $\kappa(P_j)\ge k$ and $R := k - \kappa(P_{j-1})$.
  We prove a structural decomposition theorem showing that an optimal $k$-cut can be expressed as the level-$(j\!-\!1)$ boundary $A_{\le j-1}$ together with exactly $(R-r)$ \emph{non-trivial} internal cuts of value at most~$\lambda_j$ and $r$ \emph{singleton isolations} (``islands'') inside the parts of~$P_{j-1}$.
  At this level, KT contractions yield kernels of total size $\widetilde{O}(n / \lambda_j)$, and from them we build a \emph{canonical border family}~$\mathcal{B}$ of the same order that deterministically covers all optimal refinement choices.
  Branching only over~$\mathcal{B}$ (and also including an explicit ``island'' branch) gives total running time
  $$
  T(n,m,k) = \widetilde{O}\left(\mathrm{poly}(m)+\Bigl(\tfrac{n}{\lambda_j}+n^{\omega/3}\Bigr)^{R}\right),
  $$
  where $\omega &lt; 2.373$ is the matrix multiplication exponent.
  In particular, if $\lambda_j \ge n^{\varepsilon}$ for some constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, we obtain a \emph{deterministic sub-$n^k$-time algorithm}, running in $n^{(1-\varepsilon)(k-1)+o(k)}$ time.
  Finally, combining our PSP$\times$KT framework with a small-$\lambda$ exact subroutine via a simple meta-reduction yields a deterministic $n^{c k+O(1)}$ algorithm for $c = \max\{ t/(t+1), \omega/3 \} &lt; 1$, aligning with the exponent in the randomized bound of He--Li (STOC~2022) under the assumed subroutine.</description>

      <title>Upper Bound for Permanent Saturation of Metric Graphs using Interval Exchange Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We refine upper bounds on the permanent saturation time of metric graphs using interval exchange transformations (IETs). Earlier results gave bounds under incommensurable edge lengths, we improve and generalize them by using the ergodic and minimal properties of IETs. By associating an IET to a metric graph, we show that the induced interval dynamics are ergodic and minimal, which ensures uniform coverage over time. Our main theorem gives a sharper upper bound for the saturation time in terms of edge lengths and structural constants of the graph. We also define the Lyapunov spectrum of the Kontsevich-Zorich cocycle for these maps and relate it to the system's dynamics. We validate our theoretical findings through simulations on specific graph configurations, such as the complete graph $K_4$ and star graphs, confirming the accuracy of our estimates. These results strengthen existing estimates and provide tools for studying connectivity at the interface of graph theory and dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>A verified implementation of the Misra and Gries edge coloring algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vizing's theorem states that every simple undirected graph can be edge-colored using fewer than $\Delta + 1$ colors, where $\Delta$ is the graph's maximum degree. The original proof was given through a polynomial-time algorithmic procedure that iteratively extends a partial coloring until it becomes complete. In this work, I used the Lean theorem prover to produce a verified implementation of the Misra and Gries edge-coloring algorithm, a modified version of Vizing's original method. The focus is on building libraries for relevant mathematical objects and rigorously maintaining required invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the persistence probabilities of a moving average process of order one with innovations that follow a Laplace distribution. The persistence probabilities can be computed fully explicitly in terms of classical combinatorial quantities like certain $q$-Pochhammer symbols or $q$-deformed analogues of Euler's zigzag numbers, respectively. Similarly, the generating functions of the persistence probabilities can be written in terms of $q$-analogues of the exponential function or the $q$-sine/$q$-cosine functions, respectively.</description>

      <title>An improved lower bound to Erdos' problem concerning products of distances for fixed diameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Erdos, Herzog and Piranian asked whether, for $n$ points in the plane with fixed diameter (maximum distance between points), an arrangement of a regular $n$-gon maximizes their product of all pairs of distances. Recently, it was discovered that, for every even $n \geq 4$, a regular $n$-gon is not a maximizer. However, the discovered improvement turns out to be very small. Indeed, for a fixed diameter of $2$, let $\Delta$ be the square of the product of all pairs of distances (the "square" is here due to connections with polynomial discriminants). Then, for a regular $n$-gon, $\Delta = n^n$ for even $n$. The discovered arrangements have proven $\Delta = (1+o(1))n^n$ thus far, and it was not known whether one can have $\Delta \geq C n^n$ for some $C &gt; 1$ and all sufficiently large even $n$. In this note, we show that indeed $\liminf_{n\to\infty} \Delta_{\max}/n^n &gt; 1.037$ for even $n$ which settles this conjecture. Other arrangements with higher conjectured $\Delta/n^n$ values are in fact known, but we have not been able to obtain proofs that they have large products of distances. Finally, no arrangements such that $\Delta/n^n \to \infty$ are known and we do not know whether they exist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine precisely when the branching coefficients arising from the restriction of irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ to the dihedral subgroup $D_n$ are nonzero, and we establish uniform linear lower bounds outside a finite exceptional family. As a consequence, we recover and substantially generalize known positivity results for cyclic subgroups $C_n \leq S_n$. Analogous results are obtained for the alternating group $A_n$.</description>

      <title>Distribution questions for isogeny graphs over finite fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the first part of the paper, we fix a non-CM elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ and an odd prime $\ell$ and investigate the distribution of invariants associated to the $\ell$-volcano containing the reduction $E_p$, as $p$ ranges over primes of good ordinary reduction. Let $H(p)$ be the height of the volcano and let $d'(p)$ denote the relative position of $j(E_p)$ above the floor, and let $r\ge 0$ be an integer. Assuming that the $\ell$-adic Galois representation attached to $E$ is surjective, we derive an explicit formula for the natural density of primes $p$ for which $H(p)=r$ (resp.\ $d'(p)=r$). In the non-surjective case, we show that all sufficiently large heights occur with positive density. In the second part of the paper, we analyze the distribution of $\ell$-volcano heights over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ and consider the limit as $q\to\infty$. Using analytic estimates for sums of Hurwitz class numbers in arithmetic progressions, we compute exact limiting densities for ordinary elliptic curves whose $\ell$-isogeny graph has a prescribed height $r$.</description>

      <title>Applications of infinite lower triangular matrices and their group structure in combinatorics and the theory of orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12373v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our focus is on the set of lower-triangular, infinite matrices that have natural operations like addition, multiplication by a number, and matrix multiplication. With respect to each of these operations individually, the set preserves the group structure. The set becomes an algebra with unity when all three operations are considered together. We indicate important properties of the algebraic structures obtained in this way. In particular, we indicate several sub-groups or sub-rings. Among sub-groups, we consider the group of Riordan matrices and indicate its several sub-groups. We show a variety of examples (approximately 20) of matrices that are composed of the sequences of important polynomial or number families as entries of certain lower-triangular infinite matrices. New, significant relationships between these families can be discovered by applying well-known matrix operations like multiplication and inverse calculation to this representation.
  The paper intends to compile numerous simple facts about lower-triangular matrices, specifically the family of Rionian matrices, and briefly review their properties.</description>

      <title>Calculating the maximum number of maximum cliques for simple graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14120v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple graph on $n$ vertices may contain a lot of maximum cliques. But how many can it potentially contain? We will define prime and composite graphs, and we will show that if $n \ge 15$, then the grpahs with the maximum number of maximum cliques have to be composite. Moreover, we will show an edge bound from which we will prove that if any factor of a composite graph has $\omega(G_i) \ge 5$, then it cannot have the maximum number of maximum cliques. Using this we will show that the graph that contains $3^{\lfloor n/3 \rfloor}c$ maximum cliques has the most number of maximum cliques on $n$ vertices, where $c\in\{1,\frac{4}{3},2\}$, depending on $n \text{ mod } 3$.</description>

      <title>Coloring locally sparse graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19271v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is $k$-locally sparse if for each vertex $v \in V(G)$, the subgraph induced by its neighborhood contains at most $k$ edges. Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov showed that for $f &gt; 0$ if a graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ is $\Delta^2/f$-locally-sparse, then $\chi(G) = O\left(\Delta/\log f\right)$. We introduce a more general notion of local sparsity by defining graphs $G$ to be $(k, F)$-locally-sparse for some graph $F$ if for each vertex $v \in V(G)$ the subgraph induced by the neighborhood of $v$ contains at most $k$ copies of $F$. Employing the R\"{o}dl nibble method, we prove the following generalization of the above result: for every bipartite graph $F$, if $G$ is $(k, F)$-locally-sparse, then $\chi(G) = O\left( \Delta /\log\left(\Delta k^{-1/|V(F)|}\right)\right)$. This improves upon results of Davies, Kang, Pirot, and Sereni who consider the case when $F$ is a path. Our results also recover the best known bound on $\chi(G)$ when $G$ is $K_{1, t, t}$-free for $t \geq 4$, and hold for list and correspondence coloring in the more general so-called ''color-degree'' setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abstract polytopes generalize the face lattice of convex polytopes. A polytope is semiregular if its facets are regular and its automorphism group acts transitively on its vertices. In this paper we construct semiregular, facet-transitive polyhedra with trivial facet stabilizer, showing that semiregular abstract polyhedra can have an unbounded number of flag orbits, while having as little as one facet orbit. We interpret this construction in terms of operations applied to high rank regular and chiral polytopes, and we see how this same operations help us construct alternating semiregular polyhedra (that is, with two facet orbits and adjacent facets in different orbits). Finally, we give an idea to generalize this construction giving examples in higher ranks.</description>

Abstract: We use a graph-theoretic approach which yields improvements on the known Gilbert-Varshamov (GV) bound for sum-rank-metric codes for certain parameters. In particular, we show that asymptotically $\mathbb{F}_q^{\mathbf{n} \times \mathbf{m}}$ can be partitioned into sum-rank-metric codes whose average size is bigger than the GV bound by a logarithmic factor for these parameters. Finally, we discuss the connection of such codes to set-coloring Ramsey numbers.</description>

Abstract: Tropicalisation (with trivial coefficients) is a process that turns a polynomial equation into a combinatorial predicate on subsets of the set of variables. We show that for each minuscule representation of a simple reductive group, there is a set of quadratic equations cutting out the orbit of the highest weight vector whose tropicalisation characterises the set of Coxeter matroids for that representation which satisfy the strong exchange property.</description>

      <title>Magic Gems: A Polyhedral Framework for Magic Squares</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09170v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Magic Gems, a geometric representation of magic squares as three-dimensional polyhedra. By mapping an n times n magic square onto a centered coordinate grid with cell values as vertical displacements, we construct a point cloud whose convex hull defines the Magic Gem. Building on prior work connecting magic squares to physical properties such as moment of inertia, this construction reveals an explicit statistical structure: we show that magic squares have vanishing covariances between position and value. We develop a covariance energy functional (the sum of squared covariances with individual row, column, and diagonal indicator variables) and prove that for all orders of n greater than or equal to three, an arrangement is a magic square if and only if this complete energy vanishes. This characterization transforms the classical line-sum definition into a statistical orthogonality condition. We also study a simpler low-mode relaxation using only four aggregate position indicators; this coincides with the complete characterization for n equals three (verified exhaustively) but defines a strictly larger class for n greater than or equal to four (explicit counterexamples computed). Perturbation analysis demonstrates that magic squares are isolated local minima in the energy landscape. The representation is invariant under dihedral symmetry D4, yielding canonical geometric objects for equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>Vertex-edge domination on subclasses of bipartite graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a simple undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, the open neighbourhood of a vertex $v \in V$ is defined as $N_G(v) = \{u \in V \mid uv \in E\}$, and the closed neighbourhood as $N_G[v] = N_G(v) \cup \{v\}$. A subset $D \subseteq V$ is called a vertex-edge dominating set if, for every edge $uv \in E$, at least one vertex from $D$ appears in $N_G[u] \cup N_G[v]$; that is, $\vert (N_G[u] \cup N_G[v]) \cap D\vert \geq 1$. Intuitively, a vertex-edge dominating set ensures that every edge, as well as all edges incident to either of its endpoints, is dominated by at least one vertex from the set. The \textsc{Min-VEDS} problem asks for a vertex-edge dominating set of minimum size in a given graph. This problem is known to be NP-complete even for bipartite graphs. In this paper, we strengthen this hardness result by proving that the problem remains NP-complete for two specific subclasses of bipartite graphs: star-convex and comb-convex bipartite graphs. For a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, it is known that the \textsc{Min-VEDS} problem cannot be approximated within a factor of $(1 - \epsilon)\ln |V|$ for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, unless $\text{NP} \subseteq \text{DTIME}(|V|^{O(\log \log |V|)})$. We also prove that this inapproximability result holds even for star-convex and comb-convex bipartite graphs. On the positive side, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a minimum vertex-edge dominating set in convex bipartite graphs. A polynomial-time algorithm for this graph class was also proposed by B{\"u}y{\"u}k{\c{c}}olak et al.~\cite{buyukccolak2025linear}, but we show that their algorithm has certain flaws by providing instances where it fails to produce an optimal solution. We address this issue by presenting a modified algorithm that correctly computes an optimal solution.</description>

Abstract: Glaisher's theorem states that the number of partitions of $n$ into parts which repeat at most $m-1$ times is equal to the number of partitions of $n$ into parts which are not divisible by $m$. The $m=2$ case is Euler's famous partition theorem. Recently, Andrews, Kumar, and Yee gave two new partition functions $C(n)$ and $D(n)$ related to Euler's theorem. Lin and Zhang extended their result to Glaisher's theorem by generalizing $C(n)$. We generalize $D(n)$, prove an analogous partition identity for the $m=3$ case, and show that the general case is an example of an almost partition identity. We also provide a new series equal to Glaisher's product both in the finite and infinite cases.</description>

      <title>Toric Multivariate Gaussian Models from Symmetries in a Tree</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a rooted tree $T$ on $n$ non-root leaves with colored and zeroed nodes, we construct a linear space $L_T$ of $n\times n$ symmetric matrices with constraints determined by the combinatorics of the tree. When $L_T$ represents the covariance matrices of a Gaussian model, it provides natural generalizations of Brownian motion tree (BMT) models in phylogenetics. When $L_T$ represents a space of concentration matrices of a Gaussian model, it gives certain colored Gaussian graphical models, which we refer to as BMT derived models. We investigate conditions under which the reciprocal variety $L_T^{-1}$ is toric. Relying on the birational isomorphism of the inverse matrix map, we show that if the BMT derived graph of $T$ is vertex-regular and a block graph, under the derived Laplacian transformation, $L_T^{-1}$ is the vanishing locus of a toric ideal. This ideal is given by the sum of the toric ideal of the Gaussian graphical model on the block graph, the toric ideal of the original BMT model, and binomial linear conditions coming from vertex-regularity. To this end, we provide monomial parametrizations for these toric models realized through paths among leaves in $T$.</description>

      <title>Edge ideals with linear quotients and without homological linear quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A monomial ideal $I$ is said to have homological linear quotients if for each $k\geq 0$, the homological shift ideal $\mathrm{HS}_k(I)$ has linear quotients. It is a well-known fact that if an edge ideal $I(G)$ has homological linear quotients, then $G$ is co-chordal. We construct a family of co-chordal graphs $\{\mathrm{H}_n^c\}_{n\geq 6}$ and propose a conjecture that an edge ideal $I(G)$ has homological linear quotients if and only if $G$ is co-chordal and $\mathrm{H}_n^c$-free for any $n\geq 6$. In this paper, we prove one direction of the conjecture. Moreover, we study possible patterns of pairs $(G,k)$ of a co-chordal graph $G$ and integer $k$ such that $\mathrm{HS}_k(I(G))$ has linear quotients.</description>

      <title>Geometric calculations on probability manifolds from reciprocal relations in Master equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Onsager reciprocal relations model physical irreversible processes from complex systems. Recently, it has been shown that Onsager principles for master equations on finite states introduce a class of Riemannian metrics in a probability simplex, named probability manifolds. We call these manifolds finite-state generalized Wasserstein-$2$ spaces. In this paper, we study geometric calculations on probability manifolds, in which we derive the Levi-Civita connection, gradient, Hessian, and parallel transport, and compute the Riemannian and sectional curvatures. We present two examples of geometric quantities in probability manifolds. These include Levi-Civita connections from the chemical monomolecular triangle reaction and sectional, Ricci, and scalar curvatures in Wasserstein space on a three-point lattice.</description>

      <title>Congruences modulo $7$ and $11$ for certain two restricted partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an integer $c\geq 1$, let $a_c(n)$ count the number of generalized cubic partitions of $n$, which are partitions of $n$ whose even parts may appear in $c$ different colors, and $d_c(n)$ count the number of partitions obtained by adding the links of the $c$-elongated plane partition diamonds of length $n$. We prove in this note infinite families of congruences modulo $7$ and $11$ for $a_c(n)$ and $d_c(n)$ by employing elementary $q$-series techniques. These results generalize particular congruences modulo $7$ and $11$ for $a_c(n)$ and $d_c(n)$ recently found by Dockery, and Baruah, Das, and Talukdar, respectively, using modular forms.</description>

      <title>Every finite group is represented by a finite incidence geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between finite groups and incidence geometries through their automorphism structures. Building upon classical results on the realizability of groups as automorphism groups of graphs, we develop a general framework to represent pairs of finite groups $(G, H)$, where $H \trianglelefteq G$, as pairs of correlation--automorphism groups of suitable incidence geometries. Specifically, we prove that for every such pair $(G, H)$, there exists a finite incidence geometry $\Gamma$ satisfying that the pair $(\operatorname{Aut}(\Gamma), \operatorname{Aut}_I(\Gamma))$ of correlation--automorphism groups of $\Gamma$ is isomorphic to $(G, H)$. Our construction proceeds in two main steps: first, we realize $(G, H)$ as the correlation and automorphism groups of an incidence system; then, we refine this system into a genuine incidence geometry preserving the same pair of automorphisms groups. We also provide explicit examples, including a family of geometries realizing $(S_n, A_n)$ for all $n \ge 2$.</description>

Abstract: Quantum theory of geometrically frustrated systems is usually approached as a gauge theory where the local conservation law becomes the Gauss law. Here we show that it can do something fundamentally different: enforce a global conserved quantity via a non-perturbative tiling invariant, rigorously linking microscopic geometry to a new macroscopically phase-coherent state. In a frustrated bosonic model on the honeycomb lattice in the cluster-charging regime at fractional filling, this mechanism protects a conserved global quantum number, the sublattice polarization $\tilde{N} = N_A - N_B$. Quantum fluctuation drives the spontaneous symmetry breaking of this global U(1) symmetry to result in a supernematic (SN) phase -- an incompressible yet phase-coherent quantum state that breaks rotational symmetry without forming a superfluid or realizing topological order. This establishes a route to a novel quantum many-body state driven by combinatorial constraints.</description>

      <title>Stationary list colorings</title>

Abstract: Komjath studied the list chromatic number of infinite graphs and introduced the notion of restricted list chromatic number. For a graph $X=(V_X,E_X)$ and a cardinal $\kappa$, we say that $X$ is restricted list colorable for $\kappa$ if for every $L:V_X\to[\kappa]^\kappa$ there is a choice function $c$ of $L$ such that $c(v)\neq c(w)$ whenever ${v,w}\in E_X$. In this paper, we discuss a variation, stationary list colorability for $\kappa$, obtained by replacing $[\kappa]^\kappa$ with the set of all stationary subsets of $\kappa$. We compare the stationary list colorability with other coloring properties. Among other things, we prove that the stationary list colorability is essentially different from other coloring properties including the restricted list colorability. We also prove the consistency result showing that for some $\kappa&lt;\lambda$, restricted and stationary list colorability at $\kappa$ do not imply the corresponding properties at $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Generalized Interlacing Families: New Error Bounds for CUR Matrix Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of generalized interlacing families of polynomials, which extends the classical interlacing polynomial method to handle polynomials of varying degrees. We establish a fundamental property for these families, proving the existence of a polynomial with a desired degree whose smallest root is greater than or equal to the smallest root of the expected polynomial. Applying this framework to the generalized CUR matrix approximation problem, we derive a theoretical upper bound on the spectral norm of a residual matrix, expressed in terms of the largest root of the expected polynomial. We then explore two important special cases: the classical CUR matrix decompositions and the row subset selection problem. For classical CUR matrix decompositions, we derive an explicit upper bound for the largest root of the expected polynomial. This yields a tighter spectral norm error bound for the residual matrix compared to many existing results. Furthermore, we present a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for solving the classical CUR problem under certain matrix conditions. For the row subset selection problem, we establish the first known spectral norm error bound. This paper extends the applicability of interlacing families and deepens the theoretical foundations of CUR matrix decompositions and related approximation problems.</description>
