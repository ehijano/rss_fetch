      <title>Mitigating Distribution Shift in Stock Price Data via Return-Volatility Normalization for Accurate Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How can we address distribution shifts in stock price data to improve stock price prediction accuracy? Stock price prediction has attracted attention from both academia and industry, driven by its potential to uncover complex market patterns and enhance decisionmaking. However, existing methods often fail to handle distribution shifts effectively, focusing on scaling or representation adaptation without fully addressing distributional discrepancies and shape misalignments between training and test data. We propose ReVol (Return-Volatility Normalization for Mitigating Distribution Shift in Stock Price Data), a robust method for stock price prediction that explicitly addresses the distribution shift problem. ReVol leverages three key strategies to mitigate these shifts: (1) normalizing price features to remove sample-specific characteristics, including return, volatility, and price scale, (2) employing an attention-based module to estimate these characteristics accurately, thereby reducing the influence of market anomalies, and (3) reintegrating the sample characteristics into the predictive process, restoring the traits lost during normalization. Additionally, ReVol combines geometric Brownian motion for long-term trend modeling with neural networks for short-term pattern recognition, unifying their complementary strengths. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ReVol enhances the performance of the state-of-the-art backbone models in most cases, achieving an average improvement of more than 0.03 in IC and over 0.7 in SR across various settings.</description>

      <title>Federated Diffusion Modeling with Differential Privacy for Tabular Data Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for privacy-preserving data analytics in various domains necessitates solutions for synthetic data generation that rigorously uphold privacy standards. We introduce the DP-FedTabDiff framework, a novel integration of Differential Privacy, Federated Learning and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models designed to generate high-fidelity synthetic tabular data. This framework ensures compliance with privacy regulations while maintaining data utility. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DP-FedTabDiff on multiple real-world mixed-type tabular datasets, achieving significant improvements in privacy guarantees without compromising data quality. Our empirical evaluations reveal the optimal trade-offs between privacy budgets, client configurations, and federated optimization strategies. The results affirm the potential of DP-FedTabDiff to enable secure data sharing and analytics in highly regulated domains, paving the way for further advances in federated learning and privacy-preserving data synthesis.</description>
