      <title>Dual-mode rf cavity: design, tuning and performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and characterization of a dual-mode radiofrequency (rf) cavity, a novel electromagnetic structure with potential benefits such as compactness, efficiency, cost reduction and multifunctionality. The cavity was designed to balance the dual-mode structure considering several factors, such as mode frequencies, quality factor (Q-factor), and minimizing cross talk between couplers. We preformed various tests to verify that this cavity preformed as expected compared to simulated results. As exampled here, a combination of the the fundamental mode TM 010 and the TM 011 mode, tuned to a harmonic of the fundamental, was realized to linearize the off-crest electric field, thereby enabling concurrent bunching and acceleration of charged particle (e.g. electrons) beam in high power systems. The reduction in the number of cavities required to bunch and accelerate promises cost and space savings over conventional approaches. This research lays the foundation for further exploration of multi-mode cavity applications and optimization for specific use cases, with potential implications for a wide range of fields including quantum information platforms.</description>

      <title>Wave propagation in beams with multiple resonators: conditions for weak scattering and the Born approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reports the conditions under which weak scattering assumptions can be applied in a beam loaded by multiple resonators supporting both longitudinal and flexural waves. The work derives the equations of motion of a one-dimensional elastic waveguide with several point resonators by utilizing the Green's matrix approach. The derivations include any resonator morphology, either with a discrete or continuous distribution of resonances. The method employed is based on applying multiple scattering theory. The response can be expressed as an infinite series whose convergence is closely linked to the scattering intensity provided by the resonators. The convergence conditions are reduced to studying the spectral radius of the scattering matrix. Furthermore, the the leading order of the multiple scattering expansion is associated with the Born approximation. The work also provides approximate expressions for the spectral radius, offering a physical interpretation to the concept of weak scattering in beams. Several numerical examples are presented to validate the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Sampling requirements in near-field ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ptychography is a robust lensless form of microscopy routinely used for applications spanning life and physical sciences. The most common ptychography setup consists in using a detector to record diffraction patterns in the far-field. A near-field version has been more recently introduced, and its potential is yet to be fully exploited. In this work, the sampling requirements for near-field ptychography are analysed. Starting from the characterisation available in literature, the formalism of the fractional Fourier transform is used to generalise analytically the sampling conditions. The results harmonise the far- and near-field regimes and widen the applications of the technique with respect to the current knowledge. This study is supported by simulations and provides clear guidelines on how to optimise the setup and acquisition strategies for near-field ptychography experiments. The results are key to drive the translation of the technique towards low brilliance sources.</description>

      <title>Internal acoustic resonances: small scattering center compared with the wavelength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In fields such as acoustics, electromagnetism, and quantum physics, the scattering of waves by localized objects is a fundamental phenomenon. Building on this, the present study investigates the energy distribution within a spherical scattering center during its interaction with an incident acoustic wave. The analysis reveals unexpected resonance effects driven by impedance mismatches between the scattering center and the surrounding ideal fluid. These resonance phenomena occur even when the magnitude order of the incident wavelength is significantly larger compared to the size of the scattering center. Such resonance behavior, observed in the small-particle regime, has potential applications in ultrasound imaging, targeted drug delivery, and metamaterial design.</description>

      <title>Modulating the magnetic properties of Fe3C/C encapsulated core/shell nanoparticles for potential prospects in biomedicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the pursuit of alternative and less invasive medical treatments, magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) have gained significant relevance. Iron carbides NPs stand out for their higher saturation magnetizations compared to iron oxides, while maintaining a suitable biocompatibility. In this work, high control is achieved over the composition and morphology of Fe3C/C encapsulated core/shell nanoparticles through fine-tuning of the sol-gel synthesis parameters. Specifically, the impact of decreasing each surfactant concentration added, nt, the same both for oleylamine (ON) and oleic acid (OA), has been explored. A minimum value for such parameter denoted by nt,min. was required to produce pure Fe3C@C NP-composites. For nt &lt; 4 mmol, some minor {\alpha}-Fe impurities arise, and the effective carburization becomes unstable due to insufficient carbon. The magnetic properties of the materials prepared were optimized by reducing the excess carbon from surfactants, resulting in saturation magnetization values of 86 emu/g. (for pure Fe3C at nt = 5 mmol) and 102 emu/g (for Fe3C and &lt;2 % w.t. of {\alpha}-Fe impurity at nt = 4 mmol). In view of this, several cytotoxicity studies for different Fe3C@C samples were conducted, exhibiting excellent biocompatibility in cell-based assays, which could lead to potential application at the forefront of biomedical fields.</description>

      <title>Electron Beam Characterization of REBCO-Coated Conductors at Cryogenic Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle accelerators with superconducting magnets operating at cryogenic temperatures use a beam screen (BS) liner that extracts heat generated by the circulating bunched charge particle beam before it can reach the magnets. The BS surface, commonly made of high-conductivity copper, provides a low impedance for beam stability reasons, low secondary electron yield (SEY)to mitigate the electron-cloud (EC) effect, and low electron-stimulated desorption yield (ESD) to limit the dynamic pressure rise due to EC. Rare-earth barium copper oxide (REBCO) high-temperature superconductors (HTs) recently reached technical maturity, are produced as coated conductor tapes (REBCO-CCs), and will be considered for application in future colliders to decrease the BS impedance and enable operation at around 50 K, consequently relaxing the cryogenic requirements. Aside from HTS properties, industry-grade REBCO-CCs also need qualification for EC and dynamic vacuum compatibility under accelerator-like conditions. Hence, we report the SEY and ESD measured at cryogenic temperatures of 12 K under low-energy electron irradiation of 0 - 1.4 keV. We also verify the sample compositions and morphologies using XPS, SEM, and EDS methods. The energy and dose dependencies of ESD are comparable to those of technical-grade metals and one sample reached SEY$_{MAX}=$1.2 after electron conditioning.</description>

      <title>Metal-Mesh Linear Variable Filter for Far-Infrared Wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future far-infrared (IR) observatories require compact and cost efficient optical linear variable bandpass filters (LVBFs) to define their instrument spectral bands. We have designed novel far-IR LVBFs that consist of metal-mesh bandpass filters comprised of a gold film with cross-slots of varying sizes along a silicon (Si) substrate with anti-reflection (AR) coatings. We present our work on the simulated and measured transmission of non-AR coated and AR coated LVBFs for bandpass peaks from wavelengths of 24 to 36 $\mu$m with a resolving power ($R=\lambda_0/\Delta\lambda$) of R$\approx$6 for non-AR coated LVBFs and R$\approx$4 for AR coated LVBFs. We also present a method to decrease the effects of out-of-band high frequency transmission exhibited by metal-mesh filters by depositing a thin layer of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) on the metal-mesh of the LVBF. We have fabricated and measured the LVBFs at room temperature and cryogenic temperatures (5 K). We measure a high peak transmission of $\sim$80-90 \% for the AR coated LVBF at 5 K and demonstrate that the a-Si:H LVBF is a promising method to address out-of-band high frequency transmission.</description>

      <title>New approach to designing functional materials for stealth technology: Radar experiment with bilayer absorbers and optimization of the reflection loss</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microwave power absorption by a two-layer system deposited on a metallic surface has been studied in the experimental setup emulating the response to a radar signal. Layers containing hexaferrite and iron powder in a dried paint of thickness under 1mm have been used. The data is analyzed within a theoretical model derived for a bilayer system from the transmission line theory. A good agreement between experimental and theoretical results is found. The advantage of using a bilayer system over a single-layer system has been demonstrated. How the maximum microwave absorption (minimum reflection loss) can be achieved through the optimization of the filling factors and thicknesses of the two layers is shown.</description>

      <title>A Rydberg atom based system for benchmarking mmWave automotive radar chips</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic sensors and receivers have enabled sensitive and traceable measurements of RF fields at a wide range of frequencies. Here we demonstrate the detection of electric field amplitude in the extremely high frequency (EHF) band, at $131\ \mathrm{GHz}$. In our approach we propagate the EHF field in a beam, with control over its direction and polarization at the detector using photonic waveplates. This way, we take advantage of the highest detection sensitivity, registered for collinear propagation and circular polarization. To exhibit the potential for applications in this kind of Rydberg-atom based detection, we perform test measurements on the EHF field emitted from an on-chip radar, planned to be used in automotive industry as a vital sign detector. Our work elucidates practical applications of Rydberg-atom media as well as photonic metamaterial elements.</description>

      <title>Microwave absorption in barium hexaferrite nanocomposites with random anisotropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work reports experimental evidence of random magnetic behavior observed in modified barium hexagonal ferrites. We observe a significant transition in the magnetic properties of this system when divalent cations (Ni2+, Cu2+, Mn2+) are incorporated into the structure and give rise to a magnetic nanocomposite. Such introduction randomly occurs throughout each sample and creates conditions for such materials to behave as random anisotropy magnets. We verify the occurrence of such behavior in our samples by fitting the magnetization in approaching saturation to the corresponding theoretical model. We therefore analyze the microwave absorption capacities of random anisotropy magnets in the GHz range and predict large and broad absorption signals under certain conditions. The findings presented here postulate, for the first time, ceramic materials as promising random anisotropy magnets and underline their potential as microwave absorbers, in good agreement with recent theoretical models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electromagnetic properties and microwave absorption capabilities are studied in an anechoic chamber under real radar conditions for mono and bilayer composite samples consisting of a polymeric matrix and a magnetic powder filler, either metallic or ceramic. The effect of the filler type and the filling factor is investigated. The results demonstrate exceptional broadband microwave absorption, making these materials highly suitable for stealth technology applications. The experimentally measured absorptions reach -40 dB, while model-based predictions suggest that these systems could overpass the barrier of -50 dB. The experimental results are supported by models, both for single and bilayer systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A strong increase of the reflection loss (from 25 up to 35 dBs) and an extension of the absorption bandwidth up to 20% under far-field real radar conditions are experimentally reported in this work by creating a functional bilayer system. Each layer consists of a composite material, typically a dielectric matrix filled with magnetic entities (powder or wires). Combining the two types of materials into a bilayer structure has shown unprecedented improvements in microwave absorption capacities compared to the former absorption of each layer. The potential of random magnets to create thin broadband absorbers is also demonstrated. The capacity to improve the shielding behavior is strongly related to each layer's permittivity, permeability, and thickness. This provides strong control over the design of novel materials for stealth applications.</description>

      <title>Low-characteristic-impedance superconducting tadpole resonators in the sub-gigahertz regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a simple and versatile resonator design based on a short strip of a typical coplanar waveguide shorted at one end to the ground and shunted at the other end with a large parallel-plate capacitor. Due to the shape of the structure, we coin it the tadpole resonator. The design allows tailoring the characteristic impedance of the resonator to especially suit applications requiring low values. We demonstrate characteristic impedances ranging from $Z_c = 2\,{\Omega}$ to $10\,{\Omega}$ and a frequency range from $f_0 = 290\,\mathrm{MHz}$ to $1.1\,\mathrm{GHz}$ while reaching internal quality factors of order $Q_{\mathrm{int}} = 8.5\times 10^3$ translating into a loss tangent of $\tan({\delta}) = 1.2\times 10^{-4}$ for the aluminium oxide used as the dielectric in the parallel plate capacitor. We conclude that these tadpole resonators are well suited for applications requiring low frequency and low charactersitic impedance while maintaining a small footprint on chip. The low characteristic impedance of the tadpole resonator renders it a promising candidate for achieving strong inductive coupling to other microwave components.</description>

      <title>Automated Segmentation and Analysis of Microscopy Images of Laser Powder Bed Fusion Melt Tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing adoption of metal additive manufacturing (AM), researchers and practitioners are turning to data-driven approaches to optimise printing conditions. Cross-sectional images of melt tracks provide valuable information for tuning process parameters, developing parameter scaling data, and identifying defects. Here we present an image segmentation neural network that automatically identifies and measures melt track dimensions from a cross-section image. We use a U-Net architecture to train on a data set of 62 pre-labelled images obtained from different labs, machines, and materials coupled with image augmentation. When neural network hyperparameters such as batch size and learning rate are properly tuned, the learned model shows an accuracy for classification of over 99% and an F1 score over 90%. The neural network exhibits robustness when tested on images captured by various users, printed on different machines, and acquired using different microscopes. A post-processing module extracts the height and width of the melt pool, and the wetting angles. We discuss opportunities to improve model performance and avenues for transfer learning, such as extension to other AM processes such as directed energy deposition.</description>
