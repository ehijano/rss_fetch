      <title>Can Large Language Models Trade? Testing Financial Theories with LLM Agents in Market Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a realistic simulated stock market where large language models (LLMs) act as heterogeneous competing trading agents. The open-source framework incorporates a persistent order book with market and limit orders, partial fills, dividends, and equilibrium clearing alongside agents with varied strategies, information sets, and endowments. Agents submit standardized decisions using structured outputs and function calls while expressing their reasoning in natural language. Three findings emerge: First, LLMs demonstrate consistent strategy adherence and can function as value investors, momentum traders, or market makers per their instructions. Second, market dynamics exhibit features of real financial markets, including price discovery, bubbles, underreaction, and strategic liquidity provision. Third, the framework enables analysis of LLMs' responses to varying market conditions, similar to partial dependence plots in machine-learning interpretability. The framework allows simulating financial theories without closed-form solutions, creating experimental designs that would be costly with human participants, and establishing how prompts can generate correlated behaviors affecting market stability.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Inventory Management with Mean-Field Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.17208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agents attempt to maximize expected profits earned by selling multiple units of a perishable product where their revenue streams are affected by the prices they quote as well as the distribution of other prices quoted in the market by other agents. We propose a model which captures this competitive effect and directly analyze the model in the mean-field limit as the number of agents is very large. We classify mean-field Nash equilibrium in terms of the solution to a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and a consistency condition and use this to motivate an iterative numerical algorithm to compute equilibrium. Properties of the equilibrium pricing strategies and overall market dynamics are then investigated, in particular how they depend on the strength of the competitive interaction and the ability to oversell the product.</description>
