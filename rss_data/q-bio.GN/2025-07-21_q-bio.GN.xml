      <title>Rawsamble: Overlapping and Assembling Raw Nanopore Signals using a Hash-based Seeding Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Raw nanopore signal analysis is a common approach in genomics to provide fast and resource-efficient analysis without translating the signals to bases (i.e., without basecalling). However, existing solutions cannot interpret raw signals directly if a reference genome is unknown due to a lack of accurate mechanisms to handle increased noise in pairwise raw signal comparison. Our goal is to enable the direct analysis of raw signals without a reference genome. To this end, we propose Rawsamble, the first mechanism that can identify regions of similarity between all raw signal pairs, known as all-vs-all overlapping, using a hash-based search mechanism. We show that an off-the-shelf assembler (i.e., miniasm) can use the overlaps found by Rawsamble to construct genomes from scratch (i.e., de novo assembly). Our extensive evaluations across multiple genomes of varying sizes show that Rawsamble provides a significant speedup (on average by 4.48x and up to 23.10x) and reduces peak memory usage (on average by 4.33x and up to by 22.00x) compared to a conventional genome assembly pipeline using the state-of-the-art tools for basecalling (Dorado's fastest mode) and overlapping (minimap2) on a CPU. We find that 30.94% of overlapping pairs generated by Rawsamble are identical to those generated by minimap2. We further evaluate the benefits and directions that this new overlapping approach can enable in two ways. First, by constructing and evaluating the assembly graphs from the Rawsamble overlaps, we show that we can construct accurate and contiguous assembly segments (unitigs) up to 2.3 million bases in length (almost half the genome length of E. coli). Second, we identify previously unexplored directions that can be enabled by finding overlaps and constructing de novo assemblies as well as the challenges to tackle these future directions.

      <title>Explainable AI in Genomics: Transcription Factor Binding Site Prediction with Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transcription Factor Binding Site (TFBS) prediction is crucial for understanding gene regulation and various biological processes. This study introduces a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach for TFBS prediction, integrating multiple pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, each specializing in different TFBS patterns. We evaluate the performance of our MoE model against individual expert models on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, using six randomly selected transcription factors (TFs) for OOD testing. Our results demonstrate that the MoE model achieves competitive or superior performance across diverse TF binding sites, particularly excelling in OOD scenarios. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) statistical test confirms the significance of these performance differences. Additionally, we introduce ShiftSmooth, a novel attribution mapping technique that provides more robust model interpretability by considering small shifts in input sequences. Through comprehensive explainability analysis, we show that ShiftSmooth offers superior attribution for motif discovery and localization compared to traditional Vanilla Gradient methods. Our work presents an efficient, generalizable, and interpretable solution for TFBS prediction, potentially enabling new discoveries in genome biology and advancing our understanding of transcriptional regulation.</description>
