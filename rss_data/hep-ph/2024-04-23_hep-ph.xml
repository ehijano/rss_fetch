      <title>A Multiverse Outside of the Swampland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Multiverse can arise from landscapes without de Sitter minima. It can be populated during a period of eternal inflation without trans-Planckian field excursions and without flat potentials. This Multiverse can explain the values of the cosmological constant and of the weak scale. In the process of proving these statements we derive a few simple, but counter-intuitive results. We show that it is easy to write models of eternal inflation compatible with the distance and refined de Sitter conjectures. Secondly, tunneling transitions that move fields from a lower-energy vacuum to a higher-energy vacuum and generate baby Universes are possible, and occur during eternal inflation. Finally, we relax the assumption of no de Sitter minima and show that this more standard Multiverse can be populated by Coleman-De Luccia transitions in about 100 $e$-folds of inflation.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detecting the couplings of axion-like particle with neutrinos at the CEPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of detecting the couplings of axion-like particle (ALP) with leptons from their loop-level impact on the ALP couplings to electroweak (EW) gauge bosons via the signal process $e^+ e^- \to \gamma \gamma /E$ at the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) and obtain prospective sensitivities to the ALP-lepton couplings. Our numerical results show that the CEPC with the center of mass energy $\sqrt{s}=240$ GeV and the integrated luminosity $\mathcal{L}=$ $5.6$ ab$^{-1}$ might be sensitive for probing the ALP-lepton couplings in the ALP mass range from $10$ GeV to $130$ GeV, where the prospective sensitivities to the ALP-neutrino coupling $Tr(g_{a\nu\nu})/f_a$ can be as low as $0.016$ GeV$^{-1}$ and $0.0031$ GeV$^{-1}$ for $c_{R}=0$ and $c_{R}=c_{L}$, and to the ALP-charged lepton coupling $Tr(g_{a\ell\ell})/f_a$ can be as low as $0.035$ GeV$^{-1}$ for $c_{L}=0$. We find that the prospective sensitivities given by the CEPC are not covered by the current exclusion regions in some ALP mass intervals. The CEPC has the potential for exploring the ALP-neutrino couplings via some promising processes induced by the ALP-EW gauge boson couplings in the future.</description>

      <title>String-based parametrization of nucleon GPDs at any skewness: a comparison to lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a string-based parametrization for nucleon quark and gluon generalized parton distributions (GPDs) effective across all skewness values. The conformal moments of the GPDs are expressed as sums of the spin-j nucleon A-form factor, and the skewness-dependent spin-j nucleon D-form factor. This representation, which fulfills the polynomiality condition and does not rely on model-specific assumptions, is derived from t-channel string exchanges in AdS spaces. The spin-j nucleon D-form factor is closely related to the the spin-j nucleon A-form factor. We use the Mellin moments from empirical parton distributions to model the spin-j nucleon A-form factors. Using only five Regge slope parameters, fixed from the electromagnetic and gravitational form factors, our string-based parametrization generates accurate singlet, non-singlet, isovector, and flavor-separated nucleon quark GPDs, along with symmetric nucleon gluon GPDs from their Mellin-Barnes integral representations. Our isovector nucleon quark GPD is in agreement with existing lattice data. Our string-based parametrization should enhance the empirical extraction and global analysis of nucleon GPDs in exclusive processes, bypassing the de-convolution problem.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of 3-3-1 models with radiative inverse seesaw mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose two models based on the $SU(3)_C \times SU(3)_L \times U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry, each incorporating distinct inverse seesaw mechanisms for generating neutrino masses at the radiative level. Therefore, neutrino masses are suppressed by the radiative nature of the mass generation mechanism, which occurs after the spontaneous breaking of the global lepton number symmetry. Both scenarios discussed here are characterized by the presence of vector-like charged leptons, which are involved in generating the masses of the Standard Model charged leptons. These additional vector-like fermions contribute to the anomalous magnetic moments of the electron and the muon. We perform a detailed analysis of the scalar sectors, show that these models can successfully accommodate the observed baryon asymmetry through resonant leptogenesis, and compute charged lepton flavor-violating decays, such as $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$. We discuss the constraints of the model arising from these processes and those associated the non-unitarity of the lepton mixing matrix.</description>

      <title>Impact of Noncommutative Spacetime on Anomalous Magnetic Moment of Muon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model is a theory that accurately predicts the interactions of fundamental particles. However, in recent years, certain phenomena have arisen that cannot be explained by this theory. One particular challenge is the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Various theories have been proposed in the Beyond Standard Model, with the aim of addressing these anomalies. One such theory is the Noncommutative Space-Time, which places importance on the noncommutative parameter ($\theta ^{\mu \nu}$). Different values for this parameter have been explored in various articles. However, in this particular article, we utilize the most precise values of $ (240 \, TeV)^{-2}$ for muons and $(3000 \, TeV)^{-2}$ for electrons, in order to align our findings more closely with reality. The tree level diagram for the muon in the Seiberg-Witten map has not yet been calculated. However, we have performed this calculation and predict the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon to be approximately $10^{-10}$. The Noncommutative Space-Time theory yields accurate results in both high energy and low energy physics. Furthermore, the predicted electric dipole moment for the muon and electron, using the parameters outlined in this study are about $10^{-24}$ e.cm for the muon and $10^{-34}$ e.cm for the electron.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological Constant Problem and the Extra Dimensions of $\mathcal{N}=2$ $\mathcal{D}=5$ Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an interpretation for the cosmological constant problem based on modeling the universe as a 3-brane embedded in the bulk of 5-dimensional supergravity with hypermultiplets. When solving the modified Friedmann equations the complex structure moduli of the Calabi-Yau manifold cancel the large value of the vacuum energy density on the brane, wherein this value transfers to an Anti-de Sitter fifth dimensional bulk compactified on a scale $ (\sim 10^{-26} ~\text{m}) $. An effective dark energy density is produced on the brane which equals the observed value responsible for the late-time acceleration of the universe. The bulk undergoes a decelerated contraction while we show that cosmic expansion of the brane-universe consists with the recent observed data of the $\Lambda$CDM model. On the other hand, through this model, the hierarchy between the electroweak scale $(M_{EW}= 100 ~ \text{GeV})$ and the Planck scale $(M_{pl} \sim 10^{18} ~ \text{GeV})$ is interpreted by compactifying the 6-extra dimensions of $\mathcal{D}=5$ supergravity on a sub-millimeters scale, where the fundamental scale of gravity within these extra dimensions is $\mathcal{M}_{EW}$.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simmons electrodynamics and torsion dark matter axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we delve into the influence of torsion axial pseudo vector on dark photons in an axion torsionic background, as investigated previously by Duncan et al[ Nucl Phys B 387:215 (1992)]. Notably, axial torsion, owing to its significantly greater mass compared to axions, gives rise to magnetic helicity in torsionful Chern-Simons (CS) electrodynamics, leading to the damping of magnetic fields. In QCD scale the damping from dark massive photons leads us to obtain a magnetic field of $10^{-8}$ Gauss, which is approximated the order of magnitude of magnetic fields at present universe. This result is obtained by considering that torsion has the value of the 1 MeV at the early universe, and can be improved to the higher value of $10^{-3}$ Gauss when the axial torsion 0-component is given by $10^{8}$ MeV and the mass of dark photon is approximated equal to the axion. The axion plays a crucial role in achieving CS dynamo action arising from axions. This study is useful in deepening our understanding of fundamental physics, from nuclear interactions to the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Electron and Muon $(g-2)_{e,\mu}$ Anomalous Magnetic Moment in $U(1)_{L_e-L_{\mu}}$ Symmetry Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of neutrino (whether Majorana or Dirac) and the origin of neutrino masses are still some of the mysteries to be resolved. Also, the recent results on (g-2)$_{e,\mu}$ measurements deviate from the Standard Model (SM) predictions and motivate us towards new physics beyond the SM. In this work, we propose a model with the minimal field content in the framework of anomaly free extension of Standard Model; i.e. U(1)$_{L_e-L_{\mu}}$ symmetry model. We find this model capable of explaining the low energy neutrino phenomenology and anomalous magnetic moment(g-2)$_{e,\mu}$ of electron and muon, simultaneously. The field content is extended by a SU(2)$_L$ singlet scalar field $\phi$ and three right handed neutrinos N$_R$(R = 1,2,3). Thus, the neutrino masses are generated using the Type-I seesaw mechanism. The extended model leads to the results, which are in consistency with the experimental values of (g-2)$_{e,\mu}$ and also satisfy all the relevant experimental data.</description>

      <title>Ratios of the light quark masses: Cubic curve vs ellipse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bounds on the light quark masses are obtained by fitting the squares of pseudoscalar meson masses $m_\pi^2$ and $m_K^2$ to second order in $1/N_c$ expansion. The result is an algebraic cubic curve whose coefficients are the known Weinberg values for the quark mass ratios $m_u/m_d$ and $m_s/m_d$. Additional restrictions arise when using the ratio $m_s/m_{ud}=27.23(10)$ quoted by FLAG for lattice simulations with four quark flavors. This provides a tight constraint on the ratio $m_u/m_d = 0.455(8)$.</description>

      <title>Transverse structure of the proton beyond leading twist: A light-front Hamiltonian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the Basis Light-Front Quantization framework, we systematically investigate the subleading twist (twist-3) transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs) of the proton beyond the Wandzura-Wilczek (WW) approximation. The subleading twist TMDs are not independent and can be decomposed into twist-2 and genuine twist-3 terms from the equations of motion. The latter involves quark-quark-gluon correlations and contains interferences between two light-front Fock sectors, $|qqq\rangle$ and $|qqqg\rangle$, which are usually neglected in the WW approximation.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in flavored scalar scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum entanglement in high-energy $2\to 2$ scalar scattering, where the scalars are characterized by an internal flavor quantum number acting like a qubit. Working at the 1-loop order in perturbation theory, we build the final-state density matrix as a function of the scattering amplitudes connecting the initial to the outgoing state. In this construction, the unitarity of the $S$-matrix is guaranteed at the required order by the optical theorem. We consider the post-scattering entanglement between the momentum and flavor degrees of freedom of the final-state particles, as well as the entanglement of the two-qubit flavor subsystem. In each case we identify the couplings of the scalar potential that can generate, destroy, or transfer entanglement between different bipartite subspaces of the Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Discovering Quirks through Timing at FASER and Future Forward Experiments at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quirks are generic predictions of strongly-coupled dark sectors. For weak-scale masses and a broad range of confining scales in the dark sector, quirks can be discovered only at the energy frontier, but quirk--anti-quirk pairs are produced with unusual signatures at low $p_T$, making them difficult to detect at the large LHC detectors. We determine the prospects for discovering quirks using timing information at FASER, FASER2, and an "ultimate detector'' in the far-forward region at the LHC. NLO QCD corrections are incorporated in the simulation of quirk production, which can significantly increase the production rate. To accurately propagate quirk pairs from the ATLAS interaction point to the forward detectors, the ionization energy loss of charged quirks traveling through matter, the radiation of infracolor glueballs and QCD hadrons during quirk pair oscillations, and the annihilation of quirkonium are properly considered. The quirk signal is separated from the large muon background using timing information from scintillator detectors by requiring either two coincident delayed tracks, based on arrival times at the detector, or two coincident slow tracks, based on time differences between hits in the front and back scintillators. We find that simple cuts preserve much of the signal, but reduce the muon background to negligible levels. With the data already collected, FASER can discover quirks in currently unconstrained parameter space. FASER2, running at the Forward Physics Facility during the HL-LHC era, will greatly extend this reach, probing the TeV-scale quirk masses motivated by the gauge hierarchy problem for the broad range of dark-sector confining scales between 100 eV and 100 keV.</description>

      <title>Producing Fully-Charmed Tetraquarks via Charm Quark Fragmentation in Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD), we calculate the fragmentation function for a charm quark into an $S$-wave fully-charmed tetraquark, denoted as $T_{4c}$. The charm-to-$T_{4c}$ fragmentation function can be expressed as a sum of products of the perturbatively calculable short-distance coefficients and the nonperturbative long-distance matrix elements. The short-distance coefficients are ascertained through the perturbative matching procedure at lowest order in $\alpha_{s}$ and $v$ expansion. Incorporating the celebrated QCD factorization and the charm-to-$T_{4c}$ fragmentation function, we are able to predict the $T_{4c}$ production rate at high transverse momentum $p_T$ in colliders. In phenomenology, we approximate the NRQCD matrix elements with phenomenological four-body wave functions at the origin. After applying appropriate kinematic constraints, both the differential distribution over $p_T$ and the integrated cross sections are predicted at the \texttt{LHC}. The cross section can reach approximately $100$ fb, indicating the potential for a significant number of $T_{4c}$ events to be produced at the \texttt{LHC}. Additionally, we provide predictions for the photoproduction of $T_{4c}$ in electron-proton ($ep$) collisions. However, it is observed that the cross sections for these processes are relatively small at the \texttt{HERA}, \texttt{EIC} as well as \texttt{EicC}. Given these findings, the prospect of detecting these fully heavy tetraquarks at $ep$ colliders appears to be rather challenging.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the chiral-odd generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of the $\bar{u}$ and $\bar{d}$ quarks inside the proton at zero skewness using the overlap representation within the light cone formalism. Using the light cone wave functions (LCWFs) of the proton obtained from the baryon-meson fluctuation model in terms of the $|q\bar{q}B\rangle$ Fock states, we provide the expressions of the GPDs $\widetilde{H}^{\bar{q}/P}_T(x,0,t)$, $H_T^{\bar{q}/P}(x,0,t)$ and $E_T^{\bar{q}/P}(x,0,t)$ for $\bar{q}=\bar{u}$ and $\bar{d}$. Numerical results for these GPDs in momentum space as well as in impact parameter space are presented. We further investigate certain combinations of the chiral-odd GPDs in impact parameter space to the spin-orbit correlation effect of the sea quarks.</description>

      <title>DALI sensitivity to streaming axion dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter substructures emerge naturally in a scenario in which the axion angular field acquires propagating degrees of freedom in a post-inflationary Universe. The DALI experiment is a new generation wavy dark matters interferometer currently in prototyping. Although DALI's main objective is to explore the virialized DM in our Galaxy, to a large degree in this article we explore the prospect for detection of fine grained streams made of axions that would enter the Solar System, as suggested by previous work. We find that DALI will have a sensitivity to encounters with these coherent objects that fully spans the window defined by the coupling strength to photons of representative axion models over a stacked bandwidth of two decades in mass.</description>

      <title>Two-Loop Contributions to the Anomalous Chromomagnetic Dipole Moment of the Top Quark in Two-Higgs-Doublet Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analytical results for the anomalous chromomagnetic moment of a quark at the one-loop and two-loop levels through model-independent parameterizations, considering the external gluon to be off-shell. Then, we consider different types of two-Higgs doublet models with the momentum transfer of the external gluon, $q^2 = \pm M_Z^2$, and $0$, for the numerical evaluations thereof for the top quark. We find that the contributions in the two-Higgs-doublet models are on the order of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ at the one-loop level and $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$ at the two-loop level, where the one-loop and two-loop contributions interfere destructively, resulting in the overall contributions being on the order of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ with a positive sign.</description>

      <title>Likelihood analysis of the newly observed $f_0(2020)$, $f_0(2330)$ and $f_0(2470)$ in $J/\psi\to \gamma\eta^\prime\eta^\prime$ as high-lying unflavored scalar mesons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the newly observed three scalar states $f_0(2020)$, $f_0(2330)$, and $f_0(2470)$ by the BESII Collaboration in $J/\psi\to \gamma\eta^\prime\eta^\prime$, we carried out the study of spectroscopic behavior of these high-lying unflavored scalar mesonic states. In this work, using the Regge trajectory analysis and the quark pair creation model, we discussed the assignments of the $f_0(2020)$, $f_0(2330)$, and $f_0(2470)$ associated with the $f_0(2200)$ as the isoscalar high-lying scalar mesonic states and predicted the spectroscopic properties of their high-lying partners. The present study may provide valuable information for the construction of the scalar meson family.</description>

      <title>Local univalence versus stability and causality in hydrodynamic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our main objective is to compare the analytic properties of hydrodynamic series with the stability and causality conditions applied to hydrodynamic modes. Analyticity, in this context, implies that the hydrodynamic series behaves as a univalent or single-valued function. Stability and causality adhere to physical constraints where hydrodynamic modes neither exhibit exponential growth nor travel faster than the speed of light. Through an examination of various hydrodynamic models, such as the Muller-Israel-Stewart (MIS) and the first-order hydro models like the BDNK (Bemfica-Disconzi-Noronha-Kovtun) model, we observe no new restrictions stemming from the analyticity limits in the shear channel of these models. However, local univalence is maintained in the sound channel of these models despite the global divergence of the hydrodynamic series. Notably, differences in the sound equations between the MIS and BDNK models lead to distinct analyticity limits. The MIS model's sound mode remains univalent at high momenta within a specific transport range. Conversely, in the BDNK model, the univalence of the sound mode extends to intermediate momenta across all stable and causal regions. Generally, the convergence radius is independent of univalence and the given dispersion relation predominantly influences their correlation. For second-order frequency dispersions, the relationship is precise, i.e. within the convergence radius, the hydro series demonstrates univalence. However, with higher-order dispersions, the hydro series is locally univalent within certain transport regions, which may fall within or outside the stable and causal zones.</description>

      <title>Complete $CP$ Eigen-bases of Mesonic Chiral Lagrangian up to $p^8$-order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral perturbation theory systematically describes the low energy dynamics of meson and baryons using nonlinear Nambu-Goldstone fields. Using the Young tensor technique, we construct the pure mesonic effective operators up to $p^8$-order, one-to-one corresponding to contact amplitudes with the on-shell Adler zero condition. The off-shell external sources, non-vanishing under equation-of-motion conditions, are also added to the operator bases. We also show the invariant tensor bases using the Young tableau is equivalent to the trace bases with Cayley-Hamilton relations. Separated into different $CP$ eigenstates, at $\mathcal{O}(p^8)$ we obtain the operator lists of the 567 $C$+$P$+ operators, 483 $C$+$P$- operators, 376 $C$-$P$+ operators, and 408 $C$-$P$- operators for $SU(2)$ case, while there are 1959 $C$+$P$+ operators, 1809 $C$+$P$- operators, 1520 $C$-$P$+ operators, and 1594 $C$-$P$- operators for $SU(3)$ case, consistent with results using the Hilbert series.</description>

      <title>Topological susceptibility and axion potential in two-flavor superconductive quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the potential of the axion, $a$, of Quantum Chromodynamics, in the two-flavor color superconducting phase of cold and dense quark matter. We adopt a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-like model. Our interaction contains two terms, one preserving and one breaking the $U(1)_A$ symmetry: the latter is responsible of the coupling of axions to quarks. We introduce two quark condensates, $h_L$ and $h_R$, describing condensation for left-handed and right-handed quarks respectively; we then study the loci of the minima of the thermodynamic potential, $\Omega$, in the $(h_L,h_R)$ plane, noticing how the instanton-induced interaction favors condensation in the scalar channel when the $\theta-$angle, $\theta=a/f_a$, vanishes. Increasing $\theta$ we find a phase transition where the scalar condensate rotates into a pseudo-scalar one. We present an analytical result for the topological susceptibility, $\chi$, in the superconductive phase, which stands both at zero and at finite temperature. Finally, we compute the axion mass and its self-coupling. In particular, the axion mass $m_a$ is related to the full topological susceptibility via $\chi=m_a^2 f_a^2$, hence our result for $\chi$ gives an analytical result for $m_a$ in the superconductive phase of high-density Quantum Chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Two New $\mu-\tau$ Deviated Neutrino Mass Matrix Textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose two new neutrino mass matrix textures deviating from $\mu-\tau$ symmetry and explore their phenomenological implications. Both textures predict $\theta_{23}$ and $\delta$ within sharp bounds while considering both normal and inverted ordering of neutrino masses. We try to realize these proposed textures within the framework of the seesaw mechanism, in association with the $SU(2)_L \times A_4 \times Z_3$ symmetry group.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the exclusive two-body nonleptonic $B_s^0\to J/\psi K_s$ decay by considering the tree-level diagram within the framework of relativistic independent quark (RIQ) model based on a flavor-independent interaction potential in scalar-vector harmonic form. Using the factorization approximation, we calculate the weak form factors from the overlapping integrals of meson wave functions obtained in the RIQ model and predict the BF for $B_s^0\to J/\psi K_s$ decays in reasonable agreement with existing experimental result. Branching fraction of this decay is found to be within the detection ability of the LHCb Collaboration and can also be compared with the future theoretical predictions. We predict the ratio: ${\cal R}\big(\frac{{\cal B}(B_s^0\to J/\psi K_s)}{{\cal B}(B_d^0\to J/\psi K_s)}\big)$ which is in broad agreement with the data from LHCb Collaborations. This results indicate that the present approach works well in the description of exclusive nonleptonic $B_s^0\to J/\psi K_s$ decays within the framework of the RIQ model.</description>

      <title>The Alaric parton shower for hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Alaric parton shower for simulating QCD radiation at hadron colliders and present numerical results from an implementation in the event generator Sherpa. Alaric provides a consistent framework to quantify certain systematic uncertainties which cannot be eliminated by comparing the parton shower with analytic resummation. In particular, it allows to study recoil effects away from the soft and collinear limits without the need to change the evolution variable or the splitting functions. We assess the performance of Alaric in Drell-Yan lepton pair and QCD jet production, and present the first multi-jet merging for the new algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review a recently proposed SuperGeometric (SG) approach to Quantum Field Theories (QFTs) that allow for scalar-fermion field transformations in a manifestly reparameterisation covariant manner. By adopting natural choices for the field-space supermetric, we show how a non-trivial field-space Riemannian curvature can be introduced in the fermionic sector, beyond the usual one that may have its origin in the scalar part of the theory. We present a minimal SG-QFT model with proper non-zero fermionic curvature both in two and four spacetime dimensions. Possible future directions in further developing SG-QFTs are discussed.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-Ray Propagation Models Elucidate the Prospects for Antinuclei Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tentative observations of cosmic-ray antihelium by the AMS-02 collaboration have re-energized the quest to use antinuclei to search for physics beyond the standard model. However, our transition to a data-driven era requires more accurate models of the expected astrophysical antinuclei fluxes. We use a state-of-the-art cosmic-ray propagation model, fit to high-precision antiproton and cosmic-ray nuclei (B, Be, Li) data, to constrain the antinuclei flux from both astrophysical and dark matter annihilation models. We show that astrophysical sources are capable of producing $\mathcal{O}(1)$ antideuteron events and $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$ antihelium-3 events over 15~years of AMS-02 observations. Standard dark matter models could potentially produce higher levels of these antinuclei, but showing a different energy-dependence. Given the uncertainties in these models, dark matter annihilation is still the most promising candidate to explain preliminary AMS-02 results. Meanwhile, any robust detection of antihelium-4 events would require more novel dark matter model building or a new astrophisical production mechanism.</description>

      <title>Stochastic fluctuations and stability in birth-death population dynamics: two-component Langevin equation in path-integral formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the stochastic process of creation and annihilation of particles, i.e., the $A^{n} \rightleftarrows B$ process in which $n$ particles $A$s and one particle $B$ are transformed to each other. Considering the case that the stochastic fluctuations are dependent on the numbers of $A$ and $B$, we apply the Langevin equation for the stochastic time-evolution of the numbers of $A$ and $B$. We analyze the Langevin equation in the path-integral formalism, and show that the new driving force is generated dynamically by the stochastic fluctuations. We present that the generated driving force leads to the nontrivial stable equilibrium state. This equilibrium state is regarded as the new state of order which is induced effectively by stochastic fluctuations. We also discuss that the formation of such equilibrium state requires at least two stochastic variables in the stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>The Self-Consistency of DESI Analysis and Comment on "Does DESI 2024 Confirm $\Lambda$CDM?"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the constraints on the evolution of dark energy implemented by the DESI collaboration may be insufficient or incomplete using their own BAO data. Using large enough prior ranges for the present-day equation of state of dark energy $\omega_0$ and amplitude of dark energy evolution $\omega_a$, we obtain the complete $1\,\sigma$ and $2\,\sigma$ constraints $\omega_0=1.04^{+0.91+2.00}_{-1.00-1.90}$ and $\omega_a=-7.4^{+3.8+6.8}_{-3.2-7.3}$ indicating a beyond $2\,\sigma$ preference of quintessence-like dark energy today and an evidence of evolving dark energy at beyond $2\,\sigma$ CL, respectively. Our results are different from $\omega_0=-0.55^{+0.39}_{-0.21}$ and the $2\,\sigma$ upper limit $\omega_a&lt;-1.32$ reported by the DESI collaboration \cite{DESI:2024mwx}. Employing a data combination of cosmic microwave background, DESI BAO and type Ia supernova, we obtain the $1\,\sigma$, $2\,\sigma$ and $3\,\sigma$ constraints $\omega_0=-0.707^{+0.089+0.18+0.24}_{-0.089-0.17-0.22}$ and $\omega_a=-1.09^{+0.38+0.67+0.82}_{-0.31-0.72-1.00}$, which reveals a $\sim4\,\sigma$ evidence of dynamical dark energy when the redshift $z\lesssim0.1$. We verify that the BAO data point from luminous red galaxies at the effective redshift $z_{\rm eff}=0.51$ hardly affects the joint constraint from the data combination of cosmic microwave background, DESI BAO and type Ia supernova. We also point out the shortcomings and advantages of the binning method widely used in cosmological analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore superoscillations within the context of classical and quantum field theories, presenting novel solutions to Klein-Gordon's, Dirac's, Maxwell's and Einstein's equations. In particular, we illustrate a procedure of second quantization of fields and how to construct a Fock space which encompasses Superoscillating states. Furthermore, we extend the application of superoscillations to quantum tunnelings, scatterings and mixings of particles, squeezed states and potential advancements in laser interferometry, which could open new avenues for experimental tests of Quantum Gravity effects. By delving into the relationship among superoscillations and phenomena such as Hawking radiation, the Black Hole (BH) information and the Firewall paradox, we propose an alternative mechanism for information transfer across the BH event horizon.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$ polarization in very high energy heavy ion collisions as a probe of the Quark-Gluon Plasma formation and properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have studied the spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons in heavy ion collisions at center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV and $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV carried out at RHIC and LHC colliders. We have calculated the mean spin vector at local thermodynamic equilibrium, including all known first-order terms in the gradients of the thermo-hydrodynamic fields, assuming that the hadronization hypersurface has a uniform temperature. We have also included the feed-down contributions to the polarization of $\Lambda$ stemming from the decays of polarized $\Sigma^*$ and $\Sigma^0$ hyperons. The obtained results are in good agreement with the data. In general, the component of the spin vector along the global angular momentum, orthogonal to the reaction plane, shows strong sensitivity to the initial longitudinal flow velocity. Furthermore, the longitudinal component of the spin vector turns out to be very sensitive to the bulk viscosity of the plasma at the highest LHC energy. Therefore, the azimuthal dependence of spin polarization can effectively constrain the initial hydrodynamic conditions and the transport coefficients of the Quark Gluon Plasma.</description>

      <title>Full Event Particle-Level Unfolding with Variable-Length Latent Variational Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The measurements performed by particle physics experiments must account for the imperfect response of the detectors used to observe the interactions. One approach, unfolding, statistically adjusts the experimental data for detector effects. Recently, generative machine learning models have shown promise for performing unbinned unfolding in a high number of dimensions. However, all current generative approaches are limited to unfolding a fixed set of observables, making them unable to perform full-event unfolding in the variable dimensional environment of collider data. A novel modification to the variational latent diffusion model (VLD) approach to generative unfolding is presented, which allows for unfolding of high- and variable-dimensional feature spaces. The performance of this method is evaluated in the context of semi-leptonic top quark pair production at the Large Hadron Collider.</description>

Abstract: Quintessence scalar fields are a natural candidate for evolving dark energy. Unlike the phenomenological $w_0w_a$ parameterization of the dark energy equation of state, they cannot accommodate the phantom regime of dark energy $w(z) &lt; -1$, or crossings into the phantom regime. Recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) indicate a preference for evolving dark energy over a cosmological constant, ranging from $2.6\sigma-3.9\sigma$ when fitting to $w_0w_a$, and combining the DESI BAO measurements with other cosmological probes. In this work, we directly fit three simple scalar field models to the DESI BAO data, combined with cosmic microwave background anisotropy measurements and supernova data sets. Quantifying the preference for scalar field dynamics exhibited by the data, we find that $2-4\%$ of kinetic scalar field energy $\Omega_{\rm scf,k}$, is preferred over $\Lambda$CDM at the $95\%$ confidence level, for a canonical scalar field with a quadratic or linear potential. Fitting to the supernova data sets Pantheon, Pantheon+, DES-Y5, and Union3, we show that the mild tension ($n_{\sigma}&lt; 3.4 $) under $\Lambda$CDM emerges from a BAO preference for smaller values of fractional mass-energy density $\Omega_m &lt; 0.29$, while all supernova data sets, except for Pantheon, prefer larger values, $\Omega_m &gt; 0.3$. The tension under $\Lambda$CDM remains noticeable ($n_{\sigma} &lt;2.8$), when replacing two of the DESI BAO measurements redshift bins with effective redshifts $z_{\text{eff}} =0.51$, and $z_{\text{eff}}= 0.706$ with comparable BOSS DR 12 BAO measurements at $z_{\text{eff}} =0.51$, and $z_{\text{eff}}= 0.61$. Canonical scalar fields as dark energy are successful in mitigating that tension.</description>

      <title>Renormalons in the energy-energy correlator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy-energy correlator (EEC) is an observable of wide interest for collider physics and Standard Model measurements, due to both its simple theoretical description in terms of the energy-momentum tensor and its novel features for experimental studies. Significant progress has been made in both applications and higher-order perturbative predictions for the EEC. Here, we analyze the nature of the asymptotic perturbative series for the EEC by determining its analytic form in Borel space under the bubble-sum approximation. This result provides information on the leading and subleading nonperturbative power corrections through renormalon poles. We improve the perturbative convergence of the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ series for the EEC by removing its leading renormalon using an R scheme, which is independent of the bubble-sum approximation. Using the leading R-scheme power correction determined by fits to thrust, we find good agreement with EEC OPAL data already at ${\mathcal O}(\alpha_s^2)$.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of octant of $\theta_{23}$, CP violation and mass hierarchy in NO$\nu$A with multinucleon and detector effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate how multinucleon enhancement and RPA (Random Phase Approximation) suppression can affect the measurement of three unknown neutrino oscillation parameters - the CP-violating phase $\delta_{CP}$, the octant of the atmospheric mixing angle $\theta_{23}$, and the determination of the mass hierarchy, in the appearance channel of the NO$\nu$A experiment. We include the presence of the detector effect as well in the analysis, which is crucial for capturing realistic experimental scenarios. We also conducted a comparison between the nuclear model Effective Spectral Function (calculated within the RFG model) with and without Transverse Enhancement in terms of sensitivity analysis. It is found that the analysis using our comprehensive model QE(+RPA)+2p2h along with Effective Spectral Function+Transverse Enhancement exhibits significantly enhanced sensitivity compared to the pure QE interaction process, in all the cases.Also, the higher octant of $\theta_{23}$, the lower half plane of $\delta_{CP}$, and the normal mass hierarchy (HO-LHP-NH) exhibit improved sensitivity, enabling a more precise determination of the corresponding parameters. Furthermore, it is also noted that improving the performance of the detector also improves the results. Thus, including multinucleon effects and improving detector efficiency have the potential to enhance the capabilities of the NO$\nu$A (and other long baseline) experiment in conducting precise parameter studies.</description>

      <title>Color symmetry and confinement as an underlying superconformal structure in holographic QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dedicated to the memory of our colleague, Harald Fritzsch, who, together with Murray Gell-Mann, introduced the color quantum number as the exact symmetry responsible for the strong interaction, thus establishing quantum chromodynamics (QCD) as a fundamental non-Abelian gauge theory. A basic understanding of hadron properties, however, such as confinement and the emergence of a mass scale, from first principles QCD has remained elusive: Hadronic characteristics are not explicit properties of the QCD Lagrangian and perturbative QCD, so successful in the large transverse momentum domain, is not applicable at large distances. In this article, we shall examine how this daunting obstacle is overcome in holographic QCD with the introduction of a superconformal symmetry in anti de Sitter (AdS) space which is responsible for confinement and the introduction of a mass scale within the superconformal group. When mapped to light-front coordinates in physical spacetime, this approach incorporates supersymmetric relations between the Regge trajectories of meson, baryon and tetraquark states which can be visualized in terms of specific $SU(3)_C$ color representations of quarks. We will also briefly discuss here the implications of holographic models for QCD color transparency in view of the present experimental interest. Based on the invited contribution to the book dedicated to the memory of Harald Fritzsch.</description>

      <title>Constraining scotogenic dark matter and primordial black holes using gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lightest $Z_2$ odd particle in the scotogenic model, referred to as scotogenic dark matter (DM), is a widely studied candidate for DM. This scotogenic DM is generated through well-known thermal processes as well as via the evaporation of primordial black holes (PBHs). Recent reports suggested that the curvature fluctuations of PBHs during an epoch dominated by these entities in the early universe can serve as the source of so-called induced gravitational waves (GWs). In this study, we demonstrate that stringent constraints on the mass of scotogenic DM and PBHs can be obtained through the detection of induced GWs using future detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we calculate the shear viscosity for rotating fermions with spin-half under conditions of high temperature and density. We employ the Kubo formalism, rooted in finite-temperature quantum field theory, to compute the field correlation functions essential for this evaluation. The one-loop diagram pertinent to shear viscosity is analyzed within the context of curved space, utilizing tetrad formalism as an effective approach in cylindrical coordinates. Our findings focus on extremely high angular velocities, ranging from 0.1 to 1 GeV, which align with experimental expectations. Furthermore, we explore the inter-relationship between the chemical potential and angular velocity within the scope of this study.</description>

      <title>Towards a data-driven model of hadronization using normalizing flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a model of hadronization based on invertible neural networks that faithfully reproduces a simplified version of the Lund string model for meson hadronization. Additionally, we introduce a new training method for normalizing flows, termed MAGIC, that improves the agreement between simulated and experimental distributions of high-level (macroscopic) observables by adjusting single-emission (microscopic) dynamics. Our results constitute an important step toward realizing a machine-learning based model of hadronization that utilizes experimental data during training. Finally, we demonstrate how a Bayesian extension to this normalizing-flow architecture can be used to provide analysis of statistical and modeling uncertainties on the generated observable distributions.</description>

      <title>Quark and lepton modular models from the binary dihedral flavor symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the structure of top-down derived models endowed with modular flavor symmetries, we investigate the yet phenomenologically unexplored binary dihedral group 2D_3. After building the vector-valued modular forms in the representations of 2D_3 with small modular weights, we systematically classify all (Dirac and Majorana) mass textures of fermions with fractional modular weights and all possible 2+1-family structures. This allows us to explore the parameter space of fermion models based on 2D_3, aiming at a description of both quarks and leptons with a minimal number of parameters and best compatibility with observed data. We consider the separate possibilities of neutrino masses generated by either a type-I seesaw mechanism or the Weinberg operator. We identify a model that, besides fitting all known flavor observables, delivers predictions for six not-yet measured parameters and favors normal-ordered neutrino masses generated by the Weinberg operator. It would be interesting to figure out whether it is possible to embed our model within a top-down scheme, such as T2/Z4 heterotic orbifold compactifications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from the molecular picture for the $D_{s1}(2460)$ and $D_{s1}(2536)$ resonances, which are dynamically generated by the interaction of coupled channels, the most important of which are the $D^*K$ for the $D_{s1}(2460)$ and $DK^*$ for the $D_{s1}(2536)$, we evaluate the ratio of decay widths for the $\bar{B}_s^0 \to D_{s1}(2460)^+ K^-$ and $\bar{B}_s^0 \to D_{s1}(2536)^+ K^-$ decays, the latter of which has been recently investigated by the LHCb collaboration, and we obtain a ratio of the order of unity. The present results should provide an incentive for the related decay into the $D_{s1}(2460)$ resonance to be performed, which would provide valuable information on the nature of these two resonances.</description>

      <title>Analytic auxiliary mass flow to compute master integrals in singular kinematics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The computation of master integrals from their differential equations requires boundary values to be supplied by an independent method. These boundary values are often desired at singular kinematical points. We demonstrate how the auxiliary mass flow technique can be extended to compute the expansion coefficients of master integrals in a singular limit in an analytical manner, thereby providing these boundary conditions. To illustrate the application of the method, we re-compute the phase space integrals relevant to initial-final antenna functions at NNLO, now including higher-order terms in their $\epsilon$-expansion in view of their application in third-order QCD corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss dark shower signals at the LHC from a dark QCD sector, containing GeV-scale dark pions. The portal with the Standard Model is given by the mixing of the Z boson with a dark Z' coupled to the dark quarks. Both mass and kinetic mixings are included, but the mass mixing is the essential ingredient, as it is the one mediating visible decays of the long-lived dark pions. We focus especially on the possibility that the dark Z' is lighter than the Z. Indirect constraints are dominated by electroweak precision tests, which we thoroughly discuss, showing that both Z-pole and low-energy observables are important. We then recast CMS and LHCb searches for displaced dimuon resonances to dark shower signals initiated by the production of on-shell Z or Z', where the visible signature is left by a dark pion decaying to $\mu^+ \mu^-$. We demonstrate how dark shower topologies have already tested new parameter space in Run 2, reaching better sensitivity on a light dark Z' compared to the flavor-changing decays of B mesons, which can produce a single dark pion at a time, and the electroweak precision tests.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter searches with photons at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We unveil blind spot regions in dark matter (DM) direct detection (DMDD), for weakly interacting massive particles with a mass around a few hundred~GeV that may reveal interesting photon signals at the LHC. We explore a scenario where the DM primarily originates from the singlet sector within the $Z_3$-symmetric Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM). A novel DMDD spin-independent blind spot condition is revealed for singlino-dominated DM, in cases where the mass parameters of the higgsino and the singlino-dominated lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) exhibit opposite relative signs (i.e., $\kappa &lt; 0$), emphasizing the role of nearby bino and higgsino-like states in tempering the singlino-dominated LSP. Additionally, proximate bino and/or higgsino states can act as co-annihilation partner(s) for singlino-dominated DM, ensuring agreement with the observed relic abundance of DM. Remarkably, in scenarios involving singlino-higgsino co-annihilation, higgsino-like neutralinos can distinctly favor radiative decay modes into the singlino-dominated LSP and a photon, as opposed to decays into leptons/hadrons. In exploring this region of parameter space within the singlino-higgsino compressed scenario, we study the signal associated with at least one relatively soft photon alongside a lepton, accompanied by substantial missing transverse energy and a hard initial state radiation jet at the LHC. In the context of singlino-bino co-annihilation, the bino state, as the next-to-LSP, exhibits significant radiative decay into a soft photon and the LSP, enabling the possible exploration at the LHC through the triggering of this soft photon alongside large missing transverse energy and relatively hard leptons/jets resulting from the decay of heavier higgsino-like states.</description>

Abstract: The Bayes factor surface is a new way to present results from experimental searches for new physics. Searches are regularly expressed in terms of phenomenological parameters - such as the mass and cross-section of a weakly interacting massive particle. Bayes factor surfaces indicate the strength of evidence for or against models relative to the background only model in terms of the phenomenological parameters that they predict. They provide a clear and direct measure of evidence, may be easily reinterpreted, but do not depend on choices of prior or parameterization. We demonstrate the Bayes factor surface with examples from dark matter, cosmology, and collider physics.</description>

      <title>Hints of the $J^{PC}=0^{--}$ and $1^{--}$ $K^*\bar K_1(1270)$ Molecules in the $J/\psi\to\phi\eta\eta'$ Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primary objective of this study is to investigate hadronic molecules of $K^*\bar K_1(1270)$ using a one-boson-exchange model, which incorporates exchanges of vector and pseudoscalar mesons in the $t$-channel, as well as the pion exchange in the $u$-channel. Additionally, careful consideration is given to the three-body effects resulting from the on-shell pion originating from $K_1(1270)\to K^*\pi$. Then the BESIII data of the $J/\psi\to\phi\eta\eta'$ process is fitted using the $K^*\bar K_1(1270)$ scattering amplitude with $J^{PC}=0^{--}$ or $1^{--}$. The analysis reveals that both the $J^{PC}=0^{--}$ and $1^{--}$ assumptions for $K^*\bar K_1(1270)$ scattering provide good descriptions of the data, with similar fit qualities. Notably, the parameters obtained from the best fits indicate the existence of $K^*\bar K_1(1270)$ bound states, denoted by $\phi(2100)$ and $\phi_0(2100)$ for the $1^{--}$ and $0^{--}$ states, respectively. The current experimental data, including the $\eta$ polar angular distribution, cannot distinguish which $K^*\bar K_1(1270)$ bound state contributes to the $J/\psi\to\phi\eta\eta'$ process, or if both are involved. Therefore, we propose further explorations of this process, as well as other processes, in upcoming experiments with many more $J/\psi$ events to disentangle the different possibilities.</description>

      <title>The minimal cosmological standard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05390v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel minimal scenario which simultaneously addresses the following theoretical/cosmological/phenomenological puzzles: (i) the origin of scales, (ii) primordial inflation, (iii) matter-antimatter asymmetry, (iv) tiny neutrino masses, (v) dark matter, and (vi) the strong CP-problem. Exact scale-symmetry was assumed. A global $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$-symmetry was also assumed but only in the matter sector. The novelty of the scenario is the introduction of an explicit $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$-breaking term in the gravity sector only. Such a term does not disturb the axion solution whereas naturally realizes an axi-majoron hybrid inflation which allows a natural realization of Affleck-Dine mechanism for generating Peccei-Quinn number asymmetry. The asymmetry can be transferred to the visible sector via the right-handed neutrino portal through non-thermal decay and thermal processes, even without the presence of a CP-violating phase in the matter sector. Dark matter and dark radiation are obtained by cold and hot components of axi-majorons, respectively.</description>

      <title>Axi-majoron for almost everything</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The details of the minimal cosmological standard model (MCSM) proposed in Ref.~\cite{Barenboim:2024akt} are discussed. The model is based on the scale-symmetry and the global Peccei-Quinn(PQ) symmetry with a key assumption that the latter is broken only in the gravity sector in a scale-invariant manner. We show that the model provides a quite simple unified framework for the unknown history of the universe from inflation to the epoch of big-bang nucleosynthesis, simultaneously addressing key puzzles of high energy theory and cosmology: (i) the origin of scales, (ii) primordial inflation, (iii) matter-antimatter asymmetry, (iv) tiny neutrino masses, (v) dark matter, and (vi) the strong CP-problem. Scale symmetry can be exact, and the Planck scale is dynamically generated. The presence of Gauss-Bonnet term may safely retain dangerous non-perturbative symmetry-breaking effects negligible, allowing a large-field trans-Planckian inflation along the PQ-field. Iso-curvature perturbations of axi-majorons are suppressed. A sizable amount of PQ-number asymmetry is generated at the end of inflation, and conserved afterwards. Domain wall problem is absent due to the non-restoration of the symmetry and the non-zero PQ-number asymmetry. Baryogenesis can be realized by either the transfer of the PQ-number asymmetry through the seesaw sector, or by resonant leptogenesis. Dark matter is purely cold axi-majorons from the mis-alignment contribution with the symmetry-breaking scale of $\mathcal{O}(10^{12}) {\rm GeV}$. Hot axi-majorons from the decay of the inflaton become a natural source for a sizable amount of dark radiation. Inflationary gravitational waves have information about the masse parameters of the lightest left-handed and right-handed neutrinos, thanks to the presence of an early matter-domination era driven by the long-lived lightest right-handed neutrino species.</description>

      <title>Order of the SU(N_f) x SU(N_f) chiral transition via the functional renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Renormalization group flows of the $SU(N_f)\times SU(N_f)$ symmetric Ginzburg-Landau potential are calculated for a general number of flavors, $N_f$. Our approach does not rely on the $\epsilon$ expansion, but uses the functional renormalization group, formulated directly in $d=3$ spatial dimensions, with the inclusion of all possible (perturbatively) relevant and marginal operators, whose number is considerably larger than those in $d=4$. We find new, potentially infrared stable fixed points spanned throughout the entire $N_f$ range. By conjecturing that the thermal chiral transition is governed by these ``flavor continuous" fixed points, stability analyses show that for $N_f\geq 5$ the chiral transition is of second-order, while for $N_f=2,3,4$, it is of first-order. We argue that the $U_{\rm A}(1)$ anomaly controls the strength of the first-order chiral transition for $N_f=2,3,4$, and makes it almost indistinguishable from a second-order one, if it is sufficiently weak at the critical point. This could open up a new strategy to investigate the strength of the $U_{\rm A}(1)$ symmetry breaking around the critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Two-photon production of $f_0$ and $a_0$ resonances as hadronic molecules composed of two vector mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ascribed as $\rho\rho$ and $K^* \bar{K}^*$ molecular states, respectively, iso-scalar $f_0(1500)$ and $f_0(1710)$ states are expected to have iso-vector partners, potentially identified as $a_0(1450)$ and $a_0(1710)$. The predicted dominant decay modes for these two $a_0$ resonances are $a_0(1450) \to \omega\pi\pi$ and $a_0(1710) \to \omega\pi\pi,\,\phi\pi\pi$. We estimate cross sections for two-photon production of these four resonances within the hadronic molecular picture, and demonstrate that SuperKEKB's luminosity is sufficient for their observation and more precise parameter measurements.</description>

      <title>Analysis of $B_s^0 \to X(3872) [\psi(2S)] \pi^+\pi^- (K^+ K^-)$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have phenomenologically investigated the decays $B_s^0 \to X(3872) \pi^+\pi^- (K^+ K^-)$ and $B_s^0 \to \psi(2S) \pi^+ \pi^- (K^+K^-)$. In our analysis, the scalar meson $f_0(980)$ is formed through the final state interactions of coupled channels $\pi \pi$ and $K\bar{K}$. Our findings indicate that the $\pi^+\pi^-$ invariant mass distribution of the $B_s^0 \to \psi(2S)\pi^+\pi^-$ decay can be accurately reproduced. Furthermore, we have explored the $\pi^+\pi^- (K^+ K^-)$ invariant mass distribution of the $B_s^0 \to X(3872) \pi^+\pi^- (K^+ K^-)$ decay, accounting for the different production mechanisms between $X(3872)$ and $\psi(2S)$, up to a global factor. It is found that the production rates for $X(3872)$ and $\psi(2S)$ are much different, which indicates that the structure of $X(3872)$ is more complicated than the $\psi(2S)$, which is a conventional $c\bar{c}$ state. Additionally, we have considered the contributions from $f_0(1500)$ to $\pi^+\pi^-$ and the $\phi$ meson to $K^+ K^-$ in our analysis. Utilizing the model parameters, we have calculated the branching fraction of $B_s^0 \to X(3872) K^+ K^-$, and anticipate that the findings of our study can be experimentally tested in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Q-balls are non-topological solitons that coherently rotate in field space. We show that these coherent rotations can induce superradiance for scattering waves, thanks to the fact that the scattering involves two coupled modes. Despite the conservation of the particle number in the scattering, the mismatch between the frequencies of the two modes allows for the enhancement of the energy and angular momentum of incident waves. When the Q-ball spins in real space, additional rotational superradiance is also possible, which can further boost the enhancements. We identify the criteria for the energy and angular momentum superradiance to occur.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory~(LHAASO) reported observation of photons with energies above 10~TeV from gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A. A suggestion was proposed that this result may contradict our knowledge of special relativity~(SR) and the standard model~(SM), according to which photons of about 10~TeV from such a distant object should be severely suppressed because of the absorption by extragalactic background light. As a result, a number of mechanisms have been proposed to solve this potential puzzle, including Lorentz invariance violation~(LIV). In this work, we perform a detailed numerical calculation and show the feasibility to constrain LIV of photons from the LHAASO observation of GRB 221009A quantitatively.</description>

      <title>Scalable Circuits for Preparing Ground States on Digital Quantum Computers: The Schwinger Model Vacuum on 100 Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vacuum of the lattice Schwinger model is prepared on up to 100 qubits of IBM's Eagle-processor quantum computers. A new algorithm to prepare the ground state of a gapped translationally-invariant system on a quantum computer is presented, which we call Scalable Circuits ADAPT-VQE (SC-ADAPT-VQE). This algorithm uses the exponential decay of correlations between distant regions of the ground state, together with ADAPT-VQE, to construct quantum circuits for state preparation that can be scaled to arbitrarily large systems. These scalable circuits can be determined using classical computers, avoiding the challenging task of optimizing parameterized circuits on a quantum computer. SC-ADAPT-VQE is applied to the Schwinger model, and shown to be systematically improvable, with an accuracy that converges exponentially with circuit depth. Both the structure of the circuits and the deviations of prepared wavefunctions are found to become independent of the number of spatial sites, $L$. This allows for a controlled extrapolation of the circuits, determined using small or modest-sized systems, to arbitrarily large $L$. The circuits for the Schwinger model are determined on lattices up to $L=14$ (28 qubits) with the qiskit classical simulator, and subsequently scaled up to prepare the $L=50$ (100 qubits) vacuum on IBM's 127 superconducting-qubit quantum computers ibm_brisbane and ibm_cusco. After introducing an improved error-mitigation technique, which we call Operator Decoherence Renormalization, the chiral condensate and charge-charge correlators obtained from the quantum computers are found to be in good agreement with classical Matrix Product State simulations.</description>

      <title>Chiral crossover vs chiral density wave in dense nuclear matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ a model based on nucleonic and mesonic degrees of freedom to discuss the competition between isotropic and anisotropic phases in cold and dense matter. Assuming isotropy, the model exhibits a chiral phase transition which is of second order in the chiral limit and becomes a crossover in the case of a realistic pion mass. This observation crucially depends on the presence of the nucleonic vacuum contribution. Allowing for an anisotropic phase in the form of a chiral density wave can disrupt the smooth crossover. We identify the regions in the parameter space of the model where a chiral density wave is energetically preferred. A high-density re-appearance of the chiral density wave with unphysical behavior, as seen in previous studies, is avoided by a suitable renormalization scheme. A nonzero pion mass tends to disfavor the anisotropic phase compared to the chiral limit and we find that, within our model, the chiral density wave is only realized for baryon densities of at least about 6 times nuclear saturation density.</description>

      <title>Trace Anomaly of Weyl Fermions via the Path Integral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08670v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the trace, diffeomorphism and Lorentz anomalies of a free Weyl fermion in a gravitational background field by path integral methods. This is achieved by regularising the variation of the determinant of the Weyl operator building on earlier work by Leutwyler. The trace anomaly is found to be one half of the one of a Dirac fermion. Most importantly we establish that the potential parity-odd curvature term $R \tilde R$, corresponding to the Pontryagin density, vanishes. This is to the contrary of some recent findings in the literature which gave rise to a controversy. We verify, that the regularisation does not lead to (spurious) anomalies in the Lorentz and diffeomorphism symmetries. We argue that in $d = 2\;(\textrm{mod } 4)$ $P$- and $CP$-odd terms cannot appear and that for $d = 4\;(\textrm{mod } 4)$ they are absent at least at leading order.</description>

      <title>Constraint on Lorentz invariance violation from Vela pulsar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S) Collaboration reported the discovery of a novel radiation component from the Vela pulsar by their Cherenkov telescopes. It is of great importance that gamma rays with energies of at least 20~TeV are recorded unexpectedly. The H.E.S.S Collaboration argued that such results may challenge the state-of-the-art models for the high-energy emission of pulsars. We point out in this work that these results also provide a unique opportunity to constrain certain Lorentz invariance violation parameters, leading to the realization of studying Lorentz invariance violation by using gamma-ray pulsars. The Lorentz invariance violation scale is constrained at the level of $E_{\mathrm{LV,}1}&gt; 1.66\times 10^{17} \rm GeV$ for the linear scenario, and $E_{\mathrm{LV,}2}&gt;3.53\times 10^{10} \rm GeV$ for the quadratic scenario. We anticipate that digging into the detailed features of the data of the Vela pulsar and analyzing potentially more very-high-energy photon data from pulsars in the future would improve the constraints on Lorentz invariance violation.</description>

      <title>Pulse shape discrimination technique for diffuse supernova neutrino background search with JUNO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulse shape discrimination (PSD) is widely used in particle and nuclear physics. Specifically in liquid scintillator detectors, PSD facilitates the classification of different particle types based on their energy deposition patterns. This technique is particularly valuable for studies of the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB), nucleon decay, and dark matter searches. This paper presents a detailed investigation of the PSD technique, applied in the DSNB search performed with the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO). Instead of using conventional cut-and-count methods, we employ methods based on Boosted Decision Trees and Neural Networks and compare their capability to distinguish the DSNB signals from the atmospheric neutrino neutral-current background events. The two methods demonstrate comparable performance, resulting in a 50\% to 80\% improvement in signal efficiency compared to a previous study performed for JUNO~\cite{JUNO:2015zny}. Moreover, we study the dependence of the PSD performance on the visible energy and final state composition of the events and find a significant dependence on the presence/absence of $^{11}$C. Finally, we evaluate the impact of the detector effects (photon propagation, PMT dark noise, and waveform reconstruction) on the PSD performance.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on Extended Starobinsky and Weyl Gravity Model of Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present constraints on the extended Starobinsky and Weyl gravity model of inflation using updated available observational data. The data includes cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy measurements from Planck and BICEP/Keck 2018 (BK18), as well as large-scale structure data encompassing cosmic shear and galaxy autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions measurements from Dark Energy Survey (DES), baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from 6dF, MGS and BOSS, and distance measurements from supernovae type Ia from Pantheon+ samples. By introducing a single additional parameter, each model extends the Starobinsky model to encompass larger region of parameter space while remaining consistent with all observational data. Our findings demonstrate that the inclusion of higher-order terms loosen the constraint on the upper bound of $e$-folding number $N_{\rm e}$ due to the presence of small additional parameter. The maximum limit on $N_{\rm e}$ could be refined by considering the reheating process to $N_{\rm e}&lt;55-59$ for $k_{*}=0.002-0.05\ {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. These models extend viable range of tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) to very small value $r&lt;0.002$ in contrast to the original $R^2$ Starobinsky model. In addition, our results continue to emphasize the tension in $H_0$ and $S_8$ between early-time CMB measurements and late-time large-scale structure observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, we showed that the gravitational wave spectrum from trans-Planckian shockwave scattering in Einstein gravity is determined by the gravitational Lipatov vertex expressed as the bilinear double copy $\Gamma^{\mu\nu} = \frac12 C^\mu C^\nu - \frac12 N^\mu N^\nu$ where $C^\mu$ is the QCD Lipatov vertex and $N^\mu$ is the QED soft photon factor. We show here that this result can be directly obtained by careful application of the classical color-kinematic duality to the spectrum obtained in gluon shockwave collisions.</description>

      <title>Extended Skyrme effective interactions for transport model and neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is important to develop a unified theoretical framework to describe the nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations based on the same effective nuclear interactions. Based on the so-called Skyrme pseudopotential up to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order, we construct a series of extended Skyrme interactions by modifying the density-dependent term and fitting the empirical nucleon optical potential up to above $1$ GeV, the empirical properties of isospin symmetric nuclear matter, the microscopic calculations of pure neutron matter and the properties of neutron stars from astrophysical observations. The modification of the density-dependent term in the extended Skyrme interactions follows the idea of Fermi momentum expansion and this leads to a highly flexible density behavior of the symmetry energy. In particular, the values of the density slope parameter $L$ of the symmetry energy for the new extended Skyrme interactions range from $L = -5$ MeV to $L = 125$ MeV by construction, to cover the large uncertainty of the density dependence of the symmetry energy. Furthermore, in order to consider the effects of isoscalar and isovector nucleon effective masses, we adjust the momentum dependency of the single-nucleon optical potential and the symmetry potential of these new extended Skyrme interactions and construct a parameter set family, by which we systematically study the impacts of the symmetry energy and the nucleon effective masses on the properties of nuclear matter and neutron stars. The new extended Skyrme interactions constructed in the present work will be useful to determine the equation of state of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter, especially the symmetry energy, as well as the nucleon effective masses and their isospin splitting, in transport model simulations for heavy-ion collisions, nuclear structure calculations and neutron star studies.</description>

      <title>Can Bell inequalities be tested via scattering cross-section at colliders ?</title>

Abstract: In current studies for testing Bell inequalities at colliders, the reconstruction of spin correlations from scattering cross-sections relies on the bilinear form of the spin correlations, and not all local hidden variable models (LHVMs) have such a property. To demonstrate that a general LHVM cannot be rule out via scattering cross-section data, we propose a specific LHVM, which can exactly duplicate the same scattering cross-section for particle production and decay as the standard quantum theory, making it indistinguishable at colliders in principle. Despite of this, we find that reconstructing spin correlations through scattering cross-sections can still rule out a broad class of LHVMs, e.g., those models employing classical spin correlations as a surrogate for quantum spin correlations.</description>

      <title>Kinetic temperature and radial flow velocity estimation using identified hadrons and light (anti-)nuclei produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the investigation of the kinetic freeze-out properties of identified hadrons ($\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$ and $p(\bar p)$) along with light (anti-)nuclei $d (\bar d)$, $t (\bar t)$ and ${}^{3}He$ in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. A simultaneous fit is performed with the Blast-Wave (BW) model to the transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of identified hadrons together with light (anti-)nuclei produced in $Au+Au$ collisions at $\sqrt{\mathrm{s}_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}}$ = 7.7 -- 200 GeV at the RHIC and in $Pb+Pb$ collisions at $\sqrt{\mathrm{s}_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}}$ = 2.76 TeV at the LHC. The energy and centrality dependence of freeze-out parameters, i.e., kinetic freeze-out temperature ($T_{kin}$) and collective flow velocity $\langle \beta \rangle$ has been studied. It is observed that light (anti-)nuclei also participate in the collective expansion of the medium created in the collision when included in a common fit with the light hadrons. We observe a marginal rise in $T_{kin}$ and a slight decrease in $\langle \beta \rangle$ when compared to the values obtained from the fit to light hadrons. A similar $\langle \beta \rangle$ and significantly larger $T_{kin}$ is observed when a fit is performed to only protons and light (anti-)nuclei. Additionally, we also observe that the $T_{kin}$ increases from central to peripheral collisions, which is consistent with the argument of a short-lived fireball in peripheral collisions. Whereas the $\langle \beta \rangle$ shows a decreasing trend from central to peripheral collisions indicating a more rapid expansion in the central collisions. Both, $T_{kin}$ and $\langle \beta \rangle$ show a weak dependence on the collision energy at most energies.</description>
