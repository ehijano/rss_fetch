      <title>Refining Boolean models with the partial most permissive scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation:
  In systems biology, modelling strategies aim to decode how molecular components interact to generate dynamical behaviour. Boolean modelling is more and more used, but the description of the dynamics from two-levels components may be too limited to capture certain dynamical properties. %However, in Boolean models, the description of the dynamics may be too limited to capture certain dynamical properties. Multivalued logical models can overcome this limitation by allowing more than two levels for each component. However, multivaluing a Boolean model is challenging.
  Results: We present MRBM, a method for efficiently identifying the components of a Boolean model to be multivalued in order to capture specific fixed-point reachabilities in the asynchronous dynamics. To this goal, we defined a new updating scheme locating reachability properties in the most permissive dynamics. MRBM is supported by mathematical demonstrations and illustrated on a toy model and on two models of stem cell differentiation.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Molecular Generation with Hierarchical Textual Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing an effective molecular generation framework even with a limited number of molecules is often important for its practical deployment, e.g., drug discovery, since acquiring task-related molecular data requires expensive and time-consuming experimental costs. To tackle this issue, we introduce Hierarchical textual Inversion for Molecular generation (HI-Mol), a novel data-efficient molecular generation method. HI-Mol is inspired by the importance of hierarchical information, e.g., both coarse- and fine-grained features, in understanding the molecule distribution. We propose to use multi-level embeddings to reflect such hierarchical features based on the adoption of the recent textual inversion technique in the visual domain, which achieves data-efficient image generation. Compared to the conventional textual inversion method in the image domain using a single-level token embedding, our multi-level token embeddings allow the model to effectively learn the underlying low-shot molecule distribution. We then generate molecules based on the interpolation of the multi-level token embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of HI-Mol with notable data-efficiency. For instance, on QM9, HI-Mol outperforms the prior state-of-the-art method with 50x less training data. We also show the effectiveness of molecules generated by HI-Mol in low-shot molecular property prediction.</description>
