      <title>To the isotopy classification of Morse polynomials of degree 3 in ${\mathbb R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a (conjecturally complete) topological invariant of isotopy classes of Morse polynomials ${\mathbb R}^3 \to {\mathbb R}^1$ of degree 3 with non-degenerate principal homogeneous part, calculate all 36 possible values of this invariant, and realize them all (except one) by real polynomials, at which these values are taken.
  We also demonstrate many examples of non-typical adjacencies of multisingularity classes (namely, the pairs of simple function singularities with the sum of the Milnor numbers equal to 8) to singularities of class $P_8$, which break the equisingularity of bifurcation sets of functions along the $\mu=\mbox{const} $ stratum of type $P_8$. At the same time, we prove the non-existence of many other such adjacencies.
  These results are obtained with the help of a combinatorial computer program formalizing Morse surgeries, local monodromy and the Picard-Lefschetz theory, which I promote and recommend to the readers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for a large class of $\infty$-topoi
  there exist unstable arithmetic fracture squares,
  i.e. squares which recover a nilpotent sheaf $F$
  as the pullback of the rationalization of $F$ with
  the product of the $p$-completions of $F$ ranging over
  all primes $p\in\mathbb Z$.</description>

      <title>Natural homotopy of multipointed d-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify Grandis' directed spaces as a full reflective subcategory of the category of multipointed $d$-spaces. When the multipointed $d$-space realizes a precubical set, its reflection coincides with the standard realization of the precubical set as a directed space. The reflection enables us to extend the construction of the natural system of topological spaces in Baues-Wirsching's sense from directed spaces to multipointed $d$-spaces. In the case of a cellular multipointed $d$-space, there is a discrete version of this natural system which is proved to be bisimilar up to homotopy. We also prove that these constructions are invariant up to homotopy under globular subdivision. These results are the globular analogue of Dubut's results. Finally, we point the incompatibility between the notion of bisimilar natural systems and the q-model structure of multipointed $d$-spaces. This means that either the notion of bisimilar natural systems is too rigid or new model structures should be considered on multipointed $d$-spaces.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries of Non-Supersymmetric Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine generalized symmetries for 4D theories engineered via type II strings on non-supersymmetric orbifold backgrounds $\mathbb{R}^{3,1} \times \mathbb{R}^6 / \Gamma$. Probe branes detect generalized symmetries via the adjacency matrix for fermionic degrees of freedom in an associated quiver gauge theory. In situations where the tachyons are sequestered away from the boundary $S^5 / \Gamma$, this exactly matches the result extracted from singular homology. In situations with an unsequestered tachyon which stretches out to the boundary, the presence of tachyonic pulses partitions up the space into several distinct sectors, and the net contribution again matches with the answer expected via quiver methods. For IIA backgrounds, the presence of a localized closed string tachyon leads to transitions in the spectrum of states, generalized symmetries, higher-group symmetries, as well as the level matrix of the associated symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). For IIB backgrounds with a stack of spacetime filling probe D3-branes, the onset of a radiatively generated potential leads to similar considerations involving scale dependent transitions in the symmetries of the theory, including structures such as duality defects / interfaces.</description>

      <title>Curse of Dimensionality on Persistence Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of persistent homology has led to wide applications of the persistence diagram as a trusted topological descriptor in the presence of noise. However, with the increasing demand for high-dimension and low-sample-size data processing in modern science, it is questionable whether persistence diagrams retain their reliability in the presence of high-dimensional noise. This work aims to study the reliability of persistence diagrams in the high-dimension low-sample-size data setting. By analyzing the asymptotic behavior of persistence diagrams for high-dimensional random data, we show that persistence diagrams are no longer reliable descriptors of low-sample-size data under high-dimensional noise perturbations. We refer to this loss of reliability of persistence diagrams in such data settings as the curse of dimensionality on persistence diagrams. Next, we investigate the possibility of using normalized principal component analysis as a method for reducing the dimensionality of the high-dimensional observed data to resolve the curse of dimensionality. We show that this method can mitigate the curse of dimensionality on persistence diagrams. Our results shed some new light on the challenges of processing high-dimension low-sample-size data by persistence diagrams and provide a starting point for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>Whitehead Filtrations for Computations in Topological Hochschild Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss spectral sequences coming from Whitehead filtrations in the computation of topological Hochschild homology of ring spectra. Using cyclic invariance, this makes for simple computations of $THH$ of connective rings $R$ with coefficients in discrete ring spectra. In particular, we show how to use this to compute $THH(tmf,\mathbb{F}_2)$, and $THH(tmf,\mathbb{Z}_{(2)})$, where $tmf$ denotes the $\mathbb{E}_\infty$ ring spectrum of topological modular forms. Then, we obtain a description of $THH(\ell/v_1^n)$ in terms of $THH(\ell,\ell/v_1^n)$, where the latter can be computed by results of arXiv:0710.4368. We next explain how the methods of this computation generalize to give us information about $THH(cofib(x^k:\Sigma^{k|x|}R\to R))$ for $R$ and $cofib(x^k)$ suitably structured connective ring spectra, $k&gt;1$, and $x\in \pi_{*}(R)$ an arbitrary element in positive degree. Finally, we examine the general framework to describe the topological Hochschild homology of 2-local connective self-conjugate K-theory, $ksc_2$.</description>

      <title>The Quillen-Lichtenbaum dimension of complex varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quillen-Lichtenbaum conjecture for smooth complex varieties states that algebraic and topological K-theory with finite coefficients become isomorphic in high degrees. We define the "Quillen-Lichtenbaum dimension" of a variety in terms of the point where this happens, show that it is surprisingly computable, and analyze many examples. It gives an obstruction to rationality, but one that turns out to be weaker than unramified cohomology and some related birational invariants defined by Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and Voisin using Bloch-Ogus theory. Because it is compatible with semi-orthogonal decompositions, however, it allows us to prove some new cases of the integral Hodge conjecture using homological projective duality, and to compute the higher algebraic K-theory of the Kuznetsov components of the derived categories of some Fano varieties.</description>

      <title>Uniform approximation of Betti numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05104v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that Lefschetz's principle of approximating the cohomology of a possibly singular affine scheme of finite type over a field by the cohomology of a suitable (thickening of a) hyperplane section can be made uniform: in the affine case, we can choose the hyperplane section independently of the cohomology. Using Jouanolou's trick, this gives a new way to bound the Betti numbers of quasi-projective schemes over a field, independently of the cohomology. This is achieved through a motivic version of Deligne's generic base change formula and an axiomatic presentation of the theory of perverse sheaves. These methods produce generating families of Voevodsky motivic sheaves that are realized in perverse sheaves over any base of equal characteristic.</description>
