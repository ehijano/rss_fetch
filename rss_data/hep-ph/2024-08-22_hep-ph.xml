      <description>arXiv:2408.11089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The individual fermion generations of the Standard Model fit neatly into a representation of a simple Grand Unified Theory gauge algebra. If Grand Unification is not realized in nature, this would appear to be a coincidence. We attempt to quantify how frequent this coincidence is among theories with group structure and fermion content similar to the Standard Model. We find that $\mathcal{O}(1/100)$ of consistent fermion representations similar to the Standard Model are unifiable, and discuss how the result depends on our definitions. This purely group-theoretical analysis may be taken as a bottom-up indication for Grand Unification, conceptually similar to a naturalness argument.</description>

      <title>Inching toward the QCD Axions with Axion Magnetic Resonance in Helioscopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing a helical magnet profile to enhance axion-photon conversion showed great promise in laboratory searches for high axion masses. We extend the mechanism, known as the axion-magnetic resonance (AMR), from laser experiments to axion helioscopes and demonstrate its potential in covering QCD axion parameter space. Specifically, we apply AMR to the CAST experiment legacy, make projections for the upcoming IAXO experiment, and assess its implications for both axion-like particles and QCD axions. We observe considerable improvement in the experiment's sensitivity reach in all cases.</description>

      <title>The upcoming CTEQ-TEA parton distributions in a nutshell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent studies by the CTEQ-TEA group toward the development of a new generation of precision parton distribution functions in the nucleon for advanced studies at the high-luminosity LHC and in other experiments. Among several ongoing efforts, we examine sensitivity to the PDFs and mutual compatibility of new measurements in production of Drell-Yan pairs, top-quark pairs, and single-inclusive jets by the ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb collaborations in the LHC Runs 1 and 2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use vector meson dominance to calculate non-perturbative contributions to the branching ratio of the rare decay $K^\pm \to \pi^\pm \nu\bar \nu$ stemming from matrix elements involving up-quark loops. The importance of this observable as well as of $K^0 \to \pi^0 l^+ l^-$ and of the direct CP violation parameter $\epsilon_K^{\prime}$ is then discussed in the context of a Unitarity Triangle sqtudy based on Kaon sector observables only.</description>

      <title>Solving the strong CP problem with massless grand-color quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a solution to the strong CP problem that specifically relies on massless quarks and has no light axion. The QCD color group $SU(3)_c$ is embedded into a larger, simple gauge group (grand-color) where one of the massless, colored fermions enjoys an anomalous chiral symmetry, rendering the strong CP phase unphysical. The grand-color gauge group $G_{\rm GC}$ is Higgsed down to $SU(3)_c\times G_{c'}$, after which $G_{c'}$ eventually confines at a lower scale, spontaneously breaking the chiral symmetry and generating a real, positive mass to the massless, colored fermion. Since the chiral symmetry has a $G_{c'}$ anomaly, there is no corresponding light Nambu-Goldstone boson. The anomalous chiral symmetry can be an accidental symmetry that arises from an exact discrete symmetry without introducing a domain wall problem. Potential experimental signals of our mechanism include vector-like quarks near the TeV scale, pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons below the 10 GeV scale, light dark matter decay, and primordial gravitational waves from the new strong dynamics.</description>

      <title>Towards a first principles light-front Hamiltonian for the nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the nucleon's wave functions from the eigenstates of the light-front quantum chromodynamics Hamiltonian for the first time, using a fully relativistic and nonperturbative approach based on light-front quantization, without an explicit confining potential. These eigenstates are determined for the three-quark, three-quark-gluon, and three-quark-quark-antiquark Fock representations, making them suitable for low-resolution probes. From this, we calculate the nucleon's quark and gluon matter densities, helicity, and transversity distributions, which show qualitative consistency with experimental extractions. We also compute the contributions of quark and gluon helicity to the proton spin and the tensor charges. The obtained light-front wave functions represent a significant advancement towards a unified description of various hadron distribution functions in both longitudinal and transverse momentum space.</description>

      <title>Photoproduction $\gamma p \to f_0(980) p$ in an effective Lagrangian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most recent data on differential cross sections and photon beam asymmetries $\Sigma$ from the LEPS2/BGOegg Collaboration for the $\gamma p \to f_0(980) p$ reaction are analyzed within a tree-level effective Lagrangian approach. The $t$-channel $\rho$ and $\omega$ exchanges, the $u$- and $s$-channel $N$ exchanges, the interaction current, and the possible $s$-channel $N^*$ exchanges are taken into account in constructing the reaction amplitudes to reproduce the data. The results show that the contributions from either the $N(2040)3/2^+$ or the $N(2100)1/2^+$ resonance exchange in the $s$ channel are necessarily required to describe the LEPS2/BGOegg data and they dominate the differential cross sections of $\gamma p \to f_0(980) p$. Further analysis shows that the contributions from the $t$-channel $\rho$ and $\omega$ exchanges and the interaction current are rather small to both differential cross sections and photo beam asymmetries, and the contributions from $u$-channel $N$ exchange are considerable in the case of including $N(2040)3/2^+$ in the model while negligible in the case of including $N(2100)1/2^+$ in the model. Predictions of target asymmetries $T$ for $\gamma p \to f_0(980) p$ are given, which can be examined by future experiments.</description>

      <title>Closure Testing the MSHT PDFs and a First Direct Comparison to the Neural Net Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a brief overview of the first global closure test of the fixed parameterisation (MSHT) approach to PDF fitting. We find that the default MSHT20 parameterisation can reproduce the features of the input set in such a closure test to well within the textbook uncertainties. This provides strong evidence that parameterisation inflexibility in the MSHT20 fit is not a significant issue in the data region. We also present the first completely like-for-like comparison between two global PDF fits, namely MSHT and NNPDF, where the only difference is guaranteed to be due to the fitting methodology. To achieve this, we present a fit to the NNPDF4.0 data and theory inputs with the MSHT parameterisation. We find that this gives a moderately, but noticeably, better fit quality than the central NNPDF4.0 fits and that this difference persists at the level of the PDFs and benchmark cross sections. The NNPDF4.0 uncertainties are found to be broadly in line with the MSHT results if a textbook $T^2=1$ tolerance is applied, but to be significantly smaller if a tolerance typical of the MSHT20 fit is applied.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study of the open-flavor tetraquark $T_{c\bar{s}}(2900)$ in the process $\bar{B}_s^0 \to K^0 D^0 \pi^0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the LHCb Collaboration has measured two decay processes $B^0\to\bar{D}^0D_s^+\pi^-$ and $B^+\to D^-D_s^+\pi^+$ related to isospin symmetry, where two new open-flavor tetraquark states $T_{c\bar{s}}(2900)^0$ and $T_{c\bar{s}}(2900)^{++}$ that belong to an isospin triplet were observed in the $D_s^+\pi^-$ and $D_s^+\pi^+$ invariant mass distributions. In this work, we have investigated the validity of the process $\bar{B}_s^0\to K^0D^0\pi^0$ as the promising process to confirm the existence of $T_{c\bar{s}}(2900)^0$ resonance. Taking into account the tetraquark state $T_{c\bar{s}}(2900)$, as well as intermediate resonances $K^*(892)$, $K_0^*(1430)$, and $K_2^*(1430)$, it has been shown that a clear peak of the open-flavor tetraquark $T_{c\bar{s}}(2900)$ appears in the $K^0D^0$ invariant mass distribution of the process $\bar{B}_s^0\to K^0D^0\pi^0$, which could be tested by future experiments.</description>

      <title>Strong decays of doubly charmed and bottom baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have investigated the strong decays for low-lying excited states of doubly charmed and bottom baryons in the constituent quark model. Our results indicate that some $\lambda-$mode $\Xi_{cc/bb}(1P)$ and $\Omega_{cc/bb}(1P)$ states are relatively narrow, which are very likely to be discovered by future experiments. The light meson emissions for the low-lying $\rho-$mode states are highly suppressed due to the orthogonality of wave functions between initial and final states. Moreover, the strong decay behaviors for doubly charmed and bottom baryons preserve the heavy superflavor symmetry well, where the small violation originates from the finite heavy quark masses and different phase spaces. We hope that present theoretical results for undiscovered doubly charmed and bottom baryons can provide helpful information for future experiments and help us better understand the heavy quark symmetry.</description>

      <title>Single- and double-unresolved limits of polarized tree-level matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calculation of exclusive cross sections at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD requires an analytic understanding of the infrared singular structure with up to two unresolved partons. This has so far only been achieved for unpolarized matrix elements. We derive the full set of splitting amplitudes arising in longitudinally polarized tree-level QCD matrix elements at NNLO in the Larin $\gamma_5$ scheme. They are extracted from DIS-like processes, and are verified in matrix elements of higher multiplicity. Our results will enable the calculation of NNLO corrections to longitudinal spin asymmetries in polarized collider processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the interactions between light axion-like particles (ALPs) and top quarks, gluons, and W-bosons. Utilizing high-energy probes at the LHC, we probe these couplings in the context of single top quark production associated with a W-boson and an ALP. We analyze the latest LHC Run II data on $t\bar{t}$ spin correlation measurements to establish constraints on these couplings. Additionally, we compare these constraints with those derived from loop-induced couplings and indirect searches involving B-meson decays. Furthermore, we derive two-dimensional limits on the ALP couplings with top quarks and gluons.</description>

      <title>How the QCD trace anomaly behaves at the core of twin stars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the dense and cold (normalized) QCD trace anomaly, $\Delta$, in the interior of twin neutron stars (obtained from several sets of equations of state in agreement with modern compact-star and multimessenger data) satisfying static and dynamic stability conditions. We scan this parameter space in order to look for effects caused by the presence of a strong first-order phase transition connecting hadron and quark phases by means of a Maxwell construction. We found robustly that $\Delta$ suffers an abrupt decrease around the transition point, even reaching large negative values ($\Delta\simeq-0.35$), in marked contrast to current studies pointing out a smooth behavior with $\Delta\gtrsim 0$ at all densities. Besides, we characterize the behavior of conformal factor, $d_{c}$, in twin stars for which we perform comparisons with theoretical constraints, e.g. from Bayesian studies adjusted to agree with pQCD. All this allows us to infer and hypothesize modifications in the strong QCD coupling in dense nuclear matter with a strong thermodynamic discontinuity.</description>

      <title>Exploring Abelian-Non-Abelian Kinetic Mixing in SMEFT and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a novel scenario involving Abelian-non-Abelian kinetic mixing within the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and its extension with a real triplet scalar field. In SMEFT, this mixing arises exclusively from a dimension-6 operator involving the Standard Model Higgs doublet, while the real triplet scalar field introduces an additional dimension-5 operator. We derive the modifications to electroweak gauge boson properties and impose constraints using electroweak precision data. In SMEFT, we find that $Z$ pole data at LEP-I imposes a stringent constraint on the kinetic mixing parameter, requiring it to be less than $O$($10^{-4}$), which corresponds to a new physics scale of about 10 TeV. In the SMEFT+triplet scenario, the constraint can be significantly relaxed with a sizeable triplet vacuum expectation value while preserving custodial symmetry in a finely-tuned parameter space. Future measurements from the Circular Electron Positron Collider could probe the kinetic mixing parameter down to an order of magnitude smaller.</description>

      <title>Variational autoencoder inverse mapper for extraction of Compton form factors: Benchmarks and conditional learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deeply virtual exclusive scattering processes (DVES) serve as precise probes of nucleon quark and gluon distributions in coordinate space. These distributions are derived from generalized parton distributions (GPDs) via Fourier transform relative to proton momentum transfer. QCD factorization theorems enable DVES to be parameterized by Compton form factors (CFFs), which are convolutions of GPDs with perturbatively calculable kernels. Accurate extraction of CFFs from DVCS, benefiting from interference with the Bethe-Heitler (BH) process and a simpler final state structure, is essential for inferring GPDs. This paper focuses on extracting CFFs from DVCS data using a variational autoencoder inverse mapper (VAIM) and its constrained variant (C-VAIM). VAIM is shown to be consistent with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in extracting multiple CFF solutions for given kinematics, while C-VAIM effectively captures correlations among CFFs across different kinematic values, providing more constrained solutions. This study represents a crucial first step towards a comprehensive analysis pipeline towards the extraction of GPDs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that the tau produced in charged current neutrino deeply inelastic interactions at the GeV -- TeV neutrino energy range is not fully polarized. In this paper we investigate the impact of the tau polarization on the pions generated in its decay. In particular, we consider tau neutrino - tungsten interactions at the LHC energies and estimate the associated pion momentum, energy and angular distributions. The contribution of the $F_5$ is also investigated. Our results indicate that the pion properties are sensitive to the tau polarization state as well as to the magnitude of $F_5$.</description>

Abstract: Leptoquarks (LQs) can contribute to the magnetic and electric dipole moments of charged leptons, which the current experiments have measured with good accuracy. We revisit the parameter spaces of TeV-scale vector LQs that contribute to these observables and study how these models fare against the LHC bounds. We find that only $U_1$ and $V_2$ can explain the observed positive shift in $(a_\mu^{\rm exp} - a_\mu^{\rm SM})$ through a lepton chirality-flipping contribution with $\mathcal O(1)$ LQ-quark-lepton coupling. We also see how these two LQs can fit the electron dipole moment measurements.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos and complexity from string scattering amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Krylov spread complexity in the context of black hole scattering by studying highly excited string states (HESS). Krylov complexity characterizes chaos by quantifying the spread of a state or operator under a known Hamiltonian. In contrast, quantum field theory often relies on S-matrices, where the Hamiltonian density becomes non-trivially time-dependent rendering the computations of complexity in Krylov basis exponentially hard. We define Krylov spread complexity for scattering amplitudes by analyzing the distribution of extrema, treating these as eigenvalues of a fictional Hamiltonian that evolves a thermo-field double state non-trivially. Our analysis of black hole scattering, through highly excited string states scattering into two or three tachyons, reveals that the Krylov complexity of these amplitudes mirrors the behavior of chaotic Hamiltonian evolution, with a pre-saturation peak indicating chaos. This formalism bridges the concepts of chaos in scattering and state evolution, offering a framework to distinguish different scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black holes from inflation constrained by dark matter substructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations of high-redshift massive galaxy candidates have initiated renewed interest in the important mystery around the formation and evolution of our Universe's largest supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We consider the possibility that some of them were seeded by the direct collapse of primordial density perturbations from inflation into primordial black holes and analyze the consequences of this on current dark matter substructures assuming non-Gaussian primordial curvature perturbation distributions. We derive bounds on the enhanced curvature perturbation amplitude from the number of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in our Galaxy, observations of stellar streams and gravitational lensing. We find this bound region significantly overlaps with that required for SMBH seed formation and enables us to probe Gaussian and non-Gaussian curvature perturbations corresponding to the SMBH seeds in the range ${\cal O}(10^5$-$10^{12}) M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Holographic thermodynamic relation for dissipative and non-dissipative universes in a flat FLRW cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To clarify a holographic modified thermodynamic relation, the present study applies a general formulation for cosmological equations in a flat FLRW universe to the first law of thermodynamics, using the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy $S_{\rm{BH}}$ and a dynamical Kodama-Hayward temperature $T_{\rm{KH}}$. For the general formulation, both an effective pressure $p_{e}$ of cosmological fluids for dissipative universes (e.g., bulk viscous cosmology) and an extra driving term $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ for non-dissipative universes (e.g., time-varying $\Lambda (t)$ cosmology) are phenomenologically assumed. When $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ is constant, the modified thermodynamic relation is equivalent to the formulation of the first law in standard cosmology. One side of this modified relation describes thermodynamic quantities in the bulk and can be divided into two time-derivative terms, namely $\dot{\rho}$ and $\dot{V}$ terms, where $\rho$ is the mass density of cosmological fluids and $V$ is the Hubble volume. Using the Gibbons-Hawking temperature $T_{\rm{GH}}$, the other side of this relation, $T_{\rm{KH}} \dot{S}_{\rm{BH}}$, can be formulated as the sum of $T_{\rm{GH}} \dot{S}_{\rm{BH}}$ and $[(T_{\rm{KH}}/T_{\rm{GH}}) -1] T_{\rm{GH}} \dot{S}_{\rm{BH}}$, which are equivalent to the $\dot{\rho}$ and $\dot{V}$ terms, respectively, with the magnitude of the $\dot{V}$ term being proportional to the square of the $\dot{\rho}$ term. In addition, the modified thermodynamic relation for constant $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ is examined by applying the equipartition law of energy on the horizon. This modified thermodynamic relation reduces to a kind of extended holographic-like connection when a constant $T_{\rm{KH}}$ universe is considered. The evolution of thermodynamic quantities is also discussed, using a constant $T_{\rm{KH}}$ model, extending a previous analysis [Phys. Rev. D 108, 083515 (2023) (arXiv:2306.11285)].</description>

      <title>Scrutinizing the Isotropic Gamma-Ray Background in Search of Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The isotropic gamma-ray background (IGRB), measured by the Fermi Large Area Telescope, is the result of several classes of extragalactic astrophysical sources. Those sources include blazars, start-forming galaxies and radio galaxies. Also, ultra-high-energy cosmic rays interacting with the infrared background, contribute to the isotropic background. Using information from Fermi's gamma-ray sources catalog and the results of dedicated studies of these classes of sources, from observations at the infrared and radio, we model their contribution to the IGRB. In addition to conventional astrophysical sources, dark matter may be a component of the IGRB. We combine our model of conventional astrophysical sources and of dark matter annihilation in distant galaxies, marginalizing over relevant uncertainties, to derive constraints on the dark matter annihilation cross section, from the measured IGRB. In calculating the contribution from dark matter we include the flux from extragalactic halos and their substructure and also the subdominant contribution from Milky Way's halo at high galactic latitudes. The resulting constraints are competitive with the strongest current constraints from the dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Under certain dark matter assumptions, we also find an indication for a small excess flux in the isotropic background. Our results are consistent with the gamma-ray excess at GeV energies toward the galactic center.</description>

      <title>A topological contribution to Bogoliubov coefficient for cosmological particle production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle production in cosmology is often efficiently computed in terms of Bogoliubov transforms. Restricting to a particular class of dispersion relationships, we identify a map between the number of particles produced in a special kinematic limit and a Stokes phenomena related topology of analytic continuation of the Bogoliubov coefficient functions. Intuitively, this kinematic limit corresponds to the long wavelength limit although a more precise description depends on the nature of the curved spacetime. To identify the topology, we reformulate the usual Bogoliubov computations as a type of SU(1,1) gauged differential equation and utilize a special gauge together with a discrete symmetry that naturally characterizes the dispersion relationship. Using a dark matter model and a nonzero constant spatial curvature model, we estimate how such topological contributions will arise in physical applications.</description>

      <title>Second-order spin hydrodynamics from Zubarev's nonequilibrium statistical operator formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Zubarev's nonequilibrium statistical operator formalism, we derive the second-order dissipative tensors in relativistic spin hydrodynamics, {\em viz.} rotational stress tensor ($\tau_{\mu\nu}$), boost heat vector ($q_\mu$), shear stress tensor ($\pi_{\mu\nu}$) and bulk viscous pressure ($\Pi$). The first two ($\tau_{\mu\nu}$ and $q_\mu$) emerge due to the inclusion of the antisymmetric part in the energy-momentum tensor, which, in turn, governs the conservation of spin angular momentum ($\Sigma^{\alpha\mu\nu}$). As a result, new thermodynamic forces, generated due to the antisymmetric part of $T_{\mu \nu}$, contains the spin chemical potential. In this work, we have also taken the spin density ($S^{\mu \nu}$) as an independent thermodynamic variable, in addition to the energy density and particle density, thereby resulting in an additional transport coefficient given by the correlation between $S^{\mu \nu}$ and $\tau^{\mu \nu}$. The newly found terms in $\pi_{\mu\nu}$ and $\Pi$ are the artifacts of the new thermodynamic forces that arise due to the antisymmetric part of $T^{\mu \nu}$. Finally we have derived the evolution equations for the aforesaid tensors - $\tau_{\mu\nu}$, $q_\mu$, $\pi_{\mu\nu}$, and $\Pi$.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Impact of Nuclear Parton Distribution Functions on Open Heavy Flavor Azimuthal Angular Correlations in Pb-Pb Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.5 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the impact of nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs) on the azimuthal angular correlation of open heavy flavor hadrons in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.5 TeV, utilizing PYTHIA8 + Angantyr model and various PDFs. The method involves a transverse momentum ($p_{\rm{T}}$) differential assessment of azimuthal angular correlations between prompt $\rm{D^0-\bar{D}^0}$, $\rm{B-\bar{B}}$, and non-prompt D-mesons. The results show that nPDFs significantly modify the near-side and away-side peaks of the azimuthal angular correlation distribution. A differential $p_{\rm{T}}$ analysis allowed us to find the interplay between various production mechanisms and the significant impact of nPDFs on the dynamics of heavy flavor hadron production. Apart from the contributions originating from leading order (LO) production processes like pair creation in the away side correlation distribution, the identification of a double peak structure in the near side of azimuthal angular correlation indicates contributions from next-to-leading order (NLO) processes. The paper also emphasizes the relevance of nPDF in the context of heavy quark thermalization in heavy-ion collision analyses. The findings indicate that nPDFs alter charm quark thermalization at low $p_{\rm{T}}$, with negligible effects on beauty quark thermalization. This comprehensive analysis of azimuthal correlations and nPDF effects enhances our understanding of the initial state conditions and the dynamics of heavy flavor production in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Motivating Gauge-Invariant Approaches to Particle Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is noticeable consensus among physicists and philosophers that only gauge-invariant quantities can be physically real. However, this insight that physical quantities must be gauge-invariant is not well-reflected in standard approaches to particle physics. For instance, each and every elementary field/particle of the Standard Model fails to be gauge-invariant! The main objective of this paper is to offer an accessible, concise, and convincing analysis of why philosophers and physicists should devote more of their energy to working on gauge-invariant approaches. Correspondingly, the thesis of this paper is that pursuing gauge-invariant approaches has several virtues. For instance, gauge-invariant reformulations allow us to make particle physics consistent with the mathematical framework in which it is formulated. This is illustrated by how mathematical theorems such as Elitzur's theorem, the Gribov ambiguity, and Haag's theorem pose problems for standard approaches but are avoided by gauge-invariant approaches.</description>

Abstract: We reconsider the two-loop electron self-energy in quantum electrodynamics. We present a modern calculation, where all relevant two-loop integrals are expressed in terms of iterated integrals of modular forms. As boundary points of the iterated integrals we consider the four cases $p^2=0$, $p^2=m^2$, $p^2=9m^2$ and $p^2=\infty$. The iterated integrals have $q$-expansions, which can be used for the numerical evaluation. We show that a truncation of the $q$-series to order ${\mathcal O}(q^{30})$ gives numerically for the finite part of the self-energy a relative precision better than $10^{-20}$ for all real values $p^2/m^2$.</description>

Abstract: After the CDF II results, we can ask ourselves, have they observed the vector boson $W$ of the standard model? or have they discovered the effect of new physics? We show that, in electroweak models with $SU(2)_L\otimes SU(2)_R\otimes U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry, it is possible to accommodate, at tree level, the value of the mass of the charged vector boson obtained by the CDF-II. A shift in the mass of the lightest neutral vector boson is also predicted in some versions of the model.</description>

Abstract: We present a phenomenological study of the $\gamma\gamma^*\to K\bar{K}^*(892)$ process by including the $s$-channel production of the $\eta(1475)$ and $f_1(1420)$ resonances. The non-resonant channel via $K$- and $K^*$-exchanges is investigated carefully by performing the Lorentz tensor decomposition and is constructed to yield a correct high-energy Regge behavior. The transition form factor of $f_1(1420)$ is adjusted to achieve a reasonable description of the existing L3 data in the $f_1(1420)$ resonance region. This model is intended to serve as a Monte Carlo generator for the analysis currently being performed by the BESIII Collaboration. We also estimate the polarized $\gamma\gamma^*\to K\bar{K}^*(892)$ cross sections and demonstrate how to extract the transition form factors of $f_1(1420)$ from the polarized cross sections.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a mirror twin Higgs model with spontaneous $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking that ameliorates the constraints in twin Higgs cosmology and, at the same time, generates the Standard Model neutrino masses. The model features an $SU(2)$ triplet with hypercharge $1$ alongside its twin counterpart. Spontaneous breaking of both $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and electroweak symmetry occurs in the scalar sector. The Standard Model neutrinos acquire small masses through the type-II seesaw mechanism. In contrast, their twin counterparts acquire large masses, effectively addressing the dark radiation problem in mirror twin Higgs scenarios. We study the impact of the model on the $N_{\rm eff.}$ constraints, as well as on collider phenomenology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, several new experimental results of the test of lepton flavor universality (LFU) in $B\to D^{(\ast)}$ semi-leptonic decays were announced: the first result of $R_{D}$ from the LHCb Run 1 data, the first results of $R_{D}$ and $R_{D^\ast}$ from the LHCb Run 2 data, and the first result of $R_{D^\ast}$ from the Belle II collaboration. Including these new data, a global analysis still prefers the violation of the LFU between the tau and light leptons. A new world average of the data from the BaBar, LHCb, Belle, and Belle II collaborations is $R_{D} = 0.342 \pm 0.026$ and $R_{D^{\ast}} = 0.287 \pm 0.012$. Including this new data, we update a circumstance of the $b \to c \tau \overline\nu$ measurements and their implications for new physics (NP). Incorporating recent developments for the $B \to D^{(\ast)}$ form factors in the Standard Model (SM), we observe a $4.4 \sigma$ deviation from the SM prediction. Our updates also include; model-independent NP formulae for the related observables; and the global fittings of parameters for leptoquark scenarios as well as single NP operator scenarios. Furthermore, we show future potential to indirectly distinguish different NP scenarios with the use of the precise measurements of the polarization observables in $B\to D^{(\ast)}\tau \overline\nu$ at the Belle II and the high-$p_{\rm T}$ flavored-tail searches at the LHC. We also discuss an impact on the LFU violation in $\Upsilon \to l^+ l^-$.</description>

Abstract: We show that if dark matter consists of QCD axions in the post-inflationary scenario more than ten percent of it efficiently collapses into Bose stars at matter-radiation equality. Such a result is mostly independent of the present uncertainties on the axion mass. This large population of solitons, with asteroid masses and Earth-Moon distance sizes, might plausibly survive until today, with potentially interesting implications for phenomenology and experimental searches.</description>

Abstract: Long-lived particles (LLPs) originating from decays of the Standard-Model or Beyond-the-Standard-Model Higgs bosons are often featured with signatures of displaced vertices (DVs) and jets at colliders. In this work, we show that a recent ATLAS search for DVs plus jets, with its recast implementation, can efficiently place bounds on such hadronically or semi-leptonically decaying LLPs. In particular, we find the search is uniquely sensitive to LLP proper decay lengths of about 1-100 mm, probing complementary regions in the parameter space of the relevant models compared to other prompt and LLP searches.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the effects of non-thermally produced dark matter on large-scale structure formation, focusing on the gravitino dark matter. Our analysis shows that large-scale structure measurements from the SDSS LRG data offer a promising approach to probing non-thermally produced gravitinos. Specifically, if gravitinos resulting from neutralino decay constitute a fraction $F_\text{dec}=0.35~(0.1)$ of the dark matter component, the data exclude bino-like neutralino with a mass $m_{\chi_1^0}\lesssim25~(11)\text{ GeV}$. Furthermore, this constraint appears to be largely independent of the gravitino mass.</description>

      <title>Dark Universe Phenomenology from Yukawa Potential?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11492v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that the effect of cold dark matter in the cosmological setup can be explained by the coupling between the baryonic matter particles in terms of the long-range force having a graviton mass $m_g$ via the Yukawa gravitational potential. Such a quantum-corrected Yukawa-like gravitational potential is characterized by the coupling parameter $\alpha$, the wavelength parameter $\lambda$, which is related to the graviton mass via $m_g=\hbar/(\lambda c)$, that determines the range of the force and, finally, a Planck length quantity $l_0$ that makes the potential regular at the centre. The corrected Friedmann equations are obtained using Verlinde's entropic force interpretation of gravity based on the holographic scenario and the equipartition law of energy. The parameter $\alpha$ modifies Newton's constant as $G_{\rm eff}\rightarrow G(1+\alpha)$. We argue that dark matter is an apparent effect as no dark matter particle exists in this picture. Furthermore, the dark energy is also related to graviton mass and $\alpha$; in particular, we point out that the cosmological constant can be viewed as a self-interaction effect between gravitons. We further show that there exists a precise correspondence with Verlinde's emergent gravity theory, and due to the long-range force, the theory can be viewed as a non-local gravity theory. To this end, we performed the phase space analyses and estimated $\lambda\simeq 10^3 $[Mpc] and $\alpha \in (0.0385,0.0450)$, respectively. Finally, from these values, for the graviton mass, we get $m_g\simeq 10^{-68}$ kg, and cosmological constant $\Lambda \simeq 10^{-52}\rm m^{-2}$. Further, we argue how this theory reproduces the MOND phenomenology on galactic scales via the acceleration of Milgrom $a_0 \simeq 10^{-10}\rm m/s^2$.</description>

      <title>Detecting cosmological scalar fields using orbital networks of quantum sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we propose to detect the interaction of a hypothetical coherently evolving cosmological scalar field with an orbital network of quantum sensors, focusing on the GPS satellite network as a test example. Cosmological scenarios, such as a scalar-tensor theory for dark energy or the axi-Higgs model, suggest that such a field may exist. As this field would be (approximately) at rest in the CMB frame, it would exhibit a dipole as a result of the movement of our terrestrial observers relative to the CMB. While the current sensitivity of the GPS network is insufficient to detect a cosmological dipole, future networks of quantum sensors on heliocentric orbits, using state-of-the-art atomic clocks, can reach and exceed this requirement.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on Extended Starobinsky and Weyl Gravity Model of Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01010v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present constraints on the extended Starobinsky and Weyl gravity model of inflation using updated available observational data. The data includes cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy measurements from Planck and BICEP/Keck 2018 (BK18), as well as large-scale structure data encompassing cosmic shear and galaxy autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions measurements from Dark Energy Survey (DES), baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from 6dF, MGS and BOSS, and distance measurements from supernovae type Ia from Pantheon+ samples. By introducing a single additional parameter, each model extends the Starobinsky model to encompass larger region of parameter space while remaining consistent with all observational data. Our findings demonstrate that the inclusion of higher-order terms loosen the constraint on the upper bound of $e$-folding number $N_{\rm e}$ due to the presence of small additional parameter. The maximum limit on $N_{\rm e}$ could be refined by considering the reheating process to $N_{\rm e}&lt;55-59$ for $k_{*}=0.002, 0.05$ Mpc$^{-1}$. These models extend viable range of tensor-to-scalar ratio~($r$) to very small value $r&lt;0.002$ in contrast to the original $R^2$ Starobinsky model. In addition, our results continue to emphasize the tension in $H_0$ and $S_8$ between early-time CMB measurements and late-time large-scale structure observations.</description>

      <title>Fermion Mass Generation without Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the generation of fermion mass in a context where interactions break a discrete chiral symmetry. Then, fermion mass is not protected by a symmetry, no symmetry is broken by the generation of mass, and a vanishing mass no longer enhances a symmetry. We elaborate these scenarios for template fermionic and Yukawa theories in three dimensions where mass can be generated either by fluctuations, strong dynamics, or the vacuum expectation value of a scalar field. We find that fluctuation-induced contributions to fermion mass are parametrically suppressed in the number of fermion flavours $N$. The generation of fermion mass then takes the form of a rapid crossover which turns into a second order quantum phase transition for large $N$, much like in settings with fundamental chiral symmetry. We further discuss theories where fermion mass can be generated spontaneously without breaking any symmetry other than scale symmetry. Implications of our findings are discussed.</description>

      <title>Microscale torsion resonators for short-range gravity experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13020v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring gravitational interactions on sub-100-$\mu$m length scales offers a window into physics beyond the Standard Model. However, short-range gravity experiments are limited by the ability to position sufficiently massive objects to within small separation distances. Here we propose mass-loaded silicon nitride ribbons as a platform for testing the gravitational inverse square law at separations currently inaccessible with traditional torsion balances. These microscale torsion resonators benefit from low thermal noise due to strain-induced dissipation dilution while maintaining compact size (&lt;100$\,\mu$g) to allow close approach. Considering an experiment combining a 40$\,\mu$g torsion resonator with a source mass of comparable size (130$\,\mu$g) at separations down to 25$\,\mu$m, and including limits from thermomechanical noise and systematic uncertainty, we predict these devices can set novel constraints on Yukawa interactions within the 1-100$\,\mu$m range.</description>

      <title>Lanczos, the transfer matrix, and the signal-to-noise problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a method for determining the energy spectrum of lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) by applying the Lanczos algorithm to the transfer matrix. Proof-of-principle analyses of the simple harmonic oscillator and the LQCD proton mass demonstrate that this method provides faster ground-state convergence than standard energy estimators, which are related to the power-iteration algorithm. Lanczos provides more accurate energy estimates than multi-state fits to correlation functions with small imaginary times while achieving comparable statistical precision. Two-sided error bounds are computed for Lanczos results and guarantee that excited-state effects cannot shift Lanczos results far outside their statistical uncertainties. Further, Lanczos results avoid the exponential signal-to-noise degradation present in standard energy estimators.</description>

      <title>Weyl gauge invariant DBI action in conformal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the analogue of the Dirac-Born-Infeld action in Weyl conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions, to obtain a general theory of gravity with Weyl gauge symmetry (of dilatations). For this we use a Weyl gauge covariant formulation of conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions, suitable for a gauge theory, in which this geometry is metric. For $d=4$, in a leading order expansion the DBI action becomes the general Weyl quadratic gravity action associated to this geometry, that has the same gauge symmetry; this is broken spontaneously and Einstein-Hilbert gravity is recovered in the broken phase, with $\Lambda &gt;0$. The series expansion of the DBI action also contains additional non-polynomial terms that can be generated at quantum level in Weyl quadratic gravity in $d=4$, by a regularisation that respects this gauge symmetry. Such a regularisation is automatically provided by the DBI action in $d$ dimensions. If the Weyl gauge boson of dilatations is "pure gauge", the DBI action recovers in the leading order the conformal gravity action plus a locally Weyl invariant dilaton action. All fields and scales in the theory have a geometric origin, with no added matter or Weyl scalar fields compensators.</description>
