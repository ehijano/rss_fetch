      <title>$k$-type entropy of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of \(k\)-type entropy for dynamical systems generated by \(\mathbb{Z}^d\)-actions on compact metric spaces. We investigate its fundamental properties and establish connections with classical entropy and other \(k\)-type dynamical notions. The $k$-type entropy of some $\mathbb{Z}^2$-actions on a two dimensional torus is also calculated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the correlation between dynamical properties of group actions on compact metric spaces and their induced actions on the corresponding hyperspaces. We extend classical results from discrete dynamical systems, particularly those concerning transitivity, mixing, and chaos, to the setting of group actions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of motion planning complexity for control-affine systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the complexity of the approximation of nonadmissible curves for nonlinear control-affine systems satisfying the strong H{\"o}rmander condition. Focusing on tubular approximation complexities, we provide asymptotic equivalences, with explicit constants, for all generic situations where the distribution, i.e., the linear part of the control system, is of co-rank one. Namely, we consider curves in step 2 distributions and any dimension. In the 3 dimensional case, we also consider the case of distributions with Martinet-type singularities that are crossed by the curve at isolated points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider periodic solutions of the $n$-body problem that satisfy symmetry constraints, expressed through invariance under finite group actions. We focus on their stability properties and present algorithms specifically designed for the computation of Floquet multipliers and Morse indices. Numerical results are provided to illustrate our methods in both two and three dimensional configuration spaces, and for different choices on the number of bodies.</description>

      <title>Existence and Uniqueness of Fast Traveling Pulses in Singularly Perturbed Nonlocal Neural Fields With Heaviside Nonlinearities: a Complete Proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We rigorously prove the existence and uniqueness of fast traveling pulse solutions to the singularly perturbed neural field system with linear feedback and Heaviside nonlinearity structure within a spatial convolution. The pulse is well-accepted to generally exist based on its original singular construction, closed form when it exists, and follow-ups, but prior to this study, there has not been a proof that overcomes the difficulties of (i) solving for the speed and width functions using the implicit function theorem at $\epsilon=0$ and (ii) tracking the resultant formal homoclinic orbit near its singular orbit during fast, slow, and mixed time scales. First, we provide new, first-order approximations of the pulse speed and width. We then show that the formal pulse is close to the front and back at threshold crossing points and that the Hausdorff distance between the formal pulse and the singular homoclinic orbit converges to zero, demonstrating that the formal pulse is a true solution to the original system.</description>

      <title>Unmarked spectral rigidity of expanding circle maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a smooth expanding map $f$ of the circle, its (unmarked) length spectrum is defined as the set of logarithms of multipliers of periodic orbits of $f$. This spectrum is analogous to the set of lengths of all closed geodesics on negatively curved surfaces -- the classical length spectrum. In the paper, we prove a length spectral rigidity result for expanding circle maps. Namely, we show that a smooth expanding circle map $f$ of degree $d \ge 2$, under certain assumptions on the sparsity of its length spectrum, cannot be perturbed with an arbitrarily small perturbation (depending on $f$) so that its length spectrum stays the same. The proof uses the Whitney extension theorem, a quantitative Livsic-type theorem, and a novel iterative scheme.</description>

      <title>Irreducible train tracks for pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a construction of invariant train tracks with irreducible transition matrix for pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms. This fills what seems to be a gap in the literature concerning the existence of such train tracks. The construction starts with an invariant train track associated to the veering triangulation of the mapping torus of the homeomorphism and then uses the veering property to characterize branches which obstruct irreducibility, finally modifying the track to bypass these obstructions.</description>

      <title>A model for mosquito-borne epidemic outbreaks with information-dependent protective behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a model for a mosquito-borne epidemic outbreak in which humans can adopt protective behaviour against vector bites depending on information on the past and present prevalence. Assuming that mosquitoes can also feed on other non-competent hosts (i.e. hosts that cannot infect others), we first review some results from the literature by showing that protective behaviour may either decrease or increase the value of the reproduction number of the epidemic depending on multiple elements. Then, assuming that changes in opinion occur much faster than the spread of the disease, we exploit an approach based on the Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory to reduce the two-group model to a model for a homogeneous host population. Then, we use the resulting model to investigate the effect of information-induced behavioural changes on the transient dynamics of the epidemic, discussing the case when protective measures induced an outbreak with a low attack rate. We illustrate how behavioural changes might either help in containing an epidemic outbreak or make the epidemic last longer, even triggering recurrent damped epidemic waves. We conclude with numerical simulations to illustrate our analytical results.</description>

      <title>Frobenius Revivals in Laplacian Cellular Automata: Chaos, Replication, and Reversible Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate Frobenius-driven revivals in prime-modulus Laplacian cellular
  automata, a phenomenon in which long chaotic transients collapse into exact,
  multi-tile replicas of an initial seed at algebraically prescribed times
  $t=p^m$.
  The mechanism follows directly from the Frobenius identity
  $(I+B)^{p^m}=I+B^{p^m}$, which eliminates all mixed binomial terms and enforces
  deterministic reappearance of the seed after dispersion.
  We provide a detailed numerical and analytical characterisation of these
  revivals across several moduli, examining entropy dynamics, spatial
  organisation, and local stability under perturbations.
  The revival structure yields several useful features: predictable transitions
  between chaotic and ordered phases, intrinsic spatial redundancy, and robust
  reconstruction via replica consensus in the presence of weak additive noise.
  We further show that composing Laplacian operators modulo multiple primes
  generates significantly extended periodic orbits while preserving exact
  reversibility.
  Building on these observations, we propose an explicit reversible encoding
  scheme based on chaotic transients and Frobenius returns, together with
  practical separation conditions and noise-tolerance estimates.
  Potential applications include reversible steganography, structured
  pseudorandomness, error-tolerant information representation, and procedural
  pattern synthesis.
  The results highlight an interplay between algebraic combinatorics and
  cellular-automaton dynamics, suggesting further avenues for theoretical and
  applied development.</description>

      <title>On the Equivalence of Synchronization Definitions in the Kuramoto Flow: A Unified Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a rigorous mathematical framework establishing the equivalence of four classical notions of synchronization full phase-locking, phase-locking, frequency synchronization, and order parameter synchronization in generalized Kuramoto models, via a non-perturbative, finite-dimensional analysis. Our approach avoids linearization, mean-field limits, and restrictions on initial conditions, relying instead on global phase-space geometry, periodic vector field structure, and compactness arguments based on contradiction. These results clarify the foundational role of the order parameter and provide a unified understanding of synchronization across a broad class of heterogeneous oscillator networks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a variational approach to obtain periodic solutions of the $N$-body problem, in particular the 'figure-eight' solution for three equal masses. The central idea is to explicitly optimize the \emph{spatial scale} within the Lagrangian action, leading to the functional $\mathcal F = K^{\alpha/(\alpha+2)} V^{2/(\alpha+2)}$. We prove the existence of critical points of $\mathcal F$ that enforce a curve with a single self-crossing, and show that every reparametrized critical curve satisfies Newton's equations and is free of collisions. This framework recovers the Chenciner-Montgomery 'eight' (for $\alpha=1$) and extends to the whole range $0&lt;\alpha&lt;2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09684v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let ${\mathcal C}$ be a fixed equisingularity class of irreducible germs of complex analytic plane curves. We compute a basis of the ${\mathbb C}[[x]]$-module of K\"ahler differentials for generic $\Gamma \in {\mathcal C}$, algorithmically, and study its behaviour under blow-up.
  As a first application, we give an algorithm providing the generic semimodule in an equisingularity class in terms of its multiplicity and its Puiseux characteristic exponents. As another application, we give an alternative proof for a formula of Genzmer, that provides the dimension of the moduli of analytic classes in the equisingularity class of $\Gamma$.</description>

Abstract: Dirichlet's problem for the dynamics of fluid bodies with ellipsoidal shape can be formulated as a Hamiltonian system invariant under the action of a symmetry Lie group. I apply methods from Hamiltonian bifurcation theory to the study of the branch of solutions known as MacLaurin spheroids. I show that all its bifurcations are into three types named I, $S$ and adjoint $S$ ellipsoids in agreement with previous necessary conditions obtained by Chandrasekhar by linearizing the hydrodynamic equations.</description>

      <title>A Weak Penalty Neural ODE for Learning Chaotic Dynamics from Noisy Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of complex high-dimensional dynamical systems from observational data is essential for several applications across science and engineering. A key challenge, however, is that real-world measurements are often corrupted by noise, which severely degrades the performance of data-driven models. Particularly, in chaotic dynamical systems, where small errors amplify rapidly, it is challenging to identify a data-driven model from noisy data that achieves short-term accuracy while preserving long-term invariant properties. In this paper, we propose the use of the weak formulation as a complementary approach to the classical strong formulation of data-driven time-series forecasting models. Specifically, we focus on the neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) architecture. Unlike the standard strong formulation, which relies on the discretization of the NODE followed by optimization, the weak formulation constrains the model using a set of integrated residuals over temporal subdomains. While such a formulation yields an effective NODE model, we discover that the performance of a NODE can be further enhanced by employing this weak formulation as a penalty alongside the classical strong formulation-based learning. Through numerical demonstrations, we illustrate that our proposed training strategy, which we coined as the Weak-Penalty NODE (WP-NODE), achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy and exceptional robustness across benchmark chaotic dynamical systems and real-world climate dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Closed-Form Kepler solutions in projective coordinates are used to define a corresponding set of eight orbit elements and obtain their governing equations for arbitrarily-perturbed two-body dynamics. The elements and their dynamics are singularity-free in all cases besides rectilinear motion (when angular momentum vanishes). The classic J2-perturbed two-body problem is developed and used for numerical verification.</description>
