      <title>On Sylvester equations in Banach subalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let ${\mathcal B}$ be a Banach algebra and ${\mathcal A}$ be its Banach subalgebra that admits a norm-controlled inversion. In this work, we take $A, B$ in the Banach subalgebra ${\mathcal A}$ with the spectra of $A$ and $B$ in the Banach algebra ${\mathcal B}$ being disjoint, and show that the operator Sylvester equation $ BX-XA=Q$ has a unique solution $X\in {\mathcal A}$ for every $Q\in {\mathcal A}$. Under the additional assumptions that ${\mathcal B}$ is the operator algebra ${\mathcal B}(H)$ on a complex Hilbert space $H$ and that $A$ and $B$ are normal in ${\mathcal B}(H)$, an explicit norm estimate for the solution $X$ of the above operator Sylvester equation is provided. In this work, the above conclusion on norm control is also discussed for Banach subalgebras of localized infinite matrices and integral operators.</description>

      <title>On a class of oscillatory integrals and their application to the time dependent Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper a class of oscillatory integrals is interpreted as a limit of Lebesgue integrals with Gaussian regularizers. The convergence of the regularized integrals is shown with an improved version of iterative integration by parts that generates additional decaying factors and hence leads to better integrability properties. The general abstract results are then applied to the Cauchy problem for the one dimensional time dependent Schr\"odinger equation, where the solution is expressed for C^n-regular initial conditions with polynomial growth at infinity via the Green's function as an oscillatory integral.</description>

      <title>Localizations and Essential Commutant of Toeplitz Algebra on Polydisk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Usually, the norm closure of a family of operators is not equal to the $C^*$-algebra generated by this family of operators. But, similar with the Bergman space $L^2_a(\textbf{B}, dv)$ of the unit ball in $\mathbb{C}^n$, we show that the norm closure of $\{T_f : f\in L^{\infty}(\mathbb{D}, dv)\}$ on Bergman space $L^2_a(\mathbb{D}, dv)$ of the ploydisk $\mathbb{D}$ in $\mathbb{C}^n$ actually coincides with the Toeplitz algebra $\mathcal{T}(\mathbb{D})$. A key ingredient in the proof is the class of operators $\mathcal{D}$ recently introduced by Yi Wang and Jingbo Xia. In fact, as a by-product, we simultaneously proved that $\mathcal{T}(\mathbb{D})$ also coincides with $\mathcal{D}$. Based on these results, we further proved that the essential commutant of Toeplitz algebra $\mathcal{T}(\mathbb{D})$ equals to $\{T_g: g\in VO_{bdd}\} + \mathcal{K}$ where $VO_{bdd}$ is the collection of functions of vanishing oscillation on polydisk $\mathbb{D}$ and $\mathcal{K}$ denotes the collection of compact operators on $L^2_a(\mathbb{D}, dv)$. On the other hand, we also prove that the essential commutant of $\{T_g: g\in VO_{bdd}\}$ is $\mathcal{T}(\mathbb{D})$, which implies that image of $\mathcal{T}(\mathbb{D})$ in the Calkin algebra satisfies the double commutant relation: $\pi(\mathcal{T}(\mathbb{D}))=\pi(\mathcal{T}(\mathbb{D}))''$.</description>

      <title>A note on a question of Garth Dales: Arens regularity as a three space property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Garth Dales asked whether a Banach algebra $\mA$ with an Arens regular closed ideal $\mJ$ and an Arens regular quotient $\mA/\mJ$ is necessarily Arens regular. We prove in this note that, for a class of Banach algebras including the standard algebras in harmonic analysis, Garth's conditions force the algebra to be even reflexive. We also give examples of Banach algebras with Garth's conditions, that are not Arens regular.</description>

      <title>On the set of extreme points of the unit ball of a Hardy-Lorentz space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every measurable function $f:\,[0,a]\to\mathbb{C}$ such that $|f|=1$ a.e. on $[0,a]$ is an extreme point of the unit ball of the Lorentz space $\Lambda(\varphi)$ on $[0,a]$ whenever $\varphi$ is a not linear, strictly increasing, concave, continuous function on $[0,a]$ with $\varphi(0)=0$. As a consequence, we complement the classical de Leeuw-Rudin theorem on a description of extreme points of the unit ball of $H^1$ showing that $H^1$ is a unique Hardy-Lorentz space $H(\Lambda(\varphi))$, for which every extreme point of the unit ball is a normed outer function. Moreover, assuming that $\varphi$ is strictly increasing and strictly concave, we prove that every function $f\in H(\Lambda(\varphi))$, $\|f\|_{H(\Lambda(\varphi))}=1$, such that its nontangential limit ${f}(e^{it})$ is a constant on some set of positive measure of $[0,2\pi]$, is an extreme point of the unit ball of $H(\Lambda(\varphi))$.</description>

      <title>On collectively L-weakly compact sets of operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set of bounded linear operators from a Banach space to a Banach lattice is collectively L-weakly compact whenever union of images of the unit ball is L-weakly compact. We extend the Meyer-Nieberg duality theorem to collectively L-weakly compact sets of operators, study relations between these sets and collectively almost limited sets, and discuss the domination problem for collectively compact sets and collectively L-weakly compact sets.</description>

      <title>On a broad family of quasi-Banach modulation spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr B$ be a normal quasi-Banach function space with respect to $r_0 \in (0,1]$ and $v_0$, $\omega$ be $v$-moderate, and let $r\in [r_0,\infty ]$. Then we prove that $f$ belongs to the modulation space $M(\omega ,\mathscr B )$, iff $V_\phi f$ belongs to the Wiener amalgam space $W ^r(\omega ,\mathscr B )$, and $$ \| f \| _{M(\omega , \mathscr B)} \asymp \| V _\phi f \, \omega \| _{\mathscr B} \asymp \| V _\phi f\| _{W ^r(\omega, \mathscr B)}. $$ We also show that the result can be useful in different situations. For example, we prove for $f,g\in \Sigma _1'\setminus 0$ that $V_gf\in L^{r_0}_{(v)}$, iff $f,g\in M^{r_0}_{(v)}$.</description>

      <title>ABB theorems: Results and limitations in infinite dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a weakly compact convex subset of $\ell^2$ with nonempty interior that has an isolated maximal element, with respect to the lattice order $\ell _+^2$. Moreover, the maximal point cannot be supported by any strictly positive functional, showing that the Arrow-Barankin-Blackwell theorem fails. This example discloses the pertinence of the assumption that the cone has a bounded base for the validity of the result in infinite dimensions. Under this latter assumption, the equivalence of the notions of strict maximality and maximality is established</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that operators of the form $A=-a(x)^2\Delta^{2}$, with suitable growth conditions on the coefficient $a(x)$, generate analytic semigroups in $L^1(\mathbb{R}^N)$. In particular, we deduce generation results for the operator $A :=- (1+|x|^2)^{\alpha} \Delta^{2}$, $0\leq\alpha\leq2$. Moreover, we characterise the maximal domain of $A$ in $L^1(\mathbb{R}^N)$.</description>

      <title>Partially isometric Toeplitz operators with operator-valued symbols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study partially isometric Toeplitz operators $T_{\Phi}$ on Hilbert space-valued Hardy spaces $H_{\mathcal{E}}^2(\mathbb{D}^n)$ over the unit polydisc. We establish the following crucial phenomenon: the range of partially isometric Toeplitz operators is always a Beurling-type invariant subspace of $H_{\mathcal{E}}^2(\mathbb{D}^n)$. Using this result, we prove that partially isometric Toeplitz operators always admit the following factorization: \[ T_{\Phi} = M_{\Gamma} M_{\Psi}^*, \] where $\Gamma(\boldsymbol{z}), \Psi(\boldsymbol{z})$ are operator-valued inner functions on $\mathbb{D}^n$, governed by certain conditions that force $M_{\Gamma} M_{\Psi}^*$ to become a Toeplitz operator. Our results are new even in the case of Hardy spaces over the unit disc, and extend the work of Brown-Douglas, Deepak-Pradhan-Sarkar on scalar-valued Hardy spaces.</description>

      <title>Projective tensor products where every element is norm-attaining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we analyse when every element of $X\widehat{\otimes}_\pi Y$ attains its projective norm. We prove that this is the case if $X$ is the dual of a subspace of a predual of an $\ell_1(I)$ space and $Y$ is $1$-complemented in its bidual under approximation properties assumptions. This result allows us to provide some new examples where $X$ is a Lipschitz-free space. We also prove that the set of norm-attaining elements is dense in $X\widehat{\otimes}_\pi Y$ if, for instance, $X=L_1(\mu)$ and $Y$ is any Banach space, or if $X$ has the metric $\pi$-property and $Y$ is a dual space with the RNP.</description>

      <title>Interpolation Khrushchev-type formulas for structured operators, inequalities and asymptotic relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that interpolation results in the $S$-nodes theory may be considered as Khrushchev-type formulas. If separation of the well-known Verblunsky (Schur) coefficients occurs in Khrushchev formulas, the separation of the so the called new Verblunsky-type coefficients occurs in the interpolation formulas of the $S$-nodes theory. General asymptotic inequalities (and equalities) for the $S$-nodes, with application to the block Hankel matrices, are derived using this approach. Another asymptotic inequality, needed in the proofs and important in itself, is derived in Appendix B.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\phi: A\to A$ be a (not necessarily linear, additive or continuous)
  map of a standard operator algebra. Suppose for any $a,b\in A$ there is an algebra automorphism $\theta_{a,b}$ of $ A$ such that \begin{align*} \phi(a)\phi(b) = \theta_{a,b}(ab). \end{align*} We show that either $\phi$ or $-\phi$ is a linear Jordan homomorphism.
  Similar results are obtained when any of the following conditions is satisfied: \begin{align*} \phi(a) + \phi(b) &amp;= \theta_{a,b}(a+b), \\ \phi(a)\phi(b)+\phi(b)\phi(a) &amp;= \theta_{a,b}(ab+ba), \quad\text{or} \\ \phi(a)\phi(b)\phi(a) &amp;= \theta_{a,b}(aba). \end{align*}
  We also show that a map $\phi: M\to M$ of a semi-finite von Neumann algebra $ M$ is a linear derivation if for every $a,b\in M$ there is a linear derivation $D_{a,b}$ of $M$ such that $$ \phi(a)b + a\phi(b) = D_{a,b}(ab). $$</description>

      <title>Sharp functional calculus for the Taibleson operator on non-archimedean local fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any non-archimedean local field $\mathbb{K}$ and any integer $n \geq 1$, we show that the Taibleson operator admits a bounded $H^\infty(\Sigma\_\theta)$ functional calculus for any angle $\theta \&amp;gt; 0$ on the Banach space $L^p(\mathbb{K}^n)$, where $\Sigma\_\theta=\{ z \in \mathbb{C}^*: |\arg z| \&lt; \theta \}$ and $1 \&lt; p \&lt; \infty$, and even a bounded H\''ormander functional calculus of order $\frac{3}{2}$ (with striking contrast to the Euclidean Laplacian on $\R^n$). In our study, we explore harmonic analysis on locally compact Spector-Vilenkin groups establishing the $R$-boundedness of a family of convolution operators. Our results enhance the understanding of functional calculi of operators acting on $L^p$-spaces associated to totally disconnected spaces and have implications for the maximal regularity of the fundamental evolution equations associated to the Taibleson operator, relevant in various physical models.</description>

      <title>Arens regularity and irregularity of ideals in Fourier and group algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a weakly sequentially complete Banach algebra containing a bounded approximate identity that is an ideal in its second dual $\mathcal{A}^{\ast\ast}$, we call such an algebra a Wesebai algebra. In the present paper we examine the Arens regularity properties of closed ideals of algebras in the Wesebai class. We observe that, although Wesebai algebras are always strongly Arens irregular, a variety of Arens regularity properties can be observed within their closed ideals.
  After characterizing Arens regular ideals and strongly Arens irregular ideals, we proceed to particularize to the main examples of \wasabi algebras, the convolution group algebras $L^1(G)$, $G$ compact, and the Fourier algebras $A(\Gamma)$, $\Gamma$ discrete and amenable. We find examples of Arens regular ideals in $L^1(G)$ and $A(\Gamma)$, both reflexive and nonreflexive and examples of strongly Arens irregular ideals that are not in the \wasabi class. For this, we construct, in many noncommutative groups, a new class of Riesz sets which are not $\Lambda(p)$, for any $p&gt;1$. Our approach also shows that every infinite Abelian group contains a Rosenthal set that is not $\Lambda(p)$, for any $p&gt;0$. These latter results could be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We prove a uniform vector-valued Wiener-Wintner Theorem for a class of operators that includes compositions of ergodic Koopman operators with contractive multiplication operators. Our results are new even in the case of complex-valued functions, as they also apply to some non-positive non-contractive operators, and they give new uniform pointwise theorems for ergodic, weakly mixing, and mildly mixing Koopman operators.</description>

      <title>Extreme points of matrix convex sets and their spanning properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This expository article gives a survey of matrix convex sets, a natural generalization of convex sets to the noncommutative (dimension-free) setting, with a focus on their extreme points. Mirroring the classical setting, extreme points play an important role in matrix convexity, and a natural question is, ``are matrix convex sets the (closed) matrix convex hull of their extreme points?" That is, does a Krein-Milman theorem hold in this setting? This question requires some care, as there are several notions of extreme points for matrix convex sets. Three of the most prevalent notions are matrix extreme points, matrix exposed points, and free extreme points. For each of these types of extreme points, we examine strengths and shortcomings in terms of a Krein-Milman theorem. Of particular note is the fact that these extreme points are all finite-dimensional in nature. As such, a large amount of our discussion is about free spectrahedra, which are matrix convex sets determined by a linear matrix inequality.</description>

      <title>Spherical Fourier multipliers related to Gelfand pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a family of Fourier multipliers using the spherical Fourier transform on Gelfand pairs. We refer to them as spherical Fourier multipliers. We study certain sufficient conditions under which they are bounded. Then, under the hypothesis of compactness of the underlying group and under certain summability conditions, we obtain the belonging of the spherical Fourier multipliers to some Schatten-von Neumann classes.</description>

      <title>Pathwise Uniform Convergence of Time Discretisation Schemes for SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00411v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove convergence rates for time discretisation schemes for semi-linear stochastic evolution equations with additive or multiplicative Gaussian noise, where the leading operator $A$ is the generator of a strongly continuous semigroup $S$ on a Hilbert space $X$, and the focus is on non-parabolic problems. The main results are optimal bounds for the uniform strong error $$\mathrm{E}_{k}^{\infty} := \Big(\mathbb{E} \sup_{j\in \{0, \ldots, N_k\}} \|U(t_j) - U^j\|^p\Big)^{1/p},$$ where $p \in [2,\infty)$, $U$ is the mild solution, $U^j$ is obtained from a time discretisation scheme, $k$ is the step size, and $N_k = T/k$. The usual schemes such as the exponential Euler, the implicit Euler, and the Crank-Nicolson method, etc. are included as special cases. Under conditions on the nonlinearity and the noise, we show
  - $\mathrm{E}_{k}^{\infty}\lesssim k \log(T/k)$ (linear equation, additive noise, general $S$);
  - $\mathrm{E}_{k}^{\infty}\lesssim \sqrt{k} \log(T/k)$ (nonlinear equation, multiplicative noise, contractive $S$);
  - $\mathrm{E}_{k}^{\infty}\lesssim k \log(T/k)$ (nonlinear wave equation, multiplicative noise) for a large class of time discretisation schemes. The logarithmic factor can be removed if the exponential Euler method is used with a (quasi)-contractive $S$. The obtained bounds coincide with the optimal bounds for SDEs. Most of the existing literature is concerned with bounds for the simpler pointwise strong error $$\mathrm{E}_k:=\bigg(\sup_{j\in \{0,\ldots,N_k\}}\mathbb{E} \|U(t_j) - U^{j}\|^p\bigg)^{1/p}.$$ Applications to Maxwell equations, Schr\"odinger equations, and wave equations are included. For these equations, our results improve and reprove several existing results with a unified method and provide the first results known for the implicit Euler and the Crank-Nicolson method.</description>

      <title>Global existence for an isotropic modification of the Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the open problem of large-data global existence for the non-cutoff Boltzmann equation, we introduce a model equation that in some sense disregards the anisotropy of the Boltzmann collision kernel. We refer to this model equation as isotropic Boltzmann, by analogy with the isotropic Landau equation introduced by Krieger and Strain [Comm. Partial Differential Equations 37(4), 2012, 647--689]. The collision operator of our isotropic Boltzmann model converges to the isotropic Landau collision operator under a scaling limit that is analogous to the grazing collisions limit connecting (true) Boltzmann with (true) Landau.
  Our main result is global existence for the isotropic Boltzmann equation in the space homogeneous case, for certain parts of the "very soft potentials" regime in which global existence is unknown for the space homogeneous Boltzmann equation. The proof strategy is inspired by the work of Gualdani-Guillen [J. Funct. Anal. 283(6), 2022, Paper No. 109559] on isotropic Landau, and makes use of recent progress on weighted fractional Hardy inequalities.</description>

      <title>Generalized Stein's lemma and asymptotic equipartition property for subalgebra entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum Stein's lemma is a fundamental result of quantum hypothesis testing in the context of distinguishing two quantum states. A recent conjecture, known as the ``generalized quantum Stein's lemma", asserts that this result is true in a general framework where one of the states is replaced by convex sets of quantum states. In this work, we show that the assertion of the generalized Stein's lemma is true for the setting where the second hypothesis is the state space of any subalgebra $\mathcal{N}$. This is obtained through a strong asymptotic equipartition property for smooth subalgebra entropies that applies for any fixed smoothing parameter $\epsilon\in (0,1)$. As an application in resource theory, we show that the relative entropy of a subalgebra is the asymptotic dilution cost under suitable operations. This provides a scope to establish a connection between different quantum resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The solvability for infinite dimensional differential algebraic equations possessing a resolvent index and a Weierstra{\ss} form is studied. In particular, the concept of integrated semigroups is used to determine a subset on which solutions exist and are unique. This information is later used for a important class of systems, namely, port-Hamiltonian differential algebraic equations.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Thirring inequalities on the spheres and $SO(3)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain new upper bounds for the Lieb-Thirring inequality on the spheres of any dimension greater than $2$. As far as we have checked, our results improve previous results found in the literature for all dimensions greater than $2$. We also prove and exhibit an explicit new upper bound for the Lieb-Thirring inequality on $SO(3)$. We also discuss these estimates in the case of general compact Lie groups. Originally developed for estimating the sums of moments of negative eigenvalues of the Schr\"odinger operator in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$, these inequalities have applications in quantum mechanics and other fields.</description>
