      <title>On Macroscopic Intricate States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present contribution is in the field of quantum modelling of macroscopic phenomena. The focus is on one  enigmatic aspect of quantum physics, namely the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox and entanglement. After a review of the state of the art concerning macroscopic quantum effects and quantum interaction, this contribution proposes a link between embryology and acupuncture  in the framework of macroscopic intricate states induced by quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Towards Linking Histological Changes to Liver Viscoelasticity: A Hybrid Analytical-Computational Micromechanics Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by elastography that utilizes tissue mechanical properties as biomarkers for liver disease, and the eventual objective of providing explicit links between histology and bulk mechanical properties, we develop a micromechanical modeling approach to capture the effects of fat and collagen deposition in the liver. Specifically, we utilize computational homogenization to convert the microstructural changes in hepatic lobule to the effective viscoelastic modulus of the liver tissue, i.e. predict the bulk material properties by analyzing the deformation of repeating unit cell. The lipid and collagen deposition is simulated with the help of ad hoc algorithms informed by histological observations. Collagen deposition is directly included in the computational model, while composite material theory is used to convert fat content to the microscopic mechanical properties. The results illustrate the ability of the model to capture the effect of both fat and collagen deposition on the viscoelastic moduli and represents a step towards linking histological changes in the liver to its bulk mechanical properties, which can provide insights for accurate diagnosis with elastography.</description>

      <title>Modeling the effect of hydrodynamic wakes in dynamical models of large-scale fish schools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel model of the wake of swimming fish is developed and incorporated into a dynamical model of a fish school to explore the effect of hydrodynamics on the emergent behavior in schooling fish. The model incorporates well-established rules for attraction, alignment, and visual detection via a force-momentum balance in the surge, sway, and yaw directions, thereby allowing us to include the effects of body size, shape, and inertia in to the dynamics of fish motion. The key novelty of the model lies in the modeling of the hydrodynamics, which includes not only the potential flow induced by the body of the fish but also the vortex wakes generated by the fish. These hydrodynamic features, as well as the surge, sway, and yaw force coefficients, are parameterized via three-dimensional high-fidelity direct numerical simulations of a carangiform swimmer, thereby enabling a higher degree of realism in these models. The model is used to examine the effect of wake characteristics on the topology and movement of fish schools. The simulations indicate that these wake vortices lead to improved organization within the schools, especially in situations where the social forces are relatively weak.</description>

      <title>Elucidating chirality transfer in liquid crystals of viruses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirality is ubiquitous in nature across all length scales, with major implications spanning the fields of biology, chemistry and physics to materials science. How chirality propagates from nanoscale building blocks to meso- and macroscopic helical structures remains an open issue. Here, working with a canonical system of filamentous viruses, we demonstrate that their self-assembly into chiral liquid crystal phases quantitatively results from the interplay between two main mechanisms of chirality transfer: electrostatic interactions from the helical charge patterns on the virus surface, and fluctuation-based helical deformations leading to viral backbone helicity. Our experimental and theoretical approach provides a comprehensive framework for deciphering how chirality is hierarchically and quantitatively propagated across spatial scales. Our work highlights the ways in which supramolecular helicity may arise from subtle chiral contributions of opposite handedness which either act cooperatively or competitively, thus accounting for the multiplicity of chiral behaviors observed for nearly identical molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Optically-Trapped Nanodiamond-Relaxometry Detection of Nanomolar Paramagnetic Spins in Aqueous Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probing electrical and magnetic properties in aqueous environments remains a frontier challenge in nanoscale sensing. Our inability to do so with quantitative accuracy imposes severe limitations, for example, on our understanding of the ionic environments in a diverse array of systems, ranging from novel materials to the living cell. The Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center in fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) has emerged as a good candidate to sense temperature, pH, and the concentration of paramagnetic species at the nanoscale, but comes with several hurdles such as particle-to-particle variation which render calibrated measurements difficult, and the challenge to tightly confine and precisely position sensors in aqueous environment. To address this, we demonstrate relaxometry with NV centers within optically-trapped FNDs. In a proof of principle experiment, we show that optically-trapped FNDs enable highly reproducible nanomolar sensitivity to the paramagnetic ion, (\mathrm{Gd}^{3+}). We capture the three distinct phases of our experimental data by devising a model analogous to nanoscale Langmuir adsorption combined with spin coherence dynamics. Our work provides a basis for routes to sense free paramagnetic ions and molecules in biologically relevant conditions.</description>
