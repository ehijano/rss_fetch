      <title>A note on MDS Property of Circulant Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In $2014$, Gupta and Ray proved that the circulant involutory matrices over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ can not be maximum distance separable (MDS). This non-existence also extends to circulant orthogonal matrices of order $2^d \times 2^d$ over finite fields of characteristic $2$. These findings inspired many authors to generalize the circulant property for constructing lightweight MDS matrices with practical applications in mind. Recently, in $2022,$ Chatterjee and Laha initiated a study of circulant matrices by considering semi-involutory and semi-orthogonal properties. Expanding on their work, this article delves into circulant matrices possessing these characteristics over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}.$ Notably, we establish a correlation between the trace of associated diagonal matrices and the MDS property of the matrix. We prove that this correlation holds true for even order semi-orthogonal matrices and semi-involutory matrices of all orders. Additionally, we provide examples that for circulant, semi-orthogonal matrices of odd orders over a finite field with characteristic $2$, the trace of associated diagonal matrices may possess non-zero values.</description>

      <title>Lomas: A Platform for Confidential Analysis of Private Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public services collect massive volumes of data to fulfill their missions. These data fuel the generation of regional, national, and international statistics across various sectors. However, their immense potential remains largely untapped due to strict and legitimate privacy regulations. In this context, Lomas is a novel open-source platform designed to realize the full potential of the data held by public administrations. It enables authorized users, such as approved researchers and government analysts, to execute algorithms on confidential datasets without directly accessing the data. The Lomas platform is designed to operate within a trusted computing environment, such as governmental IT infrastructure. Authorized users access the platform remotely to submit their algorithms for execution on private datasets. Lomas executes these algorithms without revealing the data to the user and returns the results protected by Differential Privacy, a framework that introduces controlled noise to the results, rendering any attempt to extract identifiable information unreliable. Differential Privacy allows for the mathematical quantification and control of the risk of disclosure while allowing for a complete transparency regarding how data is protected and utilized. The contributions of this project will significantly transform how data held by public services are used, unlocking valuable insights from previously inaccessible data. Lomas empowers research, informing policy development, e.g., public health interventions, and driving innovation across sectors, all while upholding the highest data confidentiality standards.</description>

      <title>BEEAR: Embedding-based Adversarial Removal of Safety Backdoors in Instruction-tuned Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety backdoor attacks in large language models (LLMs) enable the stealthy triggering of unsafe behaviors while evading detection during normal interactions. The high dimensionality of potential triggers in the token space and the diverse range of malicious behaviors make this a critical challenge. We present BEEAR, a mitigation approach leveraging the insight that backdoor triggers induce relatively uniform drifts in the model's embedding space. Our bi-level optimization method identifies universal embedding perturbations that elicit unwanted behaviors and adjusts the model parameters to reinforce safe behaviors against these perturbations. Experiments show BEEAR reduces the success rate of RLHF time backdoor attacks from &gt;95% to &lt;1% and from 47% to 0% for instruction-tuning time backdoors targeting malicious code generation, without compromising model utility. Requiring only defender-defined safe and unwanted behaviors, BEEAR represents a step towards practical defenses against safety backdoors in LLMs, providing a foundation for further advancements in AI safety and security.</description>

      <title>ammBoost: State Growth Control for AMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated market makers (AMMs) are a form of decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges and considered a prime example of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications. Their popularity and high trading activity have resulted in millions of on-chain transactions leading to serious scalability issues. In this paper, we address the on-chain storage overhead problem of AMMs by utilizing a new sidechain architecture as a layer 2 solution, building a system called ammBoost. Our system reduces the amount of on-chain transactions, boosts throughput, and supports blockchain pruning. We devise several techniques to enable layer 2 processing for AMMs while preserving correctness and security of the underlying AMM. We also build a proof-of-concept of ammBoost for a Uniswap-inspired use case to empirically evaluate its performance. Our experiments show that ammBoost decreases the gas cost by 94.53% and the chain growth by at least 80%, and that it can support up to 500x of the daily traffic volume observed for Uniswap in practice.</description>

      <title>Robust Zero Trust Architecture: Joint Blockchain based Federated learning and Anomaly Detection based Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a robust zero-trust architecture (ZTA) tailored for the decentralized system that empowers efficient remote work and collaboration within IoT networks. Using blockchain-based federated learning principles, our proposed framework includes a robust aggregation mechanism designed to counteract malicious updates from compromised clients, enhancing the security of the global learning process. Moreover, secure and reliable trust computation is essential for remote work and collaboration. The robust ZTA framework integrates anomaly detection and trust computation, ensuring secure and reliable device collaboration in a decentralized fashion. We introduce an adaptive algorithm that dynamically adjusts to varying user contexts, using unsupervised clustering to detect novel anomalies, like zero-day attacks. To ensure a reliable and scalable trust computation, we develop an algorithm that dynamically adapts to varying user contexts by employing incremental anomaly detection and clustering techniques to identify and share local and global anomalies between nodes. Future directions include scalability improvements, Dirichlet process for advanced anomaly detection, privacy-preserving techniques, and the integration of post-quantum cryptographic methods to safeguard against emerging quantum threats.</description>

      <title>VR-based Blockchain-enabled Data Visualization Framework For Manufacturing Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research proposes a blockchain-based data visualization framework integrated with VR to get manufacturing insights. This framework is implemented at the testbed of the Future Factories Lab at the University of South Carolina. The proposed system aims to enhance understanding, analysis, and decision-making processes by immersing users in a VR environment where complex manufacturing data stored using blockchain is translated into intuitive and interactive representations. The project focuses on two main components: blockchain and VR. Hyperledger Fabric is employed to establish a blockchain network, recording data from the Future Factories testbed. This system captures information from various sources, such as potentiometers on robot grippers to measure grip positioning, load cells to gauge pressure, emergency stop buttons, temperature, speed, and vibration sensors on the conveyors. Whenever predefined conditions are met, pertinent data, including sensor ID, timestamp, value, cause, and importance, is securely recorded in the blockchain, signaling the occurrence of a defect within the cell. Data retrieved from the blockchain system is accessed through 'GET' API requests. A VR application is developed using a cross-platform Unity game engine to visualize the data retrieved from the blockchain database. Meta Quest 3 is used as the targeted Head Mounted VR device. The VR application has two C# scripts: one script to query blockchain data using 'GET' API calls and another script converts the JSON object to text data to visualize in the VR system. The proposed system leverages blockchain technology and VR visualization to deliver immersive, actionable insights using secure data transmission. By embracing the proposed framework, manufacturers can unlock new potential for efficiency, sustainability, and resilience in today's increasingly complex and interconnected manufacturing workplace.</description>

      <title>Securing Voice Authentication Applications Against Targeted Data Poisoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural network-based voice authentication systems are promising biometric verification techniques that uniquely identify biological characteristics to verify a user. However, they are particularly susceptible to targeted data poisoning attacks, where attackers replace legitimate users' utterances with their own. We propose an enhanced framework using realworld datasets considering realistic attack scenarios. The results show that the proposed approach is robust, providing accurate authentications even when only a small fraction (5% of the dataset) is poisoned.</description>

      <title>Semantic Deep Hiding for Robust Unlearnable Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring data privacy and protection has become paramount in the era of deep learning. Unlearnable examples are proposed to mislead the deep learning models and prevent data from unauthorized exploration by adding small perturbations to data. However, such perturbations (e.g., noise, texture, color change) predominantly impact low-level features, making them vulnerable to common countermeasures. In contrast, semantic images with intricate shapes have a wealth of high-level features, making them more resilient to countermeasures and potential for producing robust unlearnable examples. In this paper, we propose a Deep Hiding (DH) scheme that adaptively hides semantic images enriched with high-level features. We employ an Invertible Neural Network (INN) to invisibly integrate predefined images, inherently hiding them with deceptive perturbations. To enhance data unlearnability, we introduce a Latent Feature Concentration module, designed to work with the INN, regularizing the intra-class variance of these perturbations. To further boost the robustness of unlearnable examples, we design a Semantic Images Generation module that produces hidden semantic images. By utilizing similar semantic information, this module generates similar semantic images for samples within the same classes, thereby enlarging the inter-class distance and narrowing the intra-class distance. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and an ImageNet subset, against 18 countermeasures, reveal that our proposed method exhibits outstanding robustness for unlearnable examples, demonstrating its efficacy in preventing unauthorized data exploitation.</description>

      <title>Laminator: Verifiable ML Property Cards using Hardware-assisted Attestations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regulations increasingly call for various assurances from machine learning (ML) model providers about their training data, training process, and the behavior of resulting models during inference. For better transparency, companies (e.g., Huggingface and Google) have adopted model cards and datasheets which describe different properties of the training datasets and models. In the same vein, we introduce the notion of an inference card to describe the properties of a given inference (e.g., binding output to the model and its corresponding input). We collectively refer to these as ML property cards.
  A malicious model provider can include false information in ML property cards, raising a need for verifiable ML property cards. We show how to realized them using property attestation, technical mechanisms by which a prover (e.g., a model provider) can attest different ML properties during training and inference to a verifier (e.g., an auditor). However, prior attestation mechanisms based purely on cryptography are often narrowly focused (lacking versatility) and inefficient. There is a need to efficiently attest different types properties across the ML model training and inference pipeline.
  Recent developments make it possible to run and even train models inside hardware-assisted trusted execution environments (TEEs), which can provide highly efficient attestation. We propose Laminator, the first framework for verifiable ML property cards using hardware-assisted ML property attestations to efficiently furnish attestations for various ML properties for training and inference. It scales to multiple verifiers, and is independent of the model configuration.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Reinforcement Learning in Red Teaming for Advanced Ransomware Attack Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ransomware presents a significant and increasing threat to individuals and organizations by encrypting their systems and not releasing them until a large fee has been extracted. To bolster preparedness against potential attacks, organizations commonly conduct red teaming exercises, which involve simulated attacks to assess existing security measures. This paper proposes a novel approach utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) to simulate ransomware attacks. By training an RL agent in a simulated environment mirroring real-world networks, effective attack strategies can be learned quickly, significantly streamlining traditional, manual penetration testing processes. The attack pathways revealed by the RL agent can provide valuable insights to the defense team, helping them identify network weak points and develop more resilient defensive measures. Experimental results on a 152-host example network confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating the RL agent's capability to discover and orchestrate attacks on high-value targets while evading honeyfiles (decoy files strategically placed to detect unauthorized access).</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based Adversarial Purification for Intrusion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escalating sophistication of cyberattacks has encouraged the integration of machine learning techniques in intrusion detection systems, but the rise of adversarial examples presents a significant challenge. These crafted perturbations mislead ML models, enabling attackers to evade detection or trigger false alerts. As a reaction, adversarial purification has emerged as a compelling solution, particularly with diffusion models showing promising results. However, their purification potential remains unexplored in the context of intrusion detection. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of diffusion models in purifying adversarial examples in network intrusion detection. Through a comprehensive analysis of the diffusion parameters, we identify optimal configurations maximizing adversarial robustness with minimal impact on normal performance. Importantly, this study reveals insights into the relationship between diffusion noise and diffusion steps, representing a novel contribution to the field. Our experiments are carried out on two datasets and against 5 adversarial attacks. The implementation code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Protecting the 'Stop Using My Data' Right through Blockchain-assisted Evidence Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to provide personalized services to users, Internet-based platforms collect and utilize user-generated behavioral data. Although the 'stop using my data' right should be a fundamental data right, which allows individuals to request their personal data to be no longer utilized by online platforms, the existing preventive data protection measures (e.g., cryptographic data elimination, differential privacy) are unfortunately not applicable. This work aims to develop the first Evidence Generation Framework for deterring post-acquisition data right violations. We formulated the 'stop using my data' problem, which captures a vantage facet of the multi-faceted notion of 'right to be forgotten'. We designed and implemented the first blockchain-assisted system to generate evidence for deterring the violations of the 'stop using my data' right. Our system employs a novel two-stage evidence generation protocol whose efficacy is ensured by a newly proposed Lemma. To validate our framework, we conducted a case study on recommendation systems with systematic evaluation experiments using two real-world datasets: the measured success rate exceeds 99%.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Link Stealing Attacks Against Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph data contains rich node features and unique edge information, which have been applied across various domains, such as citation networks or recommendation systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are specialized for handling such data and have shown impressive performance in many applications. However, GNNs may contain of sensitive information and susceptible to privacy attacks. For example, link stealing is a type of attack in which attackers infer whether two nodes are linked or not. Previous link stealing attacks primarily relied on posterior probabilities from the target GNN model, neglecting the significance of node features. Additionally, variations in node classes across different datasets lead to different dimensions of posterior probabilities. The handling of these varying data dimensions posed a challenge in using a single model to effectively conduct link stealing attacks on different datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform link stealing attacks on GNNs. LLMs can effectively integrate textual features and exhibit strong generalizability, enabling attacks to handle diverse data dimensions across various datasets. We design two distinct LLM prompts to effectively combine textual features and posterior probabilities of graph nodes. Through these designed prompts, we fine-tune the LLM to adapt to the link stealing attack task. Furthermore, we fine-tune the LLM using multiple datasets and enable the LLM to learn features from different datasets simultaneously. Experimental results show that our approach significantly enhances the performance of existing link stealing attack tasks in both white-box and black-box scenarios. Our method can execute link stealing attacks across different datasets using only a single model, making link stealing attacks more applicable to real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Machine Unlearning with Minimal Gradient Dependence for High Unlearning Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of machine unlearning, the primary challenge lies in effectively removing traces of private data from trained models while maintaining model performance and security against privacy attacks like membership inference attacks. Traditional gradient-based unlearning methods often rely on extensive historical gradients, which becomes impractical with high unlearning ratios and may reduce the effectiveness of unlearning. Addressing these limitations, we introduce Mini-Unlearning, a novel approach that capitalizes on a critical observation: unlearned parameters correlate with retrained parameters through contraction mapping. Our method, Mini-Unlearning, utilizes a minimal subset of historical gradients and leverages this contraction mapping to facilitate scalable, efficient unlearning. This lightweight, scalable method significantly enhances model accuracy and strengthens resistance to membership inference attacks. Our experiments demonstrate that Mini-Unlearning not only works under higher unlearning ratios but also outperforms existing techniques in both accuracy and security, offering a promising solution for applications requiring robust unlearning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Inception: Efficiently Computable Misinformation Attacks on Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study security threats to Markov games due to information asymmetry and misinformation. We consider an attacker player who can spread misinformation about its reward function to influence the robust victim player's behavior. Given a fixed fake reward function, we derive the victim's policy under worst-case rationality and present polynomial-time algorithms to compute the attacker's optimal worst-case policy based on linear programming and backward induction. Then, we provide an efficient inception ("planting an idea in someone's mind") attack algorithm to find the optimal fake reward function within a restricted set of reward functions with dominant strategies. Importantly, our methods exploit the universal assumption of rationality to compute attacks efficiently. Thus, our work exposes a security vulnerability arising from standard game assumptions under misinformation.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the efficacy of several practical methods for approximate machine unlearning developed for large-scale deep learning. In addition to complying with data deletion requests, one often-cited potential application for unlearning methods is to remove the effects of training on poisoned data. We experimentally demonstrate that, while existing unlearning methods have been demonstrated to be effective in a number of evaluation settings (e.g., alleviating membership inference attacks), they fail to remove the effects of data poisoning, across a variety of types of poisoning attacks (indiscriminate, targeted, and a newly-introduced Gaussian poisoning attack) and models (image classifiers and LLMs); even when granted a relatively large compute budget. In order to precisely characterize unlearning efficacy, we introduce new evaluation metrics for unlearning based on data poisoning. Our results suggest that a broader perspective, including a wider variety of evaluations, is required to avoid a false sense of confidence in machine unlearning procedures for deep learning without provable guarantees. Moreover, while unlearning methods show some signs of being useful to efficiently remove poisoned datapoints without having to retrain, our work suggests that these methods are not yet "ready for prime time", and currently provide limited benefit over retraining.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient and Scalable Training of Differentially Private Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is the standard algorithm for training machine learning models under differential privacy (DP). The major drawback of DP-SGD is the drop in utility which prior work has comprehensively studied. However, in practice another major drawback that hinders the large-scale deployment is the significantly higher computational cost. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study to quantify the computational cost of training deep learning models under DP and benchmark methods that aim at reducing the cost. Among these are more efficient implementations of DP-SGD and training with lower precision. Finally, we study the scaling behaviour using up to 80 GPUs.</description>

      <title>CuDA2: An approach for Incorporating Traitor Agents into Cooperative Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (CMARL) strategies are well known to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Previous works on adversarial attacks have primarily focused on white-box attacks that directly perturb the states or actions of victim agents, often in scenarios with a limited number of attacks. However, gaining complete access to victim agents in real-world environments is exceedingly difficult. To create more realistic adversarial attacks, we introduce a novel method that involves injecting traitor agents into the CMARL system. We model this problem as a Traitor Markov Decision Process (TMDP), where traitors cannot directly attack the victim agents but can influence their formation or positioning through collisions. In TMDP, traitors are trained using the same MARL algorithm as the victim agents, with their reward function set as the negative of the victim agents' reward. Despite this, the training efficiency for traitors remains low because it is challenging for them to directly associate their actions with the victim agents' rewards. To address this issue, we propose the Curiosity-Driven Adversarial Attack (CuDA2) framework. CuDA2 enhances the efficiency and aggressiveness of attacks on the specified victim agents' policies while maintaining the optimal policy invariance of the traitors. Specifically, we employ a pre-trained Random Network Distillation (RND) module, where the extra reward generated by the RND module encourages traitors to explore states unencountered by the victim agents. Extensive experiments on various scenarios from SMAC demonstrate that our CuDA2 framework offers comparable or superior adversarial attack capabilities compared to other baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep video inpainting is typically used as malicious manipulation to remove important objects for creating fake videos. It is significant to identify the inpainted regions blindly. This letter proposes a simple yet effective forensic scheme for Video Inpainting LOcalization with ContrAstive Learning (ViLocal). Specifically, a 3D Uniformer encoder is applied to the video noise residual for learning effective spatiotemporal forensic features. To enhance the discriminative power, supervised contrastive learning is adopted to capture the local inconsistency of inpainted videos through attracting/repelling the positive/negative pristine and forged pixel pairs. A pixel-wise inpainting localization map is yielded by a lightweight convolution decoder with a specialized two-stage training strategy. To prepare enough training samples, we build a video object segmentation dataset of 2500 videos with pixel-level annotations per frame. Extensive experimental results validate the superiority of ViLocal over state-of-the-arts. Code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/multimediaFor/ViLocal.</description>

      <title>Privacy Preserving Reinforcement Learning for Population Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of privacy protection in Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms that operate over population processes, a practical but understudied setting that includes, for example, the control of epidemics in large populations of dynamically interacting individuals. In this setting, the RL algorithm interacts with the population over $T$ time steps by receiving population-level statistics as state and performing actions which can affect the entire population at each time step. An individual's data can be collected across multiple interactions and their privacy must be protected at all times. We clarify the Bayesian semantics of Differential Privacy (DP) in the presence of correlated data in population processes through a Pufferfish Privacy analysis. We then give a meta algorithm that can take any RL algorithm as input and make it differentially private. This is achieved by taking an approach that uses DP mechanisms to privatize the state and reward signal at each time step before the RL algorithm receives them as input. Our main theoretical result shows that the value-function approximation error when applying standard RL algorithms directly to the privatized states shrinks quickly as the population size and privacy budget increase. This highlights that reasonable privacy-utility trade-offs are possible for differentially private RL algorithms in population processes. Our theoretical findings are validated by experiments performed on a simulated epidemic control problem over large population sizes.</description>

      <title>Nakamoto Consensus under Bounded Processing Capacity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09113v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For Nakamoto's longest-chain consensus protocol, whose proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) variants power major blockchains such as Bitcoin and Cardano, we revisit the classic problem of the security-performance tradeoff: Given a network of nodes with finite communication- and computation-resources, against what fraction of adversary power is Nakamoto consensus (NC) secure for a given block production rate? State-of-the-art analyses of NC fail to answer this question, because their bounded-delay model does not capture the rate limits to nodes' processing of blocks, which cause congestion when blocks are released in quick succession. We develop a new analysis technique to prove a refined security-performance tradeoff for PoW NC in a bounded-capacity model. In this model, we show that, in contrast to the classic bounded-delay model, Nakamoto's private attack is no longer the worst attack, and a new attack we call the teasing strategy, that exploits congestion, is strictly worse. In PoS, equivocating blocks can exacerbate congestion, making traditional PoS NC insecure except at very low block production rates. To counter such equivocation spamming, we present a variant of PoS NC we call Blanking NC (BlaNC), which achieves the same resilience as PoW NC.</description>

      <title>Detecting Misuse of Security APIs: A Systematic Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Security Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are crucial for ensuring software security. However, their misuse introduces vulnerabilities, potentially leading to severe data breaches and substantial financial loss. Complex API design, inadequate documentation, and insufficient security training often lead to unintentional misuse by developers. The software security community has devised and evaluated several approaches to detecting security API misuse to help developers and organizations. This study rigorously reviews the literature on detecting misuse of security APIs to gain a comprehensive understanding of this critical domain. Our goal is to identify and analyze security API misuses, the detection approaches developed, and the evaluation methodologies employed along with the open research avenues to advance the state-of-the-art in this area. Employing the systematic literature review (SLR) methodology, we analyzed 69 research papers. Our review has yielded (a) identification of 6 security API types; (b) classification of 30 distinct misuses; (c) categorization of detection techniques into heuristic-based and ML-based approaches; and (d) identification of 10 performance measures and 9 evaluation benchmarks. The review reveals a lack of coverage of detection approaches in several areas. We recommend that future efforts focus on aligning security API development with developers' needs and advancing standardized evaluation methods for detection technologies.</description>

      <title>A Resilient and Accessible Distribution-Preserving Watermark for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Watermarking techniques offer a promising way to identify machine-generated content via embedding covert information into the contents generated from language models. A challenge in the domain lies in preserving the distribution of original generated content after watermarking. Our research extends and improves upon existing watermarking framework, placing emphasis on the importance of a \textbf{Di}stribution-\textbf{P}reserving (DiP) watermark. Contrary to the current strategies, our proposed DiPmark simultaneously preserves the original token distribution during watermarking (distribution-preserving), is detectable without access to the language model API and prompts (accessible), and is provably robust to moderate changes of tokens (resilient). DiPmark operates by selecting a random set of tokens prior to the generation of a word, then modifying the token distribution through a distribution-preserving reweight function to enhance the probability of these selected tokens during the sampling process. Extensive empirical evaluation on various language models and tasks demonstrates our approach's distribution-preserving property, accessibility, and resilience, making it a effective solution for watermarking tasks that demand impeccable quality preservation.</description>

      <title>I Don't Know You, But I Can Catch You: Real-Time Defense against Diverse Adversarial Patches for Object Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have revolutionized the field of computer vision like object detection with their unparalleled performance. However, existing research has shown that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In the physical world, an adversary could exploit adversarial patches to implement a Hiding Attack (HA) which patches the target object to make it disappear from the detector, and an Appearing Attack (AA) which fools the detector into misclassifying the patch as a specific object. Recently, many defense methods for detectors have been proposed to mitigate the potential threats of adversarial patches. However, such methods still have limitations in generalization, robustness and efficiency. Most defenses are only effective against the HA, leaving the detector vulnerable to the AA.
  In this paper, we propose \textit{NutNet}, an innovative model for detecting adversarial patches, with high generalization, robustness and efficiency. With experiments for six detectors including YOLOv2-v4, SSD, Faster RCNN and DETR on both digital and physical domains, the results show that our proposed method can effectively defend against both the HA and AA, with only 0.4\% sacrifice of the clean performance. We compare NutNet with four baseline defense methods for detectors, and our method exhibits an average defense performance that is over 2.4 times and 4.7 times higher than existing approaches for HA and AA, respectively. In addition, NutNet only increases the inference time by 8\%, which can meet the real-time requirements of the detection systems. Demos of NutNet are available at: \url{https://sites.google.com/view/nutnet}.</description>

      <title>ECLIPSE: Expunging Clean-label Indiscriminate Poisons via Sparse Diffusion Purification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clean-label indiscriminate poisoning attacks add invisible perturbations to correctly labeled training images, thus dramatically reducing the generalization capability of the victim models. Recently, some defense mechanisms have been proposed such as adversarial training, image transformation techniques, and image purification. However, these schemes are either susceptible to adaptive attacks, built on unrealistic assumptions, or only effective against specific poison types, limiting their universal applicability. In this research, we propose a more universally effective, practical, and robust defense scheme called ECLIPSE. We first investigate the impact of Gaussian noise on the poisons and theoretically prove that any kind of poison will be largely assimilated when imposing sufficient random noise. In light of this, we assume the victim has access to an extremely limited number of clean images (a more practical scene) and subsequently enlarge this sparse set for training a denoising probabilistic model (a universal denoising tool). We then begin by introducing Gaussian noise to absorb the poisons and then apply the model for denoising, resulting in a roughly purified dataset. Finally, to address the trade-off of the inconsistency in the assimilation sensitivity of different poisons by Gaussian noise, we propose a lightweight corruption compensation module to effectively eliminate residual poisons, providing a more universal defense approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our defense approach outperforms 10 state-of-the-art defenses. We also propose an adaptive attack against ECLIPSE and verify the robustness of our defense scheme. Our code is available at https://github.com/CGCL-codes/ECLIPSE.</description>

      <title>Locally Differentially Private Distributed Online Learning with Guaranteed Optimality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed online learning is gaining increased traction due to its unique ability to process large-scale datasets and streaming data. To address the growing public awareness and concern on privacy protection, plenty of algorithms have been proposed to enable differential privacy in distributed online optimization and learning. However, these algorithms often face the dilemma of trading learning accuracy for privacy. By exploiting the unique characteristics of online learning, this paper proposes an approach that tackles the dilemma and ensures both differential privacy and learning accuracy in distributed online learning. More specifically, while ensuring a diminishing expected instantaneous regret, the approach can simultaneously ensure a finite cumulative privacy budget, even in the infinite time horizon. To cater for the fully distributed setting, we adopt the local differential-privacy framework, which avoids the reliance on a trusted data curator, and, hence, provides stronger protection than the classic "centralized" (global) differential privacy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that successfully ensures both rigorous local differential privacy and learning accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using machine learning tasks, including logistic regression on the the "mushrooms" datasets and CNN-based image classification on the "MNIST" and "CIFAR-10" datasets.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Fluctuation based Membership Inference Attack for Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12143v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Membership Inference Attack (MIA) identifies whether a record exists in a machine learning model's training set by querying the model. MIAs on the classic classification models have been well-studied, and recent works have started to explore how to transplant MIA onto generative models. Our investigation indicates that existing MIAs designed for generative models mainly depend on the overfitting in target models. However, overfitting can be avoided by employing various regularization techniques, whereas existing MIAs demonstrate poor performance in practice. Unlike overfitting, memorization is essential for deep learning models to attain optimal performance, making it a more prevalent phenomenon. Memorization in generative models leads to an increasing trend in the probability distribution of generating records around the member record. Therefore, we propose a Probabilistic Fluctuation Assessing Membership Inference Attack (PFAMI), a black-box MIA that infers memberships by detecting these trends via analyzing the overall probabilistic fluctuations around given records. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple generative models and datasets, which demonstrate PFAMI can improve the attack success rate (ASR) by about 27.9% when compared with the best baseline.</description>

      <title>Practical Membership Inference Attacks against Fine-tuned Large Language Models via Self-prompt Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) aim to infer whether a target data record has been utilized for model training or not. Prior attempts have quantified the privacy risks of language models (LMs) via MIAs, but there is still no consensus on whether existing MIA algorithms can cause remarkable privacy leakage on practical Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing MIAs designed for LMs can be classified into two categories: reference-free and reference-based attacks. They are both based on the hypothesis that training records consistently strike a higher probability of being sampled. Nevertheless, this hypothesis heavily relies on the overfitting of target models, which will be mitigated by multiple regularization methods and the generalization of LLMs. The reference-based attack seems to achieve promising effectiveness in LLMs, which measures a more reliable membership signal by comparing the probability discrepancy between the target model and the reference model. However, the performance of reference-based attack is highly dependent on a reference dataset that closely resembles the training dataset, which is usually inaccessible in the practical scenario. Overall, existing MIAs are unable to effectively unveil privacy leakage over practical fine-tuned LLMs that are overfitting-free and private. We propose a Membership Inference Attack based on Self-calibrated Probabilistic Variation (SPV-MIA). Specifically, since memorization in LLMs is inevitable during the training process and occurs before overfitting, we introduce a more reliable membership signal, probabilistic variation, which is based on memorization rather than overfitting. Furthermore, we introduce a self-prompt approach, which constructs the dataset to fine-tune the reference model by prompting the target LLM itself. In this manner, the adversary can collect a dataset with a similar distribution from public APIs.</description>

Abstract: Deepfakes have rapidly emerged as a profound and serious threat to society, primarily due to their ease of creation and dissemination. This situation has triggered an accelerated development of deepfake detection technologies. However, many existing detectors rely heavily on lab-generated datasets for validation, which may not effectively prepare them for novel, emerging, and real-world deepfake techniques. In this paper, we conduct an extensive and comprehensive review and analysis of the latest state-of-the-art deepfake detectors, evaluating them against several critical criteria. These criteria facilitate the categorization of these detectors into 4 high-level groups and 13 fine-grained sub-groups, all aligned with a unified standard conceptual framework. This classification and framework offer deep and practical insights into the factors that affect detector efficacy. We assess the generalizability of 16 leading detectors across various standard attack scenarios, including black-box, white-box, and gray-box settings. Our systematized analysis and experimentation lay the groundwork for a deeper understanding of deepfake detectors and their generalizability, paving the way for future research focused on creating detectors adept at countering various attack scenarios. Additionally, this work offers insights for developing more proactive defenses against deepfakes.</description>
