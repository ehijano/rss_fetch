      <title>Geophysical contribution to study the spatial variability of agricultural yields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies conducted on the experimental site of Lavalette (IRSTEA Montpellier) have shown variability in the observed agricultural yield, either attributable to spatial or temporal heterogeneities in water and nitrogen supply or to gradients of soil properties. The latter is addressed by performing a multi-depthg geophysical prospection that delivers maps of apparent electrical resistivity.</description>

      <title>Fault gouge failure induced by fluid injection: Hysteresis, delay and shear-strengthening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural faults often contain a fluid-saturated, granular fault-gouge layer, whose failure and sliding processes play a central role in earthquake dynamics. Using a two-dimensional discrete element model coupled with fluid dynamics, we simulate a fluid-saturated granular layer, where fluid pressure is incrementally raised. At a critical fluid pressure level, the layer fails and begins to accelerate. When we gradually reduce fluid pressure, a distinct behavior emerges: slip-rate decreases linearly until the layer halts at a fluid pressure level below that required to initiate failure. During this pressure cycle the system exhibits (1) velocity-strengthening friction and (2) frictional hysteresis. These behaviors, well established in dry granular media, are shown to extend here to shear of dense fluid-saturated granular layers. Additionally, we observe a delay between fluid pressure increase and failure, associated with pre-failure dilative strain and "dilational-hardening". During the delay period, small, arrested slip events dilate the layer in preparation for full-scale failure. Our findings may explain (i) fault motion that continues even after fluid pressure returns to pre-injection levels, and (ii) delayed failure in fluid-injection experiments, and (iii) pre-failure arrested slip events observed prior to earthquakes.</description>

      <title>From lab to landscape-scale experiments for the morphodynamics of sand dunes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the main processes that drive the morphodynamics of dunes, i.e. their growth in height, migration and elongation, and emphasise the contribution of experiments to the understanding of these mechanisms. The main control parameters are the sediment flux $Q$ and the saturation length $L_{\rm sat}$ associated with the spatial relaxation of the flux towards the transport capacity. The other relevant quantities are essentially dimensionless: fluid response to a bed perturbation, dune geometry (orientation, aspect ratio), transport ratios under multi-directional wind regimes. We argue that laboratory experiments dealing with sedimentary bedforms in water flows are good analogues to study the morphodynamics of aeolian dunes at reduced length and time scales, as $L_{\rm sat}$ and $L_{\rm sat}^2/Q$ are expected to be smaller for subaqueous bedload. Besides, dune shape and dynamics are mainly governed by flow and boundary conditions, independent of the transport mode. We discuss different experimental set-ups and results, especially concerning dune pattern orientation and dune interaction. Under natural wind regimes in terrestrial deserts, we show the potential of field experiments in which the control of initial and boundary conditions allows for the quantification of all the relevant mechanisms involved in dune growth. We emphasise the general agreement between observations, measurements and theoretical predictions, which indicates a robust comprehension of the underlying processes. This understanding can serve as a foundation for further investigations, including the interpretation of dune landscapes and the resolution of inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Peculiarities of hydraulic fracture propagation in media with heterogeneous toughness: the energy balance, elastic battery and fluid backflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates hydraulic fracture in a media with periodic heterogeneous toughness. Results for the plane-strain (KGD) model are analysed. The energy distribution as the fracture propagates is examined, along with the evolution of the crack geometry. It is shown that the solid layer acts as an elastic battery, discharging to promote rapid propagation through weaker material layers. The limiting behaviour as length $L\to\infty$ is discussed. The velocity of the fluid throughout the crack length is also considered. For fractures in high-toughness material it is shown that fluid backflow can occur, with its profile dependent on the toughness distribution. The implications of these findings are discussed.</description>
