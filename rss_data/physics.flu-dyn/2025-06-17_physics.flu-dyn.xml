      <title>The Three-Dimensional Velocity Field of Kinesin-Driven Microtubules in Torroidal Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two regimes of flow in multiple three-dimensional toroidal channels by tracking the fluorescent spherical particles in the kinesin-driven microtubule systems: ``chaotic'' flow and ``coherent'' flow. In the smallest aspect ratio torus, where the channel height $h$ is a quarter of the width $w$, the active system shows zero mean velocity, small-scale isotropy in fluctuation and no persistent flow structure. In other tori with higher aspect ratios $h/w$ close to 1, we find faster coherent flows along the azimuthal direction and increasing fluctuation strengths with growing confinement geometries. Regardless of flow regimes, the flow profiles at $r-z$ cross-section and $r-\theta$ plane are symmetric. The ``coherent'' profiles show two criteria: ``Poiseuille-like'' profiles, which have the peak velocities near the centers of channels; a ``peak-separated'' profile, which has four peak velocities near a certain distance to four confining surfaces. These flow profiles, after scaled by the local isotropic fluctuation strength, reveal universal three-dimensional flow structures among the ``Poiseuille-like'' criterion and the same level of scaled peak velocity at the ``peak-separated'' one. These results illustrate scalable flow structures in this kinesin-driven microtubule active system.</description>

      <title>Fluid-induced snap-through instability of spherical shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the flutter of aircraft wings to an umbrella flipping inside out in the wind, fluid-induced elastic instabilities are a major concern in aeroelastic design. However, Nature often harnesses these instabilities to achieve new functionalities, such as the mechanical snap-through of the Venus flytrap. Inspired by this, engineers and physicists have increasingly exploited elastic instabilities to enable rapid shape changes in metamaterials and soft robots, provided the structure remains elastic throughout the transition. Here, we study the fluid-induced snapping instability of a spherical elastic shell at low Reynolds numbers, the umbrella flipping problem when life is at low Reynolds numbers. We combine precision desktop-scale experiments, fluid-structure simulations, shell theory, fluid mechanics, and scaling analysis to determine the instability threshold as a function of the geometrical and material parameters of the system. Building on these findings, we devise a snapping-based valve that passively and abruptly alters the hydraulic resistance of a channel, offering robust flow control without active components. These valves could be deployed in soft robotics and, because our results are expressed in terms of key dimensionless parameters, we speculate that the system can be miniaturized for use in microfluidic circuits. Beyond the application, our study presents what we believe to be a prototypical example of fluid-induced elastic instability at low Reynolds numbers, providing a foundation for future explorations in soft hydraulics and flow-responsive structures.</description>

      <title>Viscoplastic flows in narrow channels: Herschel-Bulkley models versus its regularizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the two-dimensional flows of a viscoplastic fluid in symmetric channels with impermeable walls under no-slip boundary conditions. As response functions for the Cauchy stress tensor of the viscoplastic fluid, we considered both the celebrated Herschel-Bulkley model and a very general class $\mathcal{C}$ of its regularizations that depend on a positive parameter with the same physical dimensions as the strain rate and known as the \emph{regularization parameter}. Within this class of regularized Herschel-Bulkley models, the response function for the viscosity of the viscoplastic fluid tends to the non-smooth Herschel-Bulkley viscosity function as the regularization parameter tends to zero. To make the equations governing the flow amenable to analysis, we considered channels with small aspect ratio so that the lubrication approximation can be used. In this way, we were able to obtain analytical solutions, perform an asymptotic analysis of the regularized solutions, and compare the results predicted by the Herschel-Bulkley model and its regularizations. We found that for any given channel, the regularized flows predicted by the regularizations in $\mathcal{C}$ tend to the same velocity field in the limit as the regularization parameter tends to zero. Such an asymptotic flow coincides with that predicted by the Herschel-Bulkley model only if the viscoplastic fluid flows in plane channels. Instead, in channels with curved walls, the results are markedly different.</description>

      <title>A fluctuating lattice Boltzmann method for viscoelastic fluid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel fluctuating lattice Boltzmann (LB) method for simulating viscoelastic fluid flows governed by the Oldroyd-B model. In contrast to conventional LB approaches that explicitly compute the divergence of the polymer stress tensor using finite-difference schemes, the proposed method incorporates the polymer stress implicitly by introducing a polymer stress fluctuation term directly into the evolution equation. This treatment avoids the need for stress-gradient computations, and preserves the physical characteristics of viscoelastic fluid flows. The proposed method is validated against four classical benchmark problems: the simplified four-roll mill, planar Poiseuille flow, unsteady Womersley flow, and the three-dimensional Taylor-Green vortex. The numerical results show excellent agreement with analytical solutions and previous numerical results, confirming the method's reliability in viscoelastic fluid dynamics. Moreover, performance evaluations demonstrate that the present model reduces the memory occupancy and enhances computational efficiency, highlighting its potential for large-scale simulations of complex viscoelastic flows systems.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional velocity gradient statistics in a mesoscale convection laboratory experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present three-dimensional velocity gradient statistics from Rayleigh--B\'enard convection experiments in a horizontally extended cell of aspect ratio 25, a paradigm for mesoscale convection. The Rayleigh number $Ra$ ranges from $3.7 \times 10^5$ to $4.8 \times 10^6$, and the Prandtl number $Pr$ from 5 to 7.1. Spatio-temporally resolved volumetric data are reconstructed from moderately dense Lagrangian particle tracking measurements. All nine components of the velocity gradient tensor from the experiments show good agreement with those from direct numerical simulations, both conducted at $Ra = 1 \times 10^6$ and $Pr = 6.6$. The focus of our analysis is on non-Gaussian velocity gradient statistics. Specifically, we examine the probability density functions (PDFs) of components of the velocity gradient tensor, vorticity components, kinetic energy dissipation, and local enstrophy at different heights in the bottom half of the cell. The probability of high-amplitude derivatives increases from the bulk to the bottom plate. A similar trend is observed with increasing $Ra$ at fixed height. Both indicate enhanced small-scale intermittency of the velocity field. Furthermore, doubly-logarithmic plots of the PDFs of normalized energy dissipation and local enstrophy at all heights show that the left tails follow slopes of $3/2$ and $1/2$, respectively, in agreement with numerical results. In general, the left tails of the dissipation and local enstrophy distributions show higher probability values with increasing proximity towards the plate, compared to those in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Vortex Clusters on a Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.</description>

      <title>An advanced heat transfer model for Eulerian-Lagrangian simulations of industrial gas-solid flow systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrete element method (DEM) coupled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD), has been developed to simulate complex solid-fluid flow systems. Today, DEM is regarded as an established approach, with extensive applications in industrial systems. Heat transfer modeling might be essential to the DEM as the industrial applications. However, existing DEM heat transfer models have fundamental limitations. These issues arise from the soft spring model inherent in DEM, where heat conduction is mathematically influenced by the spring constant. Consequently, complex modeling, considering contact state such as contact area and duration, is typically required to estimate heat conduction accurately. Moreover, the current heat transfer models exhibit poor compatibility with scaling laws, such as the coarse-grained DEM, leading to amplified temperature errors relative to motion errors. To address these challenges, we develop a novel heat transfer model based on an Eulerian framework within DEM simulations. In our approach, the Eulerian description is applied to the heat transfer calculation, while particle motion remains treated by the DEM. Notably, the heat conduction in the solid phase is captured through a simple setup by specifying the void fraction, rather than relying on complex contact modeling. The adequacy of the proposed model is demonstrated through validation tests in gas-solid flow systems, showing that the temperature distribution is independent of the particle contact state. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong compatibility with coarse-grained DEM, maintaining accuracy even at reduced computational costs. These results establish the new model's reliability and universality, positioning it as a promising standard for DEM-CFD simulations in industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Scaling in two-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An equation for the evolution of mean kinetic energy, $ E $, in a 2-D or 3-D Rayleigh-B\'enard system with domain height $ L $ is derived. Assuming classical Nusselt number scaling, $ Nu \sim Ra^{1/3} $, and that mean enstrophy, in the absence of a downscale energy cascade, scales as $\sim E/L^2 $, we find that the Reynolds number scales as $ Re \sim Pr^{-1}Ra^{2/3} $ in the 2-D system, where $ Ra $ is the Rayleigh number and $ Pr $ the Prandtl number, which is a much stronger scaling than in the 3-D system. Using the evolution equation and the Reynolds number scaling, it is shown that $ \tilde{\tau} &gt; c Pr^{-1/2}Ra^{1/2} $, where $ \tilde{\tau} $ is the non-dimensional convergence time scale and $ c $ is a non-dimensional constant. For the 3-D system, we make the estimate $ \tilde{\tau} \gtrsim Ra^{1/6} $ for $ Pr = 1 $. It is estimated that the total computational cost of reaching the high $ Ra $ limit in a simulation is comparable between 2-D and 3-D. The results of the analysis are compared to DNS data and it is concluded that the theory of the `ultimate state' is not valid in 2-D. Despite the big difference between the 2-D and 3-D systems in the scaling of $ Re $ and $ \tilde{\tau} $, the Nusselt number scaling is similar. This observation supports the hypothesis of Malkus (1954) that the heat transfer is not regulated by the dynamics in the interior of the convection cell, but by the dynamics in the boundary layers.</description>

      <title>Steady two-phase stratified MHD flows in wide rectangular ducts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the effects of a non-conductive gas layer flowing concurrently with a conductive liquid on the two-phase flow characteristics in wide horizontal ducts under a constant vertical magnetic field. To this end, we present analytical solutions for the velocity profile and induced magnetic field in laminar gas-liquid stratified magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow between two infinite plates. The contributions of the Lorentz force and wall shear stresses to the pressure gradient are examined. It is shown that, unlike single-phase flow of a conductive fluid, the velocity profiles in two-phase flow differ depending on whether the bottom wall is conducting or insulating. In the case of an insulating bottom wall, the gas lubrication effect and potential pumping power savings are significantly greater, regardless of the magnetic Reynolds number. This conclusion also holds for gas-liquid MHD flows in ducts with finite width-to-height aspect ratios. To investigate the impact of side walls on the two-phase flow characteristics in wide ducts, numerical solutions of the two-dimensional problem were obtained for various combinations of bottom and side wall conductivities. In all cases, the results for high aspect ratios converge to those predicted by the Two-Plate (TP) model with the same bottom wall conductivity. However, the influence of insulating side walls remains significant even at large aspect ratios when the bottom wall is conducting. Unexpectedly, in such cases, the change in the induced magnetic field due to the presence of side walls has a dramatic effect on the velocity profile, leading to a reduced pressure gradient compared to that predicted by the TP model.</description>

      <title>Dual guidance: ROM-informed field reconstruction with generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dual-guided framework for reconstructing unsteady incompressible flow fields using sparse observations. The approach combines optimized sensor placement with a physics-informed guided generative model. Sensor locations are selected using mutual information theory applied to a reduced-order model of the flow, enabling efficient identification of high-information observation points with minimal computational cost. These sensors, once selected, provide targeted observations that guide a denoising diffusion probabilistic model conditioned by physical constraints. Extensive experiments on 2D laminar cylinder wake flows demonstrate that under sparse sensing conditions, the structured sensor layouts fail to capture key flow dynamics, yielding high reconstruction errors. In contrast, our optimized sensor placement strategy achieves accurate reconstructions with L2 errors as low as 0.05, even with a limited number of sensors, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach in data-limited regimes. When the number of sensors is higher than a threshold, however, both methods perform comparably. Our dual-guided approach bridges reduced order model-based sensor position optimization with modern generative modeling, providing accurate, physics-consistent reconstruction from sparse data for scientific machine-learning problems.</description>

      <title>Chaos, coherence and turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a personal overview of the efforts over the last half century to understand fluid turbulence in terms of simpler coherent units. The consequences of chaos and the concept of coherence are first reviewed, using examples from free-shear and wall-bounded shear flows, and including how the simplifications due to coherent structures have been useful in the conceptualization and control of turbulence. It is remarked that, even if this approach has revolutionized our understanding of the flow, most of turbulence cannot yet be described by structures. This includes cascades, both direct and inverse, and possibly junk turbulence, whose role, if any, is currently unknown. This part of the paper is mostly a catalog of questions, some of them answered and others still open. A second part of the paper examines which new techniques can be expected to help in attacking the open questions, and which, in the opinion of the author, are the strengths and limitations of current approaches, such as data-driven science and causal inference.</description>

      <title>Near Wake Dynamics of a Cross-Flow Turbine Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-flow turbines, also known as vertical-axis turbines, convert the kinetic energy in moving fluid to mechanical energy using blades that rotate about an axis perpendicular to the incoming flow. In these experiments, the performance and wake of a two-turbine array in a fence configuration (side-by-side) was characterized. The turbines were operated under coordinated control, a strategy characterized by synchronous rotation rates with a mean phase difference. Measurements were made with turbines co-rotating, counter-rotating with the blades advancing upstream at the array midline, and counter-rotating with the blades retreating downstream at the array midline. From the performance data, we find individual turbine and array efficiency depend significantly on rotation direction and phase difference. Variations are also observed in the wake flow field and, using these data, we hypothesize how rotation direction and phase influence interactions between adjacent turbines.</description>

      <title>Clustering and emergent hyperuniformity by breaking microswimmer shape and actuation symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic interactions driven by particle activity are ubiquitous in active colloidal systems. Although these interactions are strongly influenced by the interfacial actuation mechanism and geometry of the swimming particles, theoretical understanding of how these microscopic design parameters govern collective dynamics remains limited. Here, we investigate the collective dynamics of oblate spheroidal microswimmers. Using an approximate kinetic theory and corroborating boundary element method calculations, we demonstrate that breaking symmetries in both particle shape and interfacial actuation enables the emergence of dynamically stable immotile n-particle clusters. At larger scales, the clustering process drives the system into a dynamically arrested absorbing state characterized by disordered class I hyperuniform structures. Our analysis highlights the essential role of cluster-sourced long-range flows in establishing this long-range order. Overall, our findings reveal a robust, purely hydrodynamic mechanism for hierarchical self-organization in active matter systems, providing a novel strategy for engineering multifunctional hyperuniform materials.</description>

Abstract: We investigate details of the interaction of subaqueous barchans with dune-size obstacles by carrying out numerical simulations where the fluid is solved at the grain scale and the motions of individual grains are computed at all time steps. With the outputs, we analyze the disturbances of the fluid flow, the trajectories of grains, and the resultant force on each grain, the latter being unfeasible from experiments and field measurements. We show that in some cases particles pass over the obstacle, while in others they completely circumvent it (without touching it), or are even blocked. For the circumvention and blocking cases, which we call bypass and trapped, respectively, we show the existence of a strong vortex between the lee face of the dune and the obstacle. This vortex results from the interactions of recirculation regions and horseshoe vortices, and has enough strength to deviate the main flow and carry grains around the obstacle in those cases. Our results shed light on the reasons for passing over, circumventing, and blocking, and contribute to our understanding of dunes in the presence of large obstacles such as hills, crater rims, and human constructions.</description>

      <title>Adaptive criterion and modification of wave-particle decomposition in UGKWP method for high-speed flow simulation</title>

Abstract: Benefitting from the direct modeling of physical laws in a discretized space and the automatic decomposition of hydrodynamic waves and particles, the unified gas-kinetic wave-particle (UGKWP) method offers notable advantages in various multiscale physics, such as hypersonic flow, plasma transport and radiation transport. Aiming at achieving a more suitable and efficient wave-particle decomposition in high-speed flow simulation and enhancing the performance in the drastic scale variation region, in this work, the scale adaptive criterion is studied and the flux evolution of UGKWP method is modified. Specifically, besides the perspective of time which is naturally considered in the time-dependent distribution function of UGKWP method, two more criteria from views of space and gradient are utilized to identify the local scale, and to reduce the computational consumption of particles on describing the near-equilibrium microscopic gas distribution function. Moreover, corresponding to the coefficients in the time integration flux of unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS), the evolution of hydrodynamic wave is modified to be more consistent with particles, which is essential when the scale changes intensely in different cells. A variety of test cases are conducted to validate the performance of the adaptive UGKWP method, including hypersonic flows around a cylinder at multiple inflow Knudsen numbers, hypersonic flow over a slender cavity, side-jet impingement on hypersonic flow and three-dimensional hypersonic flows over a $70^{\circ}$ blunted cone with a cylindrical sting.</description>

      <title>Aerodynamic roughness of rippled beds under active saltation at Earth-to-Mars atmospheric pressures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As winds blow over sand, grains are mobilized and reorganized into bedforms such as ripples and dunes. In turn, sand transport and bedforms affect the winds themselves. These complex interactions between winds and sediment render modeling of windswept landscapes challenging. A critical parameter in such models is the aerodynamic roughness length, $z_0$, defined as the height above the bed at which wind velocity predicted from the log law drops to zero. In aeolian environments, $z_0$ can variably be controlled by the laminar viscous sublayer, grain roughness, form drag from bedforms, or the saltation layer. Estimates of $z_0$ are used on Mars, notably, to predict wind speeds, sand fluxes, and global circulation patterns; yet, no robust measurements of $z_0$ have been performed over rippled sand on Mars to date. Here, we measure $z_0$ over equilibrated rippled sand beds with active saltation under atmospheric pressures intermediate between those of Earth and Mars. Extrapolated to Mars, our results suggest that $z_0$ over rippled beds and under active saltation may be dominated by form drag across a plausible range of wind velocities, reaching values up to 1 cm -- two orders of magnitude larger than typically assumed for flat beds under similar sediment transport conditions.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Priors with Application to Boundary Layer Velocity</title>

Abstract: One of the most popular recent areas of machine learning predicates the use of neural networks augmented by information about the underlying process in the form of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). These physics-informed neural networks are obtained by penalizing the inference with a PDE, and have been cast as a minimization problem currently lacking a formal approach to quantify the uncertainty. In this work, we propose a novel model-based framework which regards the PDE as a prior information of a deep Bayesian neural network. The prior is calibrated without data to resemble the PDE solution in the prior mean, while our degree in confidence on the PDE with respect to the data is expressed in terms of the prior variance. The information embedded in the PDE is then propagated to the posterior yielding physics-informed forecasts with uncertainty quantification. We apply our approach to a simulated viscous fluid and to experimentally-obtained turbulent boundary layer velocity in a water tunnel using an appropriately simplified Navier-Stokes equation. Our approach requires very few observations to produce physically-consistent forecasts as opposed to non-physical forecasts stemming from non-informed priors, thereby allowing forecasting complex systems where some amount of data as well as some contextual knowledge is available.</description>

      <title>Effects of scalar correlation and evaporation-induced enthalpy reduction in LES-FGM simulations of ethanol spray flames</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the objective of carbon neutrality, accurate simulation of ethanol spray combustion is imperative for advanced engine design. In spray flames, the droplet evaporation not only reduces the ambient gas-phase temperature, but also influences flame dynamics by generating substantial local fluctuations of the mixture fraction $\widetilde{Z}$ and progress variable $\widetilde{c}$. These two scalars, conventionally assumed independent in flamelet models, exhibit significant correlations arising from the coupling among evaporation, turbulent mixing and chemical reactions. This study proposes a six-dimensional flamelet-generated manifolds (FGM) method, considering the evaporation-induced specific enthalpy reduction and scalar correlation. A novel joint presumed probability density function (PDF) method is derived using the copula theory, achieving rapid grid convergence and good feasibility. Large-eddy simulation (LES) is performed on the Sydney ethanol turbulent spray flames (EtF1, EtF4 and EtF7), which feature different ethanol mass flow rates and jet Reynolds numbers. Both gas and liquid phase statistics show good agreement with experimental data across the three flames. The incorporation of specific enthalpy reduction and scalar correlation in FGM modeling improves gas temperature predictions, along with enhanced liquid-phase prediction through refined gas-field resolution. The correlation coefficient of $\widetilde{Z}$ and $\widetilde{c}$ is found to be a competing result of local evaporation and combustion, since evaporation elevates mixture fraction and dilutes reaction progress variable, whereas chemical reactions enhance progress variable fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Interaction of water surface waves with periodic and quasiperiodic cylinder arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by transformation optics and photonic crystals, this paper presents a computational investigation into the interaction between water surface waves and array waveguides of cylinders with multiple previously unexplored lattice geometries, including, for the first time, quasiperiodic geometries. Extending beyond conventional square and hexagonal periodic arrays, transformation optics has opened up entirely new opportunities to investigate water wave propagation through arrays based on quasiperiodic lattices, and quasiperiodically arranged vacancy defects. Using the linear potential flow open-source code Capytaine, missing element and $\tau$-scaled Fibonacci square lattices, the Penrose lattice, hexagonal $H_{00}$ lattice and Amman-Beenker lattice are investigated. The existence of band gaps for all arrays is observed. An hexagonal lattice with vacancy defects transmits the least energy. Bragg diffraction consistent with rotational symmetry is observed from all arrays. Waves will distort significantly to achieve resonance with arrays, supporting transformation-based waveguides. The possible uses include adaptation to more versatile waveguides with applications such as offshore renewable energy and coastal defence.</description>

      <title>Computation and stability analysis of periodic orbits using finite differences, Fourier or Chebyshev spectral expansions in time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse and compare several algorithms to compute numerically periodic solutions of high-dimensional dynamical systems and investigate their Floquet stability without building the monodromy matrix. The solution and its perturbation are discretised in time either using finite differences, Fourier-Galerkin or Chebyshev expansions. The resulting nonlinear set of equations describing the periodic orbit is solved using a Newton-Raphson algorithm. The linearised equations determining the stability lead to a generalised eigenvalue problem. Unlike the Fourier-Galerkin method, the use of Chebyshev polynomials or finite differences has the advantage that the relevant Floquet exponents are directly given without the well known issue of having to sort out the eigenvalues. The speed of convergence of these three methods is illustrated with examples from the Lorenz system, the Langford system and a two-dimensional thermal convection flow inside a differentially heated cavity. This last example demonstrates the potential of the newly proposed Chebyshev expansion for large-scale problems arising from the discretisation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Continuous generation of confined bubbles: viscous effect on the gravito-capillary pinch off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate continuous generation of bubbles from a bath of air in viscous liquid in a confined geometry. In our original setup, bubbles are spontaneously generated by virtue of buoyancy and a gate placed in the cell: the gate acts like an inverted funnel trapping air beneath it before continuously generating bubbles at the tip. The dynamics is characterized by the bubble-formation period and the bubble size as a function of the amount of air under the gate. By analyzing the data obtained for various parameters, we clearly identified that the dynamics of the bubble formation is governed by dissipation in the viscous fluid beneath the trapped air balanced by a gravitational energy change due to buoyancy, after examining numerous possibilities of dissipation, which demonstrates the potential of scaling analysis even in complex cases. Furthermore, we uncover a novel type of pinch-off condition, which convincingly explains the bubble size: in the present case viscosity plays a vital role, different from the conventional mechanism of Tate, in which gravity competes with capillarity, revealing a general mechanism of pinching-off at low Reynolds number. Accordingly, the present study significantly and fundamentally advances our knowledge of generation and pinch-off of bubbles, with the results relevant for a wide variety of applications in many fields. In particular, the present study demonstrates a promising avenue in microfluidics for understanding physical principles by scaling up the system, without losing the characteristics of the flow at low Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>Deformation and breakup of a ferrofluid compound droplet migrating in a microchannel under a magnetic field: A phase-field-based multiple-relaxation time lattice Boltzmann study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11129v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Though ubiquitous in many engineering applications, including drug delivery, the compound droplet hydrodynamics in confined geometries have been barely surveyed. For the first time, this study thoroughly investigates the hydrodynamics of a ferrofluid compound droplet (FCD) during its migration in a microchannel under the presence of a pressure-driven flow and a uniform external magnetic field (UEMF) to manipulate its morphology and retard its breakup. Finite difference and phase-field multiple-relaxation time lattice Boltzmann approaches are coupled to determine the magnetic field and ternary flow system, respectively. Firstly, the influence of the magnetic Bond number (Bo) on the FCD morphology is explored depending on whether the core or shell is ferrofluid when the UEMF is applied along {\alpha}=0{\deg} and {\alpha}=90{\deg} relative to the fluid flow. It is ascertained that imposing the UEMF at {\alpha}=0{\deg} when the shell is ferrofluid can postpone the breakup. Intriguingly, when the core is ferrofluid, strengthening the UEMF enlarges the shell deformation. Afterward, the effects of the Capillary number (Ca), density ratio, viscosity ratio, radius ratio, and surface tension coefficients are scrutinized on the FCD deformation and breakup. The results indicate that augmenting the core-to-shell viscosity and density ratios accelerates the breakup process. Additionally, surface tension between the core and shell suppresses the core deformation. Moreover, increasing the Ca number intensifies the viscous drag force exerted on the shell, flattening its rear side, which causes a triangular-like configuration. Ultimately, by varying Bo and Ca numbers, five distinguished regimes are observed, whose regime map is established.</description>

      <title>Performance characteristics and bluff-body modeling of high-blockage cross-flow turbine arrays with varying rotor geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While confinement is understood to increase the power and thrust coefficients of cross-flow turbines, how the optimal rotor geometry changes with the blockage ratio -- defined as the ratio between the array projected area and the channel cross-sectional area -- has not been systematically explored. Here, the interplay between rotor geometry and the blockage ratio on turbine performance is investigated experimentally with an array of two identical cross-flow turbines at blockage ratios from 35% to 55%. Three geometric parameters are varied -- the number of blades, the chord-to-radius ratio, and the preset pitch angle -- resulting in 180 unique combinations of rotor geometry and blockage ratio. While the optimal chord-to-radius ratio and preset pitch angle do not depend on the blockage ratio, the optimal blade count increases with the blockage ratio -- an inversion of the relationship between efficiency and blade count typically observed at lower blockage. To explore the combined effects of rotor geometry, rotation rate, and the blockage ratio on array performance, we utilize two bluff-body models: dynamic solidity (which relates thrust to the rotor geometry and kinematics) and Maskell-inspired linear momentum theory (which describes the array-channel interaction as a function of the blockage ratio and thrust). By combining these models, we demonstrate that the array time-average thrust coefficient increases with dynamic solidity in a manner that is self-similar across blockage ratios. Overall, these results highlight key design principles for cross-flow turbines in confined flow and provide insights into the similarities between the dynamics of cross-flow turbines and bluff bodies at high blockage.</description>

      <title>From annular cavity to rotor-stator flow: nonlinear dynamics of axisymmetric rolls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatio-temporally complex flows are found at the onset of unsteadiness in (axisymmetric) rotor-stator turbulence in the shape of concentric rolls. The emergence of these rolls is rationalised using a homotopy approach, where the original flow configuration is continuously deformed into a simpler, better understood configuration. We deform here rotor-stator flow into an annular flow, thereby controlling curvature effects, and we investigate numerically the transition scenarios as functions of the Reynolds number. Increasing curvature starting from the planar limit reveals a clear path towards a subcritical scenario as a function of the Reynolds number. As the rotor-stator configuration is approached, supercritical branches shift to increasing Reynolds number while a subcritical branch of chaotic states takes over. Modal selection in the supercritical scenario involves the competition between two modal families. It rests on a specific radial localisation property of all eigenmodes, linked to the space-dependent convective radial velocity which intensifies as curvature is increased. A new nonlinear mechanism for the pairing of rolls is proposed based on multiple resonances. The critical point where the original rotor-stator flow loses its stability to axisymmetric perturbations is identified for the first time for the geometry under study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate gas transfer processes occurring at the air-water interface of progressive water waves using high-fidelity numerical simulations. Waves with varying initial steepness, including regular wave patterns, mild spilling and intense plunging breakers are examined. A two-phase solver is employed to model exchange processes enabling precise estimation of the air-water interface area and gas transfer velocity, achieving an accuracy unattainable in experiments. We show that the volume of gas transferred across the air-water interface increases significantly with the amount of air entrained due to wave breaking, peak values in the transfer velocity being concurrent with peaks in energy dissipation rate and air entrainment. The gas transfer velocity is observed to scale approximately as the one-fourth power of the energy dissipation rate, consistent with previous theoretical predictions. The present findings can help reduce the substantial uncertainty associated with the parametrization of fundamental natural processes, such as CO2 absorption by the oceans.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20204v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the possibility of energy transfer and budget analysis for transient flow using eigenmodes of the operator from the Navier-Stokes equation. We derive the energy transfer equation, which provides the energy budget for the eigenmodes, through the Galerkin projection of the equation using the bi-orthogonality of the eigenmodes and the adjoint mode. Energy budget and transfer analysis between modes were conducted for two-dimensional flow around a cylinder with eigenmodes growing or decaying from a steady flow. Using the linearized energy transfer equation and eigenmodes from global stability analysis, we identify the energy budget and spatial distribution that determine growth rates of the modes. Moreover, energy budget and transfer analysis are realized by considering the time evolution of the eigenmodes, even during the nonlinear development of the eigenmodes. By introducing time-varying dynamic mode decomposition with a phase-control strategy for multiple time-series datasets from numerical simulations of the phase-controlled initial flow, time-varying eigenmodes are extracted in the transient two-dimensional cylinder flow. With the extracted time-dependent modes and the derived energy transfer equations, the time evolution of the energy budget and spatial distribution of energy transfer can be computed until the eigenmodes developed from the steady field reach the post-transient periodic flow. The temporal evolution of the energy budget and transfer distribution reveals that transient growth processes display different time-dependent characteristics of energy transfer, even in cylinder flows at Reynolds numbers that eventually lead to a periodic state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03006v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Formation of a fluid drop, such as observed in dripping faucet, has been extensively studied for understanding singular dynamics widely observed in nature. The singular dynamics is often self-similar, i.e., the shape at different times are collapsed onto a master curve after rescaling. Here, we investigate the bubble breakup in an original setup, where a metal disk entrains air into viscous fluid with lubricating films on its surfaces in a confined cell, focusing on the dependence of the dynamics on the film thickness e. As a result, we find out the dynamics is self-similar as expected, but the shape of the master curve and the scaling exponents characterizing the self-similar dynamics are revealed to be sensitively dependent on e. We discuss analogy between the present study and critical phenomena in thermodynamic transitions, to suggest a promising future direction of the singular dynamics.</description>

Abstract: A body immersed in a nematic liquid crystal disturbs the fluid's preferred molecular configuration and increases its stored elastic energy. In an active nematic, the fluid components also generate a stress in the bulk fluid. By introducing either an immersed body or boundary, a large scale flow can be triggered due to anchoring boundary conditions alone -- a global pressure built by active stresses at equilibrium is instantly released everywhere. The fluid then imposes viscous, elastic, and active stresses on such surfaces which, if compliant, may result in a surface deformation. We study the deformations and stresses of a linearly elastic body placed in an active nematic in two dimensions. Using complex variables techniques, exact expressions for the fluid flow, director field, surface tractions, and body deformation are derived. Qualitative differences between elastic and active stress-driven deformations are identified, depending on an active Ericksen number, anchoring conditions, and body material properties, thereby suggesting a new method for measuring mechanical stresses in active anisotropic environments. Flow profiles, external confinement, and anchoring-induced stirring are also addressed.</description>
