      <title>Boosting Ensembles for Statistics of Tails at Conditionally Optimal Advance Split Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate science needs more efficient ways to study high-impact, low-probability extreme events, which are rare by definition and costly to simulate in large numbers. Rare event sampling (RES) and ensemble boosting offer a novel strategy to extract more information from those occasional simulated events: small perturbations in advance can turn a moderate event into a severe one, which otherwise might not come for many more simulation-years. But how to choose this ``advance split time'' (AST) remains a challenge for sudden, transient events like precipitation. In this work, we formulate a concrete optimization problem for the AST and instantiate it on an idealized but physically informative model system: a quasigeostrophic turbulent channel flow advecting a passive tracer, which captures key elements of midlatitude storm track dynamics. Three major questions guide our investigation: (1) Can RES methods, in particular \emph{ensemble boosting} and \emph{trying-early adaptive multilevel splitting}, accurately sample extreme events of return periods longer than the simulation time? (2) What is the optimal AST, and how does it depend on the definition of the extreme event, in particular the target location? (3) Can the AST be optimized ``online'' while running RES?
  Our answers are tentatively positive. (1) RES can meaningfully improve tail estimation, using (2) an optimal AST of 1-3 eddy turnover timescales, which varies weakly but detectably with target location. (3) A certain functional that we call the \emph{thresholded entropy} successfully picks out near-optimal ASTs, eliminating the need for arbitrary thresholds that have thus far hindered RES methods. Our work clarifies aspects of the optimization landscape and can, in our view, guide future research efforts on optimizing and sampling transient extreme events more efficiently in general chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Reduced Cloud Cover Errors in a Hybrid AI-Climate Model Through Equation Discovery And Automatic Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cloud-related parameterizations remain a leading source of uncertainty in climate projections. Although machine learning holds promise for Earth system models (ESMs), many data-driven parameterizations lack interpretability, physical consistency, and smooth integration into ESMs. Here, a two-step method is presented to improve a climate model with data-driven parameterizations. First, we incorporate a physically consistent cloud cover parameterization -- derived from storm-resolving simulations via symbolic regression, preserving interpretability while enhancing accuracy -- into the ICON global atmospheric model. Second, we apply the gradient-free Nelder-Mead optimizer to automatically recalibrate the hybrid model against Earth observations, tuning in nested stages (2-, 7-, 30- and 365-day runs) to ensure stability and tractability. The tuned hybrid model substantially reduces long-standing biases in cloud cover -- particularly over the Southern Ocean (by 75\%) and subtropical stratocumulus regions (by 37\%) -- and remains robust under +4K surface warming. These results demonstrate that interpretable machine-learned parameterizations, paired with practical tuning, can efficiently and transparently strengthen ESM fidelity.</description>
