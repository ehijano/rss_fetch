      <title>Separated and prime compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss conditions under which certain compactifications of topological spaces can be obtained by composing the ultrafilter space monad with suitable reflectors. In particular, we show that these compactifications inherit their categorical properties from the ultrafilter space monad. We further observe that various constructions such as the prime open filter monad defined by H. Simmons, the prime closed filter compactification studied by Bentley and Herrlich, as well as the separated completion monad studied by Salbany fall within the same categorical framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a survey of recent and classical results concerning various types of homogeneity, such as n-homogeneity, discrete homogeneity, and countable dense homogeneity. Some new results are also presented, and several problems are posed.</description>

      <title>A Topological Reimagining of Integration and Exterior Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel, highly general construction of integration, function calculus, and exterior calculus was achieved in this paper, allowing for integration of unital magma valued functions against (compactified) unital magma valued measures over arbitrary topological spaces. The Riemann integral, geometric product integral, and Lebesgue integral were all shown as special cases. Notions similar to chain complexes were developed to allow this general form of integration to define notions of exterior derivative for differential forms, and of derivatives of functions too. Fundamental realizations, some quite surprising, were achieved on the deepest natures of key concepts of analysis including integration, orientation, differentiation, and more. It's clear that further applications such as calculus on fractals, stochastic calculus, discrete calculus, and many other novel forms of analysis can all be achieved as special cases of this theory.</description>

      <title>Velichko's notions close to sequentially separability and their hereditary variants in $C_p$-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A space $X$ is sequentially separable if there is a countable $S\subset X$ such that every point of $X$ is the limit of a sequence of points from $S$. In 2004, N.V. Velichko defined and investigated concepts close to sequentially separability: $\sigma$-separability and $F$-separability. The aim of this paper is to study $\sigma$-separability and $F$-separability (and their hereditary variants) of the space $C_p(X)$ of all real-valued continuous functions, defined on a Tychonoff space $X$, endowed with the pointwise convergence topology. In particular, we proved that $\sigma$-separability coincides with sequential separability. Hereditary variants (hereditarily $\sigma$-separablity and hereditarily $F$-separablity) coincides with Frechet-Urysohn property in the class of cosmic spaces.</description>

      <title>Invertibility in nonassociative ordered rings and in weak-quasi-topological nonassociative rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Invertibility is important in ring theory because it enables division and facilitates solving equations. Moreover, rings can be endowed with extra "structure" such as order and topology allowing us to write more complex statements. The two main theorems of this article are contributions to invertibility in the context of ordered and weak-quasi-topological rings. Specifically, the first theorem asserts that the interval $]0,1]$ in any suitable partially ordered ring consists entirely of invertible elements. The second theorem asserts that if $f$ is a norm from a ring to a partially ordered ring endowed with interval topology, then under certain conditions, the subset of elements such that $f(1-a) &lt; 1$ consists entirely of invertible elements. The second theorem relies on the assumption of sequential Cauchy completeness of the topology induced by the norm $f$, which as we recall, takes values in an ordered ring endowed with the interval topology (an example of a coarse topology). The fact that a ring endowed with the topology associated with a seminorm into an ordered ring endowed with the interval topology is a locally convex quasi-topological group with an additional continuity property of the product is dealt with in a separate section. A brief application to frame theory is also included.</description>

      <title>An isometric extensor of metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, for metrizable space $Z$, we consider the space of metrics that generate the same topology on $Z$, and that space of metrics is equipped with the supremum metrics. For a metrizable space $X$ and a closed subset $A$ of it, we construct a map $E$ from the space of metrics on $A$ into the space of metrics on $X$ such that $E$ is an extension of metrics and preserves the supremum metrics between metrics.</description>
