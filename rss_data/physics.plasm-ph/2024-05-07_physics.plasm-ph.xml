      <title>Suppression of linear Breit-Wheeler pair production with polarized photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the ultraintense laser-solid interaction, our recent work [Phys. Rev. E 109, 035204 (2024)] has revealed that the linear Breit-Wheeler (BW) process via photon-photon collisions will become the dominant mechanism for electron-positron pair production at the normalized laser amplitude $a_0&lt;400$--$500$. Here, we investigate the impact of photon polarization on linear Breit-Wheeler pair production in the similar laser-solid setup, mainly focusing on the difference of positron yields between polarized and unpolarized situations. Two facts serve as the motivation for this work: (i) the emitted photons via nonlinear Compton scattering are highly linearly polarized in the strong-field QED regime; (ii) the linear BW cross section $\sigma_{\gamma\gamma}$ is dependent on photon polarization. By using two-dimensional QED particle-in-cell simulations, we find that the photon polarization effect can suppress the positron yield by 5% to 10% in linear BW pair production. This is because the polarization directions of colliding photons are predominantly parallel, resulting in a reduced $\sigma_{\gamma\gamma}$ compared to the unpolarized cross section. The suppression degree is decreased with the enhancement of the nonlinear QED strength at higher laser intensities. This work emphasizes the importance of photon polarization in accurately predicting linear BW pair production in laser-driven plasmas.</description>

      <title>ChemPlasKin: a general-purpose program for unified gas and plasma kinetics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces ChemPlasKin, a freely accessible solver optimized for zero-dimensional (0D) simulations of chemical kinetics of neutral gas in non-equilibrium plasma environments. By integrating the electron Boltzmann equation solver, CppBOLOS, with the open-source combustion library, Cantera, at the source code level, ChemPlasKin computes time-resolved evolution of species concentration and gas temperature in a unified gas-plasma kinetics framework. The model allows high fidelity predictions of both chemical thermal effects and plasma-induced heating, including fast gas heating and slower vibrational-translational relaxation processes. Additionally, a new heat loss model is developed for nanosecond pulsed discharges, specifically within pin-pin electrode configurations. With its versatility, ChemPlasKin is well-suited for a wide range of applications, from plasma-assisted combustion (PAC) to fuel reforming. In this paper, the reliability, accuracy and efficiency of ChemPlasKin are validated through a number of test problems, demonstrating its utility in advancing gas-plasma kinetic studies.</description>

      <title>Exploring relaxation dynamics in warm dense plasmas by tailoring non-thermal electron distributions with a free electron laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowing the characteristic relaxation time of free electrons in a dense plasma is crucial to our understanding of plasma equilibration and transport. However, experimental investigations of electron relaxation dynamics have been hindered by the ultra-fast, sub-femtosecond time scales on which these interactions typically take place. Here we propose a novel approach that uses x-rays from a free electron laser to generate well-defined non-thermal electron distributions, which can then be tracked via emission spectroscopy from radiative recombination as they thermalize. Collisional radiative simulations reveal how this method can enable the measurement of electron relaxation time scales {\it in situ}, shedding light on the applicability and accuracy of the Coulomb Logarithm framework for modelling collisions in dense plasmas.</description>

      <title>High velocity solid dust impacts on tiles of tokamak-relevant temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Runaway electron incidence on plasma facing components triggers explosive events that are accompanied by the expulsion of fast solid debris. Subsequent dust-wall high speed impacts constitute a mechanism of wall damage and dust destruction. Empirical damage laws that can be employed for erosion estimates are based on room-temperature impact experiments. We use light-gas gun shooting systems to accelerate solid tungsten dust to near-supersonic speeds towards bulk tungsten targets that are maintained at different temperatures. This concerns targets cooled down to $-100^{\circ}$C with liquid nitrogen and targets resistively heated up to $400^{\circ}$C. Post-mortem surface analysis reveals that the three erosion regimes (plastic deformation, bonding, partial disintegration) weakly depend on the target temperature within the investigated range. It is concluded that empirical damage laws based on room-temperature measurements can be safely employed for predictions.</description>

      <title>Broadening of the Divertor Heat Flux Profile in High Confinement Tokamak Fusion Plasmas with Edge Pedestals Limited by Turbulence in DIII-D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00185v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-machine empirical scaling predicts an extremely narrow heat exhaust layer in future high magnetic field tokamaks, producing high power densities that require mitigation. In the experiments presented, the width of this exhaust layer is nearly doubled using actuators to increase turbulent transport in the plasma edge. This is achieved in low collisionality, high confinement edge pedestals with their gradients limited by turbulent transport instead of large-scale, coherent instabilities. The exhaust heat flux profile width and divertor leg diffusive spreading both double as a high frequency band of turbulent fluctuations propagating in the electron diamagnetic direction doubles in amplitude. The results are quantitatively reproduced in electromagnetic XGC particle-in-cell simulations which show the heat flux carried by electrons emerges to broaden the heat flux profile, directly supported by Langmuir probe measurements.</description>

      <title>Dynamo action driven by precessional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reveal and analyze an efficient magnetic dynamo action due to precession-driven hydrodynamic turbulence in the local model of a precessional flow, focusing on the kinematic stage of this dynamo. The growth rate of magnetic field monotonically increases with Poincar\'{e} number, $\rm Po$, characterizing precession strength, and magnetic Prandtl number, $\rm Pm$, equal to the ratio of viscosity to resistivity, for the considered ranges of these parameters. The critical ${\rm Po}_c$ for the dynamo onset decreases with increasing $\rm Pm$. To understand the scale-by-scale evolution (growth) of the precession dynamo and its driving processes, we perform spectral analysis by calculating the spectra of magnetic energy and of different terms in the induction equation in Fourier space. To this end, we decompose the velocity field of precession-driven turbulence into 2D vortical and 3D inertial wave modes. It is shown that the dynamo operates across a broad range of scales and exhibits a remarkable transition from a primarily vortex-driven regime at lower $\rm Po$ to a more complex regime at higher $\rm Po$ where it is driven jointly by vortices, inertial waves and the shear of the background precessional flow. The vortices and shear drive the dynamo mostly at large scales, comparable to the flow system size, and at intermediate scales, while at smaller scales it is mainly driven by inertial waves. This study can be important not only for understanding the magnetic dynamo action in precession-driven flows, but also in a general context of flows where vortices emerge and govern the flow dynamics and evolution.</description>

      <title>Towards Synthetic Magnetic Turbulence with Coherent Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10573v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic turbulence is a relevant tool to study complex astrophysical and space plasma environments inaccessible by direct simulation. However, conventional models lack intermittent coherent structures, which are essential in realistic turbulence. We present a novel method, featuring coherent structures, conditional structure function scaling and fieldline curvature statistics comparable to magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. Enhanced transport of charged particles is investigated as well. This method presents significant progress towards physically faithful synthetic turbulence.</description>
