      <title>Capacity gain in Li-ion cells with silicon-containing electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon-containing lithium-ion batteries can exhibit capacity gain early in life, which makes forecasting future cell behavior difficult. We have observed these anomalous trends even in conditions where known mechanisms, such as overhang equalization and excessive electrolyte oxidation, are unlikely to be significant. Here, we combine simulations and experiments to analyze four cases that can produce increased capacity in Si cells. Three of these pathways relate to break-in processes, where improved mass and charge transport can lead to increased access to active electrode domains and decreased cell impedance. The fourth case occurs at high levels of prelithiation, when the positive electrode (PE) is completely replenished with Li+ at the end of cell discharge. We show that the commonality among these mechanisms is that the underlying transformations change the potentials experienced by electrodes at the end of half-cycles, increasing the Li+ inventory available to the cell. A quantitative framework to describe these effects is presented, enabling these ideas to be extended to other battery systems.</description>

      <title>fix pimd/langevin: An Efficient Implementation of Path Integral Molecular Dynamics in LAMMPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD), which maps a quantum particle onto a fictitious classical system of ring polymers and propagates the "beads" of this extended classical system using molecular dynamics, is widely used to capture nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) in molecular simulations. Accurate PIMD calculations typically require a large number of beads and are therefore computationally demanding. While software packages such as i-PI offer comprehensive PIMD functionality, the high efficiency of simulations driven by machine learning interatomic potentials, such as Deep Potential (DP), calls for more efficient PIMD implementations that fully exploit modern massively parallel supercomputers. Here we present fix pimd/langevin, an efficient PIMD implementation in LAMMPS that supports commonly used features and leverages the Message Passing Interface architecture of LAMMPS to achieve high computational efficiency. We demonstrate the usage and validate the correctness of our code using liquid water as a representative example, and provide a comprehensive overview of the supported features. Then we discuss several important technical aspects of the implementation. Using DP simulations of water as a benchmark, we show that our implementation achieves several-fold acceleration compared to i-PI. Finally, we report strong and weak scaling results that demonstrate the favorable parallel performance of our code.</description>

      <title>Efficient Simulation of Non-Markovian Path Integrals via Imaginary Time Evolution of an Effective Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately simulating the non-Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems remains a significant challenge. While the recently proposed time-evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) algorithm based on path integrals successfully circumvents the exponential scaling associated with memory length, its reliance on layer-by-layer tensor contractions and compressions leads to steep scaling with respect to the system Hilbert space dimension. In this work, we introduce the effective Hamiltonian-based TEMPO (EH-TEMPO) algorithm, which reformulates the calculation of the Feynman-Vernon influence functional as an imaginary time evolution governed by an effective Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that this effective Hamiltonian admits a highly compact matrix product operator representation, enabling substantial compression with negligible loss of accuracy. Combining a one-shot global evolution with a backward retrieval approach, EH-TEMPO significantly reduces algorithmic complexity and is naturally suited for GPU acceleration. We benchmark the method against the process tensor TEMPO algorithm using the 7-site Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex model. The results demonstrate that EH-TEMPO achieves numerically exact accuracy with superior efficiency, delivering speedups of up to 17.5x on GPU hardware compared to standard CPU implementations.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbital entanglement in Cr$^{3+}$-doped glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A framework for reconstructing the one-electron spinors $\Gamma_7$ and $\Gamma_8$ of Cr$^{3+}$ embedded in glasses from optical measurements has been developed. From the spinors, the spin-orbital von Neumann entropy can be calculated. An aluminum phosphate glass doped with 1 mol % chromium is prepared, and its optical absorption spectrum is recorded to validate the method. The spin-orbit coupling constant, crystal field strength, and Racah parameters are obtained from the absorption spectrum. Subsequently, the spin-orbital entanglement entropy is calculated and analyzed for a family of chromium-doped glasses. It is found that individually, neither the spin-orbit coupling constant, nor the crystal field strength, nor the Racah parameters correlate with the entanglement entropy. In contrast, the ratio between the spin-orbit coupling constant and the crystal field strength correlates linearly with the entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Monomeric machine learning potential for general covalent molecules: linear alkanes as an example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learning potentials (MLPs) have become important tools for modern molecular simulations. However, developing models that simultaneously achieve high accuracy and high computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. In this work, we extend the recently proposed MB-PIPNet framework to general covalently bonded molecular systems by combining monomer-based energy decomposition, permutationally invariant polynomial (PIP) descriptors, and neural networks within a fragmentation-based strategy. Within this framework, the total potential energy is represented as a sum of effective monomeric contributions, where PIPs provide compact and chemically motivated descriptions of both monomer internal structures and their local chemical environments. As a proof-of-concept application, we apply the MB-PIPNet framework to linear alkanes, using n-Tetradecane as a representative system, and benchmark its performance against established atomistic machine-learning models. The resulting MB-PIPNet potential accurately reproduces reference ab initio electronic energies and reliably captures key molecular properties, including torsional potential energy profiles, harmonic vibrational frequencies, and vibrational power spectra obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Importantly, MB-PIPNet demonstrates a substantial advantage in computational efficiency over other MLP models for combined energy and force evaluations. These results establish MB-PIPNet as a scalable and efficient framework for constructing MLPs, providing an additional route for large-scale quantum and classical simulations of complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>An accurate theoretical framework for the optical and electronic properties of paracyclophanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aromatic $\pi$-stacking interactions play an important role in both natural and artificial systems, influencing processes such as charge separation in photosynthesis and charge transport in organic semiconductors. Controlling the geometry and distance between aromatic units is therefore crucial for tuning intermolecular interactions and charge-transfer efficiency. Due to their well-defined stacking geometry, paracyclophanes (PCPs) composed of two or more aromatic units connected by rigid linkers, provide an ideal platform for a systematic study of such effects. Despite extensive experimental studies of PCPs, a comprehensive and quantitatively validated theoretical description linking the structure with the electronic and optical properties is still missing. Here, we present an extensive computational and experimental investigation of the electronic and optical properties of homo-PCPs containing naphthalene diimide (NDI) or pyrene chromophores linked by bridges of varying length and rigidity. We introduce a robust methodology for an accurate simulation of the absorption and fluorescence spectra of PCPs based on a combined TD-DFT and CC2 approach, achieving excellent quantitative agreement with experiment. We also present and validate a fragment-based description of PCPs using the Frenkel exciton model. Such approach is valuable not only for interpretation of the electronic and optical properties of PCPs, but it can also significantly reduce the cost of the calculation while maintaining the accuracy of the supermolecular approach. This work establishes a quantitatively reliable framework linking structure, excitonic coupling, and charge-transfer interactions in PCPs with optical properties, providing design principles for next-generation optoelectronic materials.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Based Molecular Structure Retrieval from Coulomb Explosion Imaging Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the structure and following the structural evolution of molecules undergoing chemical reactions is one of the key goals of ultrafast molecular physics and chemistry. Recently, Coulomb explosion imaging has emerged as a promising technique for imaging the evolving structure of individual molecules in the gas phase. However, its practical application for structure determination is hampered by the lack of suitable algorithms to directly retrieve the molecular structure from the measured fragment-ion momentum data. Here, we propose a scheme to solve the underlying inverse problem by employing neural networks to infer the initial atomic positions from the final ion momenta on an event-by-event basis. Using this scheme, we retrieve the structure of several polyhalomethane isomers from simulated Coulomb explosion imaging data with an average per-atom position error of approximately 0.1 atomic units, i.e., to within 5% of the typical bond lengths. This development paves the way for an automated structure retrieval from Coulomb explosion data one molecule at a time, making it ideally suitable for analyzing pump-probe experiments where several products are formed that need to be distinguished.</description>

      <title>Scaling Transferable Coarse-graining with Mean Force Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coarse-grained molecular dynamics often sacrifices accuracy and transferability for computational efficiency, but the use of machine learned potentials is helping coarse-grained models attain performance on par with atomistic molecular dynamics. Nevertheless, developing representations of the coarse-grained potential energy surface faces severe scaling challenges due to the extreme data demands of widely used "bottom-up" coarse-graining objectives. In this work, we show that mean force matching, a strategy for training thermodynamically consistent coarse-grained models, requires 50x fewer training samples and 87% less total atomistic simulation time, while obtaining better accuracy on the potential of mean force for unseen proteins compared to other commonly used objectives. By systematically removing noise from the objective function, we demonstrate that it is possible to scale machine learning architectures for coarse-graining, enabling highly accurate and transferable models. We show the advantages of mean force matching both theoretically and through exhaustive benchmarking using thermodynamic consistency as the primary metric of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Faster Molecular Dynamics with Neural Network Potentials via Distilled Multiple Time-Stepping and Non-Conservative Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following our previous work (J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 2026, 17, 5, 1288-1295), we propose the DMTS-NC approach, a distilled multi-time-step (DMTS) strategy using non conservative (NC) forces to further accelerate atomistic molecular dynamics simulations using foundation neural network models. There, a dual-level reversible reference system propagator algorithm (RESPA) formalism couples a target accurate conservative potential to a simplified distilled representation optimized for the production of non-conservative forces. Despite being non-conservative, the distilled architecture is designed to enforce key physical priors, such as equivariance under rotation and cancellation of atomic force components. These choices facilitate the distillation process and therefore improve drastically the robustness of simulation, significantly limiting the "holes" in the simpler potential, thus achieving excellent agreement with the forces data. Overall, the DMTS-NC scheme is found to be more stable and efficient than its conservative counterpart with additional speedups reaching 15-30% over DMTS. Requiring no finetuning steps, it is easier to implement and can be pushed to the limit of the systems physical resonances to maintain accuracy while providing maximum efficiency. As for DMTS, DMTS-NC is applicable to any neural network potential.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Cluster Expansion for Electronic Correlation in Large Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate many-body treatments of condensed-phase systems are challenging because correlated solvers such as full configuration interaction (FCI) and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) scale exponentially with system size. Downfolding and embedding approaches mitigate this cost but typically require prior selection of a correlated subspace, which can be difficult to determine in heterogeneous or extended systems. Here, we introduce a stochastic cluster expansion framework for efficiently recovering the total correlation energy of large systems with near-DMRG accuracy, without the need to select an active space a priori. By combining correlation contributions from randomly sampled environment orbitals with an exactly treated subspace of interest, the method reproduces total energies for non-reacting and reactive systems while drastically reducing computational cost. The approach also provides a quantitative diagnostic for molecule-solvent correlation, guiding principled embedding decisions. This framework enables systematically improvable many-body calculations in extended systems, opening the door to high-accuracy studies of chemical processes in condensed phase environments.</description>

      <title>The effect of graphene orientation on permeability and corrosion initiation under composite coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unique anisotropic properties of graphene, particularly impermeability, have made it a promising candidate for further advances in corrosion prevention applications. Despite the large number of experimental works divulging the use of graphene in anticorrosion coatings, there is no report on the numerical modelling and simulation of the relationships between the orientation of graphene sheets in composite coatings and the introduced corrosion protection efficiency, to our knowledge. Herein, it is tried to model the influence of the orientation of graphene sheets dispersed in organic coatings on the diffusivity and flux of corrosive substances besides the corrosion initiation time of the protected substrates. To discover the relationship between the graphene orientation and corrosion-related phenomena, this study introduces a novel model consisting of a trigonometric factor named unprotected projected surface area proportion, which calculates corrosion-related parameters based on the principal Fick's laws. The model reveals that the decrease in the angle between graphene sheets and the substrate is highly beneficial for postponing the corrosion onset. It is accordingly estimated that a mismatch angle of 10 degree can slow down the diffusion process significantly and delay the corrosion initiation by around 65 times in a 100 micron thick epoxy/graphene composite coating in comparison to the counterpart with the perpendicular alignment. The predicted corrosion parameters were in a good agreement with the experimental data, indicating the merit of the proposed model. Thus, this model can be further employed as the fundamental of future research on the optimum graphene orientation in anticorrosion composite coatings.</description>

      <title>High-Field NMR Characterization and Indirect $J$-Spectroscopy of a Nuclear Spin Chain [U-$^{13}$C,$^{15}$N]-butyronitrile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-dimensional chains of coupled spins are minimal models of strongly correlated quantum matter, and have been proposed as wires for transporting quantum information. In liquids, rapid molecular tumbling averages anisotropic dipolar couplings and leaves effective isotropic scalar $J$-coupling Hamiltonians. At zero- to ultralow-field (ZULF) conditions, differences in frequency between nuclear spins of different types are quenched and the internal Hamiltonians can be closely approximated by an isotropic Heisenberg model. In this work, we present [U-$^{13}$C,$^{15}$N]-butyronitrile as a chemically engineered nuclear spin chain whose full spin-spin coupling network can be determined and validated by combining high-field NMR detection with evolution at ultralow fields. Starting from high-field (16.4 T) NMR spectra of $^1$H, $^{13}$C, and $^{15}$N nuclei, we extract all relevant $J$-couplings within a 12-spin network (four $^{13}$C, one $^{15}$N, and seven $^1$H). We then employ a mechanical field-cycling apparatus to prepolarize the spins at high field, shuttle them into a magnetically shielded region for evolution at &lt;50 nT, and detect signals after returning to high field. Fourier analysis of the ultralow-field evolution yields indirect $J$-spectra that are conceptually analogous to ZULF NMR spectra but measured by a high-field NMR spectrometer. We observe clear spectral features at $J$, 1.5$J$, and 2$J$, in good agreement with simulations using the extracted coupling matrix. Finally, we demonstrate 2D experiments that correlate high-field chemical shifts and, thus, fully map interactions within the molecular spin chain. Our results establish [U-$^{13}$C,$^{15}$N]-butyronitrile as an extremely well-characterized spin chain model system and provide a quantitative Hamiltonian benchmark for future hyperpolarization and quantum-control studies.</description>

      <title>Delocalisation explains efficient transport and charge generation in neat Y6 organic photovoltaics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-fullerene acceptors (NFA), such as Y6, have significantly improved the efficiency of organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs). However, the fundamental processes behind the high efficiencies of NFA devices have remained incompletely understood, with the high efficiencies persisting without the large energetic offsets often thought to be required for charge separation. Even more surprising has been the efficient charge generation in neat Y6 devices, where there is no energetic offset at all. Here, we simulate charge transport and separation in Y6 using delocalised kinetic Monte Carlo (dKMC) parameterised using atomistic calculations, thus taking into account the often-neglected ingredients of delocalisation, disorder, and polaron formation. Including delocalisation predicts higher carrier mobilities and exciton diffusion coefficients than is possible with classical simulations, bringing them into agreement with experimental values. Delocalisation also predicts higher charge-generation efficiencies in neat Y6, in agreement with experimental measurements. Finally, this work establishes dKMC as a realistic, predictive tool for understanding next-generation OPVs.</description>

      <title>Exploiting the path-integral radius of gyration in open quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major challenge in open quantum dynamics is the inclusion of Matsubara-decay terms in the memory kernel, which arise from the quantum-Boltzmann delocalisation of the bath modes. This delocalisation can be quantified by the radius of gyration squared ${\mathcal R}^2(\omega)$ of the imaginary-time Feynman paths of the bath modes as a function of the frequency $\omega$. In a Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM) calculation with a Debye--Drude spectral density, ${\mathcal R}^2(\omega)$ is the only quantity that is treated approximately (assuming convergence with respect to hierarchy depth). Here, we show that the well-known Ishizaki--Tanimura correction is equivalent to separating smooth from `Brownian' contributions to ${\mathcal R}^2(\omega)$, and that modifying the correction leads to a more efficient HEOM in the case of fast baths. We also develop a simple `A4' adaptation of the `AAA' (Adaptive Antoulas--Anderson) algorithm in order to fit ${\mathcal R}^2(\omega)$ to a sum over poles, which results in an extremely efficient implementation of the standard HEOM method at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Sub-1-Angstrom-Resolution Imaging Reveals Phase Contrast Transition in Ice Ih Caused by Basal Stacking Faults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase-contrast transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of hexagonal ice (Ih) along [0001] sometimes shows a honeycomb-like pattern, often interpreted as individual oxygen columns in single crystals. Here, we show that this pattern commonly arises from intrinsic basal stacking faults instead. A translational boundary separating domains of comparable thickness, with an in-plane offset of (2/3a + 1/3b), produces this honeycomb-like contrast. Stacking domains translated in nonequivalent directions yields patterns resembling cubic ice (Ic) along [0001] but with a 3-fold symmetry. We imaged this structure at a record-breaking line resolution of 89 picometers, finer than the O-H covalent bond length. These findings highlight the defect tolerance of ice's molecular packing and clarify the structural relationships among hexagonal, stacking-disordered, and cubic ice phases. This resolution milestone opens new avenues for characterizing subtle structural perturbations of water in the solid state.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo at the basis set limit: application to lattice constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a plane-wave (PW) implementation of the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method within the projector augmented-wave (PAW) formalism in the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). By employing an exact inversion of the PAW overlap operator, our approach maintains cubic scaling while naturally operating at the complete basis set limit defined by the PW cutoff. We benchmark this framework by calculating the equilibrium lattice constants and bulk moduli of C, BN, BP, and Si. Our analysis demonstrates that AFQMC systematically corrects the lack of long-range screening in MP2 and the missing higher-order exchange in RPA. We identify RPA as the optimal reference method due to the rapid convergence of the remaining short-range correlations with respect to supercell size. The resulting lattice constants exhibit a mean absolute relative error of 0.14 % relative to experiment, establishing the method as a rigorous benchmark tool for structural properties in condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Ferrocene-functionalized covalent organic framework exceeding the ultimate hydrogen storage targets: a first-principles multiscale computational study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of efficient hydrogen storage materials is crucial for advancing the hydrogen economy and meeting the U.S. Department of Energy's targets of 6.5 wt\% and 50 g \ce{H2} L$^{-1}$ for automotive applications. We present a computational study of ferrocene-functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for hydrogen storage. Following the \textbf{M}ulti-binding \textbf{S}ites \textbf{U}nited in \textbf{C}ovalent-\textbf{O}rganic \textbf{F}ramework (MSUCOF) approach, we introduce MSUCOF-4-FeCp, designed by incorporating ferrocene (\ce{FeCp2}) moieties into IRCOF-102. Notably, it achieves exceptional performance with gravimetric and volumetric uptakes of 18.0 wt\% and 72.6 g \ce{H2} L$^{-1}$ at 298 K and 700 bar. The material exhibits optimal binding energies (15--20 kJ$\cdot$mol$^{-1}$) ensuring both high storage capacity and deliverable hydrogen under practical conditions. This work establishes ferrocene functionalization as a cost-effective alternative to precious metal incorporation in COFs.</description>

      <title>Practical and improved density functionals for computational catalysis on metal surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) has been critical towards our current atomistic understanding of catalysis on transition-metal surfaces. It has opened new paradigms in rational catalyst design, predicting fundamental properties, like the adsorption energy and reaction barriers, linked to catalytic performance. However, such applications depend sensitively on the predictive accuracy of DFT and achieving experimental-level reliability, so-called transition-metal chemical accuracy (13 kJ/mol), remains challenging for present density functional approximations (DFAs) or even methods beyond DFT. We introduce a new framework for designing DFAs tailored towards studying molecules adsorbed on transition-metal surfaces, building upon recent developments in non-self-consistent DFAs. We propose two functionals within this framework, demonstrating that transition-metal chemical accuracy can be achieved across a diverse set of 39 adsorption reactions while delivering consistent performance for 17 barrier heights. Moreover, we show that these non-self-consistent DFAs address qualitative failures that challenge current self-consistent DFAs, such as CO adsorption on Pt(111) and graphene on Ni(111). The resulting functionals are computationally practical and compatible with existing DFT codes, with scripts and workflows provided to use them. Looking ahead, this framework establishes a path toward developing more accurate and sophisticated DFAs for computational heterogeneous catalysis and beyond.</description>

      <title>How individual vs shared coordination governs the degree of correlation in rotational vs residence times in a high-viscosity lithium electrolyte</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02457v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Commercially used carbonate-based electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries are susceptible to many challenges, including flammability, volatility, and lower thermal stability. Solvated ionic liquids of LiTFSI salt (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-amide) and glyme-based solvents are potential alternative candidates for commonly used electrolytes. We perform classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations study the effect of concentration and temperature on the translational and rotational dynamics. The radial distribution function shows stronger coordination of Li$^+$ ions with tetraglyme(G4), as shown in earlier studies, and forms a stable [Li(G4)]$^+$ cation complex. The self-diffusion coefficients are lower than the values experimentally observed but show better improvement over other classical force fields. An increase in the salt concentrations leads to a higher viscosity of the system and reduces the overall ionic mobility of Li$^{+}$ ions. Diluting the system with a larger number of glyme molecules leads to shorter rotational relaxation times for both TFSI and tetraglyme. Ion-residence times show that Li$^+$ ions form stable and long-lasting complexes with G4 molecules than TFSI anions. The residence time of [Li(G4)]$^+$ complex increases at higher salt concentrations due to the availability of fewer G4 molecules to coordinate with a Li$^+$ ion. G4 is also seen to form polydentate complexes with Li$^+$ without a shared coordination, allowing rotation without breaking coordination, unlike TFSI, which requires coordination disruption for rotation. This distinction explains the poor correlation between rotation and residence time for G4 and the strong correlation for TFSI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14492v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate thermochemical data with sub-chemical accuracy (within 1 kcal mol$^{-1}$ of the empirical ground truth) are essential for advancing computational chemistry methods. However, existing datasets that reach this level of accuracy remain limited in size or scope. This hinders the development of data-driven methods with predictive accuracy across the broad chemical space of closed-shell, neutral molecules. Here we present Microsoft Research Accurate Chemistry Collection (MSR-ACC) and its first release, MSR-ACC/TAE25, comprising 73,040 total atomization energies at the CCSD(T)/CBS level obtained with the W1-F12 thermochemical protocol. The dataset is constructed to exhaustively cover the chemical space of closed-shell, charge-neutral, covalently bound equilibrium molecular structures containing up to 5 non-hydrogen atoms drawn from elements up to argon and lacking significant multireference character. The dataset and its canonical train and validation splits are openly available on Zenodo in the QCSchema format under the CDLA Permissive 2.0 license. This first release of MSR-ACC enables data-driven approaches for developing predictive computational chemistry methods with unprecedented accuracy and scope.</description>

      <title>Neural Canonical Transformation for the Spectra of Fluxional Molecule CH5+</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protonated methane, CH5+, is a highly fluxional molecule with large spatial motions of the hydrogen atoms. The molecule's anharmonic effects and the delocalized wavefunction of the hydrogen atoms significantly affect the excitation spectrum of the molecule. The neural canonical transformation (NCT) approach, which we previously developed to solve the vibrational spectra of molecules and solids, is a powerful method that effectively treats nuclear quantum effects and anharmonicities. Using NCT with wavefunctions in atomic coordinates rather than normal coordinates, we successfully calculate the ground and excited states of CH5+. We found that the wavefunctions for the ground state, as well as for low- and high-energy excited states, show preferences for the three stationary points on the potential energy surface. This work extends the applicability of the NCT approach for calculating excited states to fluxional molecules without fixed geometry.</description>

      <title>Unifying Decoherence and Phase Evolution in Mixed Quantum-Classical Dynamics through Exact Factorization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose mixed quantum-classical equations of motion that unify electronic coherence and phase evolution simultaneously within the exact factorization framework. Our derivation shows that incorporating the second-order electron-nuclear correlation terms from the exact coupled time-dependent Schr\"odinger equations is essential to recover both correct phase dynamics and complete electronic (de)coherence, including their effect on nuclear forces. Benchmark calculations on one- and two-dimensional model systems confirm that the approach accurately captures key nonadiabatic features. The equations therefore provide a rigorous first-principles foundation for mixed quantum-classical description of coupled electron-nuclear dynamics, bringing electronic coherence and phase evolution-long treated through separate heuristic corrections-into a single unified and systematically derived framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\mathtt{StochasticGW}$ is a code for computing accurate Quasi-Particle (QP) energies of molecules and material systems in the GW approximation. $\mathtt{StochasticGW}$ utilizes the stochastic Resolution of the Identity (sROI) technique to enable a massively-parallel implementation with computational costs that scale semi-linearly with system size, allowing the method to access systems with tens of thousands of electrons. We introduce a new implementation, $\mathtt{StochasticGW-GPU}$, for which the main bottleneck steps have been ported to GPUs and which gives substantial performance improvements over previous versions of the code. We showcase the new code by computing band gaps of hydrogenated silicon clusters ($\textrm{S}\textrm{i}_{\textrm{x}}\textrm{H}_{\textrm{y}}$) containing up to 10001 atoms and 35144 electrons, and we obtain individual QP energies with a statistical precision of better than $\pm0.03$ eV with times-to-solution on the order of minutes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11439v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating novel molecules with higher properties than the training space, namely the out-of-distribution generation, is important for de novo drug design. However, it is not easy for distribution learning-based models, for example diffusion models, to solve this challenge as these methods are designed to fit the distribution of training data as close as possible. In this paper, we show that Bayesian flow network, especially ChemBFN model, is capable of intrinsically generating high quality out-of-distribution samples that meet several scenarios. A reinforcement learning strategy is added to the ChemBFN and a controllable ordinary differential equation solver-like generating process is employed that accelerate the sampling processes. Most importantly, we introduce a semi-autoregressive strategy during training and inference that enhances the model performance and surpass the state-of-the-art models. A theoretical analysis of out-of-distribution generation in ChemBFN with semi-autoregressive approach is included as well.</description>

Abstract: We briefly review the problem of Brownian motion and describe some intriguing facets. The problem is first treated in its original form as enunciated by Einstein, Langevin, and others. Then, utilizing the problem of Brownian motion as a paradigm and upon using the Langevin equation(s), we present a brief exposition of the modern areas of stochastic thermodynamics and fluctuation theorems in a manner accessible to a non-expert. This is followed by an analysis of non-Markovian Brownian dynamics via generalized Langevin equation(s) in which we particularly shed light onto its derivation, the emergence of the fluctuation-dissipation relation, and the recently-discovered effective-mass framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The kinetics and dynamics of drug-protein binding and dissociation are crucial to understanding drug absorption and metabolism. Despite advances in artificial intelligence (AI) tools for drug-protein interaction studies, existing training datasets remain limited to static structures or quasi-static conformations. This paper proposes a novel computational approach for rapidly generating drug-protein dissociation trajectories and presents the inaugural dynamically time-resolved 4-D (t, x, y, z) trajectory database DD-13M. This dataset captures over 26,000 complete dissociation processes for 565 ligand-protein complexes, providing nearly 13 million frames of all-atom simulation trajectories. A deep equivariant generative model, UnbindingFlow, was trained using the DD-13M dataset. This model has the capacity to produce dissociation trajectories for novel targets whilst accurately predicting their rate constants (koff). DD-13M introduces a new type of training dataset for AI models, establishing a de novo paradigm for studying the dynamics of drug-protein interactions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Efficiency of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Calculations of Dynamic Response Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01875v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) constitutes an essential technique for diagnosing material properties under extreme conditions, such as high pressures and intense laser heating. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is one of the most accurate available ab initio methods for modeling XRTS spectra, as well as a host of other dynamic material properties. However, strong thermal excitations, along with the need to account for variations in temperature and density as well as the finite size of the detector significantly increase the computational cost of TDDFT simulations compared to ambient conditions. In this work, we present a broadly applicable method for optimizing and enhancing the efficiency of TDDFT calculations. Our approach is based on a one-to-one mapping between the dynamic structure factor and the imaginary time density--density correlation function, which naturally emerges in Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum many-body theory. Specifically, we combine rigorous convergence tests in the imaginary time domain with a constraints-based attenuation of narrow-band fluctuations to improve the efficiency of TDDFT modeling without the introduction of any significant bias. As a result, we can report a speed-up by up to an order of magnitude, thus substantially reducing the burden of computational cost required for XRTS analysis.</description>
