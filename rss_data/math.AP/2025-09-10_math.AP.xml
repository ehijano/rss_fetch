      <title>The non-relativistic limit of scattering states for the Vlasov equation with short-range interaction potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relativistic and non-relativistic Vlasov equation driven by short-range interaction potentials and identify the large time dynamics of solutions. In particular, we construct global-in-time solutions launched from small initial data and prove that they scatter along the forward free flow to well-behaved limits as $t \to \infty$. Moreover, we prove the existence of wave operators for such a regime and, upon constructing the aforementioned time asymptotic limits, use the wave operator formulation to prove for the first time that the relativistic scattering states converge to their non-relativistic counterparts as $c \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Minimizing solutions of degenerate Allen-Cahn equations with three wells in $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize all minimizers of the vector-valued Allen-Cahn equation in $\mathbb{R}^2$ under the assumption that the potential $W$ has three wells and that the associated degenerate metric does not satisfy the usual strict triangle inequality. These minimizers depend on one variable only in a suitable coordinate system.
  In particular, we show that no minimizing solutions to $ \Delta u=\nabla W(u)$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$ can approach the three distinct values of the potential wells.</description>

      <title>Pathological solutions of Navier-Stokes equations on $\mathbb{T}^2$ with gradients in Hardy spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an arbitrary smooth initial datum, we construct multiple nonzero solutions to the $2$d Navier-Stokes equations, with their gradients in the Hardy space $\mathcal{H}^p$ with any $p \in (0,1)$. Thus, in terms of the path space $C(\mathcal{H}^p)$ for vorticity, $p=1$ is the threshold value distinguishing between non-uniqueness and uniqueness regimes. In order to obtain our result, we develop the needed theory of Hardy spaces on periodic domains.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional steady supersonic ramp flows of Bethe-Zel'dovich-Thompson fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional steady supersonic ramp flows are important and well-studied flow patterns in aerodynamics. Vimercati, Kluwick and Guardone [J. Fluid Mech., 885 (2018) 445--468] constructed various self-similar composite wave solutions to the supersonic flow of Bethe-Zel'dovich-Thompson (BZT) fluids past compressible and rarefactive ramps. We study the stabilities of the self-similar fan-shock-fan and shock-fan-shock composite waves constructed by Vimercati et al. in that paper. %In order to study the stabilities of the composite waves, we solve some classes of shock free boundary problems. In contrast to ideal gases, the flow downstream (or upstream) of a shock of a BZT fluid may possibly be sonic in the sense of the flow velocity relative to the shock front. In order to study the stabilities of the composite waves, we establish some a priori estimates about the type of the shocks and solve some classes of sonic shock free boundary problems. We find that the sonic shocks are envelopes of one out of the two families of wave characteristics, and not characteristics. This results in a fact that the flow downstream (or upstream) a sonic shock is not $C^1$ smooth up to the shock boundary. We use a characteristic decomposition method and a hodograph transformation method to overcome the difficulty cased by the singularity on sonic shocks, and derive several groups of structural conditions to establish the existence of curved sonic shocks.</description>

      <title>Error estimates in the non-relativistic limit for the two-dimensional cubic Klein-Gordon equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the non-relativistic limit of the two-dimensional cubic nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation with a small parameter $0&lt;\varepsilon \ll 1$ which is inversely proportional to the speed of light. We show the cubic nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation converges to the cubic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a convergence rate of order $O(\varepsilon^2)$. In particular, for the defocusing case with high regularity initial data, we show error estimates of the form $C(1+t)^N \varepsilon^2$ at time $t$ up to a long time of order $\varepsilon^{-\frac{2}{N+1}}$, while for initial data with limited regularity, we also show error estimates of the form $C(1+t)^M\varepsilon$ at time $t$ up to a long time of order $\varepsilon^{-\frac{1}{M+1}}$. Here $N$ and $M$ are constants depending on initial data. The idea of proof is to reformulate nonrelativistic limit problems to stability problems in geometric optics, then employ the techniques in geometric optics to construct approximate solutions up to an arbitrary order, and finally, together with the decay estimates of the cubic Schr\"{o}dinger equation, derive the error estimates.</description>

      <title>On anisotropic energy conservation criteria of incompressible fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, by means of divergence-free condition, we establish an anisotropic energy conservation class enabling one component of velocity in the largest space $L^{3} (0,T; B^{1/3}_{3,\infty})$ for the 3D inviscid incompressible fluids, which extends the celebrated result obtained by Cheskidov, Constantin, Friedlander and Shvydkoy in [15, Nonlinearity 21 (2008)]. For viscous flows, we generalize famous Lions's energy conservation criteria to allow the horizontal components and vertical part of velocity to have different integrability.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional symmetry results for semilinear equations and inequalities on half-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove new one-dimensional symmetry results for non-negative solutions, possibly unbounded, to the semilinear equation $ -\Delta u= f(u)$ in the upper half-space $\mathbb{R}^{N}_{+}$. Some Liouville-type theorems are also proven in the case of differential inequalities in $\mathbb{R}^{N}_{+}$, even without imposing any boundary condition. Although subject to dimensional restrictions, our results apply to a broad family of functions $f$. In particular, they apply to all non-negative $f$ that behaves at least linearly at infinity.</description>

      <title>Global behavior of the energy to the hyperbolic equation of viscoelasticity with combined power-type nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main objective of this manuscript is to investigate the global behavior of the solutions to the viscoelastic wave equation with a linear memory term of Boltzmann type, and a nonlinear damping modeling friction, as well as a supercritical source term which is a combined power-type nonlinearities. The global existence of the solutions is obtained provided that the energy sink dominates the energy source in an appropriate sense. In more general scenarios, we prove the global existence of the solutions if the initial history value $u_0$ is taken from a subset of a suitable potential well. Based on global existence results, the energy decay rate is derived which depends on the relaxation kernel as well as the growth rate of the damping term. In addition, we study blow-up of solutions when the source is stronger than dissipation.</description>

      <title>Maximal regularity of Dirichlet problem for the Laplacian in Lipschitz domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The focus of this work is on the homogeneous and non-homogeneous Dirichlet problem for the Laplacian in bounded Lipschitz domains (BLD). Although it has been extensively studied by many authors, we would like to return to a number of fundamental questions and known results, such as the traces and the maximal regularity of solutions. First, to treat non-homogeneous boundary conditions, we rigorously define the notion of traces for non regular functions. This approach replaces the non-tangential trace notion that has dominated the literature since the 1980s. We identify a functional space E = \{v\in H^{1/2}(\Omega);\nabla v\in [H^1/2(\Omega)]'\} for which the trace operator is continuous from $E$ into $L^2(\Gamma)$. Second, we address the regularity of solutions to the Laplace equation with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions. Using specific equivalent norms in fractional Sobolev spaces and Grisvard's results for polygons and polyhedral domains, we prove that maximal regularity $H^{3/2}$ holds in any BLD $\Omega$, for all right-hand sides in the dual of $H^{1/2}_{00}(\Omega)$. This conclusion contradicts the prevailing claims in the literature since the 1990s. Third, we describe some criteria which establish new uniqueness results for harmonic functions in Lipschitz domains. In particular, we show that if $u\in H^{1/2}(\Omega)$ or $u\in W^{1, 2N/(N+1)}(\Omega)$, is harmonic in $\Omega$ and vanishes on $\Gamma$, then $u= 0$. These criteria play a central role in deriving regularity properties. Finally, we revisit the classical Area Integral Estimate. Using Grisvard's work and an explicit function given by Necas, we show that this inequality cannot hold in its stated form. Since this estimate has been widely used to argue that $H^{3/2}$-regularity is unattainable for data in the dual of $H^{1/2}_{00}(\Omega)$, our counterexample provides a decisive clarification.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz regularity for $p$-harmonic interface transmission problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove optimal Lipschitz regularity for weak solutions of the measure-valued $p$-Poisson equation $-\Delta_p u = Q \; \mathcal{H}^{n-1} \llcorner \Gamma$. Here $p \in (1,2)$, $\Gamma$ is a compact and connected $C^2$-hypersurface without boundary, and $Q$ is a positive $W^{2,\infty}$-density. This equation can be understood as a nonlinear interface transmission problem. Our main result extends previous studies of the linear case and provides further insights on a delicate limit case of (linear and nonlinear) potential theory.</description>

      <title>Existence of minimizers for interaction energies with external potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the existence of minimizers for interaction energies with the presence of external potentials. We consider a class of subharmonic interaction potentials, which include the Riesz potentials $|{\bf x}|^{-s},\,\max\{0,d-2\}&lt;s&lt;d$ and its anisotropic counterparts. The underlying space is taken as $\mathbb{R}^d$ or a half-space with possibly curved boundary. We give a sufficient and almost necessary condition for the existence of minimizers, as well as the uniqueness of minimizers. The proof is based on the observation that the Euler-Lagrange condition for the energy minimizer is almost the same as that for the maximizer of the height functional, defined as the essential infimum of the generated potential. We also give two complimentary results: a simple sufficient condition for the existence of minimizers for general interaction/external potentials, and a slight improvement to the known result on the existence of minimizers without external potentials.</description>

      <title>Sharp power concavity of two relevant free boundary problems of reaction-diffusion type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The porous medium type reaction-diffusion equation and the Hele-Shaw problem are two free boundary problems linked through the incompressible (Hele-Shaw) limit. We investigate and compare the sharp power concavities of the pressures on their respective supports for the two free boundary problems. For the pressure of the porous medium type reaction-diffusion equation, the $\frac{1}{2}$-concavity preserves all the time, while $\alpha$-concavity for $\alpha\in[0,\frac{1}{2})\cup(\frac{1}{2},1]$ does not persist in time. In contrast, in the case of the pressure for the Hele-Shaw problem, $\alpha$-concavity with $\alpha\in[0,\frac{1}{2}]$ is maintained all the while and $\frac{1}{2}$ acts as the largest index. The intuitive explanation for the difference between the two free boundary problems is that, although the Hele-Shaw problem is the incompressible limit of the porous medium-type reaction-diffusion equation, it is no longer a degenerate parabolic equation. Furthermore, for the pressure of the porous medium type reaction-diffusion equation, the non-degenerate estimate is established by means of the derived concave properties, indicating that the spatial Lipschitz regularity in the whole space is sharp.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of plasmas is a challenging topic. We study a control problem for plasma living in a uniform external magnetic field. Linear analysis for any equilibrium $\mu$ is investigated through the Laplace-Fourier transform approach. Moreover, the Penrose condition, which characterizes the stability of equilibrium, is derived for Bernstein modes and verified numerically. Based on the linear analysis, a general control strategy is introduced, with recovering the free-streaming solution as a specific example. We finally present several examples to control instabilities, including Gaussian equilibria and Dory-Guest-Harris instability.</description>

      <title>A weak type $(p,a)$ criterion for operators, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(X, d, \mu)$ be a space of homogeneous type and $\Omega$ an open subset of $X$. Given a bounded operator $T: L^p(\Omega) \to L^q(\Omega)$ for some $1 \le p \le q &lt; \infty$, we give a criterion for $T$ to be of weak type $(p_0, a)$ for $p_0$ and $a$ such that $\frac{1}{p_0} - \frac{1}{a} = \frac{1}{p}-\frac{1}{q}$. These results are illustrated by several applications including estimates of weak type $(p_0, a)$ for Riesz potentials $L^{-\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ or for Riesz transform type operators $\nabla \Delta^{-\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ as well as $L^p-L^q$ boundedness of spectral multipliers $F(L)$ when the heat kernel of $L$ satisfies a Gaussian upper bound or an off-diagonal bound. We also prove boundedness of these operators from the Hardy space $H^1_L$ associated with $L$ into $L^a(X)$. By duality this gives boundedness from $L^{a'}(X)$ into $\text{BMO}_L$.</description>

      <title>On shape optimization with large magnetic fields in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to show that, in the limit of strong magnetic fields, the optimal domains for eigenvalues of magnetic Laplacians tend to exhibit symmetry. We establish several asymptotic bounds on magnetic eigenvalues to support this conclusion. Our main result implies that if, for a bounded simply-connected planar domain, the n-th eigenvalue of the magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian with uniform magnetic field is smaller than the corresponding eigenvalue for a disk of the same area, then the Fraenkel asymmetry of that domain tends to zero in the strong magnetic field limit. Comparable results are also derived for the magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian on rectangles, as well as the magnetic Dirac operator with infinite mass boundary conditions on smooth domains. As part of our analysis, we additionally provide a new estimate for the torsion function on rectangles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we have analyzed semi-discrete finite element approximation and full discretization of the Stochastic semilinear generalized Benjamin-Bona-Mahony equation in a bounded convex polygonal domain driven by additive Wiener noise. We use the finite element method for spatial discretization and the semi-implicit method for time discretization and derive a strong convergence rate with respect to both parameters (spatial and temporal). Numerical experiments have also been performed to support theoretical bounds.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical exact controllability for a parabolic equation with Hardy potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to study the hierarchical exact controllability for a parabolic equation with Hardy potential by Stackelberg-Nash strategy. In linear case, we employ Lax-Milgram theorem to prove the existence of an associated Nash equilibrium pair corresponding to a bi-objective optimal control problem for each leader, which is responsible for an exact controllability property. Then the observability inequality of a coupled parabolic system is established by using global Carleman inequalities, which results in the existence of a leader that drives the controlled system exactly to any prescribed trajectory. In semilinear case, we first prove the well-posedness of the coupled parabolic system to obtain the existence of Nash quasi-equilibrium pair and show that Nash quasi-equilibrium is equivalent to Nash equilibrium. Based on these results, we establish the existence of a leader that drives the controlled system exactly to a prescribed (but arbitrary) trajectory by Leray-Schauder fixed point theorem.</description>

      <title>Linear Convergence of Gradient Descent for Quadratically Regularized Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In optimal transport, quadratic regularization is an alternative to entropic regularization when sparse couplings or small regularization parameters are desired. Here quadratic regularization means that transport couplings are penalized by the squared $L^2$ norm, or equivalently the $\chi^2$ divergence. While a number of computational approaches have been shown to work in practice, quadratic regularization is analytically less tractable than entropic, and we are not aware of a previous theoretical convergence rate analysis. We focus on the gradient descent algorithm for the dual transport problem in continuous and semi-discrete settings. This problem is convex but not strongly convex; its solutions are the potential functions that approximate the Kantorovich potentials of unregularized optimal transport. The gradient descent steps are straightforward to implement, and stable for small regularization parameter -- in contrast to Sinkhorn's algorithm in the entropic setting. Our main result is that gradient descent converges linearly; that is, the $L^2$ distance between the iterates and the limiting potentials decreases exponentially fast. Our analysis centers on the linearization of the gradient descent operator at the optimum and uses functional-analytic arguments to bound its spectrum. These techniques seem to be novel in this area and are substantially different from the approaches familiar in entropic optimal transport.</description>

      <title>A transport approach to the cutoff phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Substantial progress has recently been made in the understanding of the cutoff phenomenon for Markov processes, using an information-theoretic statistics known as varentropy [Sal23; Sal24; Sal25a; PS25]. In the present paper, we propose an alternative approach which bypasses the use of varentropy and exploits instead a new W-TV transport inequality, combined with a classical parabolic regularization estimate [BGL01; OV01]. While currently restricted to non-negatively curved processes on smooth spaces, our argument no longer requires the chain rule, nor any approximate version thereof. As applications, we recover the main result of [Sal25a] establishing cutoff for the log-concave Langevin dynamics, and extend the conclusion to a widely-used discrete-time sampling algorithm known as the Proximal Sampler.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the spectral properties of the Hilbert-Brunn-Minkowski operator $L_K$ to derive stability estimates for geometric inequalities, including the local Brunn-Minkowski inequality. By analyzing the eigenvalues of $L_K$, we establish the uniqueness of $S_2$-isotropic solutions to the isotropic $L_p$ Minkowski problem in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $\frac{1-3n^2}{2n}\leq p&lt;-n$ with $\lambda_2(-L_K)\geq \frac{n-1}{2n-1+p}$. Furthermore, we extend this uniqueness result to the range $-2n-1 \leq p&lt;-n$ with $\lambda_2(-L_K)\geq \frac{-p-1}{n-1}$, assuming the origin-centred condition.</description>

Abstract: We show that a discrete harmonic function which is bounded on a large portion of a periodic planar graph is constant. A key ingredient is a new unique continuation result for the weighted graph Laplacian. The proof relies on the structure of level sets of discrete harmonic functions, using arguments as in Bou-Rabee--Cooperman--Dario (2023) which exploit the fact that, on a planar graph, the sub- and super-level sets cannot cross over each other. In the special case of the square lattice this yields a new, geometric proof of the Liouville theorem of Buhovsky--Logunov--Malinnikova--Sodin (2017).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the realm of mathematical fluid dynamics, a formidable challenge lies in establishing inviscid limits from the Navier-Stokes equations to the Euler equations, wherein physically admissible solutions can be discerned. The pursuit of solving this intricate problem, particularly concerning singular solutions, persists in both compressible and incompressible scenarios.
  This article focuses on small $BV$ solutions to the barotropic Euler equation in one spatial dimension. Our investigation demonstrates that these solutions are inviscid limits for solutions to the associated compressible Navier-Stokes equation. Moreover, we extend our findings by establishing the well-posedness of such solutions within the broader class of inviscid limits of Navier-Stokes equations with locally bounded energy initial values.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study the derivation of nonlinear bending models for prestrained elastic plates from three-dimensional non-linear elasticity via homogenization and dimension reduction. We compare effective models obtained by either simultaneously or consecutively passing to the $\Gamma$-limits as the thickness $h\ll1$ and the size of the material microstructure $\e\ll1$ vanish. In the regime $\e\ll h$ we show that the consecutive and simultaneous limit are equivalent, and also analyze the rate of convergence. In contrast, we observe that there are several different limit models in the case $h\ll \e$.</description>

      <title>Critical double phase problems involving sandwich-type nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study problems with critical and sandwich-type growth represented by
  \begin{align*}
  -\operatorname{div}\Big(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u + a(x)|\nabla u|^{q-2}\nabla u\Big)= \lambda w(x)|u|^{s-2}u+\theta B\left(x,u\right) \quad \text{in } \Omega,\quad
  u= 0 \quad\text{on } \partial \Omega,
  \end{align*}
  where $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary $\partial\Omega$, $1&lt;p&lt;s&lt;q&lt;N$, $\frac{q}{p}&lt;1+\frac{1}{N}$, $0\leq a(\cdot)\in C^{0,1}(\overline{\Omega})$, $\lambda$, $\theta$ are real parameters, $w$ is a suitable weight and $B\colon \overline{\Omega}\times \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is given by
  \begin{align*}
  B(x,t) :=b_0(x)|t|^{p^*-2}t+b(x)|t|^{q^*-2}t,
  \end{align*}
  where $r^*:=Nr/(N-r)$ for $r\in\{p,q\}$. Here the right-hand side combines the effect of a critical term given by $B(\cdot,\cdot)$ and a sandwich-type perturbation with exponent $s \in (p,q)$. Under different values of the parameters $\lambda$ and $\theta$, we prove the existence and multiplicity of solutions to the problem above. For this, we mainly exploit different variational methods combined with topological tools, like a new concentration-compactness principle, a suitable truncation argument and the Krasnoselskii's genus theory, by considering very mild assumptions on the data $a(\cdot)$, $b_0(\cdot)$ and $b(\cdot)$.</description>

      <title>The stability threshold for 3D MHD equations around Couette with rationally aligned magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19822v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address a stability threshold problem of the Couette flow $(y,0,0)$ in a uniform magnetic fleld $\alpha(\sigma,0,1)$ with $\sigma\in\mathbb{Q}$ for the 3D MHD equations on $\mathbb{T}\times\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T}$. Previously, the authors in \cite{L20,RZZ25} obtained the threshold $\gamma=1$ for $\sigma\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}$ satisfying a generic Diophantine condition, where they also proved $\gamma = 4/3$ for a general $\sigma\in\mathbb{R}$. In the present paper, we obtain the threshold $\gamma=1$ in $H^N(N&gt;13/2)$, hence improving the above results when $\sigma$ is a rational number. The nonlinear inviscid damping for velocity $u^2_{\neq}$ is also established. Moreover, our result shows that the nonzero modes of magnetic field has an amplification of order $\nu^{-1/3}$ even on low regularity, which is very different from the case considered in \cite{L20,RZZ25}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a feedback control strategy to protect vulnerable areas from wildfires. We consider a system of coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) that models heat propagation and fuel depletion in wildfires and study two cases. First, when the wind velocity is known, we design a Neumann-type boundary controller guaranteeing that the temperature of some protected region converges exponentially, in the $L^2$ norm, to the ambient temperature. Second, when the wind velocity is unknown, we design an adaptive Neumann-type boundary controller guaranteeing the asymptotic convergence, in the $L^2$ norm, of the temperature of the protected region to the ambient temperature. In both cases, the controller acts along the boundary of the protected region and relies solely on temperature measurements along that boundary. Our results are supported by numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: We prove that solutions to linear kinetic equations in a half-space with absorbing boundary conditions decay for large times like $t^{-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{d}{4}}$ in a weighted $\sfL^{2}$ space and like $t^{-1-\frac{d}{2}}$ in a weighted $\sfL^{\infty}$ space, i.e. faster than in the whole space and in agreement with the decay of solutions to the heat equation in the half-space with Dirichlet conditions. The class of linear kinetic equations considered includes the linear relaxation equation, the kinetic Fokker-Planck equation and the Kolmogorov equation associated with the time-integrated spherical Brownian motion.</description>

Abstract: We study the $\mathrm{C}^2$ estimates for $p$-Hessian equations with general left-hand and right-hand terms on closed Riemannian manifolds of dimension $n$. To overcome the constraints of closed manifolds, we advance a new kind of "subsolution", called pseudo-solution, which generalizes "$\mathcal{C}$-subsolution" to some extent and is well-defined for fully general $p$-Hessian equations. Based on pseudo-solutions, we prove the $\mathrm{C}^1$ estimates for general $p$-Hessian equations, and the corresponding second-order estimates when $p\in\{2, n-1, n\}$, under sharp conditions -- we don't impose curvature restrictions, convexity conditions or "MTW condition" on our main results. Some other conclusions related to a priori estimates and different kinds of "subsolutions" are also given, including estimates for "semi-convex" solutions and when there exists a pseudo-solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a new hyperbolic model governing the first-order dynamics of a thin film flow under the influence of gravity and solute transport. The obtained system turns out to be a non-symmetric Keyfitz-Kranzer type system. We find an entire class of convex entropies in the regions where the system remains strictly hyperbolic. By including delta shocks, we prove the existence of unique solutions of the Riemann problem. We analyze their stability with respect to the perturbation of the initial data and to the gravity and surface tension parameters. Moreover, we discuss the large time behaviour of the solutions of the perturbed Riemann problem and prove that the initial Riemann states govern it. Thus, we confirm the structural stability of the Riemann solutions under the perturbation of initial data. Finally, we validate our analytical results with well-established numerical schemes for this new system of conservation laws.</description>
