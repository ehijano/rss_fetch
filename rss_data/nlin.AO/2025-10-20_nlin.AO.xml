      <title>Active matter synchronization and synergetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the collective behavior in a stochastic agent-based model of active matter. Provided a critical take-up of energy, agents produce two types of goods $x$, $y$ that follow a generalized Lotka-Volterra dynamics. For isolated agents, production would either reach a fixed point or diverge. Coupling agents' production via a mean field of $x$, however, can lead to synchronized oscillations if agents cooperate in the production of $x$. The production of $y$ supports the emergence of the synchronized dynamics by suppressing fluctuations and mitigating competition between agents, this way stabilizing the production of $x$. We find that in the synchronized state different groups of agents coexist, each following their own limit cycle. The Kuramoto order parameter is large within groups, and small across groups. The collective state is stable against shocks from agents temporarily switching between cooperation and competition. The model dynamics illustrates the principles of synergetics, i.e., the spontaneous emergence of order given a critical energy supply and cooperative interactions.</description>

      <title>The Physics of News, Rumors, and Opinions</title>

Abstract: The boundaries between physical and social networks have narrowed with the advent of the Internet and its pervasive platforms. This has given rise to a complex adaptive information ecosystem where individuals and machines compete for attention, leading to emergent collective phenomena. The flow of information in this ecosystem is often non-trivial and involves complex user strategies from the forging or strategic amplification of manipulative content to large-scale coordinated behavior that trigger misinformation cascades, echo-chamber reinforcement, and opinion polarization. We argue that statistical physics provides a suitable and necessary framework for analyzing the unfolding of these complex dynamics on socio-technological systems. This review systematically covers the foundational and applied aspects of this framework. The review is structured to first establish the theoretical foundation for analyzing these complex systems, examining both structural models of complex networks and physical models of social dynamics (e.g., epidemic and spin models). We then ground these concepts by describing the modern media ecosystem where these dynamics currently unfold, including a comparative analysis of platforms and the challenge of information disorders. The central sections proceed to apply this framework to two central phenomena: first, by analyzing the collective dynamics of information spreading, with a dedicated focus on the models, the main empirical insights, and the unique traits characterizing misinformation; and second, by reviewing current models of opinion dynamics, spanning discrete, continuous, and coevolutionary approaches. In summary, we review both empirical findings based on massive data analytics and theoretical advances, highlighting the valuable insights obtained from physics-based efforts to investigate these phenomena of high societal impact.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Functionally Differentiated Structures via Mutual Information Minimization in Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Functional differentiation in the brain emerges as distinct regions specialize and is key to understanding brain function as a complex system. Previous research has modeled this process using artificial neural networks with specific constraints. Here, we propose a novel approach that induces functional differentiation in recurrent neural networks by minimizing mutual information between neural subgroups via mutual information neural estimation. We apply our method to a 2-bit working memory task and a chaotic signal separation task involving Lorenz and R\"ossler time series. Analysis of network performance, correlation patterns, and weight matrices reveals that mutual information minimization yields high task performance alongside clear functional modularity and moderate structural modularity. Importantly, our results show that functional differentiation, which is measured through correlation structures, emerges earlier than structural modularity defined by synaptic weights. This suggests that functional specialization precedes and probably drives structural reorganization within developing neural networks. Our findings provide new insights into how information-theoretic principles may govern the emergence of specialized functions and modular structures during artificial and biological brain development.</description>
