      <title>Two Selection Theorems for Extremally Disconnected Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper contains a very simple proof of the classical Hasumi's theorem that each usco mapping defined on an extremally disconnected space has a continuous selection. The paper also contains a very simple proof of a recent result about extension of densely defined continuous selections for compact-valued continuous mappings, in fact a generalisation of this result to all usco mappings with a regular range.</description>

      <title>On Golomb Topology of Modules over Commutative Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we associate a new topology to a nonzero unital module $M$ over a commutative $R$, which is called Golomb topology of the $R$-module $M$. Let $M\ $be an\ $R$-module and $B_{M}$ be the family of coprime cosets $\{m+N\}$ where $m\in M$ and $N\ $is a nonzero submodule of $M\ $such that $N+Rm=M$. We prove that if $M\ $is a meet irreducible multiplication module or $M\ $is a meet irreducible finitely generated module in which every maximal submodule is strongly irreducible, then $B_{M}\ $is the basis for a topology on $M\ $which is denoted by $\widetilde{G(M)}.$ In particular, the subspace topology on $M-\{0\}$ is called the Golomb topology of the $R$-module $M\ $and denoted by $G(M)$. We investigate the relations between topological properties of $G(M)\ $and algebraic properties of $M.\ $In particular, we characterize some important classes of modules such as simple modules, Jacobson semisimple modules in terms of Golomb topology.</description>

      <title>Invertibility in partially ordered nonassociative rings and in Hausdorff Cauchy-complete weak-quasi-topological nonassociative rings endowed with an ordered ring valued seminorm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16565v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Invertibility is important in ring theory because it enables division and facilitates solving equations. Moreover, (nonassociative) rings can be endowed with an extra ''structure'' such as order and topology allowing more richness in the theory. The two main theorems of this article are contributions to invertibility in the context of partially ordered nonassociative rings \textit{and} Hausdorff sequentially Cauchy-complete weak-quasi-topological nonassociative rings. Specifically, the first theorem asserts that the interval $]0,1]$ in any suitable partially ordered nonassociative ring consists entirely of invertible elements. The second theorem asserts that if $f$ is a suitably generalized concept of seminorm from a nonassociative ring to a partially ordered nonassociative ring endowed with Frink's interval topology, then under certain conditions, the subset of elements such that $f(1-a) &lt; 1$ consists entirely of invertible elements. Part of the assumption of the second theorem is that of Hausdorff sequential Cauchy-completeness of the first ring under the topology induced by the seminorm $f$ (which takes values in a partially ordered nonassociative ring endowed with Frink's interval topology). Frink's interval topology is an example of a coarse locally-convex $T_1$ topology. Moreover, to our knowledge, the topology induced by a seminorm into a partially ordered nonassociative ring has never been introduced. Some additional original facts, such as the fact that the topology on a nonassociative ring $R_1$ induced by a norm into a totally ordered associative division ring $R_2$ endowed with Frink's interval topology (or equivalently, with the order topology, since the order of $R_2$ is total) is a Hausdorff locally convex quasi-topological group with an additional separate continuity property of the product, are dealt with in the second section ''Preliminaries''.</description>
