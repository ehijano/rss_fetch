      <title>Moire-driven skyrmion family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmion family members, such as skyrmions, bimerons, and skyrmioniums, have been recently observed in quantum, solid-state, water, and magnetic systems. However, it remains challenging and crucial to identify a single platform for observing their coexistence and evolution. Here, we describe a bilayer twisted moire elastic system as a controllable platform for the generation of skyrmion family members with distinct topological charges across different wave systems. Our experimental results further reveal that the twist angle induces a synergistic evolution between lattice symmetry and topological characteristics, enabling the mutual transformation and stable coexistence of different skyrmion family members within a single system. More importantly, we demonstrate that such a platform supports the discontinuous transport of Lamb-wave-induced topological textures, revealing phason-like dynamics within the quasiperiodic structure. This work opens a new avenue for designing all-in-one topological wave devices.</description>

      <title>A damage detection method of plate structure using fan-shaped sensor clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plate structures are widely used in large-scale engineering fields such as aerospace, hull manufacturing, and construction. However, the plate structure is easily damaged during long-term service or when it is impacted by foreign objects. Such a damage may lead to serious safety accidents. Beamforming and L-shaped sensor cluster (LSSC) localization method can be used to locate the damage on the plate. However, when using beamforming or LSSC localization method to locate the damages on plate-like structures, there exists blind area. In this paper, by combining the beamforming and LSSC localization method, a fan-shaped sensor cluster is proposed through arranging five sensors in a fan shape, which can effectively reduce the blind areas. The positions of damages on the plate can be accurately detected by using two groups of fan-shaped sensor clusters and one sensor for transmitting the excitation signal. The feasibility of the fan-shaped sensor cluster localization method is verified through numerical simulations and experiments, and the results are compared with those obtained by using the T-shaped sensor cluster. The results show that the fan-shaped sensor cluster can more accurately identify the damages at different positions. Both simulation and experimental results indicate that the fan-shaped sensor cluster can improve the accuracy of damage location.</description>

      <title>Solar cells and thermoelectric generators as finite-time chemical heat engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper shows a fundamental thermodynamic similarity between thermoelectric and photovoltaic energy converters which, at open circuit, can be represented as isochoric engines generating a finite chemical potential which appears as voltage at the terminals of the device. We show that, allowing for the temperature variation of the Seebeck coefficient, the maximum energy efficiency is intrinsically lower than the Carnot efficiency, as assumed in most of the literature, although more sophisticated strategies may exist to recuperate this loss. At finite current, further losses can be modelled in terms of finite-time thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Electrical Modulation and Probing of Antiferromagnetism in Hybrid Multiferroic Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unique features of ultrafast spin dynamics and the absence of macroscopic magnetization in antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials provide a distinct route towards high-speed magnetic storage devices with low energy consumption and high integration density. However, these advantages also introduce challenges in probing and controlling AFM order, thereby restricting their practical applications. In this study, we demonstrate an all-electric control and probing of the AFM order in heavy metal (HM)/AFM insulator (AFMI) heterostructures on a ferroelectric substrate at room temperature (RT). The AFM order was detected by the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and manipulated by the ferroelectric field effect as well as the piezoelectric effect in heterostructures of Pt/NiO/0.7Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_{3}$--0.3PbTiO$_{3}$ (PMN--PT). The non-volatile control of AFM order gives rise to a 33\% modulation of AHE, which is further evidenced by synchrotron-based X-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD). Combined with the $in$-$situ$ piezoelectric response of AHE, we demonstrate that ferroelectric polarization contributes mainly to the control of the AFM order. Our results are expected to have broader implications for efficient spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Design of Rectangular Waveguide-fed Metasurfaces for Near-Field Shaping using a Coupled Dipole Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the design of rectangular waveguide-excited metasurfaces for near-field shaping using a coupled dipole framework. Waveguide-fed metasurfaces are array-like radiating systems typically constructed from one or more waveguides loaded with a series of subwavelength metamaterial apertures that function as radiators. The use of subwavelength radiating elements distributed across the aperture enables electromagnetic field control with subwavelength precision, offering significant potential for near-field shaping. Leveraging these capabilities, we demonstrate that the near-field patterns of rectangular waveguide-fed metasurfaces can be tailored using the coupled dipole model, which accounts for mutual interactions between metamaterial radiating elements. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach are verified through full-wave simulations and experiments in the X-band.</description>

      <title>Mode-programmable comb spectroscopy enabling non-cooperative computational sensing with single-photon sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency comb spectroscopy provides broadband access to molecular fingerprints with mode-defined spectral resolution. However, its deployment in non-cooperative gas sensing remains challenging because conventional implementations require cooperative reflectors or well-controlled optical returns. Here, we overcome this limitation by introducing a computational sensing scheme based on a mode-programmable optical comb and a high-sensitivity single-pixel detector. In our approach, a two-dimensional disperser and a high-speed digital micromirror device encode individual comb modes, enabling broadband, mode-resolved spectral acquisition without relying on coherent detection. This architecture supports measurements through highly scattering media and from non-cooperative targets while retaining the core advantages of frequency-comb spectroscopy. Our method achieves picometer-level spectral resolution, a 10-nm (1.27-THz) instantaneous bandwidth, single-photon sensitivity down to 10^-4 photons per pulse, and compressed spectral acquisition with 2.5% sampling for &lt;10% reconstruction error. These capabilities establish a powerful platform for diverse gas-sensing applications, including remote environmental monitoring, industrial leak localization, and explosive-threat detection.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale tissue properties and electric fields in brain stimulation - bridging the macroscopic and microscopic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate simulations of electric fields (E-fields) in brain stimulation depend on tissue conductivity representations that link macroscopic assumptions with underlying microscopic tissue structure. Mesoscale conductivity variations can produce meaningful changes in E-fields and neural activation thresholds but remain largely absent from standard macroscopic models. Recent microscopic models have suggested substantial local E-field perturbations and could, in principle, inform mesoscale conductivity. However, the quantitative validity of microscopic models is limited by fixation-related tissue distortion and incomplete extracellular-space reconstruction. We outline approaches that bridge macro- and microscales to derive consistent mesoscale conductivity distributions, providing a foundation for accurate multiscale models of E-fields and neural activation in brain stimulation.</description>

      <title>Fundamental longitudinal electromagnetic (EM) force investigation using DC current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this work was to investigate historical claims of the existence of a longitudinal ElectroMagnetic (EM) force component acting on metallic atomic current elements in a direction parallel to the current flowing through them. This lies outside conventional textbook physics predictions, yet its reality has been indicated previously and if eventually confirmed will have a significant effect on physics theory and many technological applications, especially those involving high current density ( &gt; 10^9 A/m^2) including EM mass drivers such as railguns with liquid metal sliding contacts, flux compression generators and also high energy plasmas including fusion and other energy technologies. The experiment described here is based on the measurement of force on a supported copper armature submerged in a trough containing liquid metal through which constant DC current is passing. The coaxial symmetry of the experiment (CRE-Coaxial Recoil Experiment) was able to limit all net force on the centred armature to the direction of interest, parallel to the current within it. All the experimental data related the measured forces on the armature to the total current flowing through the circuit. Variations were made to the length and location of the armature along the central axis as well as modifications to the liquid metal configuration. Raw and processed results are presented, and an experimental technique is described that revealed strong evidence for the existence of, and discrimination between, axial mechanical contact forces between solid and liquid metal as well as longitudinal EM force. The original EM force law, proposed in 1822 by Amp\`ere, includes a longitudinal component and has been found to be qualitatively consistent with all experiments to date, including these reported findings, and is considered a candidate explanatory theory.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic back-switching phenomenon in SOT-MRAM devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The writing process of SOT-MRAMs is considered deterministic when additional symmetry-breaking factors, such as the application of an external magnetic field aligned with the current, are present. Notably, the write probability exhibits a unique behavior as a function of the current: it drops to zero at high currents or even oscillates with the current. This phenomenon is attributed to back-switching, an intrinsic effect of magnetization reversal driven by spin-orbit torques. A systematic investigation of this back-switching phenomenon is conducted on sub-100 nm CoFeB magnetic pillars positioned at the center of $\beta$-W Hall crosses. Using a statistical approach, the study examines the impact of various parameters, including the amplitude of current pulses and the application of magnetic fields in different directions. The findings reveal that the back-switching phenomenon is not statistically random. Macrospin simulations, employing realistic magnetic parameter values, accurately replicate the experimental observations and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of back-switching. These simulations also explore strategies to mitigate the phenomenon, such as optimizing the shape of the writing pulses. Applying this approach to complete SOT-MRAM single cells achieves a write error rate below $2 \times 10^{-6}$, demonstrating the effectiveness of this strategy in expanding the operational current range for write operations in SOT-MRAMs.</description>

      <title>Strongly confined Mid-infrared to Terahertz Phonon Polaritons in Ultra-thin SrTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phonon polaritons (PhPs) enable subwavelength light control for infrared sensing, imaging, and optoelectronics, but conventional polar materials have narrow Reststrahlen bands, limiting applications. Materials that support PhPs with broad spectral range, strong field confinement, slow group velocity, and high quality factor are therefore needed. Here, using monochromatic electron energy loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope, we demonstrate that ultra-thin SrTiO3 membranes possess the desired properties. Systematic measurements across varying thicknesses reveal two PhP branches with wide spectral dispersion, strong confinement, and anomalously slow group velocities spanning from the mid-infrared to terahertz range. Notably, in 3-nm-thick membranes, these polaritons exhibit unprecedented confinement factors exceeding 500 and group velocities as low as ~ 7 x 10-5c, rivaling the best-performing van der Waals materials. These findings establish perovskite oxide such as SrTiO3 as versatile platforms for tailoring light-matter interactions at the nanoscale, providing critical insights for the design of next-generation photonic devices requiring broadband operation and enhanced optical confinement.</description>

      <title>3D printed waveguides for optogenetics applications: design optimization and optical characterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optogenetics has emerged as a powerful tool for disease modeling, enabling precise control of cellular activities through light stimulation and providing a valuable insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic possibilities. Innovative materials and technologies such as micro-LEDs, optical fibers and micro/nano probes have been developed to allow precise spatial and temporal control of light delivery to target cells. Recent advances in 3D printing have further enhanced optogenetic applications by enabling the fabrication of implantable, customizable, and miniaturized light stimulation systems with high spatial resolution. In this study, we introduce a novel concept of a 3D printed light delivery system for brain organoid stimulation exploring the capabilities of projection microstereolithography (P$\mu$SL). We characterized the optical properties of the high-resolution acrylate-based 3D print resin, i.e., refractive index and extinction coefficient, to evaluate if the light transmission efficiency might limit the performance of the optogenetic stimulation systems. Finite element method simulations were employed to optimize the 3D printed design. An optogenetic setup was developed for optimal light delivery, and initial tests with optogenetically modified cells showed light-induced dopamine release with a stimulation efficiency of 2.8\%, confirming the 3D printed waveguide functionality and guiding future optimization. Our results demonstrate that this light stimulation tool offers strong potential for advancing customizable optogenetic applications.</description>
