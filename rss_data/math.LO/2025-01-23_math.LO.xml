      <title>A short note on model theory of C((t))</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we study C((t)) in the language of valued rings. We show that a definable subset of C((t))n (or in monster model, Mn) is definably compact iff it is closed and unbounded. Then we give some comments on definable groups over C((t)).</description>

      <title>An ordinal analysis of CM and its extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In arXiv:0905.1675, Nik Weaver proposed a novel intuitionistic formal theory of third-order arithmetic as a formalisation of his philosophical position known as mathematical conceptualism. In this paper, we will construct a realisability model from the partial combinatory algebra of $\Sigma^1_1$-definable partial functions and use it to provide an ordinal analysis of this formal theory. Additionally, we will examine possible extensions to this system by adding well-ordering axioms, which are briefly mentioned but never thoroughly studied in Weaver's work. We aim to use the realisability arguments to discuss how much such extensions constitute an increase from the original theory's proof-theoretic strength.</description>

      <title>On the learning power of Friedman-Stanley jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a surprising connection between algorithmic learning of algebraic structures and descriptive set theory has emerged. Following this line of research, we define the learning power of an equivalence relation $E$ on a topological space as the class of isomorphism relations with countably many equivalence classes that are continuously reducible to $E$. In this paper, we describe the learning power of the finite Friedman-Stanley jumps of $=_{\mathbb{N}}$ and $=_{\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}}$, proving that these equivalence relations learn the families of countable structures that are pairwise distinguished by suitable infinitary sentences. Our proof techniques introduce new ideas for assessing the continuous complexity of Borel equivalence relations.</description>

      <title>Definable Obstruction Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A series of recent papers by Bergfalk, Lupini and Panagiotopoulus developed the foundations of a field known as `definable algebraic topology,' in which classical cohomological invariants are enriched by viewing them as groups with a Polish cover. This allows one to apply techniques from descriptive set theory to the study of cohomology theories. In this paper, we will establish a `definable' version of a classical theorem from obstruction theory, and use this to study the potential complexity of the homotopy relation on the space of continuous maps $C(X, |K|)$, where $X$ is a locally compact Polish space, and K is a locally finite countable simplicial complex. We will also characterize the Solecki Groups of the Cech cohomology of X, which are the canonical chain of subgroups with a Polish cover that are least among those of a given complexity.</description>

      <title>Dynamical pair assignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relations between points in the phase space are central to the study of topological dynamical systems. Since many of these relations share common properties, it is natural to study them within a unified framework. To this end, we introduce the concept of \textit{dynamical pair assignments} $\mathcal{P}$.
  We then introduce the notions of a dynamical system being $\mathcal{P}$-full and $\mathcal{P}$-realizable, which generalize several existing concepts in the field like CPE, weak mixing and UPE. Our results establish that the space of $\mathcal{P}$-full systems is always a Borel set, while the space of $\mathcal{P}$-realizable systems is Borel if and only if an associated natural rank is bounded.</description>

      <title>Additivity of derived limits in the Cohen model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07222v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, in the model constructed by adding sufficiently many Cohen reals, derived limits are additive on a large class of systems. This generalizes the work of Jeffrey Bergfalk, Michael Hru\v s\'ak, and Chris Lambie-Hanson which focuses on the system $\mathbf{A}$. In the process, we isolate a partition principle responsible for the vanishing of derived limits on collections of Cohen reals and reframe the propagating trivializations results of Bergfalk, Hru\v s\'ak and Lambie-Hanson as a theorem of ZFC. In light of results of the author, Jeffrey Bergfalk, and Justin Moore, the additivity of derived limits also implies additivity results for strong homology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an $L$-like construction that produces the minimal model of $\mathsf{AD}_\mathbb{R}+$"$\Theta$ is regular". In fact, our construction can produce any model of $\mathsf{AD}^++\mathsf{AD}_\mathbb{R}+V=L(P(\mathbb{R}))$ in which there is no hod mouse with a measurable limit of Woodins.</description>

      <title>Universal Algebra in UniMath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.05952v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present our library for Universal Algebra in the UniMath framework dealing with multi-sorted signatures, their algebras, and the basics for equation systems. We show how to implement term algebras over a signature without resorting to general inductive constructions (currently not allowed in UniMath) still retaining the computational nature of the definition. We prove that our single sorted ground term algebras are instances of homotopy W-types. From this perspective, the library enriches UniMath with a computationally well-behaved implementation of a class of W-types. Moreover, we give neat constructions of the univalent categories of algebras and equational algebras by using the formalism of displayed categories, and show that the term algebra over a signature is the initial object of the category of algebras. Finally, we showcase the computational relevance of our work by sketching some basic examples from algebra and propositional logic.</description>

      <title>Rates of (T-)asymptotic regularity of the generalized Krasnoselskii-Mann-type iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we use proof mining methods to compute rates of ($T$-)asymptotic regularity of the generalized Krasnoselskii-Mann-type iteration associated to a nonexpansive mapping $T:X\to X$ in a uniformly convex normed space $X$. For special choices of the parameter sequences, we obtain quadratic rates.</description>
