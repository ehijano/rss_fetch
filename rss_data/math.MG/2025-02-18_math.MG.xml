      <title>Topological dimension of the Gromov-Hausdorff and Gromov-Prokhorov spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gromov-Hausdorff distance is a dissimilarity metric capturing how far two spaces are from being isometric. The Gromov-Prokhorov distance is a similar notion for metric measure spaces. In this paper, we study the topological dimension of the Gromov-Hausdorff and Gromov-Prokhorov spaces. We show that the dimension of the space of isometry classes of metric spaces with at most $n$ points endowed with the Gromov-Hausdorff distance is $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$, and that of mm-isomorphism classes of metric measure spaces whose support consists of $n$ points is $\frac{(n+2)(n-1)}{2}$. Hence, the spaces of all isometry classes of finite metric spaces and of all mm-isomorphism classes of finite metric measure spaces are strongly countable dimensional. If, instead, the cardinalities are not limited, the spaces are strongly infinite-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Fractional Sobolev paths on Wasserstein spaces and their energy-minimizing particle representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a generalization of Kantorovich's optimal transportation problem. Given a prescribed family of time-dependent probability measures $(\mu_t)$, we aim to find, among all path-continuous stochastic processes whose one-dimensional time marginals coincide with $(\mu_t)$ (if there is any), a process that minimizes a given energy. After discussing a sufficient condition for the energy to ensure the existence of a minimizer, we investigate fractional Sobolev energies. Given a deterministic path $(\mu_t)$ on a $p$-Wasserstein space with fractional Sobolev regularity $W^{\alpha,p}$, where $1/p &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$, we provide conditions under which we prove the existence of a process that minimizes the energy and construct a process that realizes the regularity of $(\mu_t)$. While continuous paths of low regularity on Wasserstein spaces naturally appear in stochastic analysis, they can also arise deterministically as solutions to the continuity equation. This paper is devoted to the deterministic setting to gain some understanding of the required conditions.</description>

      <title>$\ell_{p}$ has nontrivial Euclidean distortion growth when $2&lt;p&lt;4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that if $2 &lt; p &lt; 4$, then every $n$-point subset of $\ell_{p}$ embeds into a Hilbert space with distortion $o(\log n)$, i.e., with distortion that is asymptotically smaller than what Bourgain's embedding theorem provides for arbitrary $n$-point metric spaces. This has been previously unknown for any $2&lt;p&lt;\infty$. We also prove that for every $2&lt;p&lt;\infty$ the largest possible separation modulus of an $n$-point subset of $\ell_{p}$ is bounded from above and from below by positive constant multiples of $\sqrt{\log n}$ which may depend only on $p$.</description>

      <title>Disintegrated optimal transport for metric fiber bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a new two-parameter family of metrics on a subset of Borel probability measures on a general metric fiber bundle, called the $ \textit{disintegrated Monge--Kantorovich metrics}$. This family of metrics contains the classical Monge-Kantorovich metrics, linearized optimal transport distance, and generalizes the sliced and max-sliced Wasserstein metrics. We prove these metrics are complete, separable (except an endpoint case), geodesic spaces, with a dual representation. Additionally, we prove existence and duality for an associated barycenter problem, and provide conditions for uniqueness of the barycenter. These results on barycenter problems for the disintegrated Monge--Kantorovich metrics also yield the corresponding existence, duality, and uniqueness results for classical Monge--Kantorovich barycenters in a wide variety of spaces, including a uniqueness result on any connected, complete Riemannian manifold, with or without boundary; this is the first and only result with absolutely no restriction on the geometry of the manifold (such as on curvatures or injectivity radii). Our results cannot be obtained by applying the theory of $L^q$ maps valued in spaces of probability measures, in fact the $L^q$ map case can be recovered from our results by taking the underlying bundle as a trivial product bundle.</description>

      <title>On rectifiability of Delone sets in intermediate regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we deal with Delone sets and their rectifiability under different classes of regularity. By pursuing techniques developed by Rivi\`ere and Ye, and Aliste-Prieto, Coronel and Gambaudo, we give sufficient conditions for a specific Delone set to be equivalent to the standard lattice by bijections having regularity in between bi-Lipschitz and bi-H\"older-homogeneous. From this criterion, we extend a result of McMullen by showing that, for any dimension $d\geq 1$, there exists a threshold of moduli of continuity $\mathcal{M}_d$, including the class of the H\"{o}lder ones, such that for every $\omega\in\mathcal{M}_d$, any two Delone sets within a certain class in $\mathbb{R}^d$ cannot be distinguished under bi-$\omega$-equivalence. Also, we extend a result due to Aliste, Coronel, and Gambaudo, which establishes that every linearly repetitive Delone set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is rectifiable by extending it to a broader class of repetitive behaviors. Moreover, we show that for the modulus of continuity $\omega(t)=t(\log(1/t))^{1/d}$, every $\omega$-repetitive Delone set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is equivalent to the standard lattice by a bi-$\omega$-homogeneous map. Finally, we address a problem of continuous nature related to the previous ones about finding solutions to the prescribed volume form equation in intermediate regularity, thereby extending the results of Rivi\`ere and Ye.</description>

      <title>Topological Stability and Latschev-type Reconstruction Theorems for $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{CAT}(\kappa)}$ Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of homotopy-type reconstruction of compact shapes $X\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ that are $\mathrm{CAT}(\kappa)$ in the intrinsic length metric. The reconstructed spaces are in the form of Vietoris--Rips complexes computed from a compact sample $S$, Hausdorff--close to the unknown shape $X$. Instead of the Euclidean metric on the sample, our reconstruction technique leverages a path-based metric to compute these complexes. As naturally emerging in the framework of reconstruction, we also study the Gromov--Hausdorff topological stability and finiteness problem for general compact $\mathrm{CAT}(\kappa)$ spaces. Our techniques provide novel sampling conditions alternative to the existing and commonly used techniques using weak feature size and $\mu$--reach. In particular, we introduce a new parameter, called the {\em restricted distortion}, which is a generalization of the well-known global distortion of embedding. We show examples of Euclidean subspaces, for which the known parameters such as the reach, $\mu$--reach and weak features size vanish, whereas the restricted distortion is finite, making our reconstruction results applicable for such spaces.</description>

      <title>Left-Invariant Riemannian Distances on Higher-Rank Sol-Type Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the results of ($\textit{Groups, Geom. Dyn.}$, forthcoming) to describe the split left-invariant Riemannian distances on higher-rank Sol-type groups $G=\mathbf{N}\rtimes \mathbb{R}^k$. We show that the rough isometry type of such a distance is determined by a specific restriction of the metric to $\mathbb{R}^k$, and therefore the space of rough similarity types of distances is parameterized by the symmetric space $SL_k(\mathbb{R})/SO_k(\mathbb{R})$. In order to prove this result, we describe a family of uniformly roughly geodesic paths, which arise by way of the new technique of $\textit{Euclidean curve surgery}$.</description>
