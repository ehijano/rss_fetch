      <title>Thermal and microclimatic behavior of OASIS schoolyard paving materials</title>

Abstract: As part of its Resilience Strategy, the City of Paris' OASIS program aims to contribute ot its adaptation to heatwaves and climate change by transforming schoolyards into climate shelters, namely via desealing and greening. In this context, a variety of alternative pavement materials have been proposed to replace the initial schoolyard pavement, composed of an asphalt sidewalk structure. In the context of the EU-funded ERDF UIA OASIS project, the thermal performance of these alternative materials and their impact in terms of urban cooling was explored. To this aim, five samples of reference and innovative schoolyard pavements were studied in the lab under heat-wave conditions. Alternative green, biosourced, recycled and reflective pavement solutions were compared to standard fine-aggregate asphalt concrete. Their performance was evaluated with regards to their contribution to the urban heat island phenomenon and to pedestrian heat stress, account for the typical use schedule of schoolyards. Green and biosourced materials were found to perform well for both indicators, while the standard and recycled solutions had poor UHI performance but had limited negative effects on daytime heat stress. The reflective pavement had better UHI performance but had high radiosity during daytime which can negatively affect pedestrian heat stress.</description>

      <title>The Jive Verification System and its Transformative Impact on Weather Forecasting Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18429v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forecast verification is critical for continuous improvement in meteorological organizations. The Jive verification system was originally developed to assess the accuracy of public weather forecasts issued by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. It started as a research project in 2015 and gradually evolved to be a Bureau operational verification system in 2022. The system includes daily verification dashboards for forecasters to visualize recent forecast performance and "Evidence Targeted Automation" dashboards for exploring the performance of competing forecast systems. Additionally, Jive includes a Jupyter Notebook server with the Jive Python library which supports research experiments, case studies, and the development of new verification metrics and tools. This paper describes the Jive verification system and how it helped bring verification to the forefront at the Bureau of Meteorology, leading to more accurate, streamlined forecasts. Jive has provided evidence to support forecast automation decisions and has helped to understand the evolving role of meteorologists in the forecast process. It has given operational meteorologists tools for evaluating forecast processes, including identifying when and how manual interventions lead to superior predictions. Work on Jive led to new verification science, including novel metrics that are decision-focused, including diagnostics for extreme conditions. Jive also provided the Bureau with an enterprise-wide data analysis environment and has prompted a clarification of forecast definitions. These collective impacts have resulted in more accurate forecasts, ultimately benefiting society, and building trust with forecast users. These positive outcomes highlight the importance of meteorological organizations investing in verification science and technology.</description>
