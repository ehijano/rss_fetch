      <title>Dual-Functional Cerium Oxide Nanoparticles with Antioxidant and DNase I activities to Prevent and degrade Neutrophil Extracellular Traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrophils play a central role in immunothrombosis through the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a process known as NETosis. Upon stimulation, neutrophils release decondensed chromatin structures enriched with proteolytic enzymes, which contribute to thrombus formation. NETosis is critically dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS), making redox regulation a key point of intervention. The intrinsic redox cycling of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CNPs) imparts self-regenerating antioxidant properties suitable for modulating neutrophil-driven oxidative stress. To address both the prevention and clearance of NETs, we developed dual-functional CNPs conjugated with DNase I. These engineered nanoparticles were efficiently internalized by neutrophils, reduced intracellular ROS levels, and inhibited NETs formation. In addition, DNase I-functionalized CNPs degraded pre-formed NETs. This dual-action strategy offers a promising nanotherapeutic platform for mitigating NETs-associated thrombotic pathologies. Ongoing studies aim to enhance thrombus targeting and assess in vivo efficacy.</description>

      <title>Glassy dynamics in active epithelia emerge from an interplay of mechano-chemical feedback and crowding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glassy dynamics in active biological cells remain a subject of debate, as cellular activity rarely slows enough for true glassy features to emerge. In this study, we address this paradox of glassy dynamics in epithelial cells by integrating experimental observations with an active vertex model. We demonstrate that while crowding is essential, it is not sufficient for glassy dynamics to emerge. A mechanochemical feedback loop (MCFL), mediated by cell shape changes through the contractile actomyosin network, is also required to drive glass transition in dense epithelial tissues, as revealed via a crosstalk between actin-based cell clustering and dynamic heterogeneity in the experiments. Incorporating the MCFL into the vertex model reveals that glassy dynamics can emerge even at high cellular activity if the strength of the MCFL remains high. We show that the MCFL can counteract cell division-induced fluidisation and enable glassy dynamics to emerge through active cell-to-cell communication. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the existence of novel collective mechanochemical oscillations that arise from the crosstalk of two MCFLs. Together, we demonstrate that an interplay between crowding and active mechanochemical feedback enables the emergence of glass-like traits and collective biochemical oscillations in epithelial tissues with active cell-cell contacts.</description>

      <title>A dispersal recolonisation 3D biofilm in vitro model based on co-assembled peptide amphiphiles and clinical wound fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chronic wound infections are sustained by dynamic 3D biofilm cycles involving maturation, dispersal, and recolonisation, yet existing in vitro models fail to reproduce these temporal and structural complexities. Here, we report a strategy that co-assembles a designed protease-inhibitory peptide amphiphile (PA-GF) with patient-derived wound fluid (WF) to reconstruct the complete biofilm life cycle in vitro. The PA-GF sequence incorporates an HWGF motif capable of binding and inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), thereby preserving the integrity of recolonised biofilms under proteolytic stress. Co-assembling with WF generated a living material that faithfully mimicked the biochemical and mechanical microenvironment of chronic wounds, supporting the formation of stable 3D biofilms capable of dispersal and recolonisation. Furthermore, we established a controllable polymicrobial infection model and validated its translational relevance through antibiotic susceptibility profiling and spatial microbiological analyses. Notably, the antibiotic response patterns of the PA/WF-derived biofilms closely mirrored those observed in a rat wound infection in vivo model. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that co-assembling living materials can recapitulate the nutritional composition, 3D architecture, and recolonisation dynamics of in vivo infectious biofilms, offering a physiologically relevant and customisable platform for investigating chronic wound infections and accelerating anti-biofilm drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Coarse-graining nonequilibrium diffusions with Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate nonequilibrium steady-state dynamics in both continuous- and discrete-state stochastic processes. Our analysis focuses on planar diffusion dynamics and their coarse-grained approximations by discrete-state Markov chains. Using finite-volume approximations, we derive an approximate master equation directly from the underlying diffusion and show that this discretisation preserves key features of the nonequilibrium steady-state. In particular, we show that the entropy production rate of the approximation converges as the number of discrete states goes to the limit. These results are illustrated with analytically solvable diffusions and numerical experiments on nonlinear processes, demonstrating how this approach can be used to explore the dependence of entropy production rate on model parameters. Finally, we address the problem of inferring discrete-state Markov models from continuous stochastic trajectories. We show that discrete-state models significantly underestimate the true entropy production rate. However, we also show that they can provide tests to determine if a stationary planar diffusion is out of equilibrium. This property is illustrated with both simulated data and empirical trajectories from schooling fish.</description>

      <title>Physics of droplet regulation in biological cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13639v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Droplet formation has emerged as an essential concept for the spatiotemporal organisation of biomolecules in cells. However, classical descriptions of droplet dynamics based on passive liquid-liquid phase separation cannot capture the complex situations inside cells. This review discusses three general aspects that are crucial in cells: (i) biomolecules are diverse and individually complex, implying that cellular droplets posses complex internal behaviour, e.g., in terms of their material properties; (ii) the cellular environment contains many solid-like structures that droplets can wet; (iii) cells are alive and use fuel to drive processes out of equilibrium. We illustrate how these principles control droplet nucleation, growth, position, and count to unveil possible regulatory mechanisms in biological cells and other applications of phase separation.</description>

      <title>Noise-driven odd elastic waves in living chiral active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral active matter is predicted to exhibit odd elasticity, with nontraditional elastic response arising from a combination of chirality, being out of equilibrium, and the presence of nonreciprocal interactions. One of the resulting phenomena is the possible occurrence of odd elastic waves in overdamped systems, although its experimental realization still remains elusive. Here we show that in overdamped active systems, noise is required to generate persistent elastic waves. In the chiral crystalline phase of active matter, such as that found recently in populations of swimming starfish embryos, the noise arises from the self-driving of active particles and their mutual collisions, a key factor that has been missing in previous studies. We identify the criterion for the occurrence of noise-driven odd elastic waves and construct the corresponding phase diagram, which is also applicable to general chiral active crystals. Our results can be used to predict the experimental conditions for achieving a transition to self-sustained elastic waves in overdamped active systems.</description>

      <title>Local entropy production rate of run-and-tumble particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the local entropy production rate and the local entropy flow in active systems composed of non-interacting run-and-tumble particles in a thermal bath. After providing generic time-dependend expressions, we focus on the stationary regime. Remarkably, in this regime the two entropies are equal and depend only on the distribution function and its spatial derivatives. We discuss in details two case studies, relevant to real situations. First, we analyze the case of space dependent speed,describing photokinetic bacteria, cosidering two different shapes of the speed, piecewise constant and sinusoidal. Finally, we investigate the case of external force fields, focusing on harmonic and linear potentials, which allow analytical treatment. In all investigated cases, we compare exact and approximated analytical results with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Octopus-like Reaching Motion: A Perspective Inspired by Whipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stereotypical reaching motion of the octopus arm has drawn growing attention for its efficient control of a highly deformable body. Previous studies suggest that its characteristic bend propagation may share underlying principles with the dynamics of a whip. This work investigates whether whip-like passive dynamics in water can reproduce the kinematic features observed in biological reaching and their similarities and differences. Platform-based whipping tests were performed in water and air while systematically varying material stiffness and driving speed. Image-based quantification revealed that the Ecoflex Gel 2 arm driven at 150 rpm (motor speed) reproduced curvature propagation similar to that observed in octopus reaching. However, its bend-point velocity decreased monotonically rather than exhibiting the biological bell-shaped profile, confirming that the octopus reaching movement is not merely a passive whipping behavior. The absence of propagation in air further highlights the critical role of the surrounding medium in forming octopus-like reaching motion. This study provides a new perspective for understand biological reaching movement, and offers a potential platform for future hydrodynamic research.</description>
