      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we present the thermal neutron counter from the ELI Gamma Above Neutron Threshold setup recently implemented at the Extreme Light Infrastructure - Nuclear Physics. The main goals of the detector array are presented, as well as the mechanical design, electronics, and the performance of the detectors. In addition, we have performed Geant4 and MCNP simulations monoenergetic neutrons and measurements with typical neutron sources. Finally, we show the performance of the array as a whole and outline the analysis procedure for experimental measurements by reproducing the ${}^{13}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\mathrm{n}_{0}){}^{16}\mathrm{O}$ cross-section branching ratios.</description>

      <title>The SWEET project: probing sugar crystals for direct dark matter searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several experiments searching for direct dark matter interactions aim to achieve unprecedented sensitivity to sub-GeV/c$^2$ dark matter masses through elastic scattering with nuclei in various target crystals at cryogenic temperatures. Hydrogen-rich materials, such as organic compounds, are promising candidates for the detection of sub-GeV/c$^2$ dark matter due to favourable kinematics.
  In this paper, we present for the first time results obtained with a sugar-based phonon detector employing sucrose crystals ($\mathbf{C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}}$), capable of particle detection with associated scintillation light.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and Characterization of X-ray TES Detectors Based on Annular AlMn Alloy Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AlMn alloy flms are widely fabricated into superconducting transition edge sensors (TESs) for the detection of cosmic microwave background radiation. However, the application in X-ray or gamma-ray detection based on AlMn TES is rarely reported. In this study, X-ray TES detectors based on unique annular AlMn flms are devel-oped. The fabrication processes of TES detectors are introduced in detail. The char-acteristics of three TES samples are evaluated in a dilution refrigerator. The results demonstrate that the I-V characteristics of the three annular TES detectors are highly consistent. The TES detector with the smallest absorber achieved the best energy resolution of 11.0 eV @ 5.9 keV, which is inferior to the theoretical value. The dis-crepancy is mainly attributed to the larger readout electronics noise than expected.</description>

      <title>Effects of Neutron Irradiation on LGADs with Broad Multiplication Layer and varied Carbon-Enriched Doses: A Study on Timing Performance and Gain Deterioration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this radiation tolerance study, Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs) with a carbon-enriched broad and shallow multiplication layer were examined in comparison to identical non-carbonated LGADs. Manufactured at IMB-CNM, the sensors underwent neutron irradiation at the TRIGRA reactor in Ljubljana, reaching a fluence of $2.5 \times 10^{15}n_{eq}cm^{-2}$. The results revealed a smaller deactivation of Boron and improved resistance to radiation in carbonated LGADs. The study demonstrated the potential benefits of carbon enrichment in mitigating radiation damage effects, particularly the acceptor removal mechanism, reducing the acceptor removal constant by more than a factor of two. Additionally, time resolution and collected charge degradation due to irradiation were observed, with carbonated samples exhibiting better radiation tolerance. A noise analysis focused on baseline noise and thermally generated pulses showed the presence of spurious thermal-generated pulses attributed to a excessive small distance between the gain layer end and the p-stop implant at the periphery of the pad for the characterized LGAD design; however, the operation performance of the devices was unaffected.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Characterization of All DC/RF Routing Wafers for Detector Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Simons Observatory (SO) is a cosmic microwave background experiment with over 67,000 polarization-sensitive transition-edge sensor (TES) detectors currently installed for use in observations and plans to increase the total detector count to ${\sim}$98,000 detectors with the Advanced SO upgrade. The TES arrays are packaged into Universal Focal-Plane Modules (UFMs), which also contain the multiplexing readout circuit. Within a readout module, a DC/RF routing wafer provides a cold interface between the detectors and the readout multiplexing chips. Each routing wafer hosts twelve bias lines, which contain the ${\sim}$400 ${\mu}{\Omega}$ shunt resistors that are part of the TES bias circuitry. More than 70 routing wafers have been fabricated and tested both at room temperature and 100 mK before integration into UFMs. The lab measurements for all screened wafers have been compiled to show the distribution of measured average shunt resistance Rsh for each bias line, both across bias lines on a single routing wafer and across all routing wafers. The mean average shunt resistance for all wafers was found to be 396 ${\mu}{\Omega}$ with a standard deviation of 16 ${\mu}{\Omega}$, or ${\sim}$4%. For each wafer, we note good uniformity of average Rsh between bias lines, with a slight downward trend with increasing distance from the center of the wafer. The fabrication data collected at room temperature shows agreement with the cryogenic measurements of Rsh distribution.</description>

      <title>Full-Field Brillouin Microscopy with a Scanning Fabry-Perot Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brillouin microscopy is an emerging optical technique for probing mechanical properties with submicron resolution, offering fully non-contact, label-free operation. Despite its unique capabilities, broader adoption has been limited by slow acquisition speeds, particularly in systems based on scanning Fabry-Perot interferometers (FPIs). Based on prior implementations, FPIs have typically been considered too slow for practical imaging, particularly when both spatial and spectral precision are required. Here, we demonstrate that a standard multi-pass tandem FPI can be repurposed for full-field Brillouin imaging when operated in a spectral filtering mode. Combined with light-sheet illumination for uniform, low-dose excitation, this configuration enables rapid, spatially resolved acquisition of Brillouin spectra. By restricting scanning to a narrow frequency range around the Brillouin peak, we acquired a full 2D image within one minute, achieving millisecond-scale single pixel dwell times and micrometer-scale spatial resolution. The system uniquely supports Brillouin emission imaging at selected frequency shifts, a capability not available with other spontaneous Brillouin implementations. Results from synthetic and biological specimens demonstrate how existing FPI-based setups can be extended to full-field imaging and outline a pathway toward future dedicated FPI instruments optimized for high-speed, high-contrast Brillouin microscopy.</description>

      <title>Practical considerations for assignment of photon numbers with SNSPDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) can enable photon-number resolution (PNR) based on accurate measurements of the detector's response time to few-photon optical pulses. In this work we investigate the impact of the optical pulse shape and duration on the accuracy of this method. We find that Gaussian temporal pulse shapes yield cleaner arrival-time histograms, and thus more accurate PNR, compared to bandpass-filtered pulses of equal bandwidth. For low system jitter and an optical pulse duration comparable to the other jitter contributions, photon numbers can be discriminated in our system with a commercial SNSPD. At 60 ps optical pulse duration, photon-number discrimination is significantly reduced. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of using the correct arrival-time histogram model when analyzing photon-number assignment. Using exponentially-modified Gaussian (EMG) distributions, instead of the commonly used Gaussian distributions, we can more accurately determine photon-number misidentification probabilities. Finally, we reconstruct the positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) of the detector, revealing sharp features which indicate the intrinsic PNR capabilities.</description>

      <title>Vanishing Acts: Quantifying Black Hole Formation with the DSNB Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) created by stellar core-collapses throughout cosmic history is on the verge of discovery, with SK-Gd showing early deviations from the background expectation and JUNO starting to take data. However, the interpretation of early DSNB data will face significant challenges due to degeneracies between astrophysical parameters and uncertainties in supernova neutrino modeling. We explore how complementary astronomical observations can break these degeneracies and, in this context, we investigate whether early DSNB observations can constrain invisible supernovae, which have no optical emission but are powerful neutrino sources before being swallowed by a forming black hole. Leveraging the differences in the spectra between invisible and visible supernovae, we estimate the sensitivity of 1) detecting the existence of invisible supernovae, and 2) determining the fraction of invisible supernovae. Finally, we discuss how these conclusions depend on the spectral parameters of the black hole-forming component.</description>

      <title>Scintillating properties of Cs${_2}$ZrCl${_6}$ crystals in the temperature range of 5-300 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new comprehensive study on the Cs${_2}$ZrCl${_6}$ (CZC) crystal scintillating properties under different types of irradiation was performed over a wide temperature range from 5 to 300 K. The light yield (LY) at room temperature (RT), measured under irradiation by 662 keV $\gamma$ quanta of $^{137}$Cs, was evaluated to be 53,300$\pm$4,700 photons/MeV corresponding to approximately 71% of its estimated absolute value. The maximum light emission was observed in the temperature interval 135-165 K, where the LY reached 56,900 photons/MeV and 19,700 photons/MeV for $\gamma$ quanta and $\alpha$ particles, respectively. The quenching factor (QF) for $\alpha$ particles increases smoothly from QF = 0.30 at RT to QF = 0.36 at 135 K. The shape of scintillation pulses induced by $\alpha$ particles is characterized by three time-constants (0.3, 2.5 and 11.8 $\mu$s at RT), whereas the average pulse of $\gamma$ induced events is characterized by two time-constants (1.3 and 11.5 $\mu$s at RT). At the same time, scintillating properties and pulse-shape discrimination capability of the CZC exhibit an acute deterioration at temperatures below 135 K. The optimal operating conditions to maximize the scintillating performance of undoped CZC crystals are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) experiments have transformed our understanding of the Universe by enabling direct observations of compact object mergers and other astrophysical phenomena. This chapter reviews the concepts of GW detectors, such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, and describes their operating principles, data acquisition and analysis techniques, and some of the methods used to extract source properties. The scientific impact of GW observations is discussed as well, including contributions to astrophysics, tests of general relativity, and cosmology. We also examine the role of multimessenger astronomy and the complementarity between different GW detectors and with other astroparticle experiments. Finally, we outline future prospects with next-generation detectors, like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, and space-based missions.</description>

      <title>Precision measurement and modelling of the threshold-free 210Pb {\beta} spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beta decay is a fundamental process that governs nuclear stability and serves as a sensitive probe of the weak interaction and possible physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. However, precise measurements of complete $\beta$ decay spectra, particularly at low energies, remain experimentally and theoretically challenging. Here we report a high-precision, threshold-free measurement of the full $\beta$ decay spectrum of 210Pb to excited states of 210Bi, using a transition-edge sensor (TES)-based micro-calorimeter. This approach enables the detection of $\beta$ particle energies from 0 keV up to their endpoint by coincidence summing with subsequent de-excitation energy, thereby eliminating reconstruction artifacts near zero energy that have traditionally limited low-energy spectral accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first complete, high-precision $\beta$ decay spectrum from 0 keV. The data resolve theoretical uncertainties associated with the atomic quantum exchange (AQE) effect. An accompanying ab initio theoretical framework, incorporating atomic, leptonic, and nuclear components, predicts a statistically significant (7.2 {$\sigma$}) enhancement in $\beta$ emission probability near zero energy, in agreement with the measurement and in contrast to models that omit AQE corrections. These results provide a new benchmark for $\beta$ decay theory at low energies, deepen our understanding of the weak interaction, and establish a critical foundation for searches for new physics, including dark matter interactions and precision studies of neutrinos.</description>
