      <title>Quantum Maslov classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a construction of ``quantum Maslov characteristic classes'', generalizing to higher dimensional cycles the Hu-Lalonde-Seidel morphism. We also state a conjecture extending this to an $A _{\infty}$ functor from the exact path category of the space of monotone Lagrangian branes to the Fukaya category. Quantum Maslov classes are used here for the study of Hofer geometry of Lagrangian equators in $S ^{2}$, giving a rigidity phenomenon for the Hofer metric 2-systole, which stands in contrast to the flexibility phenomenon of the closely related Hofer metric girth studied by Rauch ~\cite{cite_Itamar}, in the same context of Lagrangian equators of $S ^{2}$. More applications appear in ~\cite{cite_SavelyevGlobalFukayacategoryII}.</description>

      <title>Morse theory of loop spaces and Hecke algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a smooth closed $n$-manifold $M$ and a $\kappa$-tuple of basepoints $\boldsymbol{q}\subset M$, we define a Morse-type $A_\infty$-algebra $CM_{-*}(\Omega(M,\boldsymbol{q}))$, called the based multiloop $A_\infty$-algebra, as a graded generalization of the braid skein algebra due to Morton and Samuelson. For example, when $M=T^2$ the braid skein algebra is the Type A double affine Hecke algebra (DAHA). The $A_\infty$-operations couple Morse gradient trees on a based loop space with Chas-Sullivan type string operations. We show that, after a certain "base change", $CM_{-*}(\Omega(M,\boldsymbol{q}))$ is $A_\infty$-equivalent to the wrapped higher-dimensional Heegaard Floer $A_\infty$-algebra of $\kappa$ disjoint cotangent fibers which was studied in the work of Honda, Colin, and Tian. We also compute the based multiloop $A_\infty$-algebra for $M=S^2$, which we can regard as a derived Hecke algebra of the $2$-sphere.</description>

      <title>Small symplectic $4$-manifolds via contact gluing and some applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a streamlined procedure for constructing small symplectic 4-manifolds via contact gluing, based on a technique invented by David Gay around 2000. We also give a few applications, ranging from embeddings of singular Lagrangian RP^2s to realizing an infinite family of lens spaces as hypersurfaces of contact type in a symplectic Hirzebruch surface. Furthermore, our investigation on S^1-invariant contact structures also suggests there should be a universal upper bound for the self-intersection of a rational unicuspidal curve with one Puiseux pair in any algebraic surface (the bound depends only on the singularity).</description>

      <title>Continuous and Discrete Asymptotic Behaviours of the J-function of a Fano Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a condition on the coefficients of a cohomology-valued power series, which we call ``asymptotically Mittag-Leffler''. We show that if the $J$-function of a Fano manifold is asymptotically Mittag-Leffler, then it has the exponential growth as $t\to +\infty$. This provides an alternative method to compute the principal asymptotic class of a Fano manifold using the coefficients of $J$-function. We also verify that the $J$-function of the projective space is asymptotically Mittag-Leffler, and the property of having an asymptotically Mittag-Leffler $J$-function is preserved when taking product and hypersurface.</description>

      <title>Micro-local analysis of contact Anosov flows and band structure of the Ruelle spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.11196v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a geometrical micro-local analysis of contact Anosov flow, such as geodesic flow on negatively curved manifold. This micro-local analysis is based on wave-packet transform discussed in arXiv:1706.09307. The main result is that the transfer operator is well approximated (in the high frequency limit) by the quantization of the Hamiltonian flow naturally defined from the contact Anosov flow and extended to some vector bundle over the symplectization set. This gives a few important consequences: the discrete eigenvalues of the generator of transfer operators, called Ruelle spectrum, are structured into vertical bands. If the right-most band is isolated from the others, most of the Ruelle spectrum in it concentrate along a line parallel to the imaginary axis and, further, the density satisfies a Weyl law as the imaginary part tend to infinity. Some of these results were announced in arXiv:1301.5525.</description>
