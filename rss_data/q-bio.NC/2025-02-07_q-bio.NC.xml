      <title>Immersion for AI: Immersive Learning with Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reflects upon what Immersion can mean from the perspective of an Artificial Intelligence (AI). Applying the lens of immersive learning theory, it seeks to understand whether this new perspective supports ways for AI participation in cognitive ecologies. By treating AI as a participant rather than a tool, it explores what other participants (humans and other AIs) need to consider in environments where AI can meaningfully engage and contribute to the cognitive ecology, and what the implications are for designing such learning environments. Drawing from the three conceptual dimensions of immersion - System, Narrative, and Agency - this work reinterprets AIs in immersive learning contexts. It outlines practical implications for designing learning environments where AIs are surrounded by external digital services, can interpret a narrative of origins, changes, and structural developments in data, and dynamically respond, making operational and tactical decisions that shape human-AI collaboration. Finally, this work suggests how these insights might influence the future of AI training, proposing that immersive learning theory can inform the development of AIs capable of evolving beyond static models. This paper paves the way for understanding AI as an immersive learner and participant in evolving human-AI cognitive ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Elucidation of the Concept of Consciousness from the Theory of Non-Human Communication Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article focuses on elucidating the concept of consciousness from a relational and post-phenomenological theory of non-human communication agents (ANHC). Specifically, we explore the contributions of Thomas Metzinger s Self Model Theory, Katherine Hayles conceptualizations of non-conscious cognitive processes centered on knowledge processing phenomena shared between biological and technical systems and Lenore and Manuel Blum s theoretical perspective on computation, which defines consciousness as an emergent phenomenon of complex computational systems, arising from the appropriate organization of their inorganic materiality. Building on interactions with non-human cognitive agents, among other factors, the explainability of sociotechnical systems challenges the humanistic common sense of modern philosophy and science. This critical integration of various approaches ultimately questions other concepts associated with consciousness, such as autonomy, freedom, and mutual responsibility. The aim is to contribute to a necessary discussion for designing new frameworks of understanding that pave the way toward an ethical and pragmatic approach to addressing contemporary challenges in the design, regulation, and interaction with ANHC. Such frameworks, in turn, enable a more inclusive and relational understanding of agency in an interconnected world.</description>

      <title>Revisiting convolutive blind source separation for identifying spiking motor neuron activity: From theory to practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: Identifying the activity of motor neurons (MNs) non-invasively is possible by decomposing signals from muscles, e.g., surface electromyography (EMG) or ultrasound. The theoretical background of MN identification is convolutive blind source separation (cBSS), and different algorithms have been developed and validated. Yet, the existence and identifiability of inverse solutions and the corresponding estimation errors are not fully understood. Further, the guidelines for selecting appropriate parameters are often built on empirical observations, limiting the translation to clinical applications and other modalities. Approach: We revisited the cBSS model for MN identification, augmented it with new theoretical insights and derived a framework that can predict the existence of inverse solutions. This framework allows the quantification of estimation errors due to the imperfect inversion of the motor unit action potentials (MUAP), noise sources, and the ill-conditioning of the inverse problem. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we used computer simulations. Main results: (1) Increasing the similarity of MUAPs or correlation between spike trains increases the bias for detecting high amplitude MUs. (2) The optimal objective function depends on the expected spike amplitude, spike amplitude statistics and the amplitude of background spikes. (3) There is some wiggle room for MN detection given non-stationary MUAPs. (4) There is no connection between MUAP duration and extension factor, in contrast to previous guidelines. (5) Source quality metrics like the silhouette score (SIL) or the pulse-to-noise ratio (PNR) are highly correlated with a source's objective function output. (6) SIL is superior to PNR. Significance: These findings will guide cBSS algorithm developments tailored to MN identification and clinical application translation.</description>

      <title>A rodent paradigm for studying perceptual decisions under asymmetric reward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.12278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real-life decisions involve both perceptual processes and weighing the consequences of different actions. However, the neural mechanisms underlying perceptual decisions have typically been examined separately from those underlying economic decisions. Here, we trained rats to make choices informed by both perceptual and value cues on a trial-by-trial basis. As in typical perceptual tasks, subjects were rewarded for correctly categorizing a tone relative to a learned threshold. To add an economic component, a light indicated, on each trial, whether correct responses to one side gave higher rewards than correct responses to the other side. As such, on trials with some perceptual uncertainty, it could be worthwhile to choose the unlikely option, if it had higher expected value. We found that, despite subjects sensitivity to the frequency of the cue and the reward sizes, their behavior was not optimal: subjects tended to shift their choices in a stimulus-independent way following light flashes. Moreover, subjects tended to under-shift, which could be interpreted as being over-confident in their perceptual beliefs or as being risk-averse.</description>

      <title>Spatial Contrast: A Vintage Retinal Model of Color Vision Produces the Center-Surround Opponent Color Phenomena; The Model Was Previously Shown To Produce Mutually Exclusive Opponent Colors by a Different Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The on-off phenomena of opponent colors in center-surround may be the best-known facts of retinal processing of information. Apparently, however, no explicit model has been proposed that shows how neurons can be connected to produce the center-surround phenomena. Here it is shown that a previous simple model of color vision can produce these phenomena, including the detection of edge orientation and motion famously discovered by Hubel and Wiesel. The model was previously shown to produce major phenomena central to color vision, including mutually exclusive opponent colors.
  Although the opponencies of mutually exclusive colors and center-surround involve the same color pairs, red-green and blue-yellow, the model produces them by two different mechanisms. Perceptions of two colors are mutually exclusive because only one cone type can have the most, or least, absorption of photons. Two colors have the on-off opponency of center-surround because they have the same network designs up to the ganglion cells, with the inputs reversed there. On-off opponencies with different colors are possible, but natural selection evidently did not choose them.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic motivation as constrained entropy maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: "Intrinsic motivation" refers to the capacity for intelligent systems to be motivated endogenously, i.e. by features of agential architecture itself rather than by learned associations between action and reward. This paper views active inference, empowerment, and other formal accounts of intrinsic motivation as variations on the theme of constrained maximum entropy inference, providing a general perspective on intrinsic motivation complementary to existing frameworks. The connection between free energy and empowerment noted in previous literature is further explored, and it is argued that the maximum-occupancy approach in practice incorporates an implicit model-evidence constraint.</description>

      <title>BLEND: Behavior-guided Neural Population Dynamics Modeling via Privileged Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling the nonlinear dynamics of neuronal populations represents a key pursuit in computational neuroscience. Recent research has increasingly focused on jointly modeling neural activity and behavior to unravel their interconnections. Despite significant efforts, these approaches often necessitate either intricate model designs or oversimplified assumptions. Given the frequent absence of perfectly paired neural-behavioral datasets in real-world scenarios when deploying these models, a critical yet understudied research question emerges: how to develop a model that performs well using only neural activity as input at inference, while benefiting from the insights gained from behavioral signals during training?
  To this end, we propose BLEND, the behavior-guided neural population dynamics modeling framework via privileged knowledge distillation. By considering behavior as privileged information, we train a teacher model that takes both behavior observations (privileged features) and neural activities (regular features) as inputs. A student model is then distilled using only neural activity. Unlike existing methods, our framework is model-agnostic and avoids making strong assumptions about the relationship between behavior and neural activity. This allows BLEND to enhance existing neural dynamics modeling architectures without developing specialized models from scratch. Extensive experiments across neural population activity modeling and transcriptomic neuron identity prediction tasks demonstrate strong capabilities of BLEND, reporting over 50% improvement in behavioral decoding and over 15% improvement in transcriptomic neuron identity prediction after behavior-guided distillation. Furthermore, we empirically explore various behavior-guided distillation strategies within the BLEND framework and present a comprehensive analysis of effectiveness and implications for model performance.</description>
