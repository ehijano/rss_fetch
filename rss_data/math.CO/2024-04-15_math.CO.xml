      <title>Monochromatic Polynomial sumset structures on $\mathbb{N}$: an ultrafilter proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, using machinery's from Ergodic theory, Z. Lian, and R. Xiao proved if $P$ is any polynomial with no constant term, then for every finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$, there exists two infinite subsets $B,C$ of $\mathbb{N}$ such that the set $\{P(b)+P(c):b\in B, c\in C\}$ is monochromatic. In this article we improve their result by proving that instead of taking such polynomials we can choose any function $f$ having the property that $f(\mathbb{N})\setminus \mathbb{N}$ is finite. We use ultrafilter techniques to prove our result.</description>

      <title>The thirty-seven measures on permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work with Harman, we introduced a notion of measure on a class of finite relational structures. In this note, we consider measures on the class of permutations, i.e., finite sets with two total orders. Using a method of Nekrasov, we show that there are exactly 37 measures. Two of these measures lead to a new pre-Tannakian tensor category.</description>

      <title>Complexity of the game connected domination problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connected domination game is a variation of the domination game where the played vertices must form a connected subgraph at all stages of the game. In this paper we prove that deciding whether the game connected domination number is smaller than a given integer is PSPACE-complete using log-space reductions for both Dominator- and Staller-start connected domination game.</description>

      <title>Link patterns and elliptic Hecke algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the following three families of geometric objects: Schubert varieties in flag manifolds, matrix Schubert varieties, and Borel orbits of 2-nilpotent matrices. The first family is governed by permutations, the second by partial permutations, and the last one by "link patterns". These geometric objects admit characteristic classes in equivariant elliptic cohomology obtained within the framework created by Borisov and Libgober. We construct a Hecke-type algebra for computing elliptic classes and extend its action to include partial permutations and linking patterns. A uniform point of view facilitates a better understanding of duality.</description>

      <title>Strong Resolving Graphs of Clean Graphs of Commutative Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a ring with unity. The clean graph $\text{Cl}(R)$ of a ring $R$ is the simple undirected graph whose vertices are of the form $(e,u)$, where $e$ is an idempotent element and $u$ is a unit of the ring $R$ and two vertices $(e,u)$, $(f,v)$ of $\text{Cl}(R)$ are adjacent if and only if $ef = fe =0$ or $uv = vu=1$. In this manuscript, for a commutative ring $R$, first we obtain the strong resolving graph of $\text{Cl}(R)$ and its independence number. Using them, we determine the strong metric dimension of the clean graph of an arbitrary commutative ring. As an application, we compute the strong metric dimension of $\text{Cl}(R)$, where $R$ is a commutative Artinian ring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by Berkovich's nine $q$-binomial identities involving the Legendre symbol $(\frac{d}{3})$, we establish a unified form of $q$-binomial identities of this type through a combinatorial approach. This unified form includes Berkovich's nine identities as special cases. Many such identities can be also deduced from this unified form.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics of Complex Maximal Determinant Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This doctoral thesis covers several topics related to the construction and study of maximal determinant matrices with complex entries. The first three chapters are devoted to number-theoretic tools to prove the non-solvability of Gram matrix equations over certain fields, with a focus on combinatorial applications. Chapter 4 gives a survey on Butson-type Hadamard matrices, and shows an improved lower bound on primes $p$ for the existence of $BH(12p, p)$ matrices. Chapter 5 contains the main contributions of the thesis, where the maximal determinant problem for matrices over the m-th roots of unity is discussed, and where new upper and lower bounds, as well as constructions at small orders, are given. Chapter 6 studies maximal determinant matrices over association schemes. Chapter 7 gives an application of design theory to privacy in communications, and it is connected to the rest of the thesis by the use of the theory of quadratic forms.</description>

      <title>Off-diagonally symmetric domino tilings of the Aztec diamond of odd order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the enumeration of off-diagonally symmetric domino tilings of odd-order Aztec diamonds in two directions: (1) with one boundary defect, and (2) with maximally-many zeroes on the diagonal. In the first direction, we prove a symmetry property which states that the numbers of off-diagonally symmetric domino tilings of the Aztec diamond of order $2n-1$ are equal when the boundary defect is at the $k$th position and the $(2n-k)$th position on the boundary, respectively. This symmetry property proves a special case of a recent conjecture by Behrend, Fischer, and Koutschan.
  In the second direction, a Pfaffian formula is obtained for the number of ``nearly'' off-diagonally symmetric domino tilings of odd-order Aztec diamonds, where the entries of the Pfaffian satisfy a simple recurrence relation. The numbers of domino tilings mentioned in the above two directions do not seem to have a simple product formula, but we show that these numbers satisfy simple matrix equations in which the entries of the matrix are given by Delannoy numbers. The proof of these results involves the method of non-intersecting lattice paths and a modification of Stembridge's Pfaffian formula for families of non-intersecting lattice paths. Finally, we propose conjectures concerning the log-concavity and asymptotic behavior of the number of off-diagonally symmetric domino tilings of odd-order Aztec diamonds.</description>

      <title>Tur\'an numbers for non-bipartite graphs and applications to spectral extremal problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph family $\mathcal{H}$ with $\min_{H\in \mathcal{H}}\chi(H)=r+1\geq 3$. Let ${\rm ex}(n,\mathcal{H})$ and ${\rm spex}(n,\mathcal{H})$ be the maximum number of edges and the maximum spectral radius of the adjacency matrix over all $\mathcal{H}$-free graphs of order $n$, respectively. Denote by ${\rm EX}(n,\mathcal{H})$ (resp. ${\rm SPEX}(n,\mathcal{H})$) the set of extremal graphs with respect to ${\rm ex}(n,\mathcal{H})$ (resp. ${\rm spex}(n,\mathcal{H})$).
  In this paper, we use a decomposition family defined by Simonovits to give a characterization of which graph families $\mathcal{H}$ satisfy ${\rm ex}(n,\mathcal{H})&lt;e(T_{n,r})+\lfloor \frac{n}{2r} \rfloor$. Furthermore, we completely determine ${\rm EX}\big(n,\mathbb{G}(F_1,\ldots,F_k)\big)$ for $n$ sufficiently large, where $\mathbb{G}(F_1,\ldots,F_k)$ denotes a finite graph family which consists of $k$ edge-disjoint $(r+1)$-chromatic color-critical graphs $F_1,\ldots,F_k$. This result strengthens a theorem of Gy\H{o}ri, who settled the case that $F_1=\cdots =F_k = K_{r+1}$.
  Wang, Kang and Xue %[J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 159 (2023) 20--41] proved that ${\rm SPEX}(n,H)\subseteq {\rm EX}(n,H)$ for $n$ sufficiently large and any graph $H$ with ${\rm ex}(n,H)=e(T_{n,r})+O(1)$. As an application of our first theorem, we show that ${\rm SPEX}(n,\mathcal{H})\subseteq {\rm EX}(n,\mathcal{H})$ for $n$ sufficiently large and any finite family $\mathcal{H}$ with ${\rm ex}(n,\mathcal{H})&lt;e(T_{n,r})+\lfloor \frac{n}{2r}\rfloor$. As an application of our second theorem we completely determine ${\rm SPEX}\big(n,\mathbb{G}(F_1,\ldots,F_k)\big)$ for $n$ sufficiently large.
  Finally, related problems are proposed for further research.</description>

      <title>Quiver matroids -- Matroid morphisms, quiver Grassmannians, their Euler characteristics and $\mathbb{F}_1$-points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce morphisms for matroids with coefficients (in the sense of Baker and Bowler) and quiver matroids. We investigate their basic properties, such as functoriality, duality, minors and cryptomorphic characterizations in terms of vectors, circuits and bases (a.k.a. Grassmann-Pl\"ucker functions). We generalize quiver matroids to quiver matroid bundles and construct their moduli space, which is an $\mathbb{F}_1$-analogue of a complex quiver Grassmannian. Eventually we introduce a suitable interpretation of $\mathbb{F}_1$-points for these moduli spaces, so that in 'nice' cases their number is equal to the Euler characteristic of the associated complex quiver Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial upper bounds for the smallest eigenvalue of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph, and let $\lambda(G)$ denote the smallest eigenvalue of $G$. First, we provide an upper bound for $\lambda(G)$ based on induced bipartite subgraphs of $G$. Consequently, we extract two other upper bounds, one relying on the average degrees of induced bipartite subgraphs and a more explicit one in terms of the chromatic number and the independence number of $G$. In particular, motivated by our bounds, we introduce two graph invariants that are of interest on their own. Finally, special attention goes to the investigation of the sharpness of our bounds in various classes of graphs as well as the comparison with an existing well-known upper bound.</description>

      <title>Every subcubic graph is packing $(1,1,2,2,3)$-colorable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a sequence $S=(s_1, \ldots, s_k)$ of non-decreasing integers, a packing $S$-coloring of a graph $G$ is a partition of its vertex set $V(G)$ into $V_1, \ldots, V_k$ such that for every pair of distinct vertices $u,v \in V_i$, where $1 \le i \le k$, the distance between $u$ and $v$ is at least $s_i+1$. The packing chromatic number, $\chi_p(G)$, of a graph $G$ is the smallest integer $k$ such that $G$ has a packing $(1,2, \ldots, k)$-coloring. Gastineau and Togni asked an open question ``Is it true that the $1$-subdivision ($D(G)$) of any subcubic graph $G$ has packing chromatic number at most $5$?'' and later Bre\v{s}ar, Klav\v{z}ar, Rall, and Wash conjectured that it is true.
  In this paper, we prove that every subcubic graph has a packing $(1,1,2,2,3)$-coloring and it is sharp due to the existence of subcubic graphs that are not packing $(1,1,2,2)$-colorable. As a corollary of our result, $\chi_p(D(G)) \le 6$ for every subcubic graph $G$, improving a previous bound ($8$) due to Balogh, Kostochka, and Liu in 2019, and we are now just one step away from fully solving the conjecture.</description>

      <title>The Norton-balanced condition for $Q$-polynomial distance-regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ denote a $Q$-polynomial distance-regular graph, with vertex set $X$ and diameter $D\geq 3$.
  The standard module $V$ has a basis $\lbrace {\hat x} \vert x \in X\rbrace$, where ${\hat x}$ denotes column $x$ of the identity matrix $I \in {\rm Mat}_X(\mathbb C)$. Let $E$ denote a $Q$-polynomial primitive idempotent of $\Gamma$. The eigenspace $EV$ is spanned by the vectors
  $\lbrace E {\hat x} \vert x \in X\rbrace$.
  It was previously known that these vectors satisfy a condition called the balanced set condition. In this paper, we introduce a variation on the balanced set condition called the Norton-balanced condition. The Norton-balanced condition involves the Norton algebra product on $EV$. We define $\Gamma$ to be Norton-balanced whenever $\Gamma$ has a $Q$-polynomial primitive idempotent $E$ such that the set $\lbrace E {\hat x} \vert x \in X\rbrace$ is Norton-balanced.
  We show that $\Gamma$ is Norton-balanced in the following cases:
  (i)
  $\Gamma$ is bipartite; (ii) $\Gamma$ is almost bipartite; (iii) $\Gamma$ is dual-bipartite; (iv) $\Gamma$ is almost dual-bipartite; (v) $\Gamma$ is tight; (vi)
  $\Gamma$ is a Hamming graph; (vii) $\Gamma$ is a Johnson graph; (viii) $\Gamma$ is the Grassmann graph $J_q(2D,D)$;
  (ix) $\Gamma$ is a halved bipartite dual-polar graph; (x) $\Gamma$ is a halved Hemmeter graph; (xi) $\Gamma$ is a halved hypercube; (xii) $\Gamma$ is a folded-half hypercube;
  (xiii) $\Gamma$ has $q$-Racah type and affords a spin model.
  Some theoretical results about the Norton-balanced condition are obtained, and some open problems are given.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1977, Yu.V. Matiyasevich proposed a formula expressing the chromatic polynomial of an arbitrary graph as a linear combination of flow polynomials of subgraphs of the original graph. In this paper, we prove that this representation is a particular case of one (easily verifiable) formula, namely, the representation of the characteristic polynomial of an arbitrary matroid as a linear combination of characteristic polynomials of dual matroids. As applications, we consider an explicit expression for the flow polynomial of a complete graph and a formula for the characteristic polynomial of the matroid dual to the matroid of the projective geometry over a finite field. We prove, in particular, that their major coefficients are defined by the beginning of a certain row in the Pascal triangle. We study in detail the connection with convolution formulas and other results for Tutte polynomials.</description>

      <title>Colour-permuting automorphisms of complete Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a (finite or infinite) group, and let $K_G = \mathrm{Cay} ( G;G \smallsetminus \{1\} )$ be the complete graph with vertex set $G$, considered as a Cayley graph of $G$. Being a Cayley graph, it has a natural edge-colouring by sets of the form $\{s, s^{-1}\}$ for $s \in G$. We prove that every colour-permuting automorphism of $K_G$ is an affine map, unless $G \cong Q_8 \times B$, where $Q_8$ is the quaternion group of order $8$, and $B$ is an abelian group, such that $b^2$ is trivial for all $b \in B$.
  We also prove (without any restriction on $G$) that every colour-permuting automorphism of $K_G$ is the composition of a group automorphism and a colour-preserving graph automorphism. This was conjectured by D.P.Byrne, M.J.Donner, and T.Q.Sibley in 2013.</description>

This result allows us to characterize the cographs which are quasi-threshold graphs with two main $\mathbf{Q}$-eigenvalues. In addition, we describe all the quasi-threshold graphs belonging to the subclass of generalized core-satellite graphs with $k \geq 2$ main $\mathbf{Q}$-eigenvalues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is said to be crossing-critical if $cr(G-e)&lt; cr(G)$ for every edge $e$ of $G$, where $cr(G)$ is the crossing number of $G$. Richter and Thomassen [Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B 58 (1993), 217-224] constructed an infinite family of 4-regular crossing-critical graphs with crossing number $3$. In this article, we present a new infinite family of 4-regular crossing-critical graphs.</description>

      <title>Improved Exponent for Marton's Conjecture in $\mathbb{F}_2^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A conjecture of Marton, widely known as the polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa conjecture, was recently proved by Gowers, Green, Manners and Tao for any bounded-torsion Abelian group $G$. In this paper we show a few simple modifications that improve their bound in $G=\mathbb{F}_2^n$. Specifically, for $G=\mathbb{F}_2^n$, they proved that any set $A\subseteq G$ with $|A+A|\le K|A|$ can be covered by at most $2K^C$ cosets of a subgroup $H$ of $G$ of cardinality at most $|A|$, with $C=12$. In this paper we prove the same statement for $C=9$.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of exponential random graphs and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a seminal paper in 2009, Borcea, Br\"and\'en, and Liggett described the connection between probability distributions and the geometry of their generating polynomials. Namely, they characterized that stable generating polynomials correspond to distributions with the strongest form of negative dependence. This motivates us to investigate other distributions that can have this property, and our focus is on random graph models. In this article, we will lay the groundwork to investigate Markov random graphs, and more generally exponential random graph models (ERGMs), from this geometric perspective. In particular, by determining when their corresponding generating polynomials are either stable and/or Lorentzian. The Lorentzian property was first described in 2020 by Br\"and\'en and Huh and independently by Anari, Oveis-Gharan, and Vinzant where the latter group called it the completely log-concave property. The theory of stable polynomials predates this, and is commonly thought of as the multivariate notion of real-rootedness. Br\"and\'en and Huh proved that stable polynomials are always Lorentzian. Although it is a strong condition, verifying stability is not always feasible. We will characterize when certain classes of Markov random graphs are stable and when they are only Lorentzian. We then shift our attention to applications of these properties to real-world networks.</description>

      <title>A stability result for almost perfect matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n,k,s$ be three integers and $\beta$ be a sufficiently small positive number such that $k\geq 3$, $0&lt;1/n\ll \beta\ll 1/k$ and $ks+k\leq n\leq (1+\beta)ks+k-2$. A $k$-graph is called non-trivial if it has no isolated vertex. In this paper, we determine the maximum number of edges in a non-trivial $k$-graph with $n$ vertices and matching number at most $s$. This result confirms a conjecture proposed by Frankl (On non-trivial families without a perfect matching, \emph{European J. Combin.}, \textbf{84} (2020), 103044) for the case when $s$ is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>A $q$-analog of the Stirling-Eulerian Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1974, Carlitz and Scoville introduced the Stirling-Eulerian polynomial $A_n(x,y|\alpha,\beta)$ as the enumerator of permutations by descents, ascents, left-to-right maxima and right-to-left maxima. Recently, Ji considered a refinement of $A_n(x,y|\alpha,\beta)$, denoted $P_n(u_1,u_2,u_3,u_4|\alpha,\beta)$, which is the enumerator of permutations by valleys, peaks, double ascents, double descents, left-to-right maxima and right-to-left maxima. Using Chen's context-free grammar calculus, Ji proved a formula for the generating function of $P_n(u_1,u_2,u_3,u_4|\alpha,\beta)$, generalizing the work of Carlitz and Scoville. Ji's formula has many nice consequences, one of which is an intriguing $\gamma$-positivity expansion for $A_n(x,y|\alpha,\beta)$. In this paper, we prove a $q$-analog of Ji's formula by using Gessel's $q$-compositional formula and provide a combinatorial approach to her $\gamma$-positivity expansion of $A_n(x,y|\alpha,\beta)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we consider tame $ SL_3 $-friezes that arise by specializing a cluster of Pl\"ucker variables in the coordinate ring of the Grassmannian $ \mathscr{G}(3,n) $ to $ 1 $. We show how to calculate arbitrary entries of such friezes from the cluster in question. Let $ \mathscr{F} $ be such a cluster. We study the set $ \mathscr{F}_x $ of cluster variables in $ \mathscr{F} $ that share a given index $ x $ and derive a structure Theorem for $ \mathscr{F}_x $. These sets prove central to calculating the first and last non-trivial rows of the frieze. After that, simple recursive formulas can be used to calculate all remaining entries.</description>

Abstract: By means of the generating function method, a linear recurrence relation is explicitly resolved. The solution is expressed in terms of the Stirling numbers of both the first and the second kind. Two remarkable pairs of combinatorial identities are established as applications, that contain some well-known convolution formulae on Stirling numbers as special cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a combinatorial formula for the coproduct in a Hopf algebra of decorated multi-indices which recently appeared in the literature, which can be briefly described as the graded dual of the enveloping algebra of the free Novikov algebra generated by the set of decorations. Similarly to what happens for the Hopf algebra of rooted forests, the formula can be written in terms of admissible cuts.</description>

      <title>Divisible design graphs from the symplectic graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A divisible design graph is a graph whose adjacency matrix is an incidence matrix of a (group) divisible design. Divisible design graphs were introduced in 2011 as a generalization of $(v,k,\lambda)$-graphs. Here we describe four new infinite families that can be obtained from the symplectic strongly regular graph $Sp(2e,q)$ ($q$ odd, $e\geq 2$) by modifying the set of edges. To achieve this we need two kinds of spreads in $PG(2e-1,q)$ with respect to the associated symplectic form: the symplectic spread consisting of totally isotropic subspaces and, when $e=2$, a special spread consisting of lines which are not totally isotropic. Existence of symplectic spreads is known, but the construction of a special spread for every odd prime power $q$ is a major result of this paper. We have included relevant back ground from finite geometry, and when $q=3,5$ and $7$ we worked out all possible special spreads.</description>

      <title>Perfect matchings and spanning trees: squarishness, bijections and independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number which is either the square of an integer or two times the square of an integer is called squarish. There are two main results in the literature on graphs whose number of perfect matchings is squarish: one due to Jockusch (for planar graphs invariant under rotation by 90 degrees) and the other due to the second author (concerning planar graphs with two perpendicular symmetry axes). We present in this paper a new such class, consisting of certain planar graphs that are only required to have one symmetry axis. Our proof relies on a natural bijection between the set of perfect matchings of two closely related (but not isomorphic!) families of graphs, which is interesting in its own right. The rephrasing of this bijection in terms of spanning trees turns out to be the most natural way to present this result.
  The basic move in the construction of the above bijection (which we call gliding) can also be used to extend Temperley's classical bijection between spanning trees of a planar graph and perfect matchings of a closely related graph. We present this, and as an application we answer an open question posed by Corteel, Huang and Krattenthaler.
  We also discuss another dimer bijection (used in the proof of the second author's result mentioned above), and deduce from a refinement of it new results for spanning trees. These include a finitary version of an independence result for the uniform spanning tree on $\Z^2$ due to Johansson, a counterpart of it, and a bijective proof of an independence result on edge inclusions in the uniform spanning tree on $\Z^2$ due to Lyons.</description>

Abstract: Let $(s_2(n))_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ be a $0,1$-sequence such that, for any natural number $n$, $s_2(n) = 1$ if and only if $n$ is a sum of two squares. In a recent article, Tahay proved that the sequence $(s_2(n))_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ is not $k$-automatic for any integer $k$, and asked if this sequence can be morphic. In this note, we give a negative answer to this question.</description>

      <title>The Fine-Grained Complexity of Graph Homomorphism Problems: Towards the Okrasa and Rz\k{a}\.zewski Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we are interested in the fine-grained complexity of deciding whether there is a homomorphism from an input graph $G$ to a fixed graph $H$ (the $H$-Coloring problem). The starting point is that these problems can be viewed as constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), and that (partial) polymorphisms of binary relations are of paramount importance in the study of complexity classes of such CSPs.
  Thus, we first investigate the expressivity of binary symmetric relations $E_H$ and their corresponding (partial) polymorphisms pPol($E_H$). For irreflexive graphs we observe that there is no pair of graphs $H$ and $H'$ such that pPol($E_H$) $\subseteq$ pPol($E_{H'}$), unless $E_{H'}= \emptyset$ or $H =H'$. More generally we show the existence of an $n$-ary relation $R$ whose partial polymorphisms strictly subsume those of $H$ and such that CSP($R$) is NP-complete if and only if $H$ contains an odd cycle of length at most $n$. Motivated by this we also describe the sets of total polymorphisms of nontrivial cliques, odd cycles, as well as certain cores, and we give an algebraic characterization of projective cores. As a by-product, we settle the Okrasa and Rz\k{a}\.zewski conjecture for all graphs of at most 7 vertices.</description>

Abstract: A graph $G$ is a PCG if there exists an edge-weighted tree such that each leaf of the tree is a vertex of the graph, and there is an edge $\{ x, y \}$ in $G$ if and only if the weight of the path in the tree connecting $x$ and $y$ lies within a given interval. PCGs have different applications in phylogenetics and have been lately generalized to multi-interval-PCGs. In this paper we define two new generalizations of the PCG class, namely k-OR-PCGs and k-AND-PCGs, that are the classes of graphs that can be expressed as union and intersection, respectively, of $k$ PCGs. The problems we consider can be also described in terms of the \emph{covering number} and the \emph{intersection dimension} of a graph with respect to the PCG class. In this paper we investigate how the classes of PCG, multi-interval-PCG, OR-PCG and AND-PCG are related to each other and to other graph classes known in the literature. In particular, we provide upper bounds on the minimum $k$ for which an arbitrary graph $G$ belongs to k-interval-PCG, k-OR-PCG and k-AND-PCG classes. Furthermore, for particular graph classes, we improve these general bounds. Moreover, we show that, for every integer $k$, there exists a bipartite graph that is not in the k-interval-PCG class, proving that there is no finite $k$ for which the k-interval-PCG class contains all the graphs. Finally, we use a Ramsey theory argument to show that for any $k$, there exist graphs that are not in k-AND-PCG, and graphs that are not in k-OR-PCG.</description>

      <title>Achieving the Highest Possible Elo Rating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.14567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elo rating systems measure the approximate skill of each competitor in a game or sport. A competitor's rating increases when they win and decreases when they lose. Increasing one's rating can be difficult work; one must hone their skills and consistently beat the competition. Alternatively, with enough money you can rig the outcome of games to boost your rating. This paper poses a natural question for Elo rating systems: say you manage to get together $n$ people (including yourself) and acquire enough money to rig $k$ games. How high can you get your rating, asymptotically in $k$? In this setting, the people you gathered aren't very interested in the game, and will only play if you pay them to. This paper resolves the question for $n=2$ up to constant additive error, and provide close upper and lower bounds for all other $n$, including for $n$ growing arbitrarily with $k$. There is a phase transition at $n=k^{1/3}$: there is a huge increase in the highest possible Elo rating from $n=2$ to $n=k^{1/3}$, but (depending on the particular Elo system used) little-to-no increase for any higher $n$. Past the transition point $n&gt;k^{1/3}$, the highest possible Elo is at least $\Theta(k^{1/3})$. The corresponding upper bound depends on the particular system used, but for the standard Elo system, is $\Theta(k^{1/3}\log(k)^{1/3})$.</description>

Abstract: The classical Heawood inequality states that if the complete graph $K_n$ on $n$ vertices is embeddable in the sphere with $g$ handles, then $g \ge\dfrac{(n-3)(n-4)}{12}$. A higher-dimensional analogue of the Heawood inequality is the K\"uhnel conjecture. In a simplified form it states that for every integer $k&gt;0$ there is $c_k&gt;0$ such that if the union of $k$-faces of $n$-simplex embeds into the connected sum of $g$ copies of the Cartesian product $S^k\times S^k$ of two $k$-dimensional spheres, then $g\ge c_k n^{k+1}$. For $k&gt;1$ only linear estimates were known. We present a quadratic estimate $g\ge c_k n^2$. The proof is based on beautiful and fruitful interplay between geometric topology, combinatorics and linear algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that product-free sets of the free group over a finite alphabet have maximum density $1/2$ with respect to the natural measure that assigns total weight one to each set of irreducible words of a given size. This confirms a conjecture of Leader, Letzter, Narayanan and Walters. In more general terms, we actually prove that strongly $k$-product-free sets have maximum density $1/k$ in terms of the said measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $Y_{3,2}$ be the 3-graph with two edges intersecting in two vertices. We prove that every 3-graph $ H $ on $ n $ vertices with at least $ \max \left \{ \binom{4\alpha n}{3}, \binom{n}{3}-\binom{n-\alpha n}{3} \right \}+o(n^3) $ edges contains a $Y_{3,2}$-tiling covering more than $ 4\alpha n$ vertices, for sufficiently large $ n $ and $0&lt;\alpha&lt; 1/4$. The bound on the number of edges is asymptotically best possible and solves a conjecture of the authors for 3-graphs that generalizes the Matching Conjecture of Erd\H{o}s.</description>

      <title>Alon-Tarsi Number of Some Regular Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04531v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Alon-Tarsi number of a polynomial is a parameter related to the exponents of its monomials. For graphs, their Alon-Tarsi number is the Alon-Tarsi number of their graph polynomials. As such, it provides an upper bound on their choice and online choice numbers. In this paper, we obtain the Alon-Tarsi number of some complete multipartite graphs, line graphs of some complete graphs of even order, and line graphs of some other regular graphs.</description>

      <title>The zero forcing numbers and propagation times of gear graphs and helm graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero forcing is a dynamic coloring process on graphs. Initially, each vertex of a graph is assigned a color of either blue or white, and then a process begins by which blue vertices force white vertices to become blue. The zero forcing number is the cardinality of the smallest set of initially blue vertices which can force the entire graph to become blue, and the propagation time is the minimum number of steps in such a zero forcing process. In this paper we will determine the zero forcing numbers and propagation times of two infinite classes of graphs called gear graphs and helm graphs.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds for the bracketing number of orthants or revisiting an algorithm of Thi\'{e}mard to compute bounds for the star discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We improve the best known upper bound for the bracketing number of $d$-dimensional axis-parallel boxes anchored in $0$ (or, put differently, of lower left orthants intersected with the $d$-dimensional unit cube $[0,1]^d$). More precisely, we provide a better upper bound for the cardinality of an algorithmic bracketing cover construction due to Eric Thi\'emard, which forms the core of his algorithm to approximate the star discrepancy of arbitrary point sets from [E. Thi\'emard, An algorithm to compute bounds for the star discrepancy, J.~Complexity 17 (2001), 850 -- 880].
  Moreover, the new upper bound for the bracketing number of anchored axis-parallel boxes yields an improved upper bound for the bracketing number of arbitrary axis-parallel boxes in $[0,1]^d$.
  In our upper bounds all constants are fully explicit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An $n$-vertex graph $G$ is a $C$-expander if $|N(X)|\geq C|X|$ for every $X\subseteq V(G)$ with $|X|&lt; n/2C$ and there is an edge between every two disjoint sets of at least $n/2C$ vertices. We show that there is some constant $C&gt;0$ for which every $C$-expander is Hamiltonian. In particular, this implies the well known conjecture of Krivelevich and Sudakov from 2003 on Hamilton cycles in $(n,d,\lambda)$-graphs. This completes a long line of research on the Hamiltonicity of sparse graphs, and has many applications, including to the Hamiltonicity of random Cayley graphs.</description>

      <title>Stability of graph pairs involving cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph pair $(\Gamma, \Sigma)$ is called stable if $\aut(\Gamma)\times\aut(\Sigma)$ is isomorphic to $\aut(\Gamma\times\Sigma)$ and unstable otherwise, where $\Gamma\times\Sigma$ is the direct product of $\Gamma$ and $\Sigma$. A graph is called $R$-thin if distinct vertices have different neighbourhoods. $\Gamma$ and $\Sigma$ are said to be coprime if there is no nontrivial graph $\Delta$ such that $\Gamma \cong \Gamma_1 \times \Delta$ and $\Sigma \cong \Sigma_1 \times \Delta$ for some graphs $\Gamma_1$ and $\Sigma_1$. An unstable graph pair $(\Gamma, \Sigma)$ is called nontrivially unstable if $\Gamma$ and $\Sigma$ are $R$-thin connected coprime graphs and at least one of them is non-bipartite. This paper contributes to the study of the stability of graph pairs with a focus on the case when $\Sigma = C_n$ is a cycle. We give two sufficient conditions for $(\Gamma, C_n)$ to be nontrivially unstable, where $n \ne 4$ and $\Gamma$ is an $R$-thin connected graph. In the case when $\Gamma$ is an $R$-thin connected non-bipartite graph, we obtain the following results: (i) if $(\Gamma, K_2)$ is unstable, then $(\Gamma, C_{n})$ is unstable for every even integer $n \geq 4$; (ii) if an even integer $n \ge 6$ is compatible with $\Gamma$ in some sense, then $(\Gamma, C_{n})$ is nontrivially unstable if and only if $(\Gamma, K_2)$ is unstable; (iii) if there is an even integer $n \ge 6$ compatible with $\Gamma$ such that $(\Gamma, C_{n})$ is nontrivially unstable, then $(\Gamma, C_{m})$ is unstable for all even integers $m \ge 6$. We also prove that if $\Gamma$ is an $R$-thin connected graph and $n \ge 3$ is an odd integer compatible with $\Gamma$, then $(\Gamma, C_{n})$ is stable.</description>

      <title>e-injective coloring: injective and 2-distance colorings conjectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An injective coloring of a given graph G = (V, E) is a vertex coloring of G such that any two vertices with common neighbor receive distinct colors. An e-injective coloring of a graph G is a vertex coloring of G such that any two vertices with common edge neighbor receive distinct colors; in the other words, if u and v are the end of a path P4 in a graph G, then they are assigned with different labels. With this new definition, we want to take a review at injective coloring of a graph from the new point of view. For this purpose, we will have a comparison between e-injective coloring with usual coloring, injective coloring, and 2-distance coloring. As well, we review the conjectures raised so far in the literature of injective coloring and 2-distance coloring, from the new approach, e-injective coloring. Finally, we precisely investigate the e-injective coloring of trees, join of two graphs, a family of standard graphs, grid graphs, cylinder graphs and tori graphs.</description>

      <title>The absence of monochromatic triangle implies various properly colored spanning trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09082v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An edge-colored graph $G$ is called properly colored if every two adjacent edges are assigned different colors. A monochromatic triangle is a cycle of length 3 with all the edges having the same color. Given a tree $T_0$, let $\mathcal{T}(n,T_0)$ be the collection of $n$-vertex trees that are subdivisions of $T_0$. It is conjectured that for each fixed tree $T_0$, there is a function $f(T_0)$ such that for each integer $n\geq f(T_0)$ and each $T\in \mathcal{T}(n,T_0)$, every edge-colored complete graph $K_n$ without containing monochromatic triangle must contain a properly colored copy of $T$. We confirm the conjecture in the case that $T_0$ is a star. A weaker version of the above conjecture is also obtained. Moreover, to get a nice quantitative estimation of $f(T_0)$ when $T_0$ is a star requires determining the constraint Ramsey number of a monochromatic triangle and a rainbow star, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the Eulerian polynomial is the Hilbert series of the cohomology of the permutahedral variety. Stanley obtained a formula showing that the cohomology carries a permutation representation of $\mathfrak{S}_n$. We answer a question of Stembridge on finding an explicit permutation basis of this cohomology. We observe that the Feichtner-Yuzvinsky basis for the Chow ring of the Boolean matroid is such a permutation basis, and then we construct an $\mathfrak{S}_n$-equivariant bijection between this basis and codes introduced by Stembridge, thereby giving a combinatorial proof of Stanley's formula. We obtain an analogous result for the stellahedral variety. We find a permutation basis of the permutation representation its cohomology carries. This involves the augmented Chow ring of a matroid introduced by Braden, Huh, Matherne, Proudfoot and Wang. Along the way, we obtain a general result on augmented Chow rings (which was also independently obtained by Eur) asserting that augmented Chow rings of matroids are actually Chow rings in the sense of Feichtner and Yuzvinsky. In the last part of the paper, we study enumerative aspects of the permutahedra and the stellohedra related to these permutation bases.</description>

All the estimates are dimension free with the best possible exponents. We discuss applications to various related problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A skew corner is a triple of points in $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ of the form $(x,y), (x, y + a)$ and $(x + a, y')$. Pratt posed the following question: how large can a set $A \subseteq [n] \times [n]$ be, provided it contains no non-trivial skew corner (i.e. one for which $a\not=0$)? We prove that $|A| \leq \exp(- c\log^c n) n^2$, for an absolute constant $c &gt; 0$, which, along with a construction of Beker, essentially resolves Pratt's question.
  Our argument is represents a two-dimensional variant of the method of Kelley and Meka, which they used to prove Behrend-type bounds in Roth's theorem. A very similar result was obtained independently and simultaneously by Jaber, Lovett and Ostuni.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by applications to matrix multiplication algorithms, Pratt asked (ITCS'24) how large a subset of $[n] \times [n]$ could be without containing a skew-corner: three points $(x,y), (x,y+h),(x+h,y')$ with $h \ne 0$. We prove any skew corner-free set has size at most $\exp(-\Omega(\log^{1/12} n))\cdot n^2$, nearly matching the best known lower bound of $\exp(-O(\sqrt{\log n}))\cdot n^2$ by Beker (arXiv'24). Our techniques generalize those of Kelley and Meka's recent breakthrough on three-term arithmetic progression (FOCS'23), answering a question of Beker (arXiv'24). We note that a similar bound was obtained concurrently and independently by Mili\'cevi\'c (arXiv'24).</description>

Frobenius' result states that for $|q|&lt;1$, $\lim_{q\to 1}(1-q)\sum_{n\geq 1} f(n) q^n $ is equal to the average value $\lim_{N\to \infty}$ $\frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=1}^{N}f(k)$ of the sequence $\{f(n)\}$ as $n\to \infty$, if the average value exists.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05618v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to make a connection between tropical geometry, representations of quantum affine algebras, and scattering amplitudes in physics. The connection allows us to study important and difficult questions in these areas:
  (1) We give a systematic construction of prime modules (including prime non-real modules) of quantum affine algebras using tropical geometry. We also introduce new objects which generalize positive tropical Grassmannians.
  (2) We propose a generalization of Grassmannian string integrals in physics, in which the integrand is no longer a finite, but rather an infinite product indexed by prime modules of a quantum affine algebra. We give a general formula of $u$-variables using prime tableaux (corresponding to prime modules of quantum affine algebras of type $A$) and Auslander-Reiten quivers of Grassmannian cluster categories.
  (3) We study limit $g$-vectors of cluster algebras. This is another way to obtain prime non-real modules of quantum affine algebras systematically. Using limit $g$-vectors, we construct new examples of non-real modules of quantum affine algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine two natural operations to create numerical semigroups. We say that a numerical semigroup $\mathcal{S}$ is $k$-normalescent if it is the projection of the set of integer points in a $k$-dimensional polyhedral cone, and we say that $\mathcal{S}$ is a $k$-quotient if it is the quotient of a numerical semigroup with $k$ generators. We prove that all $k$-quotients are $k$-normalescent, and although the converse is false in general, we prove that the projection of the set of integer points in a cone with $k$ extreme rays (possibly lying in a dimension smaller than $k$) is a $k$-quotient. The discrete geometric perspective of studying cones is useful for studying $k$-quotients: in particular, we use it to prove that the sum of a $k_1$-quotient and a $k_2$-quotient is a $(k_1+k_2)$-quotient. In addition, we prove several results about when a numerical semigroup is not $k$-normalescent.</description>

      <title>A Serre spectral sequence for the moduli space of tropical curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct, for all $g\geq 2$ and $n\geq 0$, a spectral sequence of rational $S_n$-representations which computes the $S_n$-equivariant reduced rational cohomology of the tropical moduli spaces of curves $\Delta_{g,n}$ in terms of compactly supported cohomology groups of configuration spaces of $n$ points on graphs of genus $g$. Using the canonical $S_n$-equivariant isomorphisms $\widetilde{H}^{i-1}(\Delta_{g,n};\mathbb{Q}) \cong W_0 H^i_c(\mathcal{M}_{g,n};\mathbb{Q})$, we calculate the weight $0$, compactly supported rational cohomology of the moduli spaces $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ in the range $g=3$ and $n\leq 9$, with partial computations available for $n\leq 13$.</description>

      <title>A short proof of an identity related to Type IV superorthogonality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a much shorter but even more powerful proof of an algebraic identity, which can be used to establish the direct and the converse inequality under Type IV superorthogonality. As an application, we obtain the optimal order of the formal constant in the direct inequality. This order turns out to be also sharp for Type III superorthogonality. When $p\geq 2$, our result recovers the optimal order of the constant in the Burkholder-Gundy inequality in martingale theory, and also recovers the currently best order of the constant in the reverse Littlewood-Paley inequality. We also introduce variants of Type IV superorthogonality, under which we prove the converse inequality.</description>

      <title>Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of the closed neighborhood ideal of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite simple graph and let $NI(G)$ denote the closed neighborhood ideal of $G$ in a polynomial ring $R$. We show that if $G$ is a forest, then the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of $R/NI(G)$ is the same as the matching number of $G$, thus proving a conjecture of Sharifan and Moradi in the affirmative. We also show that the matching number of $G$ provides a lower bound for the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of $R/NI(G)$ when $G$ is a chordal graph, unicyclic graph, complete bipartite graph, or the wheel graph. For forests and unicyclic graphs, we show that the projective dimension of $R/NI(G)$ is also bounded below by the matching number of $G$. Moreover, we investigate the relationship between the regularity and the matching number for two graph operations, namely, the join and the corona product of two graphs.</description>

      <title>$b$-Hurwitz numbers from Whittaker vectors for $\mathcal{W}$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that $b$-Hurwitz numbers with a rational weight are obtained by taking an explicit limit of a Whittaker vector for the $\mathcal{W}$-algebra of type $A$. Our result is a vast generalization of several previous results that treated the monotone case, and the cases of quadratic and cubic polynomial weights. It also provides an interpretation of the associated Whittaker vector in terms of generalized branched coverings that might be of independent interest. Our result is new even in the special case $b=0$ that corresponds to classical hypergeometric Hurwitz numbers, and implies that they are governed by the topological recursion of Eynard-Orantin. This gives an independent proof of the recent result of Bychkov-Dunin-Barkowski-Kazarian-Shadrin.</description>

      <title>On Sparse Covers of Minor Free Graphs, Low Dimensional Metric Embeddings, and other applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a metric space $(X,d_X)$, a $(\beta,s,\Delta)$-sparse cover is a collection of clusters $\mathcal{C}\subseteq P(X)$ with diameter at most $\Delta$, such that for every point $x\in X$, the ball $B_X(x,\frac\Delta\beta)$ is fully contained in some cluster $C\in \mathcal{C}$, and $x$ belongs to at most $s$ clusters in $\mathcal{C}$. Our main contribution is to show that the shortest path metric of every $K_r$-minor free graphs admits $(O(r),O(r^2),\Delta)$-sparse cover, and for every $\epsilon&gt;0$, $(4+\epsilon,O(\frac1\epsilon)^r,\Delta)$-sparse cover (for arbitrary $\Delta&gt;0$). We then use this sparse cover to show that every $K_r$-minor free graph embeds into $\ell_\infty^{\tilde{O}(\frac1\epsilon)^{r+1}\cdot\log n}$ with distortion $3+\eps$ (resp. into $\ell_\infty^{\tilde{O}(r^2)\cdot\log n}$ with distortion $O(r)$). Further, we provide applications of these sparse covers into padded decompositions, sparse partitions, universal TSP / Steiner tree, oblivious buy at bulk, name independent routing, and path reporting distance oracles.</description>

      <title>Minimal Cellular Resolutions of Path Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the path ideals of both paths and cycles have minimal cellular resolutions. Specifically, these minimal free resolutions coincide with the Barile-Macchia resolutions for paths, and their generalized counterparts for cycles. Furthermore, we identify edge ideals of cycles as a class of ideals that lack a minimal Barile-Macchia resolution, yet have a minimal generalized Barile-Macchia resolution.</description>
