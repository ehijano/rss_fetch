      <title>Supervision of a Photovoltaic/Batteries System for Stand Alone Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our paper is focused on optimal and control of an isolated photovoltaic system with batteries. The control is made by the application of a power management control (PMC). Batteries are kept safe from deep discharges and overloads by the PMC, maintaining a continuous supply to the load. The ease, with which this method can be implemented, as well as its effectiveness without imposing a large computing strain on the user, is noteworthy. The batteries and PV panels in the system under study are connected to a bidirectional converter enabling the batteries to be charged and drained in accordance with weather conditions. The simulation results, clearly highlight good performance of the proposed control across two different profiles.</description>

      <title>Optimized Renewable Energy Planning MDP for Socially-Equitable Electricity Coverage in the US</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional power grid infrastructure presents significant barriers to renewable energy integration and perpetuates energy access inequities, with low-income communities experiencing disproportionately longer power outages. This study develops a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to optimize renewable energy allocation while explicitly addressing social equity concerns in electricity distribution. The model incorporates budget constraints, energy demand variability, and social vulnerability indicators across eight major U.S. cities to evaluate policy alternatives for equitable clean energy transitions. Numerical experiments compare the MDP-based approach against baseline policies including random allocation, greedy renewable expansion, and expert heuristics. Results demonstrate that equity-focused optimization can achieve 32.9% renewable energy penetration while reducing underserved low-income populations by 55% compared to conventional approaches. The expert policy achieved the highest reward, while the Monte Carlo Tree Search baseline provided competitive performance with significantly lower budget utilization, demonstrating that fair distribution of clean energy resources is achievable without sacrificing overall system performance and providing ways for integrating social equity considerations with climate goals and inclusive access to clean power infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Design and Testing of a Low-Cost 3D-Printed Servo Gimbal for Thrust Vector Control in Model Rockets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thrust vector control (TVC) is a key mechanism for stabilizing rockets during flight, yet conventional implementations remain costly and technically inaccessible to students and hobbyists. This paper presents the design, fabrication, and testing of a low-cost, 3D-printed, servo-driven two-dimensional gimbal developed for model rocket applications. The gimbal underwent more than 60 CAD iterations, with servo selection guided by torque, response time, and stability requirements. A high-speed camera and Fusion 360 parameter simulations were used to emulate dynamic instability, enabling evaluation of angular deflection, servo responsiveness, and structural durability. The results demonstrated stable actuation within plus or minus 5 degrees, with response times on the average order of 44.5 ms, while limitations included servo fatigue and pin-joint stress under extended loading. The project highlights the feasibility of student-accessible thrust vector control systems and their potential as a reproducible platform for STEM education and experimental aerospace research.</description>

      <title>Comparative Techno-economic Assessment of Wind-Powered Green Hydrogen Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amid global interest in resilient energy systems, green hydrogen is considered vital to the net-zero transition, yet its deployment remains limited by high production cost. The cost is determined by the its production pathway, system configuration, asset location, and interplay with electricity markets and regulatory frameworks. To compare different deployment strategies in the UK, we develop a comprehensive techno-economic framework based on the Levelised Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH) assessment. We apply this framework to 5 configurations of wind-electrolyser systems, identify the most cost-effective business cases, and conduct a sensitivity analysis of key economic parameters. Our results reveal that electricity cost is the dominant contributor to LCOH, followed by the electrolyser cost. Our work highlights the crucial role that location, market arrangements and control strategies among RES and hydrogen investors play in the economic feasibility of deploying green hydrogen systems. Policies that subsidise low-cost electricity access and optimise deployment can lower LCOH, enhancing the economic competitiveness of green hydrogen.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Life Cycle Analysis of Electrolytic H2 Production in Australia under Time-Varying CO2 Management Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to sustainable energy is critical for addressing global climate change. Hydrogen production, particularly via electrolysis, has emerged as a key solution, offering the potential for low-carbon energy across various sectors. This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing hydrogen production by aligning it with periods of low-carbon intensity on the electricity grid. Leveraging real-time data from the Electricity Mapping database and real-time electricity cost data from the AEMO database, the model dynamically adjusts hydrogen output to minimize both emissions and production costs. Furthermore, the integration of hydrogen tax credits significantly enhances cost-effectiveness, offering a viable pathway for widespread adoption. A comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) framework is employed to assess the environmental impacts, emphasizing the need for real-time data incorporation to more accurately reflect hydrogen production's carbon footprint. The study concludes that dynamic, real-time operation, coupled with financial incentives, provides a promising method to enhance the sustainability and economic viability of hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Mechanism Design for Electric Vehicle Charging with Day-Ahead Reservations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general two-period model where electrical vehicles (EVs) can reserve charging sessions in the day-ahead market and swap them in the real-time market. Under the model, we explore several candidate mechanisms for running the two markets, compared using several normative properties such as incentive compatibility, efficiency, reservation awareness, and budget balance. Specifically, reservation awareness is the only property coupling the two markets and dictates that an EV will not get a lower utility by joining the real-time market. Focusing on the real-time market, we show that two variants of the classical Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism do not satisfy all the proposed properties; specifically, one is not reservation-aware, while the other is not budget-balanced. Moreover, we show that no mechanism satisfies some combinations of the properties. Then, we propose to use a posted-price mechanism to resolve the issue, which turns out to be the dynamic pricing mechanism adopted in many real-world systems. The proposed mechanism has no efficiency guarantee but satisfies all the other properties. To improve efficiency, we propose to use a VCG auction in the day-ahead market that guides the reserve prices in the real-time market. When EVs' valuations in the two markets are highly correlated, the proposed approach results in highly efficient outcomes.</description>

      <title>High-Power Wide-Bandwidth High-Quality Modular Pulse Synthesizer with Adaptive Voltage Asymmetry in Medical Power Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noninvasive brain stimulation can write signals into neurons but requires power electronics with exceptionally high power in the mega-volt-ampere range and kilohertz usable bandwidth. Whereas oscillator circuits offered only one or very few pulse shapes, modular cascaded power electronics solved a long-standing problem for the first time and enabled arbitrary software-based synthesis of the temporal shape of stimuli. However, synthesizing arbitrary stimuli with a high output quality requires a large number of modules. We propose an alternative solution that achieves high-resolution pulse shaping with fewer modules by implementing high-power wide-bandwidth voltage asymmetry. Rather than equal voltage steps, our system strategically assigns different voltages to each module to achieve a near-exponential improvement in resolution. The module voltage sequence does also not use just a simple binary pattern other work might suggest but adapts it to the output. Additionally, we introduce a switched-capacitor charging mechanism that allows the modules to charge to different voltages through a single dc power supply. We validated our design in a head-to-head comparison with the state of the art on experimental prototypes. Our three-module prototype reduces total voltage distortion by 13.4% compared to prior art with three modules, and by 4.5% compared to prior art with six -- twice as many -- modules. This paper is the first asymmetric multilevel circuit as a high-precision high-power synthesizer, as well as the first to adaptively optimize asymmetric voltage sequence in modular power electronics.</description>

      <title>A Layered Control Perspective on Legged Locomotion: Embedding Reduced Order Models via Hybrid Zero Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) provide a powerful means of synthesizing dynamic walking gaits on legged robots. Yet this approach lacks the formal guarantees enjoyed by methods that utilize the full-order model (FOM) for gait synthesis, e.g., hybrid zero dynamics. This paper aims to unify these approaches through a layered control perspective. In particular, we establish conditions on when a ROM of locomotion yields stable walking on the full-order hybrid dynamics. To achieve this result, given an ROM we synthesize a zero dynamics manifold encoding the behavior of the ROM -- controllers can be synthesized that drive the FOM to this surface, yielding hybrid zero dynamics. We prove that a stable periodic orbit in the ROM implies an input-to-state stable periodic orbit of the FOM's hybrid zero dynamics, and hence the FOM dynamics. This result is demonstrated in simulation on a linear inverted pendulum ROM and a 5-link planar walking FOM.</description>

      <title>A Quantum-Compliant Formulation for Network Epidemic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We deal with controlling the spread of an epidemic disease on a network by isolating one or multiple locations by banning people from leaving them. To this aim, we build on the susceptible-infected-susceptible and the susceptible-infected-removed discrete-time network models, encapsulating a control action that captures mobility bans via removing links from the network. Then, we formulate the problem of optimally devising a control policy based on mobility bans that trades-off the burden on the healthcare system and the social and economic costs associated with interventions. The binary nature of mobility bans hampers the possibility to solve the control problem with standard optimization methods, yielding a NP-hard problem. Here, this is tackled by deriving a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation of the control problem, and leveraging the growing potentialities of quantum computing to efficiently solve it.</description>

      <title>Solving Optimal Power Flow using a Variational Quantum Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal power flow (OPF) is a large-scale optimization problem that is central in the operation of electric power systems. Although it can be posed as a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program, the complexity of modern-day power grids raises scalability and optimality challenges. In this context, this work proposes a variational quantum paradigm for solving the OPF. We encode primal variables through the state of a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC), and dual variables through the probability mass function associated with a second PQC. The Lagrangian function can thus be expressed as scaled expectations of quantum observables. An OPF solution can be found by minimizing/maximizing the Lagrangian over the parameters of the first/second PQC. We pursue saddle points of the Lagrangian in a hybrid fashion. Gradients of the Lagrangian are estimated using the two PQCs, while PQC parameters are updated classically using a primal-dual method. We propose permuting primal variables so that OPF observables are expressed in a banded form, allowing them to be measured efficiently. Numerical tests on the IEEE 57-node power system using Pennylane's simulator corroborate that the proposed doubly variational quantum framework can find high-quality OPF solutions. Although showcased for the OPF, this framework features a broader scope, including conic programs with numerous variables and constraints, problems defined over sparse graphs, and training quantum machine learning models to satisfy constraints.</description>

      <title>A Novel Decoupled LVRT Control Strategy for Transient Voltage Stability Enhancement of IBRs Using Voltage-Angle Coupling Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the fast-increasing penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs), the voltage support capability of the grid following (GFL) IBRs under low voltage ride through (LVRT) control significantly influences the transient voltage stability of the power system. The existing LVRT adjusts the q-axis current to regulate reactive power injection. However, under a large disturbance, the phase-locked loop (PLL) error invalidates the proportional relationship between the q-axis current and reactive power, consequently causing deviation in the actual reactive power injection of the IBR. Besides, the variation of IBR current, determined by the PLL phase and LVRT, also directly influences the transient voltage. To address this issue, the specific influence of PLL error on active and reactive power injection is first analyzed under LVRT control. In addition, by combining the LVRT and PLL dynamics, the mechanisms of three voltage problems caused by voltage angle coupling are revealed. overvoltage, low voltage, and DC-side overvoltage. The specific scenarios in which these voltage stability problems occur are also obtained by the voltage-vector-triangle graphic. Furthermore, a power angle decoupled LVRT control is proposed to eliminate the influence of voltage angle coupling. Finally, the mechanism analysis and effectiveness of the decoupled LVRT are verified in the case study.</description>

      <title>Improved PLL Design for Transient Stability Enhancement of Grid Following Converters Based on Lyapunov Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuations in phase angle and frequency under large disturbances can lead to loss of synchronism (LOS) in grid-following (GFL) converters. The power angle and frequency of synchronous generators (SGs) correspond to rotor position and speed, whereas those of converters lack a direct physical counterpart in the real world and can thus be directly adjusted by control methods to prevent loss of synchronization. In this paper, an improved phase-locked loop (PLL) design with reset control for GFL converters is proposed to enhance transient stability. The stability domain (SD) of a GFL converter is first analyzed, and three forms of SD are identified under different short circuit ratios. Secondly, based on the characteristics of the three SD forms, two PLL-reset methods are proposed, including omega reset and omega&amp;delta reset. Thirdly, to provide the triggering conditions for the PLL-reset control, the Lyapunov function of the GFL converter is constructed based on three methods: the approximation-based Lyapunov method, the Zubov method, and the analytical trajectory reversing method. All these methods are immune to the negative damping problem of PLL dynamics, which makes traditional energy-perspective Lyapunov functions invalid. Finally, the estimation accuracy of the three Lyapunov-based methods is analyzed, and the effectiveness of the PLL-reset control is verified in single-machine and multi-machine case studies.</description>

      <title>Game Theoretic Resilience Recommendation Framework for CyberPhysical Microgrids Using Hypergraph MetaLearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a physics-aware cyberphysical resilience framework for radial microgrids under coordinated cyberattacks. The proposed approach models the attacker through a hypergraph neural network (HGNN) enhanced with model agnostic metalearning (MAML) to rapidly adapt to evolving defense strategies and predict high-impact contingencies. The defender is modeled via a bi-level Stackelberg game, where the upper level selects optimal tie-line switching and distributed energy resource (DER) dispatch using an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) coordinator embedded within the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). The framework simultaneously optimizes load served, operational cost, and voltage stability, ensuring all post-defense states satisfy network physics constraints. The methodology is first validated on the IEEE 69-bus distribution test system with 12 DERs, 8 critical loads, and 5 tie-lines, and then extended to higher bus systems including the IEEE 123-bus feeder and a synthetic 300-bus distribution system. Results show that the proposed defense strategy restores nearly full service for 90% of top-ranked attacks, mitigates voltage violations, and identifies Feeder 2 as the principal vulnerability corridor. Actionable operating rules are derived, recommending pre-arming of specific tie-lines to enhance resilience, while higher bus system studies confirm scalability of the framework on the IEEE 123-bus and 300-bus systems.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of "frequency control strength" as a novel approach to understand how different real-world power systems compare to each other in terms of effectiveness and performance of system-wide frequency control. It presents a comprehensive comparison, based on measurement data, of the frequency control strength of four real-world, renewable-based, synchronous islands power systems, namely Great Britain (GB), All-Island power system (AIPS) of Ireland, and Australia (AUS) mainland and Tasmania (TAS). The strength is evaluated by means of different frequency quality metrics. The common understanding is that the bigger the capacity of a power system, the bigger its robustness with respect to events and contingencies. Here we show that this is not always the case in the context of frequency control. In fact, our study shows that mainland AUS shows the highest frequency control strength during normal operating conditions, whereas the AIPS shows the highest relative frequency control strength for abnormal system conditions. The strength is, in particular, greatly influenced by different regulatory requirements and different system/ancillary services arrangements in each jurisdiction. The paper also provides possible mitigations to improve frequency control strength through grid codes and market rules.</description>

      <title>Realization of Precise Perforating Using Dynamic Threshold and Physical Plausibility Algorithm for Self-Locating Perforating in Oil and Gas Wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate depth measurement is essential for optimizing oil and gas resource development, as it directly impacts production efficiency. However, achieving precise depth and perforating at the correct location remains a significant challenge due to field operational constraints and equipment limitations. In this work, we propose the Dynamic Threshold and Physical Plausibility Depth Measurement and Perforation Control (DTPPMP) system, a solution integrated into perforating guns that enables real-time, precise depth measurement and perforation at designated perforating intervals. The system autonomously samples, processes and identifies signals from a casing collar locator (CCL) in situ within oil and gas wells. Casing collar identification is achieved using a lightweight dynamic threshold and physical plausibility algorithm deployed on an embedded platform, which serves as the system's processor. Field tests conducted in an actual oil well in Sichuan, China, demonstrated the DTPPMP's ability to accurately identify casing collar signals, measure depths, and effectively perforate at designated perforating intervals in real-time. The system achieved a perforation variation of less than the length of a single perforating interval and a F1 score of 98.6% for casing collar identification. These results provide valuable recommendations for advancing automation and intelligence in future perforation operations.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Deep AC-OPF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has proposed machine learning (ML) approaches as fast surrogates for solving AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF), with claims of significant speed-ups and high accuracy. In this paper, we revisit these claims through a systematic evaluation of ML models against a set of simple yet carefully designed linear baselines. We introduce OPFormer-V, a transformer-based model for predicting bus voltages, and compare it to both the state-of-the-art DeepOPF-V model and simple linear methods. Our findings reveal that, while OPFormer-V improves over DeepOPF-V, the relative gains of the ML approaches considered are less pronounced than expected. Simple linear baselines can achieve comparable performance. These results highlight the importance of including strong linear baselines in future evaluations.</description>

      <title>Adaptation of Parameters in Heterogeneous Multi-agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptation mechanism for heterogeneous multi-agent systems to align the agents' internal parameters, based on enforced consensus through strong couplings. Unlike homogeneous systems, where exact consensus is attainable, the heterogeneity in node dynamics precludes perfect synchronization. Nonetheless, previous work has demonstrated that strong coupling can induce approximate consensus, whereby the agents exhibit emergent collective behavior governed by the so-called blended dynamics. Building on this observation, we introduce an adaptation law that gradually aligns the internal parameters of agents without requiring direct parameter communication. The proposed method reuses the same coupling signal employed for state synchronization, which may result in a biologically or sociologically plausible adaptation process. Under a persistent excitation condition, we prove that the linearly parametrized vector fields of the agents converge to each other, thereby making the dynamics asymptotically homogeneous, and leading to exact consensus of the state variables.</description>

      <title>Passivity Compensation: A Distributed Approach for Consensus Analysis in Heterogeneous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a passivity-based approach to output consensus analysis in heterogeneous networks composed of non-identical agents coupled via nonlinear interactions, in the presence of measurement and/or communication noise. Focusing on agents that are input-feedforward passive (IFP), we first examine whether a shortage of passivity in some agents can be compensated by a passivity surplus in others, in the sense of preserving the passivity of the transformed open-loop system defined by the agent dynamics and network topology. We show that such compensation is only feasible when at most one agent lacks passivity, and we characterise how this deficit can be offset using the excess passivity within the group of agents. For general networks, we then investigate passivity compensation within the feedback interconnection by leveraging the passivity surplus in the coupling links to locally compensate for the lack of passivity in the adjacent agents. In particular, a distributed condition, expressed in terms of passivity indices and coupling gains, is derived to ensure output consensus of the interconnected network.</description>

      <title>On the Global Optimality of Linear Policies for Sinkhorn Distributionally Robust Linear Quadratic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) regulator is a cornerstone of optimal control theory, yet its performance can degrade significantly when the noise distributions deviate from the assumed Gaussian model. To address this limitation, this work proposes a distributionally robust generalization of the finite-horizon LQG control problem. Specifically, we assume that the noise distributions are unknown and belong to ambiguity sets defined in terms of an entropy-regularized Wasserstein distance centered at a nominal Gaussian distribution. By deriving novel bounds on this Sinkhorn discrepancy and proving structural and topological properties of the resulting ambiguity sets, we establish global optimality of linear policies. Numerical experiments showcase improved distributional robustness of our control policy.</description>

      <title>Using Gaussian Mixtures to Model Evolving Multi-Modal Beliefs Across Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Gaussian mixtures to model formation and evolution of multi-modal beliefs and opinion uncertainty across social networks. In this model, opinions evolve by Bayesian belief update when incorporating exogenous factors (signals from outside sources, e.g., news articles) and by non-Bayesian mixing dynamics when incorporating endogenous factors (interactions across social media). The modeling enables capturing the richness of behavior observed in multi-modal opinion dynamics while maintaining interpretability and simplicity of scalar models. We present preliminary results on opinion formation and uncertainty to investigate the effect of stubborn individuals (as social influencers). This leads to a notion of centrality based on the ease with which an individual can disrupt the flow of information across the social network.</description>

      <title>IndusGCC: A Data Benchmark and Evaluation Framework for GUI-Based General Computer Control in Industrial Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Industry 4.0 progresses, flexible manufacturing has become a cornerstone of modern industrial systems, with equipment automation playing a pivotal role. However, existing control software for industrial equipment, typically reliant on graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that require human interactions such as mouse clicks or screen touches, poses significant barriers to the adoption of code-based equipment automation. Recently, Large Language Model-based General Computer Control (LLM-GCC) has emerged as a promising approach to automate GUI-based operations. However, industrial settings pose unique challenges, including visually diverse, domain-specific interfaces and mission-critical tasks demanding high precision. This paper introduces IndusGCC, the first dataset and benchmark tailored to LLM-GCC in industrial environments, encompassing 448 real-world tasks across seven domains, from robotic arm control to production line configuration. IndusGCC features multimodal human interaction data with the equipment software, providing robust supervision for GUI-level code generation. Additionally, we propose a novel evaluation framework with functional and structural metrics to assess LLM-generated control scripts. Experimental results on mainstream LLMs demonstrate both the potential of LLM-GCC and the challenges it faces, establishing a strong foundation for future research toward fully automated factories.

      <title>Design, Modelling and Analysis of a Bio-inspired Spiking Temperature Regulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In biology, homeostasis is the process of maintaining a stable internal environment, which is crucial for optimal functioning of organisms. One of the key homeostatic mechanisms is thermoregulation that allows the organism to maintain its core temperature within tight bounds despite being exposed to a wide range of varying external temperatures. Instrumental in thermoregulation is the presence of thermosensitive neurons at multiple places throughout the body, including muscles, the spinal cord, and the brain, which provide spiking sensory signals for the core temperature. In response to these signals, thermoeffectors are activated, creating a negative spiking feedback loop. Additionally, a feedforward signal is provided by warmth and cold-sensitive neurons in the skin, offering a measure for the external temperature. This paper presents an electronic circuit-based architecture design to replicate the biological process of thermoregulation, combined with a formal mathematical analysis. The considered architecture consists of four temperature sensitive neurons and a single actuator, configured in a negative feedback loop with feedforward control. To model the overall system mathematically, hybrid dynamical system descriptions are proposed that are used to analyze and simulate the performance of the design. The analysis and numerical case study illustrate the crucial role of feedforward control in reducing the dependency on the external temperature.</description>

      <title>Energy-optimal control of discrete-time port-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we study the energy-optimal control of nonlinear port-Hamiltonian (pH) systems in discrete time. For continuous-time pH systems, energy-optimal control problems are strictly dissipative by design. This property, stating that the system to be optimized is dissipative with the cost functional as a supply rate, implies a stable long-term behavior of optimal solutions and enables stability results in predictive control.
  In this work, we show that the crucial property of strict dissipativity is not straightforwardly preserved by any energy-preserving integrator such as the implicit midpoint rule. Then, we prove that discretizations via difference and differential representations lead to strictly dissipative discrete-time optimal control problems. Consequently, we rigorously show a stable long-term behavior of optimal solutions in the form of a manifold (subspace) turnpike property. Finally, we validate our findings using two numerical examples</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Fault Isolation in Linear Time-Invariant Systems: A Subspace Classification Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of fault isolation in linear systems with actuator and sensor faults within a data-driven framework. We propose a nullspace-based filter that uses solely fault-free input-output data collected under process and measurement noises. By reparameterizing the problem within a behavioral framework, we achieve a direct fault isolation filter design that is independent of any explicit system model. The underlying classification problem is approached from a geometric perspective, enabling a characterization of mutual fault discernibility in terms of fundamental system properties given a noise-free setting. In addition, the provided conditions can be evaluated using only the available data. Finally, a simulation study is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the ConamArray, a compact broadband ultrasound transducer array composed of 32 MEMS loudspeakers. Unlike conventional broadband transducers, which are typically large and require high driving voltages, the proposed array combines small form factor MEMS devices in a staggered two-row configuration to enable beam steering across a wide ultrasonic band. A dual-microcontroller back-end with synchronized multi-DAC outputs provides flexible waveform generation and runtime steering control. Both simulations and anechoic chamber measurements demonstrate that the ConamArray achieves stable beam steering, while also revealing the onset of grating lobes when steering to larger angles. These results confirm the feasibility of broadband beam steering using MEMS technology, opening new opportunities for applications in ultrasonic imaging, localization, and bio-inspired robotics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic levitation is poised to revolutionize industrial automation by integrating flexible in-machine product transport and seamless manipulation. It is expected to become the standard drive for automated manufacturing. However, controlling such systems is inherently challenging due to their complex, unstable dynamics. Traditional control approaches, which rely on hand-crafted control engineering, typically yield robust but conservative solutions, with their performance closely tied to the expertise of the engineering team. In contrast, neural control learning presents a promising alternative. This paper presents the first neural controller for 6D magnetic levitation. Trained end-to-end on interaction data from a proprietary controller, it directly maps raw sensor data and 6D reference poses to coil current commands. The neural controller can effectively generalize to previously unseen situations while maintaining accurate and robust control. These results underscore the practical feasibility of learning-based neural control in complex physical systems and suggest a future where such a paradigm could enhance or even substitute traditional engineering approaches in demanding real-world applications. The trained neural controller, source code, and demonstration videos are publicly available at https://sites.google.com/view/neural-maglev.</description>

      <title>Semantic Technologies in Practical Demand Response: An Informational Requirement-based Roadmap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The future grid will be highly complex and decentralized, requiring sophisticated coordination across numerous human and software agents that manage distributed resources such as Demand Response (DR). Realizing this vision demands significant advances in semantic interoperability, which enables scalable and cost-effective automation across heterogeneous systems. While semantic technologies have progressed in commercial building and DR domains, current ontologies have two critical limitations: they are often developed without a formal framework that reflects real-world DR requirements, and proposals for integrating general and application-specific ontologies remain mostly conceptual, lacking formalization or empirical validation.
  In this paper, we address these gaps by applying a formal ontology evaluation/development approach to define the informational requirements (IRs) necessary for semantic interoperability in the area of incentive-based DR for commercial buildings. We identify the IRs associated with each stage of the wholesale incentive-based DR process, focusing on the perspective of building owners. Using these IRs, we evaluate how well existing ontologies (Brick, DELTA, and EFOnt) support the operational needs of DR participation. Our findings reveal substantial misalignments between current ontologies and practical DR requirements. Based on our assessments, we propose a roadmap of necessary extensions and integrations for these ontologies. This work ultimately aims to enhance the interoperability of today's and future smart grid, thereby facilitating scalable integration of DR systems into the grid's complex operational framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a targeted-subharmonic-eliminating pulse density modulation (TSE-PDM) method for SS- compensated WPT systems. By designing a noise transfer function with notch characteristics, the subharmonic components which excite current abnormal oscillations were eliminated. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the TSE-PDM in suppressing current abnormal oscillations. The proposed method is easy to implement in either primary or secondary side of the WPT system and exhibits a certain tolerance to deviations in NTF design, representing the most straightforward method for abnormal oscillation suppression in PDM controlled WPT systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Averting catastrophic global warming requires decisive action to decarbonize key sectors. Vehicle electrification, alongside renewable energy integration, is a long-term strategy toward zero carbon emissions. However, transitioning to fully renewable electricity may take decades -- during which electric vehicles may still rely on carbon-intensive electricity. We analyze the critical role of the transmission network in enabling or constraining emissions reduction from U.S. vehicle electrification. Our models reveal that the available transmission capacity severely limits potential CO2 emissions reduction. With adequate transmission, full electrification could nearly eliminate vehicle operational CO2 emissions once renewable generation reaches the existing nonrenewable capacity. In contrast, the current grid would support only a fraction of that benefit. Achieving the full emissions reduction potential of vehicle electrification during this transition will require a moderate but targeted increase in transmission capacity. Our findings underscore the pressing need to enhance transmission infrastructure to unlock the climate benefits of large-scale electrification and renewable integration.</description>

      <title>A Novel Tunable Controller for Grid Forming Converters towards Critical Services Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the key features of a control system applicable to inverter-based resources (IBR), which is based on grid-forming technology. Such resources are classified as grid-forming or grid-following converters based on the type of output with or without grid connection. With rapid growth in the energy sector to adopt carbon-free generation, Grid Forming Converter (GFC) seems suitable for power provision to remote or islanded operation of converters. A fully-fledged bulk power grid based on GFC requires complex control implementation with suitable tuning of its parameters. In this article a broader analysis of synchronous machine and such type of converter is discussed and designed in the MATLAB 2024 environment with its control technique is studied for a closed-loop system under contingencies. A proposed control scheme is developed to understand the frequency minimization problem and the minimization problem is solved using GAMS programming tool. The primary objective function is found to be suitable for minimization of frequency deviation using a mixed control approach. An artificial neural network-based controller is also proposed with Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm which augments the research by finding suitable optimal reference for GFM converter in the presence of a grid. A long-short-term memory (LSTM) based network is also proposed for the above control and the performance is found to be efficacious.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Model of Hybrid Microgrid With Pole Placement Controller Using State Feedback For Stability Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the development of a mathematical model of a converter state space model for a hybrid microgrid. The hybrid model combines the models of components such as DC-Converters, DC-AC converters, and their individual controllers, as well as loads. The input to the converter is considered a constant DC voltage, assumed to originate from distributed generations like solar, battery storage, or fuel-cells. The converter output is connected to a DC line through an LCL filter. The controller circuitry is designed to regulate the voltage, current, and power from the converter. Sensors are strategically placed to measure the currents, voltages, and power, and calculate the reference pulse signal using PWM for the switch. Similarly, the DC-AC converter is modeled. In the state space domain the converter models is used to design overall microgrid system. A single DC converter has six states and two inputs, with all states as outputs. A single DC-AC converter has thirteen states and three inputs, with all states as outputs. Three such converters of each type are considered to develop the DC microgrid and AC microgrid, which are then combined using mathematical analysis to model a hybrid microgrid. For the hybrid microgrid development, network and load models were also included. Eigenvalue analysis has been conducted to study the small signal stability of the considered system. The complete state space model of the hybrid microgrid has been programmed, and a pole-placement controller has been designed to enhance the stability of the system.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Trajectory Tracking MPC for Quadcopters with Coupled Time-Varying Constraints and Stability Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a cascade control structure to address the trajectory tracking problem for quadcopters, ensuring uniform global asymptotic stability of the state tracking error dynamics. An MPC strategy based on a 12-dimensional prediction model is proposed for the outer loop, explicitly accounting for time-varying coupled constraints, where multiple variables are interdependent and need to be handled together. The outer-loop controller generates an acceleration reference, which is then converted into attitude and angular velocity references, later tracked by a nonlinear inner-loop controller. Numerical simulations validate the approach, demonstrating enhanced performance in precise and fast tracking by imposing less conservative constraints than existing approaches, while still guaranteeing stability.</description>

      <title>Impact of Passive Element Technological Limits on CMOS Low-Noise Amplifier Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of technological constraints on passive elements in the design of inductively degenerated CMOS low-noise amplifiers (LNAs). A theoretical analysis is combined with circuit simulations in a 130-nm CMOS process at 2.45~GHz to explore how the available inductance and capacitance values limit key design objectives such as maximum gain, minimum power consumption, and transistor sizing. Results show that these limits significantly restrict the achievable design space, particularly for low-power implementations, and highlight the need to incorporate detailed passive-element models into RF integrated circuit design flows.</description>

      <title>Maximally Resilient Controllers under Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the notion of resilience of a dynamical system, defined by the maximum disturbance a controlled dynamical system can withstand while satisfying given temporal logic specifications. Given a dynamical system and a specification, the objective is to synthesize the controller such that the closed-loop system satisfies this specification while maximizing its resilience. The problem is formulated as a robust optimization program where the objective is to compute the maximum resilience while simultaneously synthesizing the corresponding controller parameters. For linear systems and linear controllers, exact solutions are provided for the class of time-varying polytopic specifications. For the case of nonlinear systems, nonlinear controllers and more general specifications, we leverage tools from the scenario optimization approach, offering a probabilistic guarantee of the solution as well as computational feasibility. Different case studies are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Model Predictive Control-Based Reverse Path-Planning and Path-Tracking Control of a Vehicle with Trailer System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reverse parking maneuvers of a vehicle with trailer system is a challenging task to complete for human drivers due to the unstable nature of the system and unintuitive controls required to orientate the trailer properly. This paper hence proposes an optimization-based automation routine to handle the path-planning and path-tracking control process of such type of maneuvers. The proposed approach utilizes nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to robustly guide the vehicle-trailer system into the desired parking space, and an optional forward repositioning maneuver can be added as an additional stage of the parking process to obtain better system configurations, before backward motion can be attempted again to get a good final pose. The novelty of the proposed approach is the simplicity of its formulation, as the path-planning and path-tracking operations are only conducted on the trailer being viewed as a standalone vehicle, before the control inputs are propagated to the tractor vehicle via inverse kinematic relationships also derived in this paper. Simulation case studies and hardware-in-the-loop tests are performed, and the results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Computation of Feasible Assume-Guarantee Contracts: A Resilience-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a resilience-based framework for computing feasible assume-guarantee contracts that ensure the satisfaction of temporal specifications in interconnected discrete-time systems. Interconnection effects are modeled as structured disturbances. We use a resilience metric, the maximum disturbance under which local specifications hold, to refine assumptions and guarantees across subsystems iteratively. For two subsystems, we demonstrate correctness, monotone refinement of guarantees, and that the resulting assumptions are maximal within ball-shaped sets. Additionally, we extend our approach to general networks of L subsystems using weighted combinations of interconnection effects. We instantiate the framework on linear systems by meeting finite-horizon safety, exact-time reachability, and finite-time reachability specifications, and on nonlinear systems by fulfilling general finite-horizon specifications. Our approach is demonstrated through numerical linear examples, and a nonlinear DC Microgrid case study, showcasing the impact of our framework in verifying temporal logic specifications with compositional reasoning.</description>

      <title>Safety-Critical Multi-Agent MCTS for Mixed Traffic Coordination at Unsignalized Roundabout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision-making at unsignalized roundabouts poses substantial challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in mixed traffic environments where AVs must coordinate safely with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). This paper presents a safety-critical multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework that integrates both deterministic and probabilistic prediction models to facilitate cooperative decision-making in complex roundabout scenarios. The proposed framework introduces three key innovations: (1) a hierarchical safety assessment module that systematically addresses AV-to-AV (A2A), AV-to-HDV (A2H), and AV-to-Road (A2R) interactions through dynamic safety thresholds and spatiotemporal risk evaluation; (2) an adaptive HDV behavior prediction scheme that combines the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) with probabilistic uncertainty modeling; and (3) a multi-objective reward optimization strategy that jointly considers safety, efficiency, and cooperative intent. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under both fully autonomous (100% AVs) and mixed traffic (50% AVs + 50% HDVs) conditions. Compared to benchmark methods, our framework consistently reduces trajectory deviations across all AVs and significantly lowers the rate of Post-Encroachment Time (PET) violations, achieving only 1.0\% in the fully autonomous scenario and 3.2% in the mixed traffic setting.</description>

      <title>RadioDiff-Loc: Diffusion Model Enhanced Scattering Congnition for NLoS Localization with Sparse Radio Map Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate localization of non-cooperative signal sources in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environments remains a critical challenge with a wide range of applications, including autonomous navigation, industrial automation, and emergency response. In such settings, traditional positioning techniques relying on line-of-sight (LoS) or cooperative signaling fail due to severe multipath propagation and unknown transmit power. This paper proposes a novel generative inference framework for NLoS localization based on conditional diffusion models. By leveraging the physical insight that diffracted electromagnetic energy concentrates near building edges, we develop a sampling strategy that collects sparse received signal strength (RSS) measurements at the geometric vertices of obstacles--locations that maximize Fisher information and mutual information with respect to the unknown source. To overcome the lack of known transmission power, we normalize all sampled RSS values relative to the maximum observed intensity, enabling the construction of a power-invariant radio map (RM). A conditional diffusion model is trained to reconstruct the full RM based on environmental layout and sparse RSS observations. Localization is then achieved by identifying the brightest point on the generated RM. Moreover, the proposed framework is compatible with existing RSS-based localization algorithms, enabling a dual-driven paradigm that fuses physical knowledge and data-driven inference for improved accuracy. Extensive theoretical analysis and empirical validation demonstrate that our approach achieves high localization accuracy with significantly reduced sampling cost, offering a scalable and physically grounded solution for non-cooperative NLoS emitter localization.</description>

      <title>Online Identification using Adaptive Laws and Neural Networks for Multi-Quadrotor Centralized Transportation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an adaptive-neuro identification method that enhances the robustness of a centralized multi-quadrotor transportation system. This method leverages online tuning and learning on decomposed error subspaces, enabling efficient real-time compensation to time-varying disturbances and model uncertainties acting on the payload. The strategy is to decompose the high-dimensional error space into a set of low-dimensional subspaces. In this way, the identification problem for unseen features is naturally transformed into submappings (``slices'') addressed by multiple adaptive laws and shallow neural networks, which are updated online via Lyapunov-based adaptation without requiring persistent excitation (PE) and offline training. Due to the model-free nature of neural networks, this approach can be well adapted to highly coupled and nonlinear centralized transportation systems. It serves as a feedforward compensator for the payload controller without explicitly relying on the dynamics coupled with the payload, such as cables and quadrotors. The proposed control system has been proven to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov, and its enhanced robustness under time-varying disturbances and model uncertainties was demonstrated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Robustness Enhancement for Multi-Quadrotor Centralized Transportation System via Online Tuning and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an adaptive-neuro geometric control for a centralized multi-quadrotor cooperative transportation system, which enhances both adaptivity and disturbance rejection. Our strategy is to coactively tune the model parameters and learn the external disturbances in real-time. To realize this, we augmented the existing geometric control with multiple neural networks and adaptive laws, where the estimated model parameters and the weights of the neural networks are simultaneously tuned and adjusted online. The Lyapunov-based adaptation guarantees bounded estimation errors without requiring either pre-training or the persistent excitation (PE) condition. The proposed control system has been proven to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov under certain preconditions, and its enhanced robustness under scenarios of disturbed environment and model-unmatched plant was demonstrated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to conventional converters, a three-level buck-boost (3L-BB) converter offers higher efficiency, reduced switching losses, and increased power density. We design a 3L-BB converter given certain voltage and current specifications in PSIM. We simulate the circuit in PSIM and analyze the power, voltage, and current waveforms by comparing the observed simulated values in PSIM with their mathematically driven theoretical values. We examine its power efficiencies and determine if the circuit meets given DC distribution specifications. We show that the proposed three-phase design, which uses two DC-DC single-ended primary-conductor converters (SEPICs), is power efficient and is a compelling solution for high-power and high-voltage applications.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Analysis and Exclusion Hypothesis of $\alpha$-Approximation Method for Discretizing Analog Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A popular method for designing digital models is transforming the transfer function of the corresponding analog models from continuous domain (s-domain) into discrete domain (z-domain) using the s-to-z transformation. The alpha-approximation is a generalized form of these transformations. When alpha is set to 0.5, the result is the well-known Tustin transformation or bi-linear transformation. In this paper, we provided a comprehensive analysis of the alpha-approximation method, including mathematical interpretation, stability analysis and distortion analysis. Through mathematical interpretation, we revealed that it can be derived by numerically integrating the error function We defined this as the hexagonal approximation. We demonstrated that the stable range of alpha was [0.5, 1] by doing stability analysis. Through distortion analysis, we found that minimizing amplitude and phase distortion simultaneously seemed impossible by regulating alpha alone. Finally, We proposed an exclusion hypothesis hypothesizing that there is no single parameter alpha to minimize the amplitude distortion and phase distortion simultaneously across all frequency points within the Nyquist frequency range. This paper demonstrates that designing parameter alpha involves balancing amplitude and phase distortion.</description>

      <title>Robust Load Disturbance Rejection in PWM DC-DC Buck Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to robust load disturbance rejection in DC-DC Buck converters. We propose a novel control scheme based on the design of two nested feedback loops. First, we design the controller in the outer loop using H infinity optimal control theory, and we show, by means of mu-analysis, that such a controller provides robust stability in the presence of uncertainty affecting the physical parameters of the circuit. Then, we introduce an inner feedback loop to improve the system's response to output load disturbances. As far as the inner loop is considered, we propose a novel load estimation-compensation (LEC) scheme, and we discuss under what conditions the insertion of such an inner loop preserves the robust stability of the entire control system. The LEC scheme is compared with the other two linear structures based on well-established disturbance rejection methods. The advantages of LEC in terms of both complexity of implementation and obtained performances are discussed and demonstrated by means of numerical simulation. Finally, we present experimental results obtained through the implementation of the proposed control scheme on a prototype board to demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances disturbance rejection performances with respect to the approach commonly used in DC-DC buck converters.</description>

      <title>Implementing General-Order Frequency Dynamic Response Model and Frequency Excursion Duration Criterion in Unit Commitment Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for incorporating frequency dynamics into the unit commitment (UC) problem through a general-order differential equation model, solved using Bernstein polynomial approximation. Traditional frequency-constrained UC (FCUC) models typically rely on simplified first-order assumptions or scalar frequency metrics, such as frequency nadir, to indirectly enforce dynamic behavior. In contrast, our formulation explicitly models time-domain frequency response using second-order dynamics, enabling a more accurate and flexible representation of generator behavior. The resulting differential equations are approximated with high fidelity using Bernstein polynomials, leading to a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation that remains computationally tractable for small-scale power systems.
  Additionally, we introduce a new constraint based on the duration of frequency excursions below a critical threshold, motivated by practical concerns such as relay operation and equipment protection. A data-driven method is employed to relate the area under this threshold-computed as the integral of the Bernstein approximation-to the duration of frequency deviation. The proposed framework is validated using real-world data from an island system in Spain, demonstrating enhanced frequency security with a moderate increase in operational cost. These results suggest the method's strong potential for application in low-inertia, small-scale power systems.</description>

      <title>Robust Performance Analysis and Nonlinearity Shaping for Closed-loop Reset Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reset elements are nonlinear filters that improve control performance beyond linear time-invariant (LTI) limits but introduce higher-order harmonics that complicate design. Although frequency-domain tools like describing functions (DFs) and higher-order sinusoidal-input describing functions (HOSIDFs) analyze reset control systems (RCS), no direct method yet quantifies the impact of higher-order harmonics on the error signal without time-domain simulations. This paper introduces a robustness factor, $\sigma_2(\omega)$, which quantifies the increase in the root-mean-square (RMS) value of the error signal due to HOSIDFs, enabling RCS to rely solely on first-order DF characteristics while accounting for nonlinear effects. By using this robustness factor, a systematic method for designing pre- and post-filters is developed to ensure a predefined bound on $\sigma_2(\omega)$, thereby limiting the influence of higher-order harmonics without altering first-order DF behavior. The proposed framework is validated through a case study on a planar precision positioning stage, demonstrating how the robustness factor guides the reduction of nonlinearities and improves performance predictability.</description>

      <title>Nuclear fusion plasma fuelling with ice pellets using a neuromorphic controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In reactor-grade tokamaks, pellet injection is the best candidate for core plasma fuelling. However, density control schemes that can handle the hybrid nature of this type of fuelling, i.e., the discrete impact of the pellets on the continuously evolving plasma density, are lacking. This paper proposes a neuromorphic controller, inspired by the integrate-and-fire neuronal model, to address this problem. The overall system is modelled as a hybrid system, and we analyse the proposed controller in closed loop with a single-input single-output linear time-invariant plasma model. The controller generates spikes, representing pellet launches, when the neuron variable reaches a certain threshold. Between the control actions, or spikes, the system evolves in open loop. We establish conditions on the controller variables and minimum actuator speed, depending on the reference value for the desired density, the pellet size and the time-constant of the plasma density, that guarantee a practical stability property for the closed-loop system. The results are illustrated in a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Task and Motion Planning of Dynamic Systems using Hyperproperties for Signal Temporal Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the task and motion planning problem for dynamical systems under signal temporal logic (STL) specifications. Existing works on STL control synthesis mainly focus on generating plans that satisfy properties over a single executed trajectory. In this work, we consider the planning problem for hyperproperties evaluated over a set of possible trajectories, which naturally arise in information-flow control problems. Specifically, we study discrete-time dynamical systems and employ the recently developed temporal logic HyperSTL as the new objective for planning. To solve this problem, we propose a novel recursive counterexample-guided synthesis approach capable of effectively handling HyperSTL specifications with multiple alternating quantifiers. The proposed method is not only applicable to planning but also extends to HyperSTL model checking for discrete-time dynamical systems. Finally, we present case studies on security-preserving planning and ambiguity-free planning to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HyperSTL planning framework.</description>

      <title>Selection of Optimal Number and Location of PMUs for CNN Based Fault Location and Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a data-driven Forward Selection with Neighborhood Refinement (FSNR) algorithm to determine the number and placement of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) for maximizing deep-learning-based fault diagnosis performance. Candidate PMU locations are ranked via a cross-validated Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, and each selection is refined through local neighborhood exploration to produce a near-optimal sensor set. The resulting PMU subset is then supplied to a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for faulted-line localization and fault-type classification from time-series measurements. Evaluation on modified IEEE 34- and IEEE 123-bus systems demonstrates that the proposed FSNR-SVM method identifies a minimal PMU configuration that achieves the best overall CNN performance, attaining over 96 percent accuracy in fault location and over 99 percent accuracy in fault-type classification on the IEEE 34 system, and approximately 94 percent accuracy in fault location and around 99.8 percent accuracy in fault-type classification on the IEEE 123 system.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Stabilization of a Class of Nonlinear Systems in Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the finite-time stabilization of a class of nonlinear infinite-dimensional systems. First, we consider a bounded matched perturbation in its linear form. It is shown that by using a set-valued function, both the convergence objective (finite-time) and the rejection of perturbations are achieved. Second, we consider a class of nonlinear systems and design a feedback control that ensures the closed-loop system is finite-time stable. All proofs presented in this paper regarding convergence are based on Lyapunov theory. The existence of solutions to the closed-loop system and its well-posedness are established using maximal monotone theory. To illustrate the applicability of the theoretical results, a heat equation is considered as an application of the main results.</description>

      <title>2.4-GHz Integrated CMOS Low-Noise Amplifier (English Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the analysis, design, fabrication, and measurement of an integrated low-noise amplifier (LNA) implemented using a 130 nm CMOS technology, operating in the 2.4 GHz band. The LNA is a crucial component in the performance of receivers, particularly in integrated receivers. The proposed LNA was designed to meet the specifications of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Post-layout simulation results, including pads with electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection, are as follows: gain of 10.7 dB, noise figure of 2.7 dB, third-order input intercept point (IIP3) of 0.9 dBm, input and output impedance matching better than -20 dB with respect to 50~$\Omega$ terminations, with a power consumption of 505 $\mu$W powered from a 1.2 V supply. The obtained results fall within the range of those recently reported for the same topology and operating frequency. The measured scattering parameters (S-parameters) are consistent with the simulation results. This work contributes to the development of a new research line in Cuba on the design of radio-frequency (RF) integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Nano Machine Intelligence: From a Communication Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an AI-integrated molecular communication link validated on a benchtop nanomachine testbed representative of subdermal implants. The system employs an indium-gallium-zinc-oxide electrolyte-gated FET (IGZO-EGFET) functionalized with glucose oxidase as a biocompatible receiver, a microfluidic channel with a syringe-pump transmitter using on-off keying (OOK), and a machine-intelligence pipeline that addresses model mismatch and hardware non-idealities. The pipeline integrates: (i) a modular universal decoder robust to vibration-induced noise, chemical delay, and single-tap intersymbol interference; (ii) a lightweight pilot-only synchronizer that estimates symbol intervals; and (iii) a virtual-response generator that augments data and scales symbol duration. Experiments across multiple chips and sessions demonstrate end-to-end chemical text transmission with consistent error-rate reductions compared to naive thresholding and standard neural baselines. By coupling biocompatible hardware with learning-based detection and generative augmentation, this work establishes a practical route toward AI-native nanomachine networks and higher rate molecular links, while providing a system blueprint adaptable to other biochemical modalities.</description>

      <title>On the Effect of Tap Changers and Nonlinear Loads on Voltage Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On 21 June 2024, a severe incident happened in the South-Eastern part of the Continental European power system. After a voltage collapse, large parts of Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as Croatia suffered from a blackout [1]. The initial tripping of two transmission lines resulted in a voltage collapse in these countries. Investigations have shown that a) transformers with on-load tap changers (OLTC) and b) nonlinear loads, in particular air conditioning systems, played a significant role in this event. Motivated by this, we carry out an assessment of the effect of OLTC on voltage stability in the presence of nonlinear loads. By doing this we hope to further shed some light on the potential instability mechanisms that can be triggered in scenarios like the above-mentioned blackout.</description>

      <title>Stability-Aware Joint Communication and Control for Nonlinear Control-Non-Affine Wireless Networked Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the stability of wireless networked control systems (WNCS) with nonlinear and control-non-affine dynamics, where system behavior is nonlinear with respect to both states and control decisions, poses a significant challenge, particularly under limited resources. However, it is essential in the context of 6G, which is expected to support reliable communication to enable real-time autonomous systems. This paper proposes a joint communication and control solution consisting of: i) a deep Koopman model capable of learning and mapping complex nonlinear dynamics into linear representations in an embedding space, predicting missing states, and planning control actions over a future time horizon; and ii) a scheduling algorithm that schedules sensor-controller communication based on Lyapunov optimization, which dynamically allocates communication resources based on system stability and available resources. Control actions are computed within this embedding space using a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) to ensure system stability. The proposed model is evaluated under varying conditions and its performance is compared against two baseline models; one that assumes systems are control-affine, and another that assumes identical control actions in the embedding and original spaces. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms both baselines, by achieving stability while requiring fewer transmissions.</description>

      <title>TREE:Token-Responsive Energy Efficiency Framework For Green AI-Integrated 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As wireless networks evolve toward AI-integrated intelligence, conventional energy-efficiency metrics fail to capture the value of AI tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel EE metric called Token-Responsive Energy Efficiency (TREE), which incorporates the token throughput of large models as network utility carriers into the system utility. Based on this metric, we analyze the design principles of AI-integrated 6G networks from the perspective of three critical AI elements, namely computing power, model and data. Case studies validate TREE's unique capability to expose energy-service asymmetries in hybrid traffic scenarios where conventional metrics prove inadequate. Although it is impossible to determine every design detail of AI-integrated 6G network at current time, we believe that the proposed TREE based framework will help the network operators to quantify the operating energy cost of AI services and continue to evolve towards sustainable 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Domain Characterization of Load Demand from Electrified Highways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrified roadways (ER) equipped with dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) capabilities can patently extend the driving range and reduce the battery size of electric vehicles (EVs). However, due to the spatial arrangement of the transmitter coils in the ER, the DWPT load exhibits frequency content that could excite power system frequency dynamics. In this context, this work aims to study the spectrum of DWPT loads under different traffic conditions. We develop statistical models for EVs moving at constant speeds to identify the location and magnitude of DWPT load harmonics. Our analysis reveals that the fundamental frequency is dependent on the ER coil spacing and the average EV speed. In the worst-case yet unlikely scenario that EVs move in a synchronized fashion, the amplitude of harmonics scales with the number of EVs. On the contrary, when EVs move freely, harmonics scale with the square root of the number of EVs. Platoon formations can accentuate harmonics. We also show that for higher-order harmonics, the spectral content around harmonics decreases in magnitude and increases in bandwidth. Despite the simplified models, our analysis offers valuable insights for ER planners and grid operators. Numerical tests using a traffic simulator corroborate some of these insights.</description>

      <title>Privacy, Informed Consent and the Demand for Anonymisation of Smart Meter Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Access to smart meter data offers system-wide benefits but raises significant privacy concerns due to the personal information it contains. Privacy-preserving techniques could facilitate wider access, though they introduce privacy-utility trade-offs. Understanding consumer valuations for anonymisation can help identify appropriate trade-offs. However, existing studies do not focus on anonymisation specifically or account for information asymmetries regarding privacy risks, raising questions about the validity of informed consent under current regulations.
  We use a mixed-methods approach to estimate non-monetary (willingness-to-share and smart metering demand) and monetary (willingness-to-pay/accept) preferences for anonymisation, based on a representative sample of 965 GB bill payers. An embedded randomised control trial examines the effect of providing information about privacy implications.
  On average, consumers are willing to pay for anonymisation, are more willing to share data when anonymised and less willing to share non-anonymised data once anonymisation is presented as an option. However, a significant minority remains unwilling to adopt smart meters, despite anonymisation. We find strong evidence of information asymmetries that suppress demand for anonymisation and identify substantial variation across demographic and electricity supply characteristics. Qualitative responses corroborate the quantitative findings, underscoring the need for stronger privacy defaults, user-centric design, and consent mechanisms that enable truly informed decisions.</description>

      <title>Newton-Flow Particle Filters based on Generalized Cram\'er Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a recursive particle filter for high-dimensional problems that inherently never degenerates. The state estimate is represented by deterministic low-discrepancy particle sets. We focus on the measurement update step, where a likelihood function is used for representing the measurement and its uncertainty. This likelihood is progressively introduced into the filtering procedure by homotopy continuation over an artificial time. A generalized Cram\'er distance between particle sets is derived in closed form that is differentiable and invariant to particle order. A Newton flow then continually minimizes this distance over artificial time and thus smoothly moves particles from prior to posterior density. The new filter is surprisingly simple to implement and very efficient. It just requires a prior particle set and a likelihood function, never estimates densities from samples, and can be used as a plugin replacement for classic approaches.</description>

      <title>Contact-Aided Navigation of Flexible Robotic Endoscope Using Deep Reinforcement Learning in Dynamic Stomach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigating a flexible robotic endoscope (FRE) through the gastrointestinal tract is critical for surgical diagnosis and treatment. However, navigation in the dynamic stomach is particularly challenging because the FRE must learn to effectively use contact with the deformable stomach walls to reach target locations. To address this, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based Contact-Aided Navigation (CAN) strategy for FREs, leveraging contact force feedback to enhance motion stability and navigation precision. The training environment is established using a physics-based finite element method (FEM) simulation of a deformable stomach. Trained with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, our approach achieves high navigation success rates (within 3 mm error between the FRE's end-effector and target) and significantly outperforms baseline policies. In both static and dynamic stomach environments, the CAN agent achieved a 100% success rate with 1.6 mm average error, and it maintained an 85% success rate in challenging unseen scenarios with stronger external disturbances. These results validate that the DRL-based CAN strategy substantially enhances FRE navigation performance over prior methods.</description>

      <title>Jacobian Exploratory Dual-Phase Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Endoluminal Navigation of Deformable Continuum Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deformable continuum robots (DCRs) present unique planning challenges due to nonlinear deformation mechanics and partial state observability, violating the Markov assumptions of conventional reinforcement learning (RL) methods. While Jacobian-based approaches offer theoretical foundations for rigid manipulators, their direct application to DCRs remains limited by time-varying kinematics and underactuated deformation dynamics. This paper proposes Jacobian Exploratory Dual-Phase RL (JEDP-RL), a framework that decomposes planning into phased Jacobian estimation and policy execution. During each training step, we first perform small-scale local exploratory actions to estimate the deformation Jacobian matrix, then augment the state representation with Jacobian features to restore approximate Markovianity. Extensive SOFA surgical dynamic simulations demonstrate JEDP-RL's three key advantages over proximal policy optimization (PPO) baselines: 1) Convergence speed: 3.2x faster policy convergence, 2) Navigation efficiency: requires 25% fewer steps to reach the target, and 3) Generalization ability: achieve 92% success rate under material property variations and achieve 83% (33% higher than PPO) success rate in the unseen tissue environment.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Relaxation for Multi-Action Partially Observable Restless Bandits: Heuristic Policies and Indexability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partially observable restless multi-armed bandits have found numerous applications including in recommendation systems, communication systems, public healthcare outreach systems, and in operations research. We study multi-action partially observable restless multi-armed bandits, it is a generalization of the classical restless multi-armed bandit problem -- 1) each bandit has finite states, and the current state is not observable, 2) each bandit has finite actions. In particular, we assume that more than two actions are available for each bandit. We motivate our problem with the application of public-health intervention planning. We describe the model and formulate a long term discounted optimization problem, where the state of each bandit evolves according to a Markov process, and this evolution is action dependent. The state of a bandit is not observable but one of finitely many feedback signals are observable. Each bandit yields a reward, based on the action taken on that bandit. The agent is assumed to have a budget constraint. The bandits are assumed to be independent. However, they are weakly coupled at the agent through the budget constraint.
  We first analyze the Lagrangian bound method for our partially observable restless bandits. The computation of optimal value functions for finite-state, finite-action POMDPs is non-trivial. Hence, the computation of Lagrangian bounds is also challenging. We describe approximations for the computation of Lagrangian bounds using point based value iteration (PBVI) and online rollout policy. We further present various properties of the value functions and provide theoretical insights on PBVI and online rollout policy. We study heuristic policies for multi-actions PORMAB. Finally, we discuss present Whittle index policies and their limitations in our model.</description>

      <title>Needle Biopsy And Fiber-Optic Compatible Robotic Insertion Platform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tissue biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing many diseases, involving the extraction of diseased tissue for histopathology analysis by expert pathologists. However, this procedure has two main limitations: 1) Manual sampling through tissue biopsy is prone to inaccuracies; 2) The extraction process is followed by a time-consuming pathology test. To address these limitations, we present a compact, accurate, and maneuverable robotic insertion platform to overcome the limitations in traditional histopathology. Our platform is capable of steering a variety of tools with different sizes, including needle for tissue extraction and optical fibers for vibrational spectroscopy applications. This system facilitates the guidance of end-effector to the tissue and assists surgeons in navigating to the biopsy target area for multi-modal diagnosis. In this paper, we outline the general concept of our device, followed by a detailed description of its mechanical design and control scheme. We conclude with the validation of the system through a series of tests, including positioning accuracy, admittance performance, and tool insertion efficacy.</description>

      <title>Gray-Box Computed Torque Control for Differential-Drive Mobile Robot Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a learning-based nonlinear algorithm for tracking control of differential-drive mobile robots. The Computed Torque Method (CTM) suffers from inaccurate knowledge of system parameters, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms are known for sample inefficiency and weak stability guarantees. The proposed method replaces the black-box policy network of a DRL agent with a gray-box Computed Torque Controller (CTC) to improve sample efficiency and ensure closed-loop stability. This approach enables finding an optimal set of controller parameters for an arbitrary reward function using only a few short learning episodes. The Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm is used for this purpose. Additionally, some controller parameters are constrained to lie within known value ranges, ensuring the RL agent learns physically plausible values. A technique is also applied to enforce a critically damped closed-loop time response. The controller's performance is evaluated on a differential-drive mobile robot simulated in the MuJoCo physics engine and compared against the raw CTC and a conventional kinematic controller.</description>

      <title>Safe and Efficient Lane-Changing for Autonomous Vehicles: An Improved Double Quintic Polynomial Approach with Time-to-Collision Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving technology has made significant advancements in recent years, yet challenges remain in ensuring safe and comfortable interactions with human-driven vehicles (HDVs), particularly during lane-changing maneuvers. This paper proposes an improved double quintic polynomial approach for safe and efficient lane-changing in mixed traffic environments. The proposed method integrates a time-to-collision (TTC) based evaluation mechanism directly into the trajectory optimization process, ensuring that the ego vehicle proactively maintains a safe gap from surrounding HDVs throughout the maneuver. The framework comprises state estimation for both the autonomous vehicle (AV) and HDVs, trajectory generation using double quintic polynomials, real-time TTC computation, and adaptive trajectory evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to embed an analytic TTC penalty directly into the closed-form double-quintic polynomial solver, enabling real-time safety-aware trajectory generation without post-hoc validation. Extensive simulations conducted under diverse traffic scenarios demonstrate the safety, efficiency, and comfort of the proposed approach compared to conventional methods such as quintic polynomials, Bezier curves, and B-splines. The results highlight that the improved method not only avoids collisions but also ensures smooth transitions and adaptive decision-making in dynamic environments. This work bridges the gap between model-based and adaptive trajectory planning approaches, offering a stable solution for real-world autonomous driving applications.</description>

      <title>Vehicle-in-Virtual-Environment (VVE) Method for Developing and Evaluating VRU Safety of Connected and Autonomous Driving with Focus on Bicyclist Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensive research has already been conducted in the autonomous driving field to help vehicles navigate safely and efficiently. At the same time, plenty of current research on vulnerable road user (VRU) safety is performed which largely concentrates on perception, localization, or trajectory prediction of VRUs. However, existing research still exhibits several gaps, including the lack of a unified planning and collision avoidance system for autonomous vehicles, limited investigation into delay tolerant control strategies, and the absence of an efficient and standardized testing methodology. Ensuring VRU safety remains one of the most pressing challenges in autonomous driving, particularly in dynamic and unpredictable environments. In this two year project, we focused on applying the Vehicle in Virtual Environment (VVE) method to develop, evaluate, and demonstrate safety functions for Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) using automated steering and braking of ADS. In this current second year project report, our primary focus was on enhancing the previous year results while also considering bicyclist safety.</description>

      <title>A Risk-aware Spatial-temporal Trajectory Planning Framework for Autonomous Vehicles Using QP-MPC and Dynamic Hazard Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory planning is a critical component in ensuring the safety, stability, and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. While existing trajectory planning methods have achieved progress, they often suffer from high computational costs, unstable performance in dynamic environments, and limited validation across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose an enhanced QP-MPC-based framework that incorporates three key innovations: (i) a novel cost function designed with a dynamic hazard field, which explicitly balances safety, efficiency, and comfort; (ii) seamless integration of this cost function into the QP-MPC formulation, enabling direct optimization of desired driving behaviors; and (iii) extensive validation of the proposed framework across complex tasks. The spatial safe planning is guided by a dynamic hazard field (DHF) for risk assessment, while temporal safe planning is based on a space-time graph. Besides, the quintic polynomial sampling and sub-reward of comforts are used to ensure comforts during lane-changing. The sub-reward of efficiency is used to maintain driving efficiency. Finally, the proposed DHF-enhanced objective function integrates multiple objectives, providing a proper optimization tasks for QP-MPC. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms benchmark optimization methods in terms of efficiency, stability, and comfort across a variety of scenarios likes lane-changing, overtaking, and crossing intersections.</description>

      <title>Dynamic control of stochastic matching systems in heavy traffic: An effective computational method for high-dimensional problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bipartite matching systems arise in many settings where agents or tasks from two distinct sets must be paired dynamically under compatibility constraints. We consider a high-dimensional bipartite matching system under uncertainty and seek an effective dynamic control policy that maximizes the expected discounted total value generated by the matches minus the congestion-related costs. To derive a tractable approximation, we focus attention on balanced, high-volume systems, i.e., the heavy-traffic regime, and derive an approximating Brownian control problem. We then develop a computational method that relies on deep neural network technology for solving this problem. To show the effectiveness of the policy derived from our computational method, we compare it to the benchmark policies available in the extant literature in the context of the original matching problem. In the test problems attempted thus far, our proposed policy outperforms the benchmarks, and its derivation is computationally feasible for dimensions up to 100 or more.</description>

      <title>Controller synthesis method for multi-agent system based on temporal logic specification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controller synthesis is a theoretical approach to the systematic design of discrete event systems. It constructs a controller to provide feedback and control to the system, ensuring it meets specified control specifications. Traditional controller synthesis methods often use formal languages to describe control specifications and are mainly oriented towards single-agent and non-probabilistic systems. With the increasing complexity of systems, the control requirements that need to be satisfied also become more complex. Based on this, this paper proposes a controller synthesis method for semi-cooperative semi-competitive multi-agent probabilistic discrete event systems to solve the controller synthesis problem based on temporal logic specifications. The controller can ensure the satisfaction of specifications to a certain extent. The specification is given in the form of a linear temporal logic formula. This paper designs a controller synthesis algorithm that combines probabilistic model checking. Finally, the effectiveness of this method is verified through a case study.</description>

      <title>Hybrid AI-Driven Intrusion Detection: Framework Leveraging Novel Feature Selection for Enhanced Network Security</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, safeguarding network infrastructures against cyberattacks has become a critical priority. This research presents an innovative AI-driven real-time intrusion detection framework designed to enhance network security, particularly in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Cloud Computing (CC) environments. The system employs classical machine learning models, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors, optimized through the novel Energy Valley Optimization (EVO) method using the NSL-KDD dataset. Feature selection significantly reduced the number of input features from 42 to 18 while maintaining strong detection capabilities. The proposed system achieved 98.95 percent accuracy with Decision Tree, 98.47 percent with K-Nearest Neighbors, and 88.84 percent with Logistic Regression. Moreover, high precision, recall, and F1-scores were attained across all classifiers while substantially reducing training and testing times, making the framework highly suitable for real-time applications. To ensure fair detection across diverse attack types, dataset balancing via downsampling was applied to address class imbalance challenges. This investigation focuses on the significance of advancing intrusion detection systems in cloud computing and WSNs. Overall, this work advances secure communications by delivering a scalable, low-latency, and high-accuracy intrusion detection solution aligned with the latest trends in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and real-time digital networks</description>

      <title>Is Noisy Data a Blessing in Disguise? A Distributionally Robust Optimization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noisy data are often viewed as a challenge for decision-making. This paper studies a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) that shows how such noise can be systematically incorporated. Rather than applying DRO to the noisy empirical distribution, we construct ambiguity sets over the \emph{latent} distribution by centering a Wasserstein ball at the noisy empirical distribution in the observation space and taking its inverse image through a known noise kernel. We validate this inverse-image construction by deriving a tractable convex reformulation and establishing rigorous statistical guarantees, including finite-sample performance and asymptotic consistency. Crucially, we demonstrate that, under mild conditions, noisy data may be a ``blessing in disguise." Our noisy-data DRO model is less conservative than its direct counterpart, leading to provably higher optimal values and a lower price of ambiguity. In the context of fair resource allocation problems, we demonstrate that this robust approach can induce solutions that are structurally more equitable. Our findings suggest that managers can leverage uncertainty by harnessing noise as a source of robustness rather than treating it as an obstacle, producing more robust and strategically balanced decisions.</description>

      <title>On a closed-loop identification challenge in feedback optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feedback optimization has emerged as an effective strategy for steady-state optimization of dynamical systems. By exploiting models of the steady-state input-output sensitivity, methods of this type are often sample efficient, and their use of feedback ensures that they are robust against model error. Still, this robustness has its limitations, and the dependence on a model may hinder convergence in settings with high model error. We investigate here the effect of a particular type of model error: bias due to identifying the model from closed-loop data. Our main results are a sufficient convergence condition, and a converse divergence condition. The convergence condition requires a matrix which depends on the closed-loop sensitivity and a noise-to-signal ratio of the data generating system to be positive definite. The negative definiteness of the same matrix characterizes an extreme case where the bias due to closed-loop data results in divergence of model-based feedback optimization.</description>

Abstract: Conventional ultrasonic inspection systems rely on phased arrays and high-performance computing hardware, making them costly, bulky, and unsuitable for portable or embedded use. In this work, we present nRTIS (nano Real-Time 3D Imaging Sonar), a compact ultrasonic sensing platform built around a circular array of MEMS microphones and a central ultrasonic transducer. The device achieves real-time acquisition through an RP2350 microcontroller and high-speed USB transfer. We validate the system using both simulations and controlled experiments: point spread function (PSF) simulations demonstrate beamforming resolution and sidelobe suppression, while reflector measurements confirm robust data acquisition. These results highlight the potential of nRTIS for scalable industrial applications such as weld inspection, pipe mapping, and robotic navigation.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to system identification for nonlinear input-output models by minimizing the simulation error and formulating it as a constrained optimization problem. This method addresses vanishing gradient issues, enabling faster convergence than traditional gradient-based methods. We present an algorithm that utilizes feedback-linearization controlled multipliers optimization and provide a theoretical analysis of its performance. We prove that the algorithm converges to a local minimum, and we optimize the computational efficiency by leveraging the problem structure. Numerical experiments illustrate that our approach outperforms gradient-based methods in computational effort and accuracy.</description>

Abstract: With artificial intelligence (AI) being applied to bring autonomy to decision-making in safety-critical domains such as the ones typified in the aerospace and emergency-response services, there has been a call to address the ethical implications of structuring those decisions, so they remain reliable and justifiable when human lives are at stake. This paper contributes to addressing the challenge of decision-making by proposing a structured decision-making framework as a foundational step towards responsible AI. The proposed structured decision-making framework is implemented in autonomous decision-making, specifically within disaster management. By introducing concepts of Enabler agents, Levels and Scenarios, the proposed framework's performance is evaluated against systems relying solely on judgement-based insights, as well as human operators who have disaster experience: victims, volunteers, and stakeholders. The results demonstrate that the structured decision-making framework achieves 60.94% greater stability in consistently accurate decisions across multiple Scenarios, compared to judgement-based systems. Moreover, the study shows that the proposed framework outperforms human operators with a 38.93% higher accuracy across various Scenarios. These findings demonstrate the promise of the structured decision-making framework for building more reliable autonomous AI applications in safety-critical contexts.</description>

      <title>Securing Radiation Detection Systems with an Efficient TinyML-Based IDS for Edge Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation Detection Systems (RDSs) play a vital role in ensuring public safety across various settings, from nuclear facilities to medical environments. However, these systems are increasingly vulnerable to cyber-attacks such as data injection, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, ICMP floods, botnet attacks, privilege escalation, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Such threats could compromise the integrity and reliability of radiation measurements, posing significant public health and safety risks. This paper presents a new synthetic radiation dataset and an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) tailored for resource-constrained environments, bringing Machine Learning (ML) predictive capabilities closer to the sensing edge layer of critical infrastructure. Leveraging TinyML techniques, the proposed IDS employs an optimized XGBoost model enhanced with pruning, quantization, feature selection, and sampling. These TinyML techniques significantly reduce the size of the model and computational demands, enabling real-time intrusion detection on low-resource devices while maintaining a reasonable balance between efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Intrusion Detection System for Safeguarding Radiation Detection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation Detection Systems (RDSs) are used to measure and detect abnormal levels of radioactive material in the environment. These systems are used in many applications to mitigate threats posed by high levels of radioactive material. However, these systems lack protection against malicious external attacks to modify the data. The novelty of applying Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in RDSs is a crucial element in safeguarding these critical infrastructures. While IDSs are widely used in networking environments to safeguard against various attacks, their application in RDSs is novel. A common attack on RDSs is Denial of Service (DoS), where the attacker aims to overwhelm the system, causing malfunctioning RDSs. This paper proposes an efficient Machine Learning (ML)-based IDS to detect anomalies in radiation data, focusing on DoS attacks. This work explores the use of sampling methods to create a simulated DoS attack based on a real radiation dataset, followed by an evaluation of various ML algorithms, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), logistic regression, and Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM), to detect DoS attacks on RDSs. LightGBM is emphasized for its superior accuracy and low computational resource consumption, making it particularly suitable for real-time intrusion detection. Additionally, model optimization and TinyML techniques, including feature selection, parallel execution, and random search methods, are used to improve the efficiency of the proposed IDS. Finally, an optimized and efficient LightGBM-based IDS is developed to achieve accurate intrusion detection for RDSs.</description>

      <title>Learning to Coordinate: Distributed Meta-Trajectory Optimization Via Differentiable ADMM-DDP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed trajectory optimization via ADMM-DDP is a powerful approach for coordinating multi-agent systems, but it requires extensive tuning of tightly coupled hyperparameters that jointly govern local task performance and global coordination. In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general framework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight agent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent configurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in a distributed manner. It also enables efficient meta-gradient computation by reusing DDP components such as Riccati recursions and feedback gains. These gradients correspond to the optimal solutions of distributed matrix-valued LQR problems, coordinated across agents via an auxiliary ADMM framework that becomes convex under mild assumptions. Training is further accelerated by truncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for rapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a challenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and adapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up to $88\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>A QoS Framework for Service Provision in Multi-Infrastructure-Sharing Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for resource provisioning with QoS guarantees in shared infrastructure networks. Our novel framework provides tunable probabilistic service guarantees for throughput and delay. Key to our approach is a Modified Dirft-plus-Penalty (MDP) policy that ensures long-term stability while capturing short-term probabilistic service guarantees using linearized upper-confidence bounds. We characterize the feasible region of service guarantees and show that our MDP procedure achieves mean rate stability and an optimality gap that vanishes with the frame size over which service guarantees are provided. Finally, empirical simulations validate our theory and demonstrate the favorable performance of our algorithm in handling QoS in multi-infrastructure networks.</description>

      <title>Designing a Layered Framework to Secure Data via Improved Multi Stage Lightweight Cryptography in IoT Cloud Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel multi-layered hybrid security approach aimed at enhancing lightweight encryption for IoT-Cloud systems. The primary goal is to overcome limitations inherent in conventional solutions such as TPA, Blockchain, ECDSA and ZSS which often fall short in terms of data protection, computational efficiency and scalability. Our proposed method strategically refines and integrates these technologies to address their shortcomings while maximizing their individual strengths. By doing so we create a more reliable and high-performance framework for secure data exchange across heterogeneous environments. The model leverages the combined potential of emerging technologies, particularly Blockchain, IoT and Cloud computing which when effectively coordinated offer significant advancements in security architecture. The proposed framework consists of three core layers: (1) the H.E.EZ Layer which integrates improved versions of Hyperledger Fabric, Enc-Block and a hybrid ECDSA-ZSS scheme to improve encryption speed, scalability and reduce computational cost; (2) the Credential Management Layer independently verifying data integrity and authenticity; and (3) the Time and Auditing Layer designed to reduce traffic overhead and optimize performance across dynamic workloads. Evaluation results highlight that the proposed solution not only strengthens security but also significantly improves execution time, communication efficiency and system responsiveness, offering a robust path forward for next-generation IoT-Cloud infrastructures.</description>

      <title>An intrusion detection system in internet of things using grasshopper optimization algorithm and machine learning algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a foundational paradigm supporting a range of applications, including healthcare, education, agriculture, smart homes, and, more recently, enterprise systems. However, significant advancements in IoT networks have been impeded by security vulnerabilities and threats that, if left unaddressed, could hinder the deployment and operation of IoT based systems. Detecting unwanted activities within the IoT is crucial, as it directly impacts confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Consequently, intrusion detection has become a fundamental research area and the focus of numerous studies. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is essential to the IoTs alarm mechanisms, enabling effective security management. This paper examines IoT security and introduces an intelligent two-layer intrusion detection system for IoT. Machine learning techniques power the system's intelligence, with a two layer structure enhancing intrusion detection. By selecting essential features, the system maintains detection accuracy while minimizing processing overhead. The proposed method for intrusion detection in IoT is implemented in two phases. In the first phase, the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) is applied for feature selection. In the second phase, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is used to detect intrusions. The method was implemented in MATLAB, and the NSLKDD dataset was used for evaluation. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves accuracy compared to other approaches.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Applicability of Emulated Virtual Circuits for Tokamak Plasma Shape Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has recently been adopted to emulate sensitivity matrices for real-time magnetic control of tokamak plasmas. However, these approaches would benefit from a quantification of possible inaccuracies. We report on two aspects of real-time applicability of emulators. First, we quantify the agreement of target displacement from VCs computed via Jacobians of the shape emulators with those from finite differences Jacobians on exact Grad-Shafranov solutions. Good agreement ($\approx$5-10%) can be achieved on a selection of geometric targets using combinations of neural network emulators with $\approx10^5$ parameters. A sample of $\approx10^{5}-10^{6}$ synthetic equilibria is essential to train emulators that are not over-regularised or overfitting. Smaller models trained on the shape targets may be further fine-tuned to better fit the Jacobians. Second, we address the effect of vessel currents that are not directly measured in real-time and are typically subsumed into effective "shaping currents" when designing virtual circuits. We demonstrate that shaping currents can be inferred via simple linear regression on a trailing window of active coil current measurements with residuals of only a few Amp\`eres, enabling a choice for the most appropriate shaping currents at any point in a shot. While these results are based on historic shot data and simulations tailored to MAST-U, they indicate that emulators with few-millisecond latency can be developed for robust real-time plasma shape control in existing and upcoming tokamaks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrusion detection in unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) swarms is complicated by high mobility, non-stationary traffic, and severe class imbalance. Leveraging a 120 k-flow simulation corpus that covers five attack types, we benchmark three quantum-machine-learning (QML) approaches - quantum kernels, variational quantum neural networks (QNNs), and hybrid quantum-trained neural networks (QT-NNs) - against strong classical baselines. All models consume an 8-feature flow representation and are evaluated under identical preprocessing, balancing, and noise-model assumptions. We analyse the influence of encoding strategy, circuit depth, qubit count, and shot noise, reporting accuracy, macro-F1, ROC-AUC, Matthews correlation, and quantum-resource footprints. Results reveal clear trade-offs: quantum kernels and QT-NNs excel in low-data, nonlinear regimes, while deeper QNNs suffer from trainability issues, and CNNs dominate when abundant data offset their larger parameter count. The complete codebase and dataset partitions are publicly released to enable reproducible QML research in network security.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One might argue that solving a trajectory optimization problem over a million grid points is preposterous. How about solving such a problem at an incredibly fast computational time? On a small form-factor processor? Algorithmic details that make possible this trifecta of breakthroughs are presented in this paper. The computational mathematics that deliver these advancements are: (i) a Birkhoff-theoretic discretization of optimal control problems, (ii) matrix-free linear algebra leveraging Krylov-subspace methods, and (iii) a near-perfect Birkhoff preconditioner that helps achieve $\mathcal{O}(1)$ iteration speed with respect to the grid size,~$N$. A key enabler of this high performance is the computation of Birkhoff matrix-vector products at $\mathcal{O}(N\log(N))$ time using fast Fourier transform techniques that eliminate traditional computational bottlenecks. A numerical demonstration of this unprecedented scale and speed is illustrated for a practical astrodynamics problem.</description>

      <title>Semi-on-Demand Transit Feeders with Shared Autonomous Vehicles and Reinforcement-Learning-Based Zonal Dispatching Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a semi-on-demand transit feeder service using shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) and zonal dispatching control based on reinforcement learning (RL). This service combines the cost-effectiveness of fixed-route transit with the adaptability of demand-responsive transport to improve accessibility in lower-density areas. Departing from the terminus, SAVs first make scheduled fixed stops, then offer on-demand pick-ups and drop-offs in a pre-determined flexible-route area. Our deep RL model dynamically assigns vehicles to subdivided flexible-route zones in response to real-time demand fluctuations and operations, using a policy gradient algorithm - Proximal Policy Optimization. The methodology is demonstrated through agent-based simulations on a real-world bus route in Munich, Germany. Results show that after efficient training of the RL model, the semi-on-demand service with dynamic zonal control serves 16% more passengers at 13% higher generalized costs on average compared to traditional fixed-route service. The efficiency gain brought by RL control brings 2.4% more passengers at 1.4% higher costs. This study not only showcases the potential of integrating SAV feeders and machine learning techniques into public transit, but also sets the groundwork for further innovations in addressing first-mile-last-mile problems in multimodal transit systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous aerial vehicles, such as NASA's Ingenuity, enable rapid planetary surface exploration beyond the reach of ground-based robots. Thus, NASA is studying a Mars Science Helicopter (MSH), an advanced concept capable of performing long-range science missions and autonomously navigating challenging Martian terrain. Given significant Earth-Mars communication delays and mission complexity, an advanced autonomy framework is required to ensure safe and efficient operation by continuously adapting behavior based on mission objectives and real-time conditions, without human intervention. This study presents a deterministic high-level control framework for aerial exploration, integrating a Finite State Machine (FSM) with Behavior Trees (BTs) to achieve a scalable, robust, and computationally efficient autonomy solution for critical scenarios like deep space exploration. In this paper we outline key capabilities of a possible MSH and detail the FSM-BT hybrid autonomy framework which orchestrates them to achieve the desired objectives. Monte Carlo simulations and real field tests validate the framework, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability to both discrete events and real-time system feedback. These inputs trigger state transitions or dynamically adjust behavior execution, enabling reactive and context-aware responses. The framework is middleware-agnostic, supporting integration with systems like F-Prime and extending beyond aerial robotics.</description>

      <title>Green Traffic Engineering for Satellite Networks Using Segment Routing Flexible Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale low-Earth-orbit (LEO) constellations demand routing that simultaneously minimizes energy, guarantees delivery under congestion, and meets latency requirements for time-critical flows. We present a segment routing over IPv6 (SRv6) flexible algorithm (Flex-Algo) framework that consists of three logical slices: an energy-efficient slice (Algo 130), a high-reliability slice (Algo 129), and a latency-sensitive slice (Algo 128). The framework provides a unified mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that combines satellite CPU power, packet delivery rate (PDR), and end-to-end latency into a single objective, allowing a lightweight software-defined network (SDN) controller to steer traffic from the source node. Emulation of Telesat's Lightspeed constellation shows that, compared with different routing schemes, the proposed design reduces the average CPU usage by 73%, maintains a PDR above 91% during traffic bursts, and decreases urgent flow delay by 18 ms between Ottawa and Vancouver. The results confirm Flex-Algo's value as a slice-based traffic engineering (TE) tool for resource-constrained satellite networks.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Navigation Strategy for Low-Thrust Proximity Operations in Circular Relative Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive observer-based navigation strategy for spacecraft in Circular Relative Orbit (CRO) scenarios, addressing challenges in proximity operations like formation flight and uncooperative target inspection. The proposed method adjusts observer gains based on the estimated state to achieve fast convergence and low noise sensitivity in state estimation. A Lyapunov-based analysis ensures stability and accuracy, while simulations using vision-based sensor data validate the approach under realistic conditions. Compared to classical observers with time-invariant gains, the proposed method enhances trajectory tracking precision and reduces control input switching, making it a promising solution for autonomous spacecraft localization and control.</description>

      <title>Guidance and Control Neural Network Acceleration using Memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the space community has been exploring the possibilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), for a variety of on board applications. However, this development is limited by the restricted energy budget of smallsats and cubesats as well as radiation concerns plaguing modern chips. This necessitates research into neural network accelerators capable of meeting these requirements whilst satisfying the compute and performance needs of the application. This paper explores the use of Phase-Change Memory (PCM) and Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM) memristors for on-board in-memory computing AI acceleration in space applications. A guidance and control neural network (G\&amp;CNET) accelerated using memristors is simulated in a variety of scenarios and with both device types to evaluate the performance of memristor-based accelerators, considering device non-idealities such as noise and conductance drift. We show that the memristive accelerator is able to learn the expert actions, though challenges remain with the impact of noise on accuracy. We also show that re-training after degradation is able to restore performance to nominal levels. This study provides a foundation for future research into memristor-based AI accelerators for space, highlighting their potential and the need for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Constrained Stabilization on the n-Sphere with Conic and Star-shaped Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of constrained stabilization on the n-sphere under star-shaped constraints is considered. We propose a control strategy that allows to almost globally steer the state to a desired location while avoiding star-shaped constraints on the n-sphere. Depending on the state's proximity to the unsafe regions, the state is either guided towards the target location along the geodesic connecting the target to the state or steered towards the antipode of a predefined point lying in the interior of the nearest unsafe region. We prove that the target location is almost globally asymptotically stable under the proposed continuous, time-invariant feedback control law. Nontrivial simulation results on the 2-sphere and the 3-sphere demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Information in Incentive Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incentive design deals with interaction between a principal and an agent where the former can shape the latter's utility through a policy commitment. It is well known that the principal faces an information rent when dealing with an agent that has informational advantage. In this work, we embark on a systematic study of the effect of information asymmetry in incentive design games. Specifically, we first demonstrate that it is in principal's interest to decrease this information asymmetry. To mitigate this uncertainty, we let the principal gather information either by letting the agent shape her belief (aka Information Design), or by paying to acquire it. Providing solutions to all these cases we show that while introduction of uncertainty increases the principal's cost, letting the agent shape its belief can be advantageous. We study information asymmetry and information acquisition in both matrix games and quadratic Gaussian game setups.</description>

      <title>Topology Inference for Network Systems with Unknown Inputs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.03964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topology inference is a powerful tool to better understand the behaviours of network systems (NSs). Different from most of prior works, this paper is dedicated to inferring the directed topology of NSs from noisy observations, where the nodes are influenced by unknown time-varying inputs. These inputs can be actively injected signals by the user, intrinsic system noises or extrinsic environment interference. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose a two-stage inference scheme to overcome the influence of the inputs. First, by leveraging the second-order difference of the state evolution, we establish a judging criterion to detect the input injection time and provide the probability guarantees. With this injection time to determine available observations, an initial topology is accordingly inferred to further facilitate the input estimation. Second, utilizing the stability characteristic of the system response, a recursive input filtering algorithm is designed to approximate the zero-input response, which directly reflects the topology structure. Then, we construct a decreasing-weight based optimization problem to infer the final network topology from the approximated response. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.09945v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of dynamical networks modeled by linear and time-invariant systems which are described by state-space realizations. For these networks, we investigate the relations between various types of factorizations which preserve the structure of their component subsystems' interconnection. In doing so, we provide tractable means of shifting between different types of sparsity-preserving representations and we show how to employ these factorizations to obtain distributed implementations for stabilizing and possibly stable controllers. By formulating all these results for both discrete- and continuous-time systems, we develop specialized distributed implementations that, up to this point, were only available for networks modeled as discrete-time systems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive control of dynamic networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world network systems are inherently dynamic, with network topologies undergoing continuous changes over time. Previous works often focus on static networks or rely on complete prior knowledge of evolving topologies, whereas real-world networks typically undergo stochastic structural changes that are difficult to predict in advance. To address this challenge, we define the adaptive control problem and propose an adaptive control algorithm to reduce the extra control cost caused by driver node switching. We introduce a node-level adaptive control metric to capture both the stability and consistency of each node across historical topologies. By integrating this metric with a partial matching repair strategy, our algorithm adjusts the minimum driver node set in real time at each snapshot, while minimizing unnecessary reconfigurations between consecutive time steps. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world dynamic networks demonstrate that the proposed adaptive control algorithm significantly outperforms the existing algorithm, reducing the switching cost by an average of 22% in synthetic networks and 19\% in real-world networks, without requiring foreknowledge of the future evolution of the network. These findings extend the theoretical scope of dynamic network controllability and open new avenues for practical applications in transportation, social, and molecular regulatory systems.</description>

      <title>Learning disturbance models for offset-free reference tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a nonlinear control framework that guarantees asymptotic offset-free tracking of generic reference trajectories by learning a nonlinear disturbance model, which compensates for input disturbances and model-plant mismatch. Our approach generalizes the well-established method of using an observer to estimate a constant disturbance to allow tracking constant setpoints with zero steady-state error. In this paper, the disturbance model is generalized to a nonlinear static function of the plant's state and command input, learned online, so as to perfectly track time-varying reference trajectories under certain assumptions on the model and provided that future reference samples are available. We compare our approach with the classical constant disturbance model in numerical simulations, showing its superiority.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Control Koopman Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07312v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Koopman composition operator representation framework for control systems in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) that is free of explicit dictionary or input parametrizations. By establishing fundamental equivalences between different model representations, we are able to close the gap of control system operator learning and infinite-dimensional regression, enabling various empirical estimators and the connection to the well-understood learning theory in RKHSs under one unified framework. Consequently, our proposed framework allows for arbitrarily accurate finite-rank approximations in infinite-dimensional spaces and leads to finite-dimensional predictors without apriori restrictions to a finite span of functions or inputs. To enable applications to high-dimensional control systems, we improve the scalability of our proposed control Koopman operator estimates by utilizing sketching techniques. Numerical experiments demonstrate superior prediction accuracy compared to bilinear EDMD, especially in high dimensions. Finally, we show that our learned models are readily interfaced with linear-parameter-varying techniques for model predictive control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first general stability results for nonlinear offset-free model predictive control (MPC). Despite over twenty years of active research, the offset-free MPC literature has not shaken the assumption of closed-loop stability for establishing offset-free performance. In this paper, we present a nonlinear offset-free MPC design that is robustly stable with respect to the tracking errors, and thus achieves offset-free performance, despite plant-model mismatch and persistent disturbances. Key features and assumptions of this design include quadratic costs, differentiability of the plant and model functions, constraint backoffs at steady state, and a robustly stable state and disturbance estimator. We first establish nominal stability and offset-free performance. Then, robustness to state and disturbance estimate errors and setpoint and disturbance changes is demonstrated. Finally, the results are extended to sufficiently small plant-model mismatch. The results are illustrated by numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: We study singularly perturbed systems that exhibit input-to-state stability (ISS) with fixed-time properties in the presence of bounded disturbances. In these systems, solutions converge to the origin within a time frame independent of initial conditions when undisturbed, and to a vicinity of the origin when subjected to bounded disturbances. First, we extend the traditional composite Lyapunov method, commonly applied in singular perturbation theory to analyze asymptotic stability, to include fixed-time ISS. We demonstrate that if both the reduced system and the boundary layer system exhibit fixed-time ISS, and if certain interconnection conditions are met, the entire multi-time scale system retains this fixed-time ISS characteristic, provided the separation of time scales is sufficiently pronounced. Next, we illustrate our findings via analytical and numerical examples, including a novel application in fixed-time feedback optimization for dynamic plants with slowly varying cost functions.</description>

      <title>A Review of Hydrogen-Enabled Resilience Enhancement for Multi-Energy Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring resilience in multi-energy systems (MESs) becomes both more urgent and more challenging due to the rising occurrence and severity of extreme events (e.g., natural disasters, extreme weather, and cyber-physical attacks). Among many measures of strengthening MES resilience, the integration of hydrogen shows exceptional potential in cross-temporal flexibility, cross-spatial flexibility, cross-sector flexibility, and black start capability. Although many hydrogen-enabled MES resilience enhancement measures have been developed, the current literature lacks a systematic overview of hydrogen-enabled resilience enhancement in MESs. To fill the research gap, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of hydrogen-enabled MES resilience enhancement. First, advantages and challenges of adopting hydrogen in MES resilience enhancement are summarized. Then, we propose a resilience enhancement framework for hydrogen-enabled MESs. Under the proposed framework, existing resilience metrics and event-oriented contingency models are summarized and discussed. Furthermore, we classify hydrogen-enabled planning measures by the types of hydrogen-related facilities and provide some insights for planning problem formulation frameworks. Moreover, we categorize the hydrogen-enabled operation enhancement measures into three operation response stages: preventive, emergency, and restoration. Finally, we identify some research gaps and point out possible future directions in aspects of comprehensive resilience metric design, temporally-correlated event-targeted scenario generation, multi-type temporal-spatial cyber-physical contingency modeling under compound extreme events, multi-network multi-timescale coordinated planning and operation, low-carbon resilient planning and operation, and large language model-assisted whole-process resilience enhancement.</description>

      <title>Best Response Convergence for Zero-sum Stochastic Dynamic Games with Partial and Asymmetric Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze best response dynamics for finding a Nash equilibrium of an infinite horizon zero-sum stochastic linear quadratic dynamic game (LQDG) with partial and asymmetric information. We derive explicit expressions for each player's best response within the class of pure linear dynamic output feedback control strategies where the internal state dimension of each control strategy is an integer multiple of the system state dimension. With each best response, the players form increasingly higher-order belief states, leading to infinite-dimensional internal states. However, we observe in extensive numerical experiments that the game's value converges after just a few iterations, suggesting that strategies associated with increasingly higher-order belief states eventually provide no benefit. To help explain this convergence, our numerical analysis reveals rapid decay of the controllability and observability Gramian eigenvalues and Hankel singular values in higher-order belief dynamics, indicating that the higher-order belief dynamics become increasingly difficult for both players to control and observe. Consequently, the higher-order belief dynamics can be closely approximated by low-order belief dynamics with bounded error, and thus feedback strategies with limited internal state dimension can closely approximate a Nash equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Lane Planning for Connected Electric Vehicles in Urban Traffic: Design and Vehicle-in-the-Loop Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban driving with connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) offers potential for energy savings, yet most eco-driving strategies focus solely on longitudinal speed control within a single lane. This neglects the significant impact of lateral decisions, such as lane changes, on overall energy efficiency, especially in environments with traffic signals and heterogeneous traffic flow. To address this gap, we propose a novel energy-aware motion planning framework that jointly optimizes longitudinal speed and lateral lane-change decisions using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. Our approach estimates long-term energy costs using a graph-based approximation and solves short-horizon optimal control problems under traffic constraints. Using a data-driven energy model calibrated to an actual battery electric vehicle, we demonstrate with vehicle-in-the-loop experiments that our method reduces motion energy consumption by up to 24 percent compared to a human driver, highlighting the potential of connectivity-enabled planning for sustainable urban autonomy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a generalized excitable system in which spikes can happen in a continuum of directions, therefore drastically enriching the expressivity and control capability of the spiking dynamics. In this generalized excitable system, spiking trajectories happen in a Hilbert space with an excitable resting state at the origin and spike responses that can be triggered in any direction as a function of the system's state and inputs. State-dependence of the spiking direction provide the system with a vanishing spiking memory trace, which enables robust tracking and integration of inputs in the spiking direction history. The model exhibits generalized forms of both Hodgkin's Type I and Type II excitability, capturing their usual bifurcation behaviors in an abstract setting. When used as the controller of a two-dimensional navigation task, this model facilitates both the sparseness of the actuation and its sensitivity to environmental inputs. These results highlight the potential of the proposed generalized excitable model for excitable control in high- and infinite-dimensional spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a targeted exploration strategy for the non-asymptotic, finite-time case. The proposed strategy is applicable to uncertain linear time-invariant systems subject to sub-Gaussian disturbances. As the main result, the proposed approach provides a priori guarantees, ensuring that the optimized exploration inputs achieve a desired accuracy of the model parameters. The technical derivation of the strategy (i) leverages existing non-asymptotic identification bounds with self-normalized martingales, (ii) utilizes spectral lines to predict the effect of sinusoidal excitation, and (iii) effectively accounts for spectral transient error and parametric uncertainty. A numerical example illustrates how the finite exploration time influence the required exploration energy.</description>

      <title>Robust MPC for Uncertain Linear Systems - Combining Model Adaptation and Iterative Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a robust adaptive learning Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for linear systems with parametric uncertainties and additive disturbances performing iterative tasks. The approach refines the parameter estimates online using set-membership estimation. Performance enhancement over iterations is achieved by learning the terminal cost from data. Safety is enforced using a terminal set, which is also learned iteratively. The proposed method guarantees recursive feasibility, constraint satisfaction, and a robust bound on the closed-loop cost. Numerical simulations on a mass-spring-damper system demonstrate improved computational efficiency and control performance compared to a robust adaptive MPC scheme without iterative learning of the terminal ingredients.</description>

      <title>Sampled-data Systems: Stability, Contractivity and Single-iteration Suboptimal MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the stability of interconnected continuous-time (CT) and discrete-time (DT) systems coupled through sampling and zero-order hold mechanisms. The DT system updates its output at regular intervals $T&gt;0$ by applying an $n$-fold composition of a given map. This setup is motivated by online and sampled-data implementations of optimization-based controllers - particularly model predictive control (MPC) - where the DT system models $n$ iterations of an algorithm approximating the solution of an optimization problem.
  We introduce the concept of a reduced model, defined as the limiting behavior of the sampled-data system as $T \to 0^+$ and $n \to +\infty$. Our main theoretical contribution establishes that when the reduced model is contractive, there exists a threshold duration $T(n)$ for each iteration count $n$ such that the CT-DT interconnection achieves exponential stability for all sampling periods $T &lt; T(n)$. Finally, under the stronger condition that both the CT and DT systems are contractive, we show exponential stability of their interconnection using a small-gain argument. Our theoretical results provide new insights into suboptimal MPC stability, showing that convergence guarantees hold even when using a single iteration of the optimization algorithm - a practically significant finding for real-time control applications.</description>

      <title>Current trends and future directions in event-based control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The defining characteristic of event-based control is that feedback loops are only closed when indicated by a triggering condition that takes recent information about the system into account. This stands in contrast to periodic control where the feedback loop is closed periodically. Benefits of event-based control arise when sampling comes at a cost, which occurs, e.g., for Networked Control Systems or in other setups with resource constraints. A rapidly growing number of publications deals with event-based control. Nevertheless, some fundamental questions about event-based control are still unsolved. In this article, we provide an overview of current research trends in event-based control. We focus on results that aim for a better understanding of effects that occur in feedback loops with event-based control. Based on this summary, we identify important open directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Unit Commitment Framework for Nuclear Reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear reactors are often modeled as inflexible baseload generators with fixed downtimes and restrictive ramping constraints. In practice, however, a reactor's operational flexibility is closely tied to its fuel cycle and associated reactivity margin. A key physical constraint for power maneuverability is xenon poisoning, caused from the transient buildup of neutron-absorbing xenon following a power reduction. This transient can delay or prevent subsequent power ramp-up due to suppressed core reactivity. Additionally, if a reactor is shutdown during periods of low reactivity, restart times can vary significantly, leading to prolonged downtimes. This work introduces a physics-informed modeling framework that embeds fuel cycle dynamics within a unit commitment (UC) formulation. The framework tracks reactivity margin, dynamically enforces xenon induced constraints, and endogenously schedules refueling outages based on core conditions. By capturing intracycle reactivity evolution, the model enables operation dependent nuclear dispatch that reflects both techno-economic requirements and irreducible nuclear physics limits. Application to a representative reactor fleet shows that flexible operation can slow reactivity degradation and extend fuel cycles. Results further demonstrate that different operational modes substantially affect VRE utilization, curtailment, and nuclear fleet capacity factors. These findings highlight the importance of fuel cycle aware flexibility modeling for accurate reactor scheduling and integration of nuclear power into energy system models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the automated abstraction-based synthesis of correct-by-construction control policies for stochastic dynamical systems with unknown dynamics. Our approach is to learn an abstraction from sampled data, which is represented in the form of a finite Markov decision process (MDP). In this paper, we present a data-driven technique for constructing finite-state interval MDP (IMDP) abstractions of stochastic systems with unknown nonlinear dynamics. As a distinguishing and novel feature, our technique only requires (1) noisy state-input-state observations and (2) an upper bound on the system's Lipschitz constant. Combined with standard model-checking techniques, our IMDP abstractions enable the synthesis of policies that satisfy probabilistic temporal properties (such as "reach-while-avoid") with a predefined confidence. Our experimental results show the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Distributed Safety-Critical MPC for Multi-Agent Formation Control and Obstacle Avoidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For nonlinear multi-agent systems with high relative degrees, achieving formation control and obstacle avoidance in a distributed manner remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose a novel distributed safety-critical model predictive control (DSMPC) algorithm that incorporates discrete-time high-order control barrier functions (DHCBFs) to enforce safety constraints, alongside discrete-time control Lyapunov functions (DCLFs) to establish terminal constraints. To facilitate distributed implementation, we develop estimated neighbor states for formulating DHCBFs and DCLFs, while also devising a bound constraint to limit estimation errors and ensure convergence. Additionally, we provide theoretical guarantees regarding the feasibility and stability of the proposed DSMPC algorithm based on a mild assumption. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evidenced by the simulation results, demonstrating improved performance and reduced computation time compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Combined Stochastic and Robust Optimization for Electric Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand with Nested Benders Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electrification and automation of mobility are reshaping how cities operate on-demand transport systems. Managing Electric Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (EAMoD) fleets effectively requires coordinating dispatch, rebalancing, and charging decisions under multiple uncertainties, including travel demand, travel time, energy consumption, and charger availability. We address this challenge with a combined stochastic and robust model predictive control (MPC) framework. The framework integrates spatio-temporal Bayesian neural network forecasts with a multi-stage stochastic optimization model, formulated as a large-scale mixed-integer linear program. To ensure real-time applicability, we develop a tailored Nested Benders Decomposition that exploits the scenario tree structure and enables efficient parallelized solution. Stochastic optimization is employed to anticipate demand and infrastructure variability, while robust constraints on energy consumption and travel times safeguard feasibility under worst-case realizations. We evaluate the framework using high-fidelity simulations of San Francisco and Chicago. Compared with deterministic, reactive, and robust baselines, the combined stochastic and robust approach reduces median passenger waiting times by up to 36% and 95th-percentile delays by nearly 20%, while also lowering rebalancing distance by 27% and electricity costs by more than 35%. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis of battery size and vehicle efficiency, finding that energy-efficient vehicles maintain stable performance even with small batteries, whereas less efficient vehicles require larger batteries and greater infrastructure support. Our results emphasize the importance of jointly optimizing predictive control, vehicle capabilities, and infrastructure planning to enable scalable, cost-efficient EAMoD operations.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Dead-Zone Dual Sliding Mode Observer for Reliable Electrochemical Model-Based SOC Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate state of charge (SOC) estimation is critical for ensuring the safety, reliability, and efficiency of lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles and energy storage systems. Electrochemical models provide high fidelity for SOC estimation but introduce challenges due to parameter variations, nonlinearities, and computational complexity. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive dead-zone dual sliding mode observer(SMO) based on an improved electrochemical single-particle model. The algorithm integrates a state observer for SOC estimation and a parameter observer for online parameter adaptation. A Lyapunov-derived adaptive dead-zone is introduced to ensure stability, activating parameter updates only when the terminal voltage error lies within a rigorously defined bound. The proposed method was validated under constant-current and UDDS dynamic conditions. Results demonstrate that the adaptive dead-zone dual SMO achieves superior accuracy compared with conventional dual SMO and equivalent circuit model-based EKF methods, maintaining SOC estimation errors within 0.2% under correct initialization and below 1% under a 30% initial SOC error, with rapid convergence. Computational efficiency analysis further shows that the adaptive dead-zone dual sliding mode observer reduces execution time compared with the conventional dual SMO by limiting unnecessary parameter updates, highlighting its suitability for real-time battery management applications. Moreover, robustness under battery aging was confirmed using a cycle-aging model, where the adaptive dead-zone dual SMO maintained stable SOC estimation despite parameter drift. These findings indicate that the proposed method offers a reliable, accurate, and computationally efficient solution for SOC estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The safe and efficient operation of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) in complex environments, such as manufacturing, logistics, and agriculture, necessitates accurate multi-object tracking and predictive collision avoidance. This paper presents algorithms and techniques for addressing these challenges using Lidar sensor data, emphasizing ensemble Kalman filter. The developed predictive collision avoidance algorithm employs the data provided by lidar sensors to track multiple objects and predict their velocities and future positions, enabling the AMR to navigate safely and effectively. A modification to the dynamic windowing approach is introduced to enhance the performance of the collision avoidance system. The overall system architecture encompasses object detection, multi-object tracking, and predictive collision avoidance control. The experimental results, obtained from both simulation and real-world data, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in various scenarios, which lays the foundation for future research on global planners, other controllers, and the integration of additional sensors. This thesis contributes to the ongoing development of safe and efficient autonomous systems in complex and dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>A First-Order Gradient Approach for the Connectivity Optimization of Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11744v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphs are commonly used to model various complex systems, including social networks, power grids, transportation networks, and biological systems. In many applications, the connectivity of these networks can be expressed through the Mean First Passage Times (MFPTs) of a Markov chain modeling a random walker on the graph. In this paper, we generalize the network metrics based on Markov chains' MFPTs and extend them to networks affected by uncertainty, in which edges may fail and hence not be present according to a pre-determined stochastic model. To find optimally connected Markov chains, we present a parameterization-free method for optimizing the MFPTs of the Markov chain. More specifically, we present an efficient Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm in the context of Markov chain optimization. The proposed algorithm is suitable for both fixed and random networks. Using various numerical experiments, we demonstrate scalability compared to established benchmarks. Importantly, our algorithm finds an optimal solution without requiring prior knowledge of edge failure probabilities, allowing for an online optimization approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10486v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider multi-agent systems with cooperative interactions and study the convergence to consensus in the case of time-dependent connections, with possible communication failure.
  We prove a new condition ensuring consensus: we define a graph in which directed arrows correspond to connection functions that converge (in the weak sense) to some function with a positive integral on all intervals of the form $[t,+\infty)$. If the graph has a node reachable from all other indices, i.e.~``globally reachable'', then the system converges to consensus. We show that this requirement generalizes some known sufficient conditions for convergence, such as Moreau's or the Persistent Excitation one. We also give a second new condition, transversal to the known ones: total connectedness of the undirected graph formed by the non-vanishing of limiting functions.</description>

      <title>Safety-Critical Human-Machine Shared Driving for Vehicle Collision Avoidance based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Road safety continues to be a pressing global issue, with vehicle collisions imposing significant human, societal, and economic burdens. Human-machine shared collision avoidance in critical collision scenarios aims to aid drivers' accident avoidance through intervening only when necessary. Existing methods count on replanning collision-free trajectories and imposing human-machine tracking, which usually interrupts the driver's intent and increases the risk of conflict. This paper introduces a Reachability-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for shared control, guided by Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis. Machine intervention is activated only when the vehicle approaches the Collision Avoidance Reachable Set (CARS), which represents states where collision is unavoidable. First, we precompute the reachability distributions and the CARS by solving the Bellman equation using offline data. To reduce human-machine conflicts, we develop a driver model for sudden obstacles and propose an authority allocation strategy considering key collision avoidance features. Finally, we train a RL agent to reduce human-machine conflicts while enforcing the hard constraint of avoiding entry into the CARS. The proposed method was tested on a real vehicle platform. Results show that the controller intervenes effectively near CARS to prevent collisions while maintaining improved original driving task performance. Robustness analysis further supports its flexibility across different driver attributes.</description>

      <title>Sim-to-Real Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Based Dexterous Manipulation on Humanoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning generalizable robot manipulation policies, especially for complex multi-fingered humanoids, remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches primarily rely on extensive data collection and imitation learning, which are expensive, labor-intensive, and difficult to scale. Sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative, but has mostly succeeded in simpler state-based or single-hand setups. How to effectively extend this to vision-based, contact-rich bimanual manipulation tasks remains an open question. In this paper, we introduce a practical sim-to-real RL recipe that trains a humanoid robot to perform three challenging dexterous manipulation tasks: grasp-and-reach, box lift and bimanual handover. Our method features an automated real-to-sim tuning module, a generalized reward formulation based on contact and object goals, a divide-and-conquer policy distillation framework, and a hybrid object representation strategy with modality-specific augmentation. We demonstrate high success rates on unseen objects and robust, adaptive policy behaviors -- highlighting that vision-based dexterous manipulation via sim-to-real RL is not only viable, but also scalable and broadly applicable to real-world humanoid manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Dynamics Models with Generative State Estimation for Cloth Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cloth manipulation is challenging due to its highly complex dynamics, near-infinite degrees of freedom, and frequent self-occlusions, which complicate both state estimation and dynamics modeling. Inspired by recent advances in generative models, we hypothesize that these expressive models can effectively capture intricate cloth configurations and deformation patterns from data. Therefore, we propose a diffusion-based generative approach for both perception and dynamics modeling. Specifically, we formulate state estimation as reconstructing full cloth states from partial observations and dynamics modeling as predicting future states given the current state and robot actions. Leveraging a transformer-based diffusion model, our method achieves accurate state reconstruction and reduces long-horizon dynamics prediction errors by an order of magnitude compared to prior approaches. We integrate our dynamics models with model predictive control and show that our framework enables effective cloth folding on real robotic systems, demonstrating the potential of generative models for deformable object manipulation under partial observability and complex dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Modelling forced dynamical systems - where an external input drives the system state - is critical across diverse domains such as engineering, finance, and the natural sciences. In this work, we propose Laplace-Net, a decoupled, solver-free neural framework for learning forced and delay-aware systems. It leverages a Laplace transform-based approach to decompose internal dynamics, external inputs, and initial values into established theoretical concepts, enhancing interpretability. Laplace-Net promotes transferability since the system can be rapidly re-trained or fine-tuned for new forcing signals, providing flexibility in applications ranging from controller adaptation to long-horizon forecasting. Experimental results on eight benchmark datasets - including linear, non-linear, and delayed systems - demonstrate the method's improved accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in handling complex and previously unseen inputs.</description>

      <title>SafeLink: Safety-Critical Control Under Dynamic and Irregular Unsafe Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) provide a theoretical foundation for safety-critical control in robotic systems. However, most existing methods rely on the analytical expressions of unsafe state regions, which are often impractical for irregular and dynamic unsafe regions. This paper introduces SafeLink, a novel CBF construction method based on cost-sensitive incremental random vector functional-link (RVFL) neural networks. By designing a valid cost function, SafeLink assigns different sensitivities to safe and unsafe state points, thereby eliminating false negatives in classification of unsafe state points. Furthermore, an incremental update theorem is established, enabling precise real-time adaptation to changes in unsafe regions. An analytical expression for the gradient of SafeLink is also derived to facilitate control input computation. The proposed method is validated on the endpoint position control task of a nonlinear two-link manipulator. Experimental results demonstrate that the method effectively learns the unsafe regions and rapidly adapts as these regions change, achieving an update speed significantly faster than comparison methods, while safely reaching the target position.

      <title>Composable Uncertainty in Symmetric Monoidal Categories for Design Problems (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17274v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applied category theory often studies symmetric monoidal categories (SMCs) whose morphisms represent open systems. These structures naturally accommodate complex wiring patterns, leveraging (co)monoidal structures for splitting and merging wires, or compact closed structures for feedback. A key example is the compact closed SMC of design problems (DP), which enables a compositional approach to co-design in engineering. However, in practice, the systems of interest may not be fully known. Recently, Markov categories have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling uncertain processes. In this work, we demonstrate how to integrate this perspective into the study of open systems while preserving consistency with the underlying SMC structure. To this end, we employ the change-of-base construction for enriched categories, replacing the morphisms of a symmetric monoidal $\mathcal{V}$-category $\mathcal{C}$ with parametric maps $A \to \mathcal{C}(X,Y)$ in a Markov category induced by a symmetric monoidal monad. This results in a symmetric monoidal 2-category $N_*\mathcal{C}$ with the same objects as $\mathcal{C}$ and reparametrization 2-cells. By choosing different monads, we capture various types of uncertainty. The category underlying $\mathcal{C}$ embeds into $N_*\mathcal{C}$ via a strict symmetric monoidal functor, allowing (co)monoidal and compact closed structures to be transferred. Applied to DP, this construction leads to categories of practical relevance, such as parametrized design problems for optimization, and parametrized distributions of design problems for decision theory and Bayesian learning.</description>

      <title>Feedback Optimization with State Constraints through Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00813v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of research on a class of methods called feedback optimization. These are methods to steer the state of a control system to an equilibrium that arises as the solution of an optimization problem. Despite the growing literature on the topic, the important problem of enforcing state constraints at all times remains unaddressed. In this work, we present the first feedback-optimization method that enforces state constraints. The method combines a class of dynamics called safe gradient flows with high-order control barrier functions. We provide a number of results on our proposed controller, including well-posedness guarantees, anytime constraint-satisfaction guarantees, equivalence between the closed-loop's equilibria and the optimization problem's critical points, and local asymptotic stability of optima.</description>

      <title>On Word-of-Mouth and Private-Prior Sequential Social Learning</title>

Abstract: Social learning constitutes a fundamental framework for studying interactions among rational agents who observe each other's actions but lack direct access to individual beliefs. This paper investigates a specific social learning paradigm known as Word-of-Mouth (WoM), where a series of agents seeks to estimate the state of a dynamical system. The first agent receives noisy measurements of the state, while each subsequent agent relies solely on a degraded version of her predecessor's estimate. A defining feature of WoM is that the final agent's belief is publicly broadcast and subsequently adopted by all agents, in place of their own. We analyze this setting theoretically and through numerical simulations, noting that some agents benefit from using the belief of the last agent, while others experience performance deterioration.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Reachable Set Estimation for Saturated Systems with Unbounded Additive Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03443v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an analytical approach for the synthesis of ellipsoidal probabilistic reachable sets of saturated systems subject to unbounded additive noise. Using convex optimization methods, we compute a contraction factor of the saturated error dynamics that allows us to tightly bound its evolution and therefore construct accurate reachable sets. The proposed approach is applicable to independent, zero mean disturbances with a known covariance. A numerical example illustrates the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed design.</description>

      <title>Robustness Analysis for Quantum Systems Controlled by Continuous-Time Pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential sensitivity techniques originally developed to study the robustness of energy landscape controllers are generalized to the important case of closed quantum systems subject to continuously varying controls. Vanishing sensitivity to parameter variation is shown to coincide with perfect fidelity, as was the case for time-invariant controls. Upper bounds on the magnitude of the differential sensitivity to any parameter variation are derived based simply on knowledge of the system Hamiltonian and the maximum size of the control inputs.</description>

      <title>Grid-Agent: An LLM-Powered Multi-Agent System for Power Grid Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), widespread adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs), and the growing frequency of extreme weather events have significantly increased the complexity of power grid planning, operation, and management. Traditional rule-based systems and numerical optimization approaches often struggle with the scale, dynamics, and adaptability required by modern power networks. This paper introduces Grid-Agent, an autonomous, AI-driven framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with multi-agent reinforcement learning to detect and remediate grid violations in real time. Grid-Agent integrates semantic reasoning with numerical precision through a modular agent architecture: a planning agent generates coordinated action sequences using numerical power flow solvers, while a validation agent evaluates system stability and action effectiveness via sandboxed execution with safety rollbacks. To ensure scalability, Grid-Agent incorporates an adaptive multiscale network representation that dynamically selects optimal encoding schemes based on network size and complexity. The framework enables coordinated violation resolution through optimizing switch configurations, battery deployment, and load curtailment strategies. Experimental results in standard IEEE and CIGRE test systems (IEEE 69-bus, CIGRE MV, and IEEE 30-bus) demonstrate superior violation mitigation performance. Additionally, the framework's built-in data collection and learning capabilities enable continuous learning and adaptation to diverse network topologies. The autonomous nature of the framework makes it particularly suitable for modern smart grid applications requiring rapid response to dynamic operating conditions.</description>

      <title>A State-Space Representation of Coupled Linear Multivariate PDEs and Stability Analysis using SDP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical processes evolving in both time and space are often modeled using Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Recently, it has been shown how stability analysis and control of coupled PDEs in a single spatial variable can be more conveniently performed using an equivalent Partial Integral Equation (PIE) representation. The construction of this PIE representation is based on an analytic expression for the inverse of the spatial differential operator, $\partial_s^{d}$, on the domain defined by boundary conditions. In this paper, we show how this univariate representation may be extended inductively to multiple spatial variables by representing the domain as the intersection of lifted univariate domains. Specifically, we show that if each univariate domain is well-posed, then there exists a readily verified consistency condition which is necessary and sufficient for existence of an inverse to the multivariate spatial differential operator, $D^\alpha=\partial_{s_1}^{\alpha_1}\cdots\partial_{s_N}^{\alpha_N}$, on the PDE domain. Furthermore, we show that this inverse is an element of a $*$-algebra of Partial Integral (PI) operators defined by polynomial semi-separable kernels. Based on this operator algebra, we show that the evolution of any suitably well-posed linear multivariate PDE may be described by a PIE, parameterized by elements of the PI algebra. A convex computational test for PDE stability is then proposed using a positive matrix parameterization of positive PI operators, and software (PIETOOLS) is provided which automates the process of representation and stability analysis of such PDEs. This software is used to analyze stability of 2D heat, wave, and plate equations, obtaining accurate bounds on the rate of decay.</description>
