      <title>Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and planar Hall effect in HfTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) HfTe2 is a topological semimetal candidate with increasing attentions recently. The map of the Fermi surface is of interest and importance to understand its properties. Here we present a study of Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations and planar Hall effect (PHE) in HfTe2. The single crystals grown by flux method show the largest unsaturated magnetoresistance (MR) effect of 1.1*104 % at 14 T and 2 K. The angle-resolved SdH oscillations reveal that the Fermi surface consists of three pockets with different anisotropy. In addition, we observe PHE and anisotropic MR (AMR) effect in the material for a wide temperature range. The effective mass, carrier density and quantum transport mobility are quantified in the system, and the Berry phase is discussed. Our work provides crucial insights into the electronic structure and the Fermi surface of the semimetal.</description>

      <title>Multiple Dirac Spin-Orbital Liquids in SU(4) Heisenberg Antiferromagnets on the Honeycomb Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the strong coupling model of $d^1$ transition metal tri-halides in the large spin-orbit coupled limit. By considering ab-initio-calculation-inspired hierarchy of hopping pathways of these compounds, SU(4) symmetry is found to emerge at multiple points in the parameter space of the hopping parameters. The resultant Dirac spin-orbital liquids, within the parton mean field description, are distinct. The calculated dynamical structure factor fingerprints this distinctive nature, giving rise to observable effects. This opens up a playground for SU(4) Dirac Spin-Orbital liquid in $d^1$ Honeycomb lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Electron-Phonon interaction and lattice thermal conductivity from metals to 2D Dirac crystals: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron--phonon (e--ph) coupling governs electrical resistivity, hot-carrier cooling, and critically, thermal transport in solids. Recent first-principles advances now predict e--ph limited thermal conductivity from d-band metals and wide-band-gap semiconductors to 2D Dirac crystals without empirical parameters. In bulk metals, ab-initio lifetimes show that phonons, though secondary, still carry up to 40\% of the heat once e--ph scattering is included. We next survey coupled Boltzmann frameworks, exemplified by \textsc{elphbolt}, that capture mutual drag and ultrafast non-equilibrium in semiconductors. For 2D Dirac crystals, mirror symmetry, carrier density, strain, and finite size rearrange the scattering hierarchy: ZA modes dominate pristine graphene yet become the main resistive branch in nanoribbons once symmetry is broken. At low Fermi energies and high temperatures, the standard 3-particle decay is partially cancelled, elevating 4-particle processes and necessitating dynamically screened, higher-order theory. Throughout, we identify the microscopic levers such as the electronic density of states, phonon frequency, deformation potential, and show how doping, strain, or dielectric environment can tune e--ph damping. We conclude by outlining open challenges such as: developing coupled e--ph solvers, solving the full mode-to-mode Peierls--Boltzmann equation with 4-particle terms, embedding correlated electron methods in e--ph workflows, and leveraging higher-order e--ph coupling and symmetry breaking to realise phononic thermal diodes and rectifiers. Solving these challenges will elevate e--ph theory from a diagnostic tool to a predictive, parameter-free platform that links symmetry, screening, and many-body effects to heat and charge transport in next-generation electronic, photonic, and thermoelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-type non-thermal fixed points and beyond of far-from-equilibrium dilute system: ultra-cold Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The far-from-equilibrium dynamics driven by the scattering from next-to-leading-order (NLO) corrections in the quantum field theory has stationary solutions for the particle distribution characterized as the Kolmogorov-type non-thermal fixed points. The dynamics of the spatially homogeneous, isotropic dilute ultra-cold Fermi gas is investigated, and its kinetic equation confirms the Kolmogorov-type non-thermal fixed points in the perturbation theory by the quasi-particle assumption, in contrast to the wave turbulence of the weakly coupled ultra-cold Bose gas. In addition, other stationary states are found without the quasi-particle assumption and in a strongly coupled system. These analytical solutions provide chances for future experiments and numerical simulations in search of far-from-equilibrium stationary states of the dilute system.</description>

      <title>YSGAG: The Ideal Substrate for YIG in Quantum Magnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum magnonics leverages the quantum mechanical properties of magnons for advancing nanoscale quantum information technologies. Ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG), known for its exceptionally long magnon lifetimes, is a cornerstone material for magnonics and is typically grown into thin films on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates due to near-perfect lattice matching. However, the paramagnetic nature of GGG introduces damping mechanisms detrimental to quantum applications at low temperatures. Here, we present a study of magnetic damping in a 150$\,$nm-thick YIG film grown on a 500$\,\mu$m-thick yttrium scandium gallium aluminium garnet (YSGAG) substrate, a newly developed diamagnetic alternative to GGG. Using ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy at temperatures as low as 30$\,$mK, we compare the damping characteristics of the YIG/YSGAG system with those of a conventional YIG/GGG reference system. Our results demonstrate that the YIG/YSGAG system maintains low magnetic damping from room temperature, with $\alpha = 4.29\times10^{-5}$, which is the lowest value reported so far for YIG/GGG films and comparable to the best YIG bulk material, and down to 30$\,$mK, with no significant temperature-dependent increase in damping. In this substrate, the low-temperature damping mechanisms associated with paramagnetic spins, prominent in GGG, are effectively eliminated. Consequently, YSGAG serves as an ideal substrate for YIG films in quantum magnonics and is paving the way for the development of spin-wave-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>New Twists on Topological Quantum Error Correcting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a new family of quantum error-correcting codes. The main technical tool used to do so is the physically intuitive concept of condensation, which is employed to create new domain walls between the quantum double of $\Z_4$ and an instance of the doubled semion phase. Specifically, we provide explicit constructions, first at the lattice-level and then subsequently at the macroscopic logical-level. To provide intuition, we provide a series of explicit examples using the derived topological interfaces. We discuss the code's utility in the burgeoning area of quantum error-correction with an emphasis on the interplay between logical error rates and decoding.
  We conclude by outlining how such codes' representation and design can be automated. We expect our results, which provide explicit step-by-step instructions in the form of algorithms, to pave the path for new higher-algebraic-dimensional codes to be discovered and implemented in configurations that take advantage of various hardware's distinct strengths.</description>

      <title>Localized states, topology and anomalous Hall conductivity on a 30 degrees twisted bilayer honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider $30^{\circ}$ twisted bilayer formed by two copies of Haldane model and explore its evolution with varying interlayer coupling strength. Specifically, we compute the system's energy spectrum, its fractal dimensions, topological entanglement entropy, local Chern markers and anomalous Hall conductivity. We find that at weak interlayer coupling, the system %remains gapped still has a bulk energy gap, topological edge states and retains topological properties of the isolated layers, but at strong interlayer coupling, this energy gap closes, but it is possible that another bulk gap may open. Such a system possesses multiple states localized at various locations of the lattice. We also establish that topological entanglement entropy and anomalous Hall conductivity can be used to characterize the system's topological properties in the same way as a local Chern marker.</description>

      <title>Eigen-SNAP gate for photonic qubits in a cavity-transmon system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the pursuit of robust quantum computing, we put forth a platform based on photonic qubits in a circuit-QED environment. Specifically, we propose a versatile two-qubit gate based on two cavities coupled via a transmon, constituting a selective number-dependent phase gate operating on the in-phase eigenmodes of the two cavities, the Eigen-SNAP gate. This gate natively operates in the dispersive coupling regime of the cavities and the transmon, and operates by driving the transmon externally, to imprint desired phases on the number states. As an example for the utility of the Eigen-SNAP gate, we implement a $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$ gate on a system of two logical bosonic qubits encoded in the cavities. Further, we use numerical optimization to determine the optimal implementation of the $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$. We find that the fidelities of these optimal protocols are only limited by the coherence times of the system's components. These findings pave the way to continuous variable quantum computing in cavity-transmon systems.</description>
