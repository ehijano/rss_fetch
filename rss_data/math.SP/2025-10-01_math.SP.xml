      <title>On the finiteness of logarithmic Hamiltonians for Volterra-type lattices in terms of the spectral measures of Jacobi operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a correspondence between the semi-infinite and infinite Volterra lattices having a finite logarithmic Hamiltonian and certain classes of even probability measures. In doing so, we apply the inverse spectral theory of Jacobi operators and the theory of orthogonal polynomials. A similar correspondence is established for semi-infinite modified Volterra lattices.</description>

      <title>Competition of small targets in planar domains: from Dirichlet to Robin and Steklov boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider steady-state diffusion in a bounded planar domain with multiple small targets on a smooth boundary. Using the method of matched asymptotic expansions, we investigate the competition of these targets for a diffusing particle and the crucial role of surface reactions on the targets. We start from the classical problem of splitting probabilities for perfectly reactive targets with Dirichlet boundary condition and improve some earlier results. We discuss how this approach can be generalized to partially reactive targets characterized by a Robin boundary condition. In particular, we show how partial reactivity reduces the effective size of the target. In addition, we consider more intricate surface reactions modeled by mixed Steklov-Neumann or Steklov-Neumann-Dirichlet problems. We provide the first derivation of the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for these spectral problems in the small-target limit. Finally, we show how our asymptotic approach can be extended to interior targets in the bulk and to exterior problems where diffusion occurs in an unbounded planar domain outside a compact set. Direct applications of these results to diffusion-controlled reactions are discussed.</description>

      <title>On uniqueness of radial potentials for given Dirichlet spectra with distinct angular momenta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an inverse spectral problem for radial Schr\" odinger operators with singular potentials. First, we show that the knowledge of the Dirichlet spectra for infinitely many angular momenta~$\ell$ satisfying a M\"untz-type condition uniquely determines the potential. Then, in a neighborhood of the zero potential, we prove that the potential is uniquely determined by two Dirichlet spectra associated with distinct angular momenta in the cases \((\ell_1,\ell_2) = (0,1)\) and \((0,2)\). Our approach relies on an explicit analysis of the corresponding singular differential equation, combined with the classical Kneser--Sommerfeld formula. These results confirm, in the linearized setting and in these configurations, a conjecture originally formulated by Rundell and Sacks (2001).</description>

      <title>Sums of projections with random coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study infinite sums \[ {\mathcal P}_{\varkappa}=\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \varkappa_n \langle\cdot, \psi_n\rangle\psi_n \] of rank-one projections in a Hilbert space, where $\{\psi_n\}_{n\in\mathbb Z}$ are norm-one vectors, not necessarily orthogonal, and $\{\varkappa_n\}_{n\in\mathbb Z}$ are independent identically distributed positive random variables. Assuming that the Gram matrix $\{\langle\psi_n,\psi_m\rangle\}_{n,m\in\mathbb Z}$ defines a bounded operator on $\ell^2(\mathbb Z)$ and that its entries depend only on the difference $n-m$, we analyse ${\mathcal P}_{\varkappa}$ within the framework of spectral theory of ergodic operators. Inspired by the spectral theory of ergodic Schr\"odinger operators, we define the integrated density of states (IDS) measure $\nu_{{\mathcal P}_\varkappa}$ for ${\mathcal P}_{\varkappa}$ and establish results on its continuity and absolute continuity, including Wegner-type estimates and Lifshitz tail behaviour near the spectral edges. In the asymptotic regime of nearly-orthogonal $\psi_n$, we prove the Anderson-type localisation result: the spectrum of ${\mathcal P}_{\varkappa}$ is pure point almost surely.</description>

      <title>Finite projective planes meet spectral gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for any connected graph $G$ with maximum degree $d\ge3$, the spectral gap from $0$ with respect to the adjacency matrix is at most $\sqrt{d-1}$, with equality if and only if $G$ is the incidence graph of a finite projective plane of order $d-1$; and for other cases, the bound $\sqrt{d-1}$ is improved to $\sqrt{d-2}$. This is a spectral gap version of a result by Mohar and Tayfeh-Rezaie. Moreover, for $d$-regular graphs with girth at least 7, the bound $\sqrt{d-2}$ is further improved to $\sqrt{d-c(d)}$ where $c(d)\ge 2$ and $\lim\limits_{d\to\infty}c(d)/d=(\sqrt{5}-1)/2$.
  A similar yet more subtle phenomenon involving the normalized Laplacian is also investigated, where we work on graphs of degrees $\ge d$ rather than $\le d$. We prove that for any graph $G$ with \emph{minimum} degree $d\ge 3$, the spectral gap from the value 1 with respect to the normalized Laplacian is at most $\sqrt{d-1}/d$, with equality if and only if $G$ is the incidence graph of a finite projective plane of order $d-1$. As an application, we provide a new sharp bound for the convergence rate of some eigenvalues of the Laplacian on the weighted neighborhood graphs introduced by Bauer and Jost.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotic Analysis of Some PDE and Steklov Eigenvalue Problems with Partially Reactive Patches in 3-D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider steady-state diffusion in a three-dimensional bounded domain with a smooth reflecting boundary that is partially covered by small partially reactive patches. By using the method of matched asymptotic expansions, we investigate the competition of these patches for a diffusing particle and the crucial role of surface reactions on these targets. After a brief overview of former contributions to this field, we first illustrate our approach by considering the classical problems of the mean first-reaction time (MFRT) and the splitting probability for partially reactive patches characterized by a Robin boundary condition. For a spherical domain, we derive a three-term asymptotic expansion for the MFRT and splitting probabilities in the small-patch limit. This expansion is valid for arbitrary reactivities, and also accounts for the effect of the spatial configuration of patches on the boundary. Secondly, we consider more intricate surface reactions modeled by mixed Steklov-Neumann or Steklov-Neumann-Dirichlet problems. We provide the first derivation of the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for these spectral problems in the small-patch limit for a spherical domain. Extensions of these asymptotic results to arbitrary domains and their physical applications are discussed.</description>
