      <title>Every additively idempotent semiring satisfying $xy\approx xz$ is finitely based</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the finite basis problem for additively idempotent semirings satisfying the identity $xy \approx xz$. Let $\mathbf{R}$ denote the variety of all such semirings. Yue et al. (2025, Algebra Universalis, DOI:10.1007/s00012-025-00908-5) established that $\mathbf{R}$ is finitely generated. In this paper, we show that the subvariety lattice of $\mathbf{R}$ forms a distributive lattice of order $10$. As a consequence, the variety $\mathbf{R}$ is a Cross variety, and every member of $\mathbf{R}$ is finitely based.</description>

      <title>On self-similarity of finitely generated torsion-free nilpotent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to investigate the self-similarity property in finitely-generated torsion-free nilpotent groups. We establish connections between geometric equivalence and self-similarity in these groups. Moreover, we show that any 2-generated torsion-free nilpotent group of class 3 has a faithful representation as a transitive self-similar group. Additionally, we provide an example of a 4-generated torsion-free nilpotent group of class 3 that does not admit such a representation. This example, sourced from the work of V. Bludov and B. Gusev in \cite{BG}, resolves a question posed by S. Sidki in \cite{LectureDusseldorf}.</description>

      <title>Stable Invariants of Words from Random Matrices II: Formulas and Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $w$ be a word in a free group. As was revealed by Magee and Puder in [arXiv:1802.04862], the stable commutator length (scl) of $w$, a well-known topological invariant, can also be defined in terms of certain stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random unitary matrices. In the first part of the current work [arXiv:2311.17733], we demonstrated how this phenomenon is much broader: we proved more instances of such results and conjectured others. These new results and conjectures involved other topological invariants (relatives of scl) and different families of groups.
  In the current paper we further extend and support this theory. We provide another instance of the theory and prove that the stable primitivity rank, too, can be expressed in terms of stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random elements of groups. We introduce concrete formulas for stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random elements in the symmetric group $S_N$ and its generalizations in the form of the wreath products $G\wr S_N$ where $G$ is an arbitrary compact group. We also define new stable invariants related to these groups, and prove they give bounds to many of the stable Fourier coefficients.
  As an aside, we generalize to tuples of words a result of Puder and Parzanchevski [arXiv:1202.3269] about the expected number of fixed points of $w$-random permutations.</description>

      <title>Some new compatible groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two finite groups $L_1$ and $L_2$ are compatible if there exists a finite group $G$ with isomorphic normal subgroups $N_1$ and $N_2$ such that $L_1\cong G/N_1$ and $L_2\cong G/N_2$. We prove a new sufficient condition for two groups to be compatible. As a corollary, we obtain that nilpotent groups of the same order are compatible, and so are groups of the same square-free order.</description>

      <title>On finite groups with exactly one noncommutator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An element $x$ of a group $G$ is a commutator if it can be expressed in the form $x = a^{-1}b^{-1}ab$ for some $a, b \in G$. In 2010 MacHale posed the following problem in the Kourovka notebook: does there exist a finite group $G$, with $|G| &gt; 2$, such that there is exactly one element of $G$ which is not a commutator? We answer this question in the affirmative and provide an infinite series of such groups, the smallest group in our construction having size $16609443840$.</description>

      <title>Expansion of Integer Matrices over Various Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the problem of constructing high-dimensional expanders through the study of relations between expansion constants over different rings. We investigate expansion constants of integer matrices regarded as morphisms between free modules over $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{Z}$, and $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$. We introduce a new condition which we call integral spanning regarding kernels of integer matrices, and prove that it ensures equality of real and integral expansions. In addition, we prove a bound on expansion constants over finite fields for a certain class of matrices in terms of the corresponding integral expansions. As an application, one may use this theorem to bound the expansion of codifferentials over $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ in degrees $0$ and $1$.</description>

      <title>Quasi-isometric Higman embeddings and the Dehn function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first of a sequence of papers devoted to studying the link between the complexity of the Word Problem for a finitely generated recursively presented group $G$ and the isoperimetric functions of the finitely presented groups in which $G$ embeds. We prove here that if a finitely generated group has a presentation $\mathcal{P}$ whose relators can be enumerated by a computational model satisfying certain technical requirements, then the group embeds quasi-isometrically into a finitely presented group whose Dehn function is bounded above by a function of the model's computational complexity and the Dehn function of $\mathcal{P}$. This generalizes a previous result of the author pertaining to the embeddings of free Burnside groups and gives a recipe for establishing such Higman embeddings into groups with desired geometric properties. As an example of the use of this embedding scheme, we find a substantial improvement to the seminal result of Birget, Ol'shanskii, Rips, and Sapir showing that the Word Problem of a finitely generated group is in class NP if and only if the group embeds into a finitely presented group with polynomial Dehn function.</description>

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to refine some aspects of the cohomological study of Bruhat-Tits subgroups. It aims to complement the work done in the 1987 article. As an application, we obtain a result "\`a la Grothendieck-Serre" for Bruhat-Tits subgroups of a semisimple simply connected group and the exact calculation of the obstruction in the case of quasi-split adjoint groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the equality $\dTC(\Gamma)=\TC(\Gamma)$ for distributional topological complexity of torsion free hyperbolic and of torsion free nilpotent groups.
  For the distributional topological complexity of lens spaces we prove the inequality $\dTC(L^n_p)\le 2p-1$ and for the distributional LS-category the inequality $d\cat(L^n_p)\le p-1$ which turns into equality for prime $p$ and $n&gt;p$. We use these inequalities to bring counter-examples to the product formula for $d\cat$ and $\dTC$.</description>

      <title>Twisted Malle's Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we use inductive methods similar to those employed in a 2025 paper by Alberts, Lemke Oliver, Wang and Wood in order to prove many new cases of the Twisted Malle's Conjecture. Previously, this conjecture had only been proven for $T \trianglelefteq G$ where $T$ is abelian, and for $S_3^m \trianglelefteq S_3 \wr B$. We prove many new examples of this conjecture, such as for $A \wr M \trianglelefteq A \wr B$ where $A$ is a finite abelian $p$-group, $B$ is a $p$-group, and $M$ is a proper abelian normal subgroup of $B$, and for $C_p \wr M \trianglelefteq C_p \wr B$, where $|B|$ is odd and $M$ is a proper abelian normal subgroup of $B$.</description>

      <title>Geometric Interpolation of Rigid Body Motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of interpolating a rigid body motion is to find a spatial trajectory between a prescribed initial and terminal pose. Two variants of this interpolation problem are addressed. The first is to find a solution that satisfies initial conditions on the k-1 derivatives of the rigid body twist. This is called the kth-order initial value trajectory interpolation problem (k-IV-TIP). The second is to find a solution that satisfies conditions on the rigid body twist and its k-1 derivatives at the initial and terminal pose. This is called the kth-order boundary value trajectory interpolation problem (k-BV-TIP). Solutions to the k-IV-TIP for k=1,...,4, i.e. the initial twist and up to the 4th time derivative are prescribed. Further, a solution to the 1-IV-TBP is presented, i.e. the initial and terminal twist are prescribed. The latter is a novel cubic interpolation between two spatial configurations with given initial and terminal twist. This interpolation is automatically identical to the minimum acceleration curve when the twists are set to zero. The general approach to derive higher-order solutions is presented. Numerical results are shown for two examples.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of non-finite CL-shellable posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shellable complexes are homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres of possibly different dimensions, so that the (co)homology of the constant functor over the complex is concentrated in those degrees. In this work, we introduce the concept of a stable functor -a local weakening of fibrancy- over a shellable poset, which ensures the vanishing of the (co)homology of such a functor in specific degrees. In addition, we extend the notion of shellability to non-finite and non-pure posets. The methods are based on a model category structure on the category of functors indexed by a filtered poset and the combinatorial structure of CL-shellable posets. With these tools, we describe higher limits via explicit fibrant replacements. Applications include acyclicity criteria for Mackey functors, computation of cohomology of $j$-th exterior powers over arrangement lattices, and homological decompositions for Bianchi groups $\Gamma_d$ for $d=1,2,7$ and $11$.</description>

      <title>Enveloping semigroups as compactifications of topological groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ellis's "functional approach" allows one to obtain proper compactifications of a topological group $G$ if $G$ can be represented as a subgroup of the homeomorphism group of a space $X$ in the topology of pointwise convergence and $G$-space $X$ is $G$-Tychonoff. These compactifications, called Ellis compactifications, are right topological monoids and $G$-compactifications of the group $G$ with its action by multiplication on the left on itself. A comparison is made between Ellis compactifications of $G$ and the Roelcke compactification of $G$. Uniformity corresponding to the Ellis compactification of $G$ for its representation in a compact space $X$ is established.
  Proper Ellis semigroup compactifications are described for groups ${\rm S}(X)$ (the permutation group of a discrete space $X$) and ${\rm Aut} (X)$ (automorphism group of an ultrahomogeneous chain $X$) in the permutation topology and ${\rm Aut} (X)$ of LOTS $X$ in the topology of pointwise convergence.</description>

      <title>The 3-strand braid group with torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the 1950s, H. S. M. Coxeter considered the quotients of braid groups given by adding the relation that all half Dehn twist generators have some fixed, finite order. He found a remarkable formula for the order of these groups in terms of some related Platonic solids. Despite the inspiring apparent connection between these "truncated" braid groups and Platonic solids, Coxeter's proof boils down to a finite case check that reveals nothing about the structure present. We give a topological interpretation of the truncated 3-strand braid group that makes the connection with Platonic solids clear. One of our key tools is a formalism for orbifolds developed by A. Henriques that we think others would find interesting.</description>

      <title>Monodromy representation of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that every vertex-transitive graph admits a representation as a coset graph. In this paper, we extend this construction by introducing monodromy graphs defined through double cosets. Our main result establishes that every graph is isomorphic to a monodromy graph, providing a new combinatorial framework for graph representation. Moreover, we show that every graph gives rise to an arc-transitive graph through its monodromy representation. Inspired by the monodromy representation of graphs, we denote an algebraic map $\mathcal{M}(G;\Omega,\rho,\tau)$ by $\mathcal{M}(G;U,\rho,\tau)$ where $U$ is a stabiliser in $G$. As an application, we prove an enumeration theorem for orientable maps with a given monodromy group. We underscore a fundamental triad in algebraic graph theory: Where there is a graph, there is a group, an arc-transitive graph, and an orientable regular map--each arising canonically from the underlying combinatorial and algebraic structures.</description>

      <title>Fractal failures of Ratner rigidity in higher rank geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ratner's theorem shows that in a locally symmetric space of noncompact type and finite volume, every immersed totally geodesic subspace of noncompact type is topologically rigid: its closure is an immersed submanifold.
  We construct the first explicit higher-rank, infinite-volume examples in which this rigidity fails, via floating geodesic planes. Specifically, we exhibit a Zariski-dense Hitchin surface group $\Gamma&lt;\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})$ such that $\Gamma\backslash \mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})/ \mathrm{SO}(3)$ contains a sequence of immersed floating geodesic planes with fractal closures whose Hausdorff dimensions, non-integral, accumulate at $2$. Moreover, $\Gamma$ can be chosen inside $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$.
  Our method uses Goldman's bulging deformations, but in higher rank new difficulties arise: unlike in rank one, where geodesics orthogonal to a hyperplane always diverge, here one must analyze the collective behavior of entire families of parallel geodesics inside flats under bulging, a phenomenon intrinsic to higher rank.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Properties of Partial Bijection Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.00324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the computational complexity of problems in which we are given generators for a partial bijection semigroup and asked to check properties of the generated semigroup. We prove that the following problems are in AC$^0$: (1) enumerating left and right identities and (2) checking if the semigroup is completely regular. We also describe a nondeterministic logspace algorithm for checking if an inverse semigroup given by generators satisfies a fixed semigroup identity that may involve a unary inverse operation. We conclude with an alternative proof that checking membership of a given idempotent in a partial bijection semigroup is a PSPACE-complete problem. The proof reduces from the well-known PSPACE-complete Rectangle Tiling Problem, thereby illustrating a connection between Wang tilings and partial bijection semigroups.</description>

      <title>Stable Invariants of Words from Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $w$ be a word in a free group. A few years ago, Magee and the first named author discovered that the stable commutator length (scl) of $w$, a well-known topological invariant, can also be defined in terms of certain Fourier coefficients of $w$-random unitary matrices [arXiv:1802.04862]. But the random-matrix side of this equality can be naturally tweaked by considering $w$-random permutations, $w$-random orthogonal matrices and so on, to produce new invariants for any given word. Are these invariants new? interesting? Do they admit an intrinsic topological description as in the case of $w$-random unitaries and scl?
  The current paper formalizes the definition of these invariants coming from $w$-random matrices, answers the above questions in certain cases involving generalized symmetric groups, and poses detailed conjectures in many others. In particular, we present a plethora of topological, combinatorial and algebraic invariants of words which play, or are at least conjectured to play, a similar role to the one played by scl in the above-mentioned result. Among others, these invariants include two invariants recently defined by Wilton [arXiv:2210.09853]: the stable primitivity rank and a non-oriented analog of scl.</description>

      <title>Co-Engel graphs of certain finite non-Engel groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group. The co-Engel graph of $G$) with $G$ whose vertex set is $G$ and two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if $[x,{}_k y]\neq1$ and $[y,{}_k x] \neq 1$ for all positive integer $k$, where $[x,{}_ky]$ is the iterated commutator $[x,y,y,\ldots,y]$, with $k$ terms $y$ in the expression; usually we delete isolated vertices (these are the left Engel elements).
  This graph, under the name ``Engel graph'', was introduced by Abdollahi~\cite{aa}. However, we argue that it is more naturally called the ``co-Engel graph''.
  We compute genus, various spectra, energies and Zagreb indices of co-Engel graphs for groups including the dihedral and generalized quaternion groups and nonabelian groups of order $pq$ where $p$ and $q$ are primes. As a consequence, we determine (up to isomorphism) all finite non-Engel group $G$ such that the clique number of the co-Engel is at most $4$ and the graph is toroidal or projective. Further, we show that the co-Engel graph is super integral and satisfies the E-LE conjecture and the Hansen--Vuki{\v{c}}evi{\'c} conjecture for the groups considered in this paper.
  We also look briefly at the directed Engel graph, with an arc $x\to y$ if $[y,{}_kx]=1$ for some $k$. We show that, if $G$ is a finite soluble group, this graph either is the complete directed graph (which occurs only if $G$ is nilpotent), or has pairs of vertices joined only by single arcs. We also show that the (directed or undirected) Engel graph of a group $G$ is the lexicographic product of a complete graph of order $Z_\infty(G)$ by the (directed or undirected) Engel graph of $G/Z_\infty(G)$, where $Z_\infty(G)$ is the hypercenter of $G$.</description>

      <title>Periodicity of tiles in finite Abelian groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the periodic tiling (PT) property for finite abelian groups. A finite abelian group is said to have the PT property if every non-periodic set that tiles the group by translation admits a periodic tiling complement. This notion extends the scope beyond groups with the Haj\'os property. We give a complete classification of cyclic groups possessing the PT property and identify certain non-cyclic groups that enjoy the PT property but fail to satisfy the Haj\'os property.. As a byproduct, we obtain new families of groups for which the implication ``Tile $\Longrightarrow$ Spectral" holds. Furthermore, for elementary $p$-groups with the PT property, by analyzing the structure of tiles, we prove that every tile is a complete set of representatives of the cosets of some subgroup.</description>

      <title>The Conjugacy Ratio of Abelian-by-Cyclic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G = K \rtimes \langle t \rangle $ be a finitely generated group where $K$ is abelian and $\langle t\rangle$ is the infinite cyclic group. Let $ R $ be a finite symmetric subset of $K$ such that $S = \{ (r,1),(0,t^{\pm 1}) \mid r \in R \}$ is a generating set of $G$. We prove that the spherical conjugacy ratio, and hence the conjugacy ratio, of $G$ with respect to $S$ is $0$ unless $G$ is virtually abelian, confirming a conjecture of Ciobanu, Cox and Martino in this case. We also show that the Baumslag--Solitar group $\mathrm{BS}(1,2)$ has a one-sided F{\o}lner sequence $F$ such that the conjugacy ratio with respect to $F$ is non-zero, even though $\mathrm{BS}(1,2)$ is not virtually abelian. This is in contrast to two-sided F{\o}lner sequences, where Tointon showed that the conjugacy ratio with respect to a two-sided F{\o}lner sequence is positive if and only if the group is virtually abelian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of word lengths of elements from a three-reflection symmetric generating set of the dihedral group $D_n$. Specifically, we provide the upper bound $\lambda_1(D_n,S) \leq \lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor + 1$ for a quantity $\lambda_1$ defined in arXiv:1104.5044, which measures the stability of a finitely presented group under perturbations in the words corresponding to certain elements with respect to specific presentations. This quantity has been of recent interest due to its role in the application of group theory to computational genomics, and we aim to introduce techniques in additive combinatorics to its discourse.</description>

Abstract: The orbital chromatic polynomial introduced by Cameron and Kayibi counts the number of proper $\lambda$-colorings of a graph modulo a group of symmetries. As a generalization of this polynomial we consider the orbital bivariate chromatic polynomial, itself specializing to the orbital independence polynomial, and establish expansions for path, stars and cycles of arbitrary size. As side results, we rediscover Fermat's Little Theorem and a "Fermat-like" congruence for Lucas numbers.</description>

      <title>On a local property of infinite Galois extensions implying the Northcott property</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2001, Bombieri and Zannier studied the Northcott property (N) for infinite Galois extensions of the rationals. In particular they provided a local property of the extensions that imply property (N). Later, Checcoli and Fehm demonstrated the existence of infinite extensions satisfying this local property. In this article, we establish two main results. First, we show that this local property, unlike property (N), is not preserved under finite extensions. Second, we show that, for an infinite Galois extension of Q, such local property cannot be read on the Galois group. More precisely, we exhibit several profinite groups that are realizable over Q by fields that do not satisfy the local property.</description>

Abstract: We derive a formula for computing the size of lower Bruhat intervals for elements in the dominant cone of an affine Weyl group of type $A$. This enumeration problem is reduced to counting lattice points in certain polyhedra. Our main tool is a decomposition -- or tiling -- of each interval into smaller, combinatorially tractable pieces, which we call paper boats. We also conjecture a generalization of this formula to all affine Weyl groups, restricted to elements in the lowest two-sided Kazhdan-Lusztig cell, which contains almost all of the elements.</description>

Abstract: Combinatorial categories satisfy a stronger form of Yoneda Lemma, namely, the isomorphism type of an object can be recovered by counting the number of homomorphisms from all other objects into it. In this work, we show that this property holds for sufficiently small categories by studying the algebra of homomorphism-counting functions. We present applications of the results to the isomorphism problem in group, graph and ring theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend L\"uck's determinant conjecture from groups to invariant random subgroups (IRS) of free groups, a framework generalizing groups where a non-sofic object is known to exist. For every free group, we prove the existence of an IRS satisfying the determinant conjecture that is not co-hyperlinear, and hence not co-sofic. This provides evidence that satisfying the determinant conjecture might be a weaker property than soficity for groups, and consequently the conjecture possibly holds for all groups. We use techniques from non-local games and $\mathsf{MIP}^* = \mathsf{RE}$, showing more generally when the latter can be used to narrow down when a von Neumann algebra (or IRS) contains a non-Connes embeddable object.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any action of a finite group on a finitely presentable group arises as the action of the group of self-homotopy equivalences of a space on its fundamental group. In doing so, we prove that any finite connected (abstract) simplicial complex $\mathbf{K}$ can be rigidified -- meaning it can be perturbed in a way that reduces the full automorphism group to any subgroup -- while preserving the homotopy type of the geometric realization $| \mathbf{K} |$. We also obtain that every action of a finite group on a finitely generated abelian group is the action of the group of self-homotopy equivalences of a space on one of its higher homotopy groups.</description>
