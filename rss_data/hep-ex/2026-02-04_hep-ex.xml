      <title>Recent results on vector-like quarks and excited fermions at CMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most recent results on the searches for the vector-like quarks and excited fermions from the CMS Collaboration are presented. These results are based on the full Run 2 $\sqrt{s} = $13 TeV proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS Collaboration at the LHC from 2016 to 2018, which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. No significant excess above the Standard Model expectation is observed. Exclusion limits are set at the 95% confidence level on various benchmark models.</description>

      <title>Observation of $\Upsilon$(1S) + Z associated production and measurement of the effective double-parton scattering cross section in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of associated production of an $\Upsilon$(1S) meson with a Z boson and a measurement of the ratio of its fiducial cross section to the fiducial cross section of the Z boson are presented. Both the $\Upsilon$(1S) meson and the Z boson are identified via decays into a pair of opposite-sign muons. The analysis is based on proton-proton (pp) collision data at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, collected with the CMS detector in 2016$-$2018 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. Using the production of the Z boson decaying into four muons as a normalization channel, the ratio of the fiducial cross sections $\sigma$(pp $\to$ Z $+$ $\Upsilon$(1S))$\mathcal{B}$(Z $\to$ $\mu^+\mu^-$)$\mathcal{B}$($\Upsilon$(1S) $\to$ $\mu^+\mu^-$ ) to $\sigma$(pp $\to$ Z)$\mathcal{B}$(Z $\to$ 4$\mu$) is measured to be $\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm{Z+\Upsilon}\mathrm{(1S)}}$ = (21.1 $\pm$ 55 (stat) $\pm$ 0.6 (syst) $\times$ 10$^{-3}$), where stat and syst denote the statistical and systematic uncertainties, respectively. The result is used to extract the effective double-parton scattering cross section $\sigma_\text{eff}$ = 13.0$^{+7.7}_{-3.4}$. In addition, for the first time, $\sigma_\text{eff}$ is measured in bins of the transverse momentum of the $\Upsilon$(1S) meson or of the Z boson.</description>

      <title>Jet-associated Balance Functions of Charged and Identified Hadrons in pp Collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV using PYTHIA8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of charge balance functions inside jets in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV using the PYTHIA8 event generator. The balance function is a differential observable of opposite-charge correlations, which is calculated in the jet frame for inclusive charged hadrons and the identified $\pi$, $K$, and $p$. The results show a clear narrowing of the balancing width with increasing jet charged multiplicity, indicating that particle production becomes more localized in momentum space in high-multiplicity jets.This trend resembles features attributed to collective expansion in heavy-ion collisions. The species dependence highlights sensitivity to the redistribution of strangeness and baryon number during string fragmentation and color reconnection. The new CR tune yields a little broader proton balance-function width in $\Delta\phi^{*}$ than CP5, hinting at enhanced baryon-production dynamics, whereas meson widths differ only mildly. These comparisons suggest that multiparton interactions and color reconnection contribute to the observed trends, potentially generating collective like features inside jets, especially in high multiplicity jets, via nontrivial color dynamics alongside standard fragmentation. Taken together, the results establish identified hadron balance functions in high multiplicity jets as a sensitive probe of hadronization and provide new constraints for models of small system collectivity.</description>

      <title>Deep-Learning Denoising of Radio Observations for Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic-Ray Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) can be detected via the broadband radio pulses produced by their extensive air showers. The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is a planned radio observatory that aims to deploy autonomous antenna arrays over areas of order $\sim 10^5\,\mathrm{km}^2$ to detect this emission. However, Galactic and instrumental radio backgrounds make the identification of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) pulses a central challenge. Here, we present a deep convolutional denoiser model that jointly processes each GRAND antenna trace in the time and frequency domains, allowing the network to learn transient pulse morphology and broadband spectral features while suppressing background noise. By training the model on $4.1\times 10^5$ simulated traces that include detailed UHECR radio emission and realistic detector response and noise, we find a median output-SNR improvement of $\sim 15-23\,\mathrm{dB}$ in the $50-200~\mathrm{MHz}$ band and a reduction of the normalized mean squared error of the waveform by about an order of magnitude relative to a Hilbert-envelope denoiser baseline. We also verify that applying the denoiser to noise-only windows does not produce spurious pulse candidates. Near the detection threshold, the denoiser increases the number of antennas contributing reliable pulse timing by a factor of $\sim 2-3$, which correspondingly tightens direction reconstruction uncertainties. When we additionally require accurate recovery of the waveform shape, the denoiser yields a median gain of $\sim 3-4$ antennas usable for energy reconstruction at SNR$\simeq 5-6$, strengthening event-level direction and energy estimates in sparse radio arrays.</description>

      <title>Generalized Neutrino Interactions: constraints and parametrizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized neutrino interactions (GNI) are emerging as a convenient framework for describing effective scalar, vector, and tensor interactions. Such interactions arise naturally from extensions of the Standard Model that aim to explain neutrino properties and their mass origin. In this paper, we carefully study the two more common parametrizations for GNI and how to relate them. This allows us to compare bounds obtained from CEvNS and deep-inelastic scattering under the same footing. In addition, we present the current bounds from CEvNS measurements by COHERENT and compare them to those obtained from deep inelastic scattering on the same level. Our results focus on neutrino-quark interactions, and illustrate the complementarity between experiments working at different scales for GNI, showing that scalar interactions are better constrained by low-energy experiments like COHERENT, while tensor interactions are robustly constrained from deep inelastic scattering.</description>

      <title>Hydrogenated carbon structures as directional sub-GeV dark matter detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose hydrogenated carbon structures as targets with a remarkable sensitivity to dark matter-nucleon interactions, in the mass range between the 1 MeV and 100 MeV. The ejection of a proton following the interaction with a dark matter particle is a quasi-elastic process, with an extremely small energy threshold, and a clear experimental signature. The proposed detectors are simple, technologically ready, and inexpensive. Yet, they can be considerably more sensitive than current experiments. They also allow strong directionality, to be used towards efficient background rejection.</description>

      <title>An Improved Torsion Balance Test of the Equivalence Principle Towards the Sun</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We search for violations of the Equivalence Principle towards the Sun using a rotating torsion balance apparatus. We set 95\%-confidence limits on violations with beryllium and aluminum test bodies of $\eta_{\odot, Be-Al} \leq 2.1 \times 10^{-13}$. These results are a factor of four improvement of previously reported results towards the Sun and a $\sim20\%$ improvement on previous torsion balance tests regardless of source.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter-Induced Nuclear De-Excitation at SBND with Ab Initio Nuclear Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the sensitivity of the Short-Baseline Near Detector (SBND) experiment to light dark matter using MeV-scale electromagnetic activity. Inelastic scattering of dark matter with argon nuclei can excite nuclear states that subsequently de-excite via the emission of MeV-scale photons, producing localized low-energy "blip" signatures in a liquid argon time projection chamber. We perform state-of-the-art ab initio nuclear calculations, including all relevant argon excited states with energies up to 18 MeV, to provide reliable predictions for these signals. After accounting for relevant backgrounds, we find that SBND can probe previously unexplored regions of parameter space for light dark matter.</description>

      <title>Studying Energy-Energy Correlators in pp Collisions at the LHC with a Jet-Free Event-Topology Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a jet-free approach for measuring energy-energy correlators (EEC) in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), employing an event-topology method that does not rely on explicit jet reconstruction. Using the leading charged hadron as a reference axis, the azimuthal plane is divided into Toward and Transverse regions, enabling a robust background subtraction and extending EEC measurements into the low $p_T$ regime where conventional jet-based approaches become unreliable. The method is validated through comparisons with conventional jet reconstruction results. We systematically explore the dependence of the EEC on the leading-particle transverse momentum and parton flavor. The observed scaling between the EEC peak position and the hard scale suggests that this topology-based EEC captures effectively the transition between perturbative and non-perturbative QCD regimes. Distinct differences are found between quark- and gluon-initiated events, reflecting their different color charges and radiation patterns. Extending the analysis to heavy flavor, EECs triggered by leading charm mesons exhibit a suppressed magnitude and a peak shifted toward larger angular separations relative to inclusive charged-particle triggers, providing a direct manifestation of the dead-cone effect. This jet-free EEC framework offers a simple and experimentally robust tool for studying the scale and flavor dependence of the QCD dynamics, with promising applications to proton-nucleus and heavy-ion collisions at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic simulations of expanded warm dense foil heated by pulsed-power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Warm Dense Matter lies at the frontier between condensed matter and plasma, and plays a central role in various fields ranging from planetary science to inertial confinement fusion. Improving our understanding of this regime requires experimental data that can be directly compared with theoretical and numerical models over a broad range of conditions. In this work, a pulsed-power experiment is described in which thin metallic foils, confined within a sapphire cell, are Joule-heated to achieve the expanded warm dense matter regime. Designing such an experiment is challenging, as it requires simultaneously predicting the electrical response of the pulsed-power driver and the hydrodynamic evolution of the heated material. To tackle this challenge, a modeling framework has been developed that couples an electrical description of the pulsed-power system, including the driver, the switching stages and the load with a one-dimensional hydrodynamic code. This coupling allows the electrical energy deposition and the load thermodynamic evolution to be consistently linked through the material electrical conductivity. This approach takes advantage of the simplicity of a 1D geometry while retaining the essential physics and allowing to reproduce various measurements with good accuracy, such as expansion velocity, current and voltage. This numerical approach therefore constitutes a robust and efficient method for designing and optimizing future Warm Dense Matter experiments using pulsed-power facilities.</description>

      <title>Probing Direct $CP$ Violation in $\Lambda_b^0 \to P_c^+ h^-$ $(h=\pi,K)$ with Final-State Rescattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LHCb collaboration has recently reported a measurement of the difference in direct CP asymmetries for the decays $\Lambda_b^0 \to J/\psi \, p \, h^-$ (with $h = K, \pi$), offering new experimental constraints on the decay dynamics of heavy baryons into charmonium final states. Inspired by these findings, we explore the branching ratios and direct CP violations for the decays $\Lambda_b^0 \to P_c^+(4312, 4440, 4457)\,h^-$ within the framework of final-state rescattering. Our analysis indicates that the branching fractions for $\Lambda_b^0 \to P_c^+ \pi^-$ lie around the $10^{-6}$ level, with the corresponding direct CP asymmetries approaching approximately $1\%$. In contrast, the direct CP violation for the decay $\Lambda_b^0 \to P_c^+ K^-$ is found to be very small, while its branching ratios show a strong dependence on the spin assignments of the $P_c$ states. These predictions may provide useful guidance for more precise CP measurements and amplitude analyses in the $P_c$ region in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Exploring Higgs EFT in $t\bar{t}hh$ at High Luminosity LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-resonant production of a Higgs boson pair in association with a top-antitop quark pair ($pp\rightarrow t\bar{t}hh$) has only recently begun to be explored at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and provides a unique and largely uncharted probe of the top-Higgs sector, offering complementary sensitivity to the Higgs self-coupling and higher-dimensional interactions beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we present a detailed study of this process within the framework of Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). A comparative analysis is performed using a traditional cut-based approach in the single-lepton channel and a multivariate parametric boosted decision tree method in both single-lepton and dilepton final states. We derive one- and two-parameter limits at 95\% confidence level on the HEFT couplings $\delta\kappa_\lambda$, $c_2$, $c_{2g}$, and $c_{tg}$. The projected bound on $\delta\kappa_\lambda$ is weaker than current experimental constraints from dedicated Higgs-pair measurement; however, this coupling plays a critical role in shaping the multidimensional allowed parameter space. For the remaining HEFT couplings, where no direct experimental limits currently exist, our results provide the first sensitivity projections in the $t\bar{t}hh$ channel. Overall, this study demonstrates the strong potential of the $t\bar{t}hh$ production process to probe extended Higgs and top-quark interactions beyond the Standard Model through the exploitation of the $t\bar{t}hh$ data at the HL-LHC.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the top-quark Yukawa coupling from $t\overline{t}$ production in the lepton+jets final state using $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The top-quark Yukawa coupling is extracted from the distribution of the top-quark pair ($t \overline{t}$) invariant mass in proton-proton collisions using 140 ${fb}^{-1}$ of data at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV collected in 2015-2018 by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. In the region near the production threshold, the $t \overline{t}$ invariant mass spectrum is sensitive to electroweak virtual corrections, including contributions from Higgs boson exchange, thereby providing sensitivity to the top-quark Yukawa coupling. This is the first measurement in ATLAS that aims to obtain this coupling exploiting this approach. The $t\overline{t}$ system is reconstructed in the single-lepton final state, requiring exactly one isolated electron or muon and at least four jets with at least two identified as originating from $b$-quarks. The measured Yukawa coupling is found to be in good agreement with the Standard Model prediction. An upper limit on the top-quark Yukawa coupling strength of $Y_t &lt; 2.1$ relative to the Standard Model prediction is observed at 95% confidence level, consistent with the expected sensitivity.</description>

Abstract: This work investigates the prospects for performing a time-dependent angular analysis of $B_s^0 \rightarrow \phi \mu^+\mu^-$ decays at hadron colliders, and introduces new optimised angular observables associated with $B_s^0$-mixing in the decay rate. The time-dependent normalised decay rate and corresponding probability density function is presented both for when the flavour of the $B_s^0$ meson at production is tagged and when it is untagged. The normalised angular terms linked to $B_s^0$-mixing in the tagged (untagged) case are denoted $\mathcal{Z}_i$ ($\mathcal{H}_i$), and their optimised counterparts as $Q_i$ ($\mathcal{M}_i$).
  The expected sensitivities of these observables at the end of Run 3, Run 4, and Run 5 of the LHC are determined using pseudoexperiments generated with a decay-time resolution, background level, and signal yield similar to those reported by the LHCb collaboration. It is found that all observables can be extracted with Run 3 statistics, and that the $\mathcal{H}_i$ and $\mathcal{Z}_i$ observables have similar sensitivity, despite the former being suppressed by mixing terms. Moreover, the angular observables only accessible via flavour tagging, such as the equivalent of $P_5^{\prime}$ in the $B^0_s$ system, are found to exhibit sensitivities comparable to current measurements in $B^0 \rightarrow K^{\ast 0} \mu^+\mu^-$ decays once Run 5 datasets are available. Fits to the observables to extract the Wilson coefficients show a significant increase in precision when either the observables accessible via time-dependent analysis, or flavour tagging, are included. A marked increase in sensitivity to $CP$-violating short-distance effects is observed for a subset of the new optimised $M_i$ and $Q_i$ observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in accelerator technology have led to significant improvements in the quality of muon beams over the past decades. Investigations of the muon and muonium enable precise measurements of fundamental constants, as well as searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Furthermore, by utilizing muon beams with high intensity and polarization, studies of the dynamics of the muon and muonium within atomic level can offer valuable insights into materials science. This review presents recent progress and prospects at the frontiers of muon beams and high-precision muonium physics. It also provides an overview of novel methods and detection techniques to achieve high sensitivities in different areas, including particle physics, nuclear physics, materials science and beyond.</description>

      <title>Challenges and Opportunities of Gravitational Wave Searches above 10 kHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first direct measurement of gravitational waves by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations has opened up new avenues to explore our Universe. This white paper outlines the challenges and gains expected in gravitational-wave searches at frequencies above the LIGO/Virgo band. The scarcity of possible astrophysical sources in most of this frequency range provides a unique opportunity to discover physics beyond the Standard Model operating both in the early and late Universe, and we highlight some of the most promising of these sources. We review several detector concepts that have been proposed to take up this challenge, and compare their expected sensitivity with the signal strength predicted in various models. This report is the summary of a series of workshops on the topic of high-frequency gravitational wave detection, held in 2019 (ICTP, Trieste, Italy), 2021 (online) and 2023 (CERN, Geneva, Switzerland).</description>

      <title>New Constraints on Dark Photon Dark Matter with a Millimeter-Wave Dielectric Haloscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter remains one of the most profound and unresolved mysteries in modern physics. To unravel its nature, numerous haloscope experiments have been implemented across various mass ranges. However, very few haloscope experiments conducted within millimeter-wave frequency range, which is in the favored mass region for well-motivated dark matter candidates. Here we designed and constructed a millimeter-wave dielectric haloscope featuring a dark matter detector composed of dielectric disks and a mirror. Using this setup, we conducted a search for randomly polarized dark photon dark matter and found no evidence for its existence. Our results established new constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter in the mass range from $387.72$ to $391.03$ $\mu eV$, improving the existing limits by two orders of magnitude. With future enhancements, our system has the potential to explore new parameter space for dark photon as well as axion dark matter within the millimeter-wave frequency range.</description>

      <title>Updated Bounds on the Minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model from LHC Dilepton Resonance Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Left-Right model is a popular extension of the Standard Model that features three new neutral gauge bosons, $W^{\pm}_R$ and $Z_R$. Collider searches for a Left-Right symmetry are often concentrated on the charged right-handed current, but in this work, we take advantage of the dilepton data at the LHC with center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and 139 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity to place lower mass bounds in the $Z_R$ mass based on the $p\,p \rightarrow Z_{R} \rightarrow \ell^{+} \, \ell^{-}$ process. We vary the $SU(2)_R$ gauge coupling from $g_{R}=0.4$ to $g_{R}=1.0$, and impose $M_{Z_R}&gt;4.9$ TeV and $M_{Z_{R}}&gt;6.1$ TeV, respectively. Lastly, we put our findings into perspective with $W_R$ searches at the LHC and show that our limits cover an unexplored region of parameter space, where the right-handed neutrino is heavier than the $W_R$ boson.</description>

      <title>Probing displaced (dark)photons from low reheating freeze-in at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the Standard Model (SM) by introducing a $U(1)'$ gauge boson and a real pseudo-scalar field, both odd under a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. The resulting low-energy spectrum consists of a stable vector as the dark matter candidate, and a pseudo-scalar mediator, which interacts with the SM via a Higgs portal coupling and a dimension-five portal connecting it to both the dark and visible photons. We explore the freeze-in of both particles at low reheating temperature, finding a rich yield evolution dynamics in the early Universe. This setup brings a consistent dark matter scenario in which the dark photon relic abundance is generated through freeze-in at low reheating temperatures. In addition to its cosmological viability, the model can be tested at the LHC: Higgs bosons can decay into dark photons and displaced visible photons via the long-lived mediator. These signatures allow us to constrain the Higgs portal coupling using recent searches for non-pointing photons and limits on invisible or undetected Higgs decays. We derive meaningful constraints on the dark matter parameter space, in particular excluding a thermalized mediator in the region compatible with the observed relic abundance.</description>

      <title>Two-loop anomalous dimensions for baryon-number-violating operators in SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the two-loop renormalization-group equations for the baryon-number-violating dimension-six operators in the SMEFT. This includes all three gauge interactions, the Yukawa, and Higgs self-interaction contributions. In addition, we present the one-loop matching of the $S_1$ scalar leptoquark on the SMEFT, which can generate the Wilson coefficients of all four gauge-invariant baryon-number-violating SMEFT operators. Using this example, we demonstrate the cancellation of scheme and matching-scale dependences. Together with the known two-loop renormalization-group evolution below the electroweak scale in the LEFT, as well as the one-loop matching of SMEFT onto LEFT, our results enable consistent next-to-leading-log analyses of nucleon decays, provided that the relevant matrix elements are known at next-to-leading-order accuracy.</description>

      <title>First Experimental Demonstration of Beam Storage by Three-Dimensional Spiral Injection Scheme for Ultra-Compact Storage Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional spiral injection scheme enables storage in ultra-compact rings with nanosecond revolution period. We report the first successful storage of a $297\,\mathrm{keV/}c$ electron beam in a $22\,\mathrm{cm}$ weak-focusing storage ring with a $4.7\,\mathrm{ns}$ revolution period using multi-turn vertical kick with a $140\,\mathrm{ns}$ kicker pulse. Using a scintillating-fiber detector, we observe a signal exceeding $5\sigma$ of the pre-injection rms noise for $\geq 1\,\mathrm{\mu s}$, confirming beam storage. By varying the weak-focusing field configuration and measuring the stored beam distribution, we show that the storage beam resides within the predicted region by Monte Carlo simulations. This result is a key proof-of-principle for realizing ultra-compact storage rings for next-generation precision measurements including the muon experiments at J-PARC and PSI.</description>
