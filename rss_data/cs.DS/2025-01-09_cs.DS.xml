      <title>Multi-armed Bandit and Backbone boost Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun Algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lin-Kernighan-Helsguan (LKH) heuristic is a classic local search algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). LKH introduces an $\alpha$-value to replace the traditional distance metric for evaluating the edge quality, which leads to a significant improvement. However, we observe that the $\alpha$-value does not make full use of the historical information during the search, and single guiding information often makes LKH hard to escape from some local optima. To address the above issues, we propose a novel way to extract backbone information during the TSP local search process, which is dynamic and can be updated once a local optimal solution is found. We further propose to combine backbone information, $\alpha$-value, and distance to evaluate the edge quality so as to guide the search. Moreover, we abstract their different combinations to arms in a multi-armed bandit (MAB) and use an MAB model to help the algorithm select an appropriate evaluation metric dynamically. Both the backbone information and MAB can provide diverse guiding information and learn from the search history to suggest the best metric. We apply our methods to LKH and LKH-3, which is an extension version of LKH that can be used to solve about 40 variant problems of TSP and Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). Extensive experiments show the excellent performance and generalization capability of our proposed method, significantly improving LKH for TSP and LKH-3 for two representative TSP and VRP variants, the Colored TSP (CTSP) and Capacitated VRP with Time Windows (CVRPTW).</description>

      <title>Protecting the Connectivity of a Graph Under Non-Uniform Edge Failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of guaranteeing the connectivity of a given graph by protecting or strengthening edges. Herein, a protected edge is assumed to be robust and will not fail, which features a non-uniform failure model. We introduce the $(p,q)$-Steiner-Connectivity Preservation problem where we protect a minimum-cost set of edges such that the underlying graph maintains $p$-edge-connectivity between given terminal pairs against edge failures, assuming at most $q$ unprotected edges can fail. We design polynomial-time exact algorithms for the cases where $p$ and $q$ are small and approximation algorithms for general values of $p$ and $q$. Additionally, we show that when both $p$ and $q$ are part of the input, even deciding whether a given solution is feasible is NP-complete. This hardness also carries over to Flexible Network Design, a research direction that has gained significant attention. In particular, previous work focuses on problem settings where either $p$ or $q$ is constant, for which our new hardness result now provides justification.</description>

      <title>Graph classes through the lens of logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph transformations definable in logic can be described using the notion of transductions. By understanding transductions as a basic embedding mechanism, which captures the possibility of encoding one graph in another graph by means of logical formulas, we obtain a new perspective on the landscape of graph classes and of their properties. The aim of this survey is to give a comprehensive presentation of this angle on structural graph theory.
  We first give a logic-focused overview of classic graph-theoretic concepts, such as treedepth, shrubdepth, treewidth, cliquewidth, twin-width, bounded expansion, and nowhere denseness. Then, we present recent developments related to notions defined purely through transductions, such as monadic stability, monadic dependence, and classes of structurally sparse graphs.</description>

      <title>A Constant-factor Approximation for Weighted Bond Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.00857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Weighted $\mathcal{F}$-Vertex Deletion for a class ${\cal F}$ of graphs asks, weighted graph $G$, for a minimum weight vertex set $S$ such that $G-S\in{\cal F}.$ The case when ${\cal F}$ is minor-closed and excludes some graph as a minor has received particular attention but a constant-factor approximation remained elusive for Weighted $\mathcal{F}$-Vertex Deletion. Only three cases of minor-closed ${\cal F}$ are known to admit constant-factor approximations, namely Vertex Cover, Feedback Vertex Set and Diamond Hitting Set. We study the problem for the class ${\cal F}$ of $\theta_c$-minor-free graphs, under the equivalent setting of the Weighted $c$-Bond Cover problem, and present a constant-factor approximation algorithm using the primal-dual method. For this, we leverage a structure theorem implicit in [Joret, Paul, Sau, Saurabh, and Thomass\'{e}, SIDMA'14] which states the following: any graph $G$ containing a $\theta_c$-minor-model either contains a large two-terminal protrusion, or contains a constant-size $\theta_c$-minor-model, or a collection of pairwise disjoint constant-sized connected sets that can be contracted simultaneously to yield a dense graph. In the first case, we tame the graph by replacing the protrusion with a special-purpose weighted gadget. For the second and third case, we provide a weighting scheme which guarantees a local approximation ratio. Besides making an important step in the quest of (dis)proving a constant-factor approximation for Weighted $\mathcal{F}$-Vertex Deletion, our result may be useful as a template for algorithms for other minor-closed families.</description>

      <title>A Unified Algorithmic Framework for Dynamic Assortment Optimization under MNL Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider assortment and inventory planning problems with dynamic stockout-based substitution effects, and without replenishment, in two different settings: (1) Customers can see all available products when they arrive, a typical scenario in physical stores. (2) The seller can choose to offer a subset of available products to each customer, which is more common on online platforms. Both settings are known to be computationally challenging, and the current approximation algorithms for the two settings are quite different. We develop a unified algorithm framework under the MNL choice model for both settings. Our algorithms improve on the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of approximation guarantee and runtime, and the ability to manage uncertainty in the total number of customers and handle more complex constraints. In the process, we establish various novel properties of dynamic assortment planning (for the MNL choice model) that may be useful more broadly.</description>

      <title>Hardness of circuit and monotone diameters of polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04158v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Circuit diameter of polytopes was introduced by Borgwardt, Finhold and Hemmecke as a fundamental tool for the study of circuit augmentation schemes for linear programming and for estimating combinatorial diameters. Determining the complexity of computing the circuit diameter of polytopes was posed as an open problem by Sanit\`a as well as by Kafer, and was recently reiterated by Borgwardt, Grewe, Kafer, Lee and Sanit\`a.
  In this paper, we solve this problem by showing that computing the circuit diameter of a polytope given in halfspace-description is strongly NP-hard. To prove this result, we show that computing the combinatorial diameter of the perfect matching polytope of a bipartite graph is NP-hard. This complements a result by Sanit\`a (FOCS 2018) on the NP-hardness of computing the diameter of fractional matching polytopes and implies the new result that computing the diameter of a $\{0,1\}$-polytope is strongly NP-hard, which may be of independent interest. In our second main result, we give a precise graph-theoretic description of the monotone diameter of perfect matching polytopes and use this description to prove that computing the monotone (circuit) diameter of a given input polytope is strongly NP-hard as well.</description>

      <title>Minimum Weighted Feedback Arc Sets for Ranking from Pairwise Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Minimum Weighted Feedback Arc Set (MWFAS) problem is fundamentally connected to the Ranking Problem -- the task of deriving global rankings from pairwise comparisons. Recent work [He et al. ICML2022] has advanced the state-of-the-art for the Ranking Problem using learning-based methods, improving upon multiple previous approaches. However, the connection to MWFAS remains underexplored. This paper investigates this relationship and presents efficient combinatorial algorithms for solving MWFAS, thus addressing the Ranking Problem. Our experimental results demonstrate that these simple, learning-free algorithms not only significantly outperform learning-based methods in terms of speed but also generally achieve superior ranking accuracy.</description>

      <title>An Algorithmic Approach to Finding Degree-Doubling Nodes in Oriented Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Seymour's Second Neighborhood Conjecture asserts that in the square of any oriented graph, there exists a node whose out-degree at least doubles. This paper presents a definitive proof of the conjecture by introducing the GLOVER (Graph Level Order) data structure, which facilitates a systematic partitioning of neighborhoods and an analysis of degree-doubling conditions. By leveraging this structure, we construct a decreasing sequence of subsets that establish a well-ordering of nodes, ensuring that no counterexample can exist. This approach not only confirms the conjecture for all oriented graphs but also provides a novel framework for analyzing degrees and arcs in complex networks. The findings have implications for theoretical graph studies and practical applications in network optimization and algorithm design.</description>
