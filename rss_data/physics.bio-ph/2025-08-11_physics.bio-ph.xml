      <title>Epidemic threshold and localization of the SIS model on directed complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model on directed complex networks within the quenched mean-field approximation. Combining results from random matrix theory with an analytic approach to the distribution of fixed-point infection probabilities, we derive the phase diagram and show that the model exhibits a nonequilibrium phase transition between the absorbing and endemic phases for $c \geq \lambda^{-1}$, where $c$ is the mean degree and $\lambda$ the average infection rate. Interestingly, the critical line is independent of the degree distribution but is highly sensitive to the form of the infection-rate distribution. We further show that the inverse participation ratio of infection probabilities diverges near the epidemic threshold, indicating that the disease may become localized on a small fraction of nodes. These results provide a comprehensive picture of how network heterogeneities shape epidemic spreading on directed contact networks.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Hole Formation in Cell Monolayers Emerges from Collective Cell Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although cell monolayers typically remain confluent, they can spontaneously develop persistent holes as a result of collective cellular motion. Recent studies on MDCK monolayers cultured on soft substrates have revealed that cells can align to create regions of local nematic order, and topological defects that generate localised mechanical stresses which can spontaneously trigger hole formation. To investigate this process, we develop a continuum multi-phase field model that incorporates internal dissipation and active dipolar forces that drive cell shape anisotropy. Our simulations show that reducing substrate friction enhances cell-cell velocity correlations. In this low-friction regime, topological defects give rise to spiral flow patterns that concentrate stress and can trigger hole formation. We further demonstrate that the number and stability of the holes, whether they close or persist, depends on both substrate friction and cellular activity. These findings underscore the critical role of collective cell dynamics in maintaining tissue integrity.</description>

      <title>Traction and Stress Control Formation and Motion of +1/2 Topological Defects in Epithelial Cell Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In confluent cell monolayers, patterns of cell forces and motion are systematically altered near topological defects in cell shape. In turn, defects have been proposed to alter cell density, extrusion, and invasion, but it remains unclear how the defects form and how they affect cell forces and motion. Here, we studied +1/2 defects, and, in contrast to prior studies, we observed the concurrent occurrence of both tail-to-head and head-to-tail defect motion in the same cell monolayer. We quantified the cell velocities, the tractions at the cell-substrate interface, and the stresses within the cell layer near +1/2 defects. Results revealed that both traction and stress are sources of activity and dissipation within the epithelial cell monolayer, with the direction of motion of +1/2 defects depending on whether energy is injected by stresses or tractions. Interestingly, patterns of motion, traction, stress, and energy injection near +1/2 defects existed before defect formation, suggesting that defects form as a result of spatially coordinated patterns in cell forces and motion. These findings introduce a new focus, on coordinated patterns of force and motion that lead to defect formation and motion.</description>

      <title>Global graph features unveiled by unsupervised geometric deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphs provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems, but their structural variability poses significant challenges for analysis and classification. To address these challenges, we introduce GAUDI (Graph Autoencoder Uncovering Descriptive Information), a novel unsupervised geometric deep learning framework designed to capture both local details and global structure. GAUDI employs an innovative hourglass architecture with hierarchical pooling and upsampling layers linked through skip connections, which preserve essential connectivity information throughout the encoding-decoding process. Even though identical or highly similar underlying parameters describing a system's state can lead to significant variability in graph realizations, GAUDI consistently maps them into nearby regions of a structured and continuous latent space, effectively disentangling invariant process-level features from stochastic noise. We demonstrate GAUDI's versatility across multiple applications, including small-world networks modeling, characterization of protein assemblies from super-resolution microscopy, analysis of collective motion in the Vicsek model, and identification of age-related changes in brain connectivity. Comparison with related approaches highlights GAUDI's superior performance in analyzing complex graphs, providing new insights into emergent phenomena across diverse scientific domains.</description>
