      <title>Simulating many-engine spacecraft: Exceeding 100 trillion grid points via information~geometric regularization and the MFC flow solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a method and optimized implementation for exascale simulations of high-speed compressible fluid flows, enabling the simulation of multi-engine rocket craft at an unprecedented scale. We significantly improve upon the state-of-the-art in terms of computational cost and memory footprint through a carefully crafted implementation of the recently proposed information geometric regularization, which eliminates the need for numerical shock capturing. Unified addressing on tightly coupled CPU--GPU platforms increases the total problem size with negligible performance hit. Despite linear stencil algorithms being memory-bound, we achieve wall clock times that are four times faster than optimized baseline numerics. This enables the execution of CFD simulations at more than 100 trillion grid points, surpassing the largest state-of-the-art publicly available simulations by an order of magnitude. Ideal weak scaling is demonstrated on OLCF Frontier and CSCS Alps using the full system, entailing 37.8K AMD MI250X GPUs (Frontier) or 9.2K NVIDIA GH200 superchips (Alps).</description>

      <title>Antagonistic coinfection in rock-paper-scissors models during concurrent epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of dual disease epidemics within the spatial rock-paper-scissors model. In this framework, individuals from all species are equally susceptible to infection by two distinct pathogens transmitted via person-to-person contact. We assume antagonistic mortality, where the simultaneous occurrence of coinfection reduces the probability of host mortality due to complications arising from either coexisting disease. Specifically, we explore two scenarios: global antagonism, where the presence of one pathogen inhibits the progression of the other in coinfected hosts, and uneven antagonism, where only one pathogen affects the development of the other. Using stochastic simulations, we show that the characteristic length scale of the spatial patterns emerging from random initial conditions diminishes as antagonism becomes more significant. We find that antagonism enhances species population growth and reduces the average probability of healthy organisms becoming infected. Additionally, introducing individuals' mobility restrictions significantly decreases both organisms' infection risk and selection pressures. Our results demonstrate that combining mobility restrictions with antagonistic coinfection can increase organisms' life expectancy by up to $54\%$. Our findings show that integrating antagonistic coinfection and mobility restriction strategies into ecological models may provide insights into designing interventions for managing concurrent epidemics in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Spiral defect chaos with intermittency increases mean termination time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardiac models are examples of excitable systems and can support stable spiral waves. For certain parameter values, however, these spiral waves can become unstable, resulting in spiral defect chaos (SDC), characterized by the continuous creation and annihilation of spiral waves and thought to underlie atrial fibrillation. During SDC, the number of spiral waves fluctuates and eventually drops to zero, marking the termination of activity. In this work, we demonstrate that varying a single parameter allows the system to transition from SDC to a single spiral wave, passing through an intermediate regime of intermittency. In this intermittent dynamics, intervals of SDC are sandwiched between non-SDC intervals during which the number of spiral waves remains small and constant. We quantify this intermittency and show that the mean termination time increases significantly as the control parameter approaches values for which a single spiral wave is stable. In addition, we find that it is also possible to have intermittently present quasi-stable spiral waves in part of the computational domain while the remainder of the domain exhibits SDC. Our results may have implications for clinical atrial fibrillation, which often shows intermittency, switching back-and-forth between fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm.</description>

      <title>A computational approach for the study of electromagnetic interactions in reacting flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A computational fluid dynamics methodology for the simulation of electromagnetic interactions in compressible reacting flows has been formulated. The developed code, named EMI, is based on the SENGA Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) software. Static electric and magnetic fields are solved using Gauss's laws of Maxwell's equations. Electromagnetic wave propagation is solved by discretizing Ampere's and Faraday's equations using the explicit Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method. The equations for the electromagnetic fields are fully coupled with the Navier-Stokes equations, such that interactions between the electromagnetic fields and the fluid are included in the formulation. The interaction terms include the Lorentz, polarization, and magnetization forces. These forces determine volume forces that affect the transport of momentum, the diffusion velocity, and the energy conservation equations. In addition, the medium's properties affect the propagation of the electromagnetic fields via electrical permittivity and conductivity, charge density, and magnetic permeability. The solution of electromagnetic fields is validated against analytical and numerical solutions. The implementation of the coupling between electromagnetic fields and conservation equations for species, energy, and momentum is validated with laminar reacting flow numerical solutions from the literature. The capabilities of the formulation are investigated for a range of laminar methane-air computations under electrostatic, magnetostatic, and high-frequency electromagnetic waves. The validity of the electrostatic formulation in the presence of currents related to the movement of charged species is also assessed. Results demonstrate that EMI-SENGA can capture the fundamental effects of electromagnetic fields on reacting flows and the dynamics of charged species and their effect on flame shape and reactivity.</description>

      <title>Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Physics-Informed Neural Networks Using Error Bounds and Solution Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been widely used to obtain solutions to various physical phenomena modeled as Differential Equations. As PINNs are not naturally equipped with mechanisms for Uncertainty Quantification, some work has been done to quantify the different uncertainties that arise when dealing with PINNs. In this paper, we use a two-step procedure to train Bayesian Neural Networks that provide uncertainties over the solutions to differential equation systems provided by PINNs. We use available error bounds over PINNs to formulate a heteroscedastic variance that improves the uncertainty estimation. Furthermore, we solve forward problems and utilize the obtained uncertainties when doing parameter estimation in inverse problems in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Wave Splatting for Computer-Generated Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art neural rendering methods optimize Gaussian scene representations from a few photographs for novel-view synthesis. Building on these representations, we develop an efficient algorithm, dubbed Gaussian Wave Splatting, to turn these Gaussians into holograms. Unlike existing computer-generated holography (CGH) algorithms, Gaussian Wave Splatting supports accurate occlusions and view-dependent effects for photorealistic scenes by leveraging recent advances in neural rendering. Specifically, we derive a closed-form solution for a 2D Gaussian-to-hologram transform that supports occlusions and alpha blending. Inspired by classic computer graphics techniques, we also derive an efficient approximation of the aforementioned process in the Fourier domain that is easily parallelizable and implement it using custom CUDA kernels. By integrating emerging neural rendering pipelines with holographic display technology, our Gaussian-based CGH framework paves the way for next-generation holographic displays.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann Classifier: A Thermodynamic-Inspired Approach to Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel classification algorithm, the Boltzmann Classifier, inspired by the thermodynamic principles underlying the Boltzmann distribution. Our method computes a probabilistic estimate for each class based on an energy function derived from feature-wise deviations between input samples and class-specific centroids. The resulting probabilities are proportional to the exponential negative energies, normalized across classes, analogous to the Boltzmann distribution used in statistical mechanics. In addition, the KT variable can be used to allow the high energy states to be more accessible, which allows the tuning of their probabilities as needed. We evaluate the model performance on several datasets from different applications. The model achieves a high accuracy, which indicates that the Boltzmann Classifier is competitive with standard models like logistic regression and k-nearest neighbors while offering a thermodynamically motivated probabilistic interpretation. our classifier does not require iterative optimization or backpropagation and is thus computationally efficient and easy to integrate into existing workflows. This work demonstrates how ideas from physics can inform new directions in machine learning, providing a foundation for interpretable, energy-based decision-making systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review various changes made in recent years to the software development process of the LAMMPS simulation software package and the software itself. We discuss how those changes have impacted the effort and workflow required to develop and maintain a software package that has been in existence for more than 30 years and where a significant part of the code base is contributed by external developers. We also look into how those changes have affected the code quality and ease of modifying and extending the software while at the same time its audience has changed from a cohort with a generally strong software development background to a group containing many researchers with limited software development skills. We explore how this contributes to LAMMPS' significant growth in popularity in that time. We close with an outlook on future steps.</description>

      <title>Sharp front tracking with geometric interface reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel sharp front-tracking method designed to address limitations in classical front-tracking approaches, specifically their reliance on smooth interpolation kernels and extended stencils for coupling the front and fluid mesh. In contrast, the proposed method employs exclusively sharp, localized interpolation and spreading kernels, restricting the coupling to the interfacial fluid cells. This localized coupling is achieved by integrating a divergence-preserving velocity interpolation method with a piecewise parabolic interface calculation (PPIC) and a polyhedron intersection algorithm to compute the indicator function and local interface curvature. Surface tension is computed using the Continuum Surface Force (CSF) method, maintaining consistency with the sharp representation. Additionally, we propose an efficient local roughness smoothing implementation to account for surface mesh undulations, which is easily applicable to any triangulated surface mesh. Building on our previous work, the primary innovation of this study lies in the localization of the coupling for both the indicator function and surface tension calculations. By reducing the interface thickness on the fluid mesh to a single cell, as opposed to the 4-5 cell spans typical in classical methods, the proposed sharp front-tracking method achieves a highly localized and accurate representation of the interface. This sharper representation mitigates parasitic currents and improves force balancing, making it particularly suitable for scenarios where the interface plays a critical role, such as microfluidics, fluid-fluid interactions, and fluid-structure interactions. The presented results demonstrate that the sharp front-tracking method significantly outperforms the classical approach in terms of accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Evolution of cooperation and competition in multilayer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperation and competition coexist and coevolve in natural and social systems. Cooperation generates resources, which in turn, drive non-cooperative competition to secure individual shares. How this complex interplay between cooperation and competition shapes the evolution of social dilemmas and welfare remains unknown. In this study, we introduce a two-layer evolutionary game model, in which one layer is a cooperative public goods game, and the other is a competitive involution game, with cross-layer feedback linking the two. We find that feedback can either promote or inhibit cooperation, depending on the baseline conditions. For example, moderate resource and synergy factor values can promote social welfare when feedback strength is large. This provides an approach to adjusting the strength and asymmetry of cross-layer feedback to promote cooperation and social welfare. We thus emphasize the importance of managing feedback mechanisms to balance cooperation and competition in complex social systems.</description>

      <title>Crossed pseudopotential$-$functional calculations made simple: An extended Kohn-Sham framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations rely heavily on pseudopotentials, yet their impact on accuracy is barely addressed. In this work, we derive from the Kohn-Sham equation that the use of pseudopotentials invariably introduces a ``dropping" error, which leads to a deviation from the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. Crossed pseudopotential-functional calculations provide a pragmatic way to balance accuracy and efficiency, enabling the right results for the right reasons. This paradigm goes beyond the (generalized) Kohn-Sham framework, which we name the extended Kohn-Sham framework. We support our assertion with a bandgap study on 54 monovalent-Cu semiconductors. The crossed calculations, compared to consistent ones, not only remove all 11 erroneous metal predictions, but also drastically reduce the mean relative error from 80\% to 20\%. The accuracy even exceeds that of the hybrid functionals and GW due to the role of pseudopotentials in modelling the external potentials of Cu-valence electrons that cannot be compensated by exchange-correlation.</description>

      <title>DiffCrysGen: A Score-Based Diffusion Model for Design of Diverse Inorganic Crystalline Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystal structure generation is a foundational challenge in materials discovery, particularly in designing functional inorganic crystalline materials with desired properties. Most existing diffusion-based generative models for crystals rely on complex, hand-crafted priors and modular architectures to separately model atom types, atomic positions, and lattice parameters. These methods often require customized diffusion processes and conditional denoising, which can introduce additional model complexities and inconsistencies. Here we introduce DiffCrysGen, a fully data-driven, score-based diffusion model that jointly learns the distribution of all structural components in crystalline materials. With crystal structure representation as unified 2D matrices, DiffCrysGen bypasses the need for task-specific priors or decoupled modules, enabling end-to-end generation of atom types, fractional coordinates, and lattice parameters within a single framework. Our model learns crystallographic symmetry and chemical validity directly from large-scale datasets, allowing it to scale to complex materials discovery tasks. As a demonstration, we applied DiffCrysGen to the design of rare-earth-free magnetic materials with high saturation magnetization, showing its effectiveness in generating stable, diverse, and property-aligned candidates for sustainable magnet applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum mechanical closure of partial differential equations with symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for the dynamical closure of spatiotemporal dynamics governed by partial differential equations. We employ the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics to embed the original classical dynamics into an infinite dimensional quantum mechanical system, using the space of quantum states to model the unresolved degrees of freedom of the original dynamics and the technology of quantum measurement to predict their contributions to the resolved dynamics. We use a positivity preserving discretization to project the embedded dynamics to finite dimension. Combining methods from operator valued kernels and delay embedding, we derive a compressed representation of the dynamics that is invariant under the spatial symmetries of the original dynamics. We develop a data driven formulation of the scheme that can be realized numerically and apply it to a dynamical closure problem for the shallow water equations, demonstrating that our closure model can accurately predict the main features of the true dynamics, including for out of sample initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Machine Learning Potentials for Hydroxide Transport: Surprising Efficiency of Single-Concentration Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transferability of machine learning interatomic potentials across concentration variations in chemically similar systems, using aqueous potassium hydroxide solutions as a case study. Despite containing identical chemical species (K$^+$, OH$^-$, H$_2$O) across all concentrations, models fine-tuned on specific KOH concentrations exhibit surprisingly poor transferability to others, with force prediction errors increasing dramatically from ~30 meV/A (at training concentration) to ~90 meV/A (at very different concentrations). This reveals a critical limitation when applying such models beyond their training domain, even within chemically homogeneous systems. We demonstrate that strategic selection of training data can substantially overcome these limitations without requiring extensive computational resources. Models fine-tuned on intermediate concentrations (6.26 mol/L) exhibit remarkable transferability across the entire concentration spectrum (0.56-17.98 mol/L), often outperforming more computationally expensive models trained on multiple concentration datasets. This approach enables accurate simulation of hydroxide transport dynamics across varying electrolyte conditions while maintaining near-quantum accuracy. Our simulations further reveal the emergence of hydroxide-hydroxide hydrogen bonding at high concentrations - a phenomenon not explicitly represented in dilute training data but successfully captured by our intermediate-concentration model. This work establishes practical guidelines for developing broadly applicable machine learning force fields with optimal transferability, challenging the assumption that diverse training datasets are always necessary for robust performance in similar chemical environments.</description>

      <title>Design Principles for Realizable Discrete Surface Embeddings in Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The isometric embedding of surfaces in three-dimensional space is fundamental to various physical systems, from elastic sheets to programmable materials. While continuous surfaces typically admit unique solutions under suitable boundary conditions, their discrete counterparts-represented as networks of vertices connected by edges-can exhibit multiple distinct embeddings for identical edge lengths. We present a systematic approach to constructing discrete meshes that yield a controlled number of embeddings. By analyzing the relationship between mesh connectivity and embedding multiplicity through rigidity theory, we develop criteria for designing meshes that minimize solution multiplicity. We demonstrate computational methods based on local matrix operations and trilateration techniques, enabling practical implementation for meshes with approximately a thousand vertices. Our analysis provides both theoretical bounds on the number of possible embeddings based on B\'ezout's theorem and practical guidelines for mesh construction in physical applications. Through numerical simulations, we show that this approach achieves comparable accuracy to traditional minimization methods while offering computational advantages through sequential computation. Importantly, we demonstrate that in cases where a unique smooth solution exists, local fluctuations in reconstructed shapes derived from the computational grid can serve as indicators of insufficient geometric constraints. This work bridges the gap between discrete and continuous embedding problems, providing insights for applications in 4D printing, mechanical meta-materials, and deployable structures.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal spin transport from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a computational framework for first-principles density matrix transport within the Wigner function formalism to predict transport of quantum-mechanical degrees of freedom such as spin over long time and length scales. This framework facilitates simulation of spin dynamics and transport from first principles, while accounting for electron-phonon scattering at device length scales. We demonstrate this framework to elucidate the impact of various spin-orbit field profiles, such as Rashba and persistent spin helix, on coherent spin transport in several materials. Using graphene under an electric field as an example to illustrate the impact of electron-phonon scattering on incoherent transport, we show how the transport changes with the strength of scattering. We identify three distinct regimes of incoherent spin transport corresponding to the free induction decay, Dyakonov-Perel and Elliott-Yafet regimes of spin relaxation. In particular, we show that the spin diffusion length is insensitive to the strength of scattering within the Dyakonov-Perel regime.</description>

      <title>Automatically Differentiable Model Updating (ADiMU): conventional, hybrid, and neural network material model discovery including history-dependency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the first Automatically Differentiable Model Updating (ADiMU) framework that finds any history-dependent material model from full-field displacement and global force data (global, indirect discovery) or from strain-stress data (local, direct discovery). We show that ADiMU can update conventional (physics-based), neural network (data-driven), and hybrid material models. Moreover, this framework requires no fine-tuning of hyperparameters or additional quantities beyond those inherent to the user-selected material model architecture and optimizer. The robustness and versatility of ADiMU is extensively exemplified by updating different models spanning tens to millions of parameters, in both local and global discovery settings. Relying on fully differentiable code, the algorithmic implementation leverages vectorizing maps that enable history-dependent automatic differentiation via efficient batched execution of shared computation graphs. This contribution also aims to facilitate the integration, evaluation and application of future material model architectures by openly supporting the research community. Therefore, ADiMU is released as an open-source computational tool, integrated into a carefully designed and documented software named HookeAI.</description>

      <title>A LightGBM-Incorporated Absorbing Boundary Conditions for the Wave-Equation-Based Meshless Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A LightGBM-Incorporated absorbing boundary condition (ABC) computation approach for the wave-equation-based the radial point interpolation meshless (RPIM) method is proposed to simulate wave propagation in open space during the computation process. Different strageties are implemented for replacing the conventional perfectly matched layers (PMLs) in the computational domain. In this work, the model is used to predict the field components on the boundary at each time step to improve computational efficiency. The effectiveness and high efficiency of our method is verified by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Predicting solvation free energies with an implicit solvent machine learning potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00183v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) potentials are a powerful tool in molecular modeling, enabling ab initio accuracy for comparably small computational costs. Nevertheless, all-atom simulations employing best-performing graph neural network architectures are still too expensive for applications requiring extensive sampling, such as free energy computations. Implicit solvent models could provide the necessary speed-up due to reduced degrees of freedom and faster dynamics. Here, we introduce a Solvation Free Energy Path Reweighting (ReSolv) framework to parametrize an implicit solvent ML potential for small organic molecules that accurately predicts the hydration free energy, an essential parameter in drug design and pollutant modeling. With a combination of top-down (experimental hydration free energy data) and bottom-up (ab initio data of molecules in a vacuum) learning, ReSolv bypasses the need for intractable ab initio data of molecules in explicit bulk solvent and does not have to resort to less accurate data-generating models. On the FreeSolv dataset, ReSolv achieves a mean absolute error close to average experimental uncertainty, significantly outperforming standard explicit solvent force fields. Compared to the explicit solvent ML potential, ReSolv offers a computational speedup of four orders of magnitude and attains closer agreement with experiments. The presented framework paves the way toward deep molecular models that are more accurate yet computationally cheaper than classical atomistic models.</description>

      <title>Online learning of eddy-viscosity and backscattering closures for geophysical turbulence using ensemble Kalman inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Different approaches to using data-driven methods for subgrid-scale closure modeling have emerged recently. Most of these approaches are data-hungry, and lack interpretability and out-of-distribution generalizability. Here, we use {online} learning to address parametric uncertainty of well-known physics-based large-eddy simulation (LES) closures: the Smagorinsky (Smag) and Leith eddy-viscosity models (1 free parameter) and the Jansen-Held (JH) backscattering model (2 free parameters). For 8 cases of 2D geophysical turbulence, optimal parameters are estimated, using ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI), such that for each case, the LES' energy spectrum matches that of direct numerical simulation (DNS). Only a small training dataset is needed to calculate the DNS spectra (i.e., the approach is {data-efficient}). We find the optimized parameter(s) of each closure to be constant across broad flow regimes that differ in dominant length scales, eddy/jet structures, and dynamics, suggesting that these closures are {generalizable}. In a-posteriori tests based on the enstrophy spectra and probability density functions (PDFs) of vorticity, LES with optimized closures outperform the baselines (LES with standard Smag, dynamic Smag or Leith), particularly at the tails of the PDFs (extreme events). In a-priori tests, the optimized JH significantly outperforms the baselines and optimized Smag and Leith in terms of interscale enstrophy and energy transfers (still, optimized Smag noticeably outperforms standard Smag). The results show the promise of combining advances in physics-based modeling (e.g., JH) and data-driven modeling (e.g., {online} learning with EKI) to develop data-efficient frameworks for accurate, interpretable, and generalizable closures.</description>

      <title>Inverse Faraday effect in 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the spin contributions to the inverse Faraday effect (IFE) in transition metals. The IFE depends on the d-electron filling and asymmetry between excited electron and hole spin moments. Our results reveal that even elements with smaller electron magnetic moments, like Os, can exhibit higher IFE due to greater electron-hole asymmetry. Pt shows the highest IFE in the 1-2 eV frequency range, while Os dominates in the 2-4 eV range. In addition, we demonstrate that the IFE of neighboring elements with similar crystal structures (e.g., Ir, Pt, and Au) can be tuned by adjusting their Fermi levels, indicating the importance of d-electron filling on IFE. Finally, we find that the trend in electron (or hole) contributions to the IFE closely follows that of the spin Hall conductivity, however, the total IFE involves more complex interactions.</description>

      <title>Theory of Order-Disorder Phase Transitions Induced by Fluctuations Based on Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Both quantum phase transitions and thermodynamic phase transitions are probably induced by fluctuations, yet the specific mechanism through which fluctuations cause phase transitions remains unclear in existing theories. This paper summarizes different phases into combinations of three types of network structures based on lattice models transformed into network models. These three network structures correspond to ordered, boundary, and disordered conditions, respectively. By utilizing the transformation relationships satisfied by these three network structures and classical probability, this work derive the high-order detailed balance relationships satisfied by strongly correlated systems. Using the high-order detailed balance formula, this work obtain the weights of the maximum entropy network structures in general cases. Consequently, I clearly describe the process of ordered-disordered phase transitions based on fluctuations and provide critical exponents and phase transition points. Finally, I verify this theory using the Ising model in different dimensions, the frustration scenario of the triangular lattice antiferromagnetic Ising model, and the expectation of ground-state energy in the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model.</description>

      <title>On the Estimation of Centre of Mass in Periodic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14578v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calculation of the centre of mass of a group of particles in a periodically-repeating cell is an important aspect of chemical and physical simulation. One popular approach calculates the centre of mass via the projection of the individual particles' coordinates onto a circle [Bai \&amp; Breen, \emph{J. Graph. Tools}, \textbf{13}(4), 53, (2008)]. However, this approach involves averaging of the particles in a non-physically meaningful way resulting in inaccurate centres of mass. Instead the intrinsic weighted average should be computed, but the analytical calculation of this is computationally expensive and complex. Here, we propose a more computationally efficient approach to compute the intrinsic mean that is suitable for the majority of chemical systems.</description>

      <title>Collective Neutrino Oscillations in Three Flavors on Qubit and Qutrit Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective neutrino flavor oscillations are of primary importance in understanding the dynamic evolution of core-collapse supernovae and subsequent terrestrial detection, but also among the most challenging aspects of numerical simulations. This situation is complicated by the quantum many-body nature of the problem due to neutrino-neutrino interactions which demands a quantum treatment. An additional complication is the presence of three flavors, which often is approximated by the electron flavor and a heavy lepton flavor. In this work, we provide both qubit and qutrit encodings for all three flavors, and develop optimized quantum circuits for the time evolution and analyze the Trotter error. We conclude our study with a hardware experiment of a system of two neutrinos with superconducting hardware: the IBM Torino device for qubits and AQT device for qutrits. We find that error mitigation greatly helps in obtaining a signal consistent with simulations. While hardware results are comparable at this stage, we expect the qutrit setup to be more convenient for large-scale simulations since it does not suffer from probability leakage into nonphsycial qubit space, unlike the qubit setup.</description>

      <title>Simple and exact nonlinear pendulum motion for all possible initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16816v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simple and formally exact solutions of energy-conserving nonlinear pendulum motion are derived for all three classes: swinging, stopping, and spinning. Their unique simplicity should be useful in a theoretical development that requires tractable mathematical framework or in an introductory physics course that aims to discuss nonlinear pendulum. Although with seemingly very different characteristic motions, the swinging and the spinning motion can now be treated on the same footing using frequency domain. The key insights provided by the solutions is the importance of angular velocity frequency analysis, rather than that of angular displacement. The emphasis on velocity frequency domain should benefit other studies of nonlinear motion as well. Brief theoretical derivations are given. The solutions are validated by exact numerical values and frequencies analysis of dynamical simulations using velocity verlet integration.</description>

      <title>A Matrix Product State Representation of Boolean Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel normal form representation of Boolean functions in terms of products of binary matrices, hereafter referred to as the Binary Matrix Product (BMP) representation. BMPs are analogous to the Tensor-Trains (TT) and Matrix Product States (MPS) used, respectively, in applied mathematics and in quantum many-body physics to accelerate computations that are usually inaccessible by more traditional approaches. BMPs turn out to be closely related to Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs), a powerful compressed representation of Boolean functions invented in the late 80s by Bryant that has found a broad range of applications in many areas of computer science and engineering. We present a direct and natural translation of BMPs into Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs), and derive an elementary set of operations used to manipulate and combine BMPs that are analogous to those introduced by Bryant for BDDs. Both BDDs and BMPs are practical tools when the complexity of these representations, as measured by the maximum bond dimension of a BMP (or the accumulated bond dimension across the BMP matrix train) and the number of nodes of a BDD, remains polynomial in the number of bits, $n$. In both cases, controlling the complexity hinges on optimizing the order of the Boolean variables. BMPs offer the advantage that their construction and manipulation rely on simple linear algebra -- a compelling feature that can facilitate the development of open-source libraries that are both more flexible and easier to use than those currently available for BDDs. An initial implementation of a BMP library is available on GitHub, with the expectation that the close conceptual connection to TT and MPS techniques will motivate further development of BMP methods by researchers in these fields, potentially enabling novel applications to classical and quantum computing.</description>
