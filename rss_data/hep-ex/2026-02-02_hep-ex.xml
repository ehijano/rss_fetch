      <title>Neutrino-argon cross-section measurements from the MicroBooNE experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MicroBooNE is a liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) neutrino detector located along the Fermilab Booster Neutrino Beam and 8 degrees off-axis to the Neutrinos at the Main Injector beam. MicroBooNE collected data from both beams accumulating a large neutrino-argon scattering dataset containing hundreds of thousands of events. Understanding neutrino-argon interactions is crucial for the next generation of neutrino oscillation experiments including DUNE. MicroBooNE has developed pioneering methodologies and novel reconstruction tools in order to benchmark models at very high sensitivity across the interaction phase space, including for ultra-rare channels. This proceeding presents an overview of the most recent MicroBooNE neutrino interaction results. These measurements span inclusive, CC0$\pi$, and rare channels including $\Lambda$, $K^+$ and $\eta$ production, providing invaluable datasets for constraining backgrounds and improving the modeling of neutrino scattering critical for the broader LArTPC neutrino physics program.</description>

      <title>The SPD project at NICA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Spin Physics Detector (SPD) is a universal detector in the one of two interaction points of the NICA collider under construction at JINR, Dubna. SPD plans to study the spin structure of the proton and deuteron and other spin-related phenomena using a unique possibility to operate with polarized proton and deuteron beams at a collision energy up to 27 GeV and a luminosity up to $10^{32}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. As the main goal, the experiment aims to provide access to the gluon TMD PDFs in the proton and deuteron, as well as the gluon transversity distribution and tensor PDFs in the deuteron, via the measurements of specific single and double spin asymmetries using different complementary probes such as charmonia, open charm, and prompt photon production processes. Other polarized and unpolarized physics is possible, especially at the first stage of NICA operation with reduced luminosity and collision energy of the proton and ion beams. Construction of the first stage of the SPD facility is included in the JINR seven-year development plan for 2024-2030. The physics program of the SPD project and the design of the SPD setup are presented.</description>

      <title>Breaking barriers: the impact of ATLAS Virtual Visits in science communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ATLAS Collaboration at CERN's Large Hadron Collider is at the forefront of particle physics research and is equally committed to bridging the gap between cutting-edge science and the wider public. Since 2010, the ATLAS Virtual Visits programme has provided live, interactive tours of the ATLAS detector and control room to global audiences in their language, without the need to travel. The programme has grown significantly since its inception, as demonstrated by quantitative data collected since January 2019 and case studies of large-scale implementations in Brazil and Greece. The impact on individual participants is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Recent results on heavy resonances at CMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics provides a successful description of elementary particles and their interactions. However, it does not explain phenomena such as the hierarchy problem or the nature of dark matter. Many Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) theories provide answers to these open questions by adding new heavy resonances, which can be probed directly at colliders. This note summarizes recent resonance searches by the CMS Collaboration, focusing on final states containing top quarks and Higgs bosons.</description>

      <title>Parton spin correlations and $\mathcal{CP}$ properties in Higgs boson decay at future lepton colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a phenomenological study of partonic spin correlations and $\mathcal{CP}$ properties in $H\to gg$ decay channel at future lepton colliders. We investigate two classes of observables: Lund observable defined based on subjets and four-point energy-energy correlator (E4C) between particles inside two jets. Our results show that the E4C with energy weighted to the power of \(n=4\) achieves the strongest sensitivity to the spin correlations of gluons from Higgs boson decay. Under the assumption of ideal identification of different gluon splitting modes, we estimate that future lepton colliders operating at \(\sqrt{s}=240~\mathrm{GeV}\) with an integrated luminosities of \(5.6~\mathrm{ab}^{-1}\) can successfully probe gluon spin correlations, while \(20~\mathrm{ab}^{-1}\) of data can probe the $\mathcal{CP}$-mixing angle in the \(Hgg\) coupling to \(\lesssim 0.03\pi\) using E4C. We outline strategies for extending this framework to realistic detector-level analyses, which can provide a new pathway for the precision test of Standard Model and searches for new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a protocol to measure impulses beyond the standard quantum limit. The protocol reduces noise in all three spatial dimensions and consists of squeezing a mechanical system's state via a series of jumps in the frequency of the harmonic potential. We quantify how decoherence in a realistic system of an optically levitated, dielectric nanoparticle limits the ultimate sensitivity. We predict that $\sim$10 dB of squeezing is achievable with current technology, enabling quantum-enhanced detection of weak impulses.</description>

      <title>IceCube DeepCore's sensitivity to Non-Standard neutrino Interactions in the Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22374v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillations continue to provide one of the most promising avenues for uncovering physics beyond the Standard Model. In particular, beyond-standard-model neutrino matter interactions may perturb neutrino oscillations in matter, leading to an observable signal in long baseline oscillation experiments. Moreover, such interactions can be a possible explanation of the rising tension between T2K and NOvA's $\delta_{\text{CP}}$ measurements. We examine IceCube DeepCore's sensitivity to these Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) by employing a model-independent NSI parameterization, and examine IceCube DeepCore's ability to comment on NSI being the cause of the T2K-NOvA $\delta_{\text{CP}}$ tension.</description>

      <title>Relativistic effects in heavy mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the application of a relativistic potential model to the description of the spectrum and radiative transitions in mesons containing at least one heavy quark (b or c). Although the model has a small number of parameters, it is possible to achieve qualitative agreement with all available experimental data, including those that could not be explained by all previous methods. This demonstrates the importance of taking relativistic effects into account. A remarkable property of the relativistic potential model is that the predictions for meson masses and partial widths of radiative transitions remain finite in the limit of zero light quark mass.</description>

      <title>Singly Cabibbo-suppressed hadronic weak decays of the $\Omega^-$ hyperon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the two-body hadronic weak decays of the $\Omega^-$ hyperon with strangeness $S=-3$, including three singly Cabibbo-suppressed decay modes: $\Xi^0 \pi^-$, $\Xi^-\pi^0$ and $\Lambda K^-$. The decay amplitudes at the quark level, arising from $s\to ud \bar{u}$ transitions (direct pion emission and color-suppressed processes) and $su\to ud$ transitions (pole terms), are calculated in the framework of the non-relativistic constituent quark model.The theoretical results show that the $\Xi^0 \pi^-$ channel is dominated by the color-allowed direct pion emission process, while the $\Lambda K^-$ channel is well described by one type of pole contribution mediated through intermediate $\Xi$ resonances ($1^2S_{1/2^+}$ and $1^2P_{1/2^-}$ states). However, the contribution from tree-level mechanisms alone to the branching ratio of $\Omega^- \to \Xi^- \pi^0$ is small due to its color-suppressed nature. The discrepancy is resolved by including final state interactions through rescattering processes via intermediate states $\Xi^0\pi^-$ and $\Lambda K^-$. This work demonstrates that a unified description of $\Omega^-$ hadronic weak decays necessitates the interplay of quark-level weak vertices, baryon pole structures, and long-distance final state rescattering dynamics. With these mechanisms, the obtained branching ratios are in agreement with the high-precision experimental data from the BESIII. Furthermore, these above decays are found to be dominated by the parity-conserving $P$-wave transitions, thus the asymmetry parameters are almost zero.</description>

      <title>Radiative Dirac Neutrino Masses from Modular $S_3$ Symmetry in an Axion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified axion model framework that simultaneously addresses the origin of neutrino masses, leptonic flavor structure, the strong CP problem, and dark matter. The model is based on a global $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$ symmetry combined with a modular $S_3$ symmetry and is realized within a novel class of KSVZ-type axion model. Exotic colored fermions and scalars mediate radiative neutrino mass generation at the one loop-level. The PQ charge assignment forbids tree-level neutrino masses and leaves a residual $Z_3$ symmetry that ensures the Dirac nature of neutrinos. In the minimal realization, the neutrino mass matrix is of rank two, predicting one massless neutrino. Consequently, the sum of neutrino masses is constrained for both the normal and inverted hierarchies. We analyze the implications for charged lepton flavor violation and the lepton $g-2$. The axion emerging from this framework dynamically resolves the strong CP problem and accounts for the observed dark matter abundance. Notably, the predicted axion-photon coupling is within reach of upcoming experiments and consistent with existing astrophysical and cosmological bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the wavelet formalism of quantum field theory to study field theories in the nonperturbative Hamiltonian framework. Specifically, we make use of Daubechies wavelets in momentum space. These basis elements are characterised by a resolution and a translation index that provides for a natural nonperturbative infrared and ultraviolet truncation of the quantum field theory. As an application, we consider the $\phi^4$ theory and demonstrate the emergence of the well-known nonperturbative strong-coupling phase transition in the $m^2&gt;0$ sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.23047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the non-zero value of $\theta_{13}$ has opened an exciting opportunity to probe the Earth's matter effects in three-flavor oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos. These matter effects depend on both neutrino energy and the electron density distributions encountered during their propagation through Earth. In this contribution, we present preliminary sensitivities from the DeepCore detector, a densely instrumented sub-array of the IceCube neutrino observatory at the South Pole, demonstrating its ability to observe these matter effects in atmospheric neutrino oscillations. Using simulated data equivalent to 9.3 years of observations at IceCube DeepCore, we show the sensitivity of the DeepCore to reject the vacuum oscillation hypothesis and align with the Preliminary Reference Earth Model. Additionally, we present the expected improvement in sensitivity for rejecting the vacuum oscillations using the upcoming IceCube Upgrade, a low-energy extension of the IceCube detector.</description>

      <title>Exploring Layered Structure Inside Earth Using Atmospheric Neutrino Oscillation at IceCube DeepCore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The IceCube detector, using its densely instrumented center, called DeepCore, can detect multi-GeV atmospheric neutrinos. The oscillation pattern of neutrinos is altered due to interactions with ambient electrons as they pass through Earth. The changes in these patterns are influenced by the amount of matter and its specific arrangement. As neutrinos propagate, they retain information about the densities they encounter. Our study demonstrates that IceCube DeepCore can utilize the Earth's matter effects to distinguish between a homogeneous matter density profile and a layered structure density profile of Earth. In this contribution, we present that IceCube DeepCore data equivalent to 9.3 years of observation can reject the homogeneous matter density profile with a confidence level of 1.4$\sigma$.</description>

Abstract: Earth's mass and internal structure have been primarily studied through gravitational and seismic methods. Neutrinos, however, offer an independent way to explore Earth's interior via matter effects in neutrino oscillations that depend on the electron distribution inside Earth, and hence its matter density. Our study uses atmospheric neutrinos at DeepCore, a densely instrumented sub-detector of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, to estimate Earth's mass and layer densities. We also assess how the upcoming IceCube Upgrade, with denser instrumentation, could improve these measurements.</description>

      <title>Exploring Long-Range Interactions in the Atmospheric Neutrino Oscillations at IceCube DeepCore</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.23093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The IceCube neutrino observatory consists of an array of Digital Optical Modules (DOMs) instrumenting one cubic-kilometer of deep glacial ice at the South Pole. DeepCore, a densely-spaced sub-array of DOMs at the bottom central region of IceCube, enables the detection of atmospheric neutrinos with an energy threshold in the GeV range. The high statistics data of DeepCore provides a unique opportunity to perform neutrino oscillation studies as well as explore various sub-leading Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics signatures. We consider a well-motivated minimal extension of the Standard Model by an additional anomaly-free, gauged lepton-number symmetry, such as $L_e - L_\mu$ or $L_e - L_\tau$. These symmetries give rise to flavor-dependent long-range interaction mediated through a very light neutral gauge boson.

      <title>Vision Calorimeter for Anti-neutron Reconstruction: A Baseline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10599v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In high-energy physics, anti-neutrons ($\bar{n}$) are fundamental particles that frequently appear as final-state particles, and the reconstruction of their kinematic properties provides an important probe for understanding the governing principles. However, this confronts significant challenges instrumentally with the electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC), a typical experimental sensor but recovering the information of incident $\bar{n}$ insufficiently. In this study, we introduce Vision Calorimeter (ViC), a baseline method for anti-neutron reconstruction that leverages deep learning detectors to analyze the implicit relationships between EMC responses and incident $\bar{n}$ characteristics. Our motivation lies in that energy distributions of $\bar{n}$ samples deposited in the EMC cell arrays embody rich contextual information. Converted to 2-D images, such contextual energy distributions can be used to predict the status of $\bar{n}$ ($i.e.$, incident position and momentum) through a deep learning detector along with pseudo bounding boxes and a specified training objective. Experimental results demonstrate that ViC substantially outperforms the conventional reconstruction approach, reducing the prediction error of incident position by 42.81% (from 17.31$^{\circ}$ to 9.90$^{\circ}$). More importantly, this study for the first time realizes the measurement of incident $\bar{n}$ momentum, underscoring the potential of deep learning detectors for particle reconstruction.

      <title>Measurement of time-dependent $CP$ asymmetries in $B^0 \to K_{\rm S}^0 \: \pi^{+} \pi^{-} \gamma$ decays at Belle and Belle II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a measurement of the time-dependent $CP$ asymmetry in $B^0 \to K_{\rm S}^0 \: \pi^{+} \pi^{-} \gamma$ decays using a data set of 365 fb$^{-1}$ recorded by the Belle II experiment and the final data set of 711 fb$^{-1}$ recorded by the Belle experiment at the ${\rm \Upsilon(4S)}$ resonance. The direct and mixing-induced time-dependent $CP$ violation parameters $C$ and $S$ are determined along with two additional quantities, $S^{+}$ and $S^{-}$, defined in the two halves of the $m^2(K_{\rm S}^0 \pi^{+})-m^2(K_{\rm S}^0 \pi^{-})$ plane. The measured values are $C = -0.17 \pm 0.09 \pm 0.04$, $S = -0.29 \pm 0.11 \pm 0.05$, $S^{+} = -0.57 \pm 0.23 \pm 0.10$ and $S^{-} = 0.31 \pm 0.24 \pm 0.05$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic.</description>

      <title>A Method to Constrain Preferential Emission and Spectator Dynamics in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06977v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Longitudinal particle production in heavy-ion collisions is influenced both by preferential emission from participating nucleons and by the breakup of spectator matter, yet quantifying these effects experimentally remains challenging. We introduce a Pearson correlation between spectator and charged-particle forward-backward asymmetries as an experimental probe of these phenomena. Using Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV simulated with A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) model, we validate that this correlator provides a robust, pseudorapidity-differential measure of the influence of preferential emission on the longitudinal structure of particle production. We further demonstrate that the correlation strength is sensitive to fluctuations in spectator number, which in experiments arise from evaporation and fragmentation of the spectator remnants. The proposed observable therefore offers a data-driven handle for constraining models of preferential emission and spectator breakup, thereby improving our understanding of the mechanisms that shape the final-state longitudinal distributions in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Fast Low Energy Reconstruction using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: IceCube is a Cherenkov detector instrumenting over a cubic kilometer of glacial ice deep under the surface of the South Pole. The DeepCore sub-detector lowers the detection energy threshold to a few GeV, enabling the precise measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters with atmospheric neutrinos. The reconstruction of neutrino interactions inside the detector is essential in studying neutrino oscillations. It is particularly challenging to reconstruct sub-100 GeV events with the IceCube detectors due to the relatively sparse detection units and detection medium. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are broadly used in physics experiments for both classification and regression purposes. This paper discusses the CNNs developed and employed for the latest IceCube-DeepCore oscillation measurements. These CNNs estimate various properties of the detected neutrinos, such as their energy, direction of arrival, interaction vertex position, flavor-related signature, and are also used for background classification.</description>

      <title>CaloHadronic: a diffusion model for the generation of hadronic showers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating showers of particles in highly-granular calorimeters is a key frontier in the application of machine learning to particle physics. Achieving high accuracy and speed with generative machine learning models can enable them to augment traditional simulations and alleviate a major computing constraint. Recent developments have shown how diffusion based generative shower simulation approaches that do not rely on a fixed structure, but instead generate geometry-independent point clouds, are very efficient. We present a transformer-based extension to previous architectures which were developed for simulating electromagnetic showers in the highly granular electromagnetic calorimeter of the International Large Detector, ILD. The attention mechanism now allows us to generate complex hadronic showers with more pronounced substructure across both the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. This is the first time that machine learning methods are used to holistically generate showers across the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter in highly granular imaging calorimeter systems.</description>

      <title>Testing Non-Standard Neutrinos in Purely Leptonic Lepton Decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to probe sterile neutrinos using polarization observables in the purely leptonic decays $\ell^{\prime-} \to \ell^{-} \bar{\nu}_{\ell} \nu_{\ell^{\prime}}$. By analyzing angular distributions and asymmetries derived from polarized decay rates, we identify distinctive signatures of sterile neutrino mixing. In particular, we demonstrate that sterile neutrinos can induce singularities in certain asymmetry parameters as functions of the invariant mass squared of the neutrino pair. These singularities occur for sterile neutrino masses $m_{4\nu}$ satisfying $m_{4\nu}^2 &lt; m_{\ell^{\prime}}^2 / 2$, providing a clear target for experimental investigation. Our results motivate the incorporation of polarized beam sources at future colliders to enhance sensitivity to sterile neutrinos and other new physics.</description>

      <title>Beam-test evaluation of pre-production Low Gain Avalanche Detectors for the ATLAS High Granularity Timing Detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The High Granularity Timing Detector (HGTD) will be installed in the ATLAS experiment as part of the Phase-II upgrade for the High Luminosity-Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). It will mitigate pile-up effects in the forward region, and measure per bunch luminosity. The design of HGTD is based on Low Gain Avalanche Detector (LGAD) sensors. This paper presents the results of beam-test campaigns conducted at CERN and DESY in 2023 and 2024 on single LGADs from HGTD pre-production test structures, before and after neutron irradiation up to fluences of $2.5 \times 10^{15}~\mathrm{n_{eq}/cm^2}$. The tested LGADs can meet HGTD requirements in terms of charge collection, time resolution, and hit efficiency, even under HL-LHC end-of-life conditions, supporting their deployment in the final detector.</description>

      <title>Towards First Detection of the Solar MSW Transition With JUNO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matter-induced neutrino flavor mixing (the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein, or MSW, effect) is a central prediction of the neutrino mixing framework, but it has not been conclusively observed. Direct observation of the energy-dependent MSW transition in the solar electron-neutrino survival probability would solve this, but backgrounds have been prohibitive. We show that our new technique for suppressing muon-induced spallation backgrounds will allow JUNO to measure the MSW transition at $&gt;$4$\sigma$ significance in 10 years. This would strongly support upcoming multi-\$1B next-generation long-baseline experiments and their goals in cementing the neutrino mixing framework.</description>
