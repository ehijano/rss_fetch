      <title>Efficient Electron Spin Relaxation by Chiral Phonons in WSe$_2$ Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductor monolayers the spin dynamics of electrons is controlled by the original spin-valley locking effect resulting from the interplay between spin-orbit interaction and inversion asymmetry. As a consequence, for electrons occupying bottom conduction bands, a carrier spin flip occurs only if there is a simultaneous change of valley. However, very little is known about the intra-valley spin relaxation processes. In this work we have performed stationary and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements in high quality WSe$_2$ monolayers. Our experiments highlight an efficient relaxation from bright to dark excitons, due to a fast intra-valley electron transfer from the top to the bottom conduction band with opposite spins. A combination of experiments and theoretical analysis allows us to infer a spin relaxation time of about $\tau_s\sim10~$ps, driven by the interplay between $\Gamma$-valley chiral phonons and spin-orbit mixing.</description>

      <title>Observation of Klein bottle quadrupole topological insulators in electric circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Klein bottle Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes (BBH) insulator phase plays a pivotal role in understanding higher-order topological phases. The insulator phase is characterized by a unique feature: a nonsymmorphic glide symmetry that exists within momentum space, rather than real space. This characteristic transforms the Brillouin zone's fundamental domain into a structure of Klein bottle. Here, we report an observation of a Klein bottle topoelectrical model under gauge fields. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the different corner distributions of odd and even unit cells, we present theoretical calculations and demonstrate that the symmetry properties significantly affect the topological nature. These theoretical predictions are confirmed by experimental results, which demonstrate the practical feasibility of such topological configurations in electronic circuits. Our work establishes a vital connection between the realms of condensed matter physics and circuit systems, thereby paving a pathway for investigating exotic condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Observation of non-Abelian band topology without time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Going beyond the conventional theory, non-Abelian band topology uncovers the global quantum geometry of Bloch bands with multiple gaps and thus unveil a new paradigm for topological physics. However, to date, all non-Abelian topological materials are restricted to systems with time-reversal symmetry (T). Here, starting from a Kagome lattice inspired by Haldane model and designer gyromagnetic photonic crystals (PhCs), we show that T breaking can lead to rich non-Abelian topological physics, particularly the emergence of multigap antichiral edge states. Simply changing the magnetic flux of the Kagome lattice, or in-situ tuning the local magnetic field of the gyromagnetic PhCs, can lead to the unconventional creation, braiding, merging, and splitting of non-Abelian charged band nodes, alongside with the direct manipulation of the multigap antichiral edge states. Particularly, the quadratic point can be split into four Dirac points, a phenomenon unique in T-broken systems. Our theoretical and experimental findings will inspire a new direction in the study of non-Abelian physics in T-broken systems and open an unprecedent pathway for topological manipulation of electromagnetic waves.</description>

      <title>Bound States in Continuum via Singular Transfer Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, bound states in continuum (BICs) have gained significant value for practitioners in both theoretical and applied photonics. This paper focuses on devices that utilize non-homogeneous thin patterned laminae. The properties, design principles, and behavior of BICs for this class of devices are frequently explained through a variety of models, ranging from numerical or semi-analytical solutions for the Maxwell equations to heuristic approaches that rely on fitting functions to provide phenomenological descriptions. The field of devices under study has given less attention to approaches that integrate exact analytical solutions of the transfer matrix with numerical data. In this vein, this paper aims to adopt an approach where exact analytical formulas, detailed in our previous manuscript arXiv:2303.06765 (2023), are translated into equations to explore the origins and properties of the bound states in continuum, as well as their practical implementation. The geometric parameters of the device and its operating frequency band emerge from the null space of the transfer matrix.</description>

      <title>Optical reflection signature of an axion dielectric with magnetic current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the reflection properties on the interface between an ordinary dielectric medium and a dielectric supporting a magnetic current (equivalent to a dielectric governed by axion electrodynamics). Considering the usual Maxwell equations and constitutive relations, we derive the general Fresnel coefficients for reflection for an incident wave with $s$ and $p$ polarization, assuming an isotropic magnetic current on a dielectric substrate. We determine all total internal reflection and critical angles (Brewster angles) conditions, which are given by strict relations between all relevant electromagnetic quantities of the system and the frequency. For $s$- and $p$-polarized incident waves, total internal reflection can occur under certain conditions on the constitutive parameters (for each propagating mode) at specific frequency windows and certain incidence angle intervals. All possible conditions to define critical angles for null reflection are determined. This scenario allows polarization changes by reflection. Considering a $p$-polarized incident wave, the frequency and the Brewster angle, allowing null reflection for both propagating modes, are determined. The Goos-H\"anchen shift and the complex Kerr rotation are also evaluated. The Kerr ellipticity angle presents a frequency-dependent behavior, also reported in Weyl semimetals, having maximum values $\eta_{Kerr}=\pm \pi/4$ for specific values of frequency, which may work as a signature of this axion chiral dielectric.</description>
