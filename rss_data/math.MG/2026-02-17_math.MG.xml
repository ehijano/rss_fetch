      <title>Symmetrizations of Ball-Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study symmetrization procedures within the class $\mathcal S_n$ of \emph{ball-bodies}, i.e.\ intersections of unit Euclidean balls (equivalently, summands of the Euclidean unit ball, or $c$-convex sets via the $c$-duality $A\mapsto A^c$). We first examine linear parameter systems obtained by replacing the usual convex hull by the $c$-hull $A^{cc}$, deriving consequences for volume along these $c$-paths. In particular, we obtain convexity statements in special cases and in dimension $2$, and we show by example that such convexity fails in general for $n\ge 3$. We then focus on Steiner symmetrization. We prove that Steiner symmetrization increases the \emph{dual volume} and that in the planar case Steiner symmetrals of ball-bodies remain ball-bodies. In contrast, we provide an explicit example in $\RR^3$ showing that the Steiner symmetral of a ball-body need not belong to $\mathcal S_n$, and show that there are such counter-examples with arbitrarily large curvatures.</description>

      <title>A strengthening of the Blaschke-Santal\'o inequality for $o$-symmetric planar convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We verify the inequality $$ \frac{|K|}{|E|}+\frac{|K^*|}{|E^*|}\leq 2 $$
  for any $o$-symmetric convex body $K\subset\R^2$ where $E$ is either the John ellipse of maximal area contained in $K$ or the minimal area L\"owner ellipse containing $K$. The analogous estimate may not hold if $K$ is a planar but the assumption of $o$-symmetry is dropped, or if $K$ is $o$-symmetric convex body in $\R^n$ for $n\geq 3$. Our new inequality strengthens the Blaschke-Santal\'o inequality for $o$-symmetric convex bodies $K\subset\R^2$ with an error term of optimal order.</description>

      <title>John-type decompositions for affinely-optimal positions of convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many classical problems in convex geometry can be cast as optimization problems under certain containment conditions. The arguably best-understood example is volume-maximization of convex bodies contained in other convex bodies, where the John decomposition describes$\unicode{x2014}$and in the Euclidean case fully characterizes$\unicode{x2014}$the optimal positions. For many other such problems, however, no general optimality conditions are known. To address this, we generalize an approach of O. B. Ader to obtain a John-type decomposition as a necessary condition for affinely-optimal containment chains, i.e., chains $r L_1 + c \subseteq K \subseteq R L_2 + d$ for convex bodies $K, L_1, L_2 \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, translation vectors $c,d \in \mathbb{R}^n$, and reals $r,R &gt; 0$ such that the ratio $\frac{R}{r}$ cannot be decreased by linearly transforming $K$. We again obtain sufficiency for optimality when ellipsoids are involved, and show how optimality conditions for various problems follow from our result. Our main applications concern the Banach-Mazur distance, where we provide necessary optimality conditions in the general case and a full characterization in the Euclidean case. Finally, we derive several consequences of these optimality conditions related to the Banach-Mazur distance to the Euclidean ball.</description>

      <title>Packings in classical Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain several new results on the simultaneous packing and covering constant $\gamma(\mathcal{X})$ of a Banach space $\mathcal{X}$, and its lattice counterpart $\gamma^*(\mathcal{X})$. These constants measure how efficient a (lattice) packing by unit balls in $\mathcal{X}$ can be, the optimal case being that $\gamma(\mathcal{X})= 1$ and the worst that $\gamma(\mathcal{X})= 2$. Our first main result is that $\gamma(\mathcal{X})&gt; 1$ whenever $B_\mathcal{X}$ admits a LUR point, which leads us to a negative answer to a question of Swanepoel. We also develop general methods to compute these constants for a large class of spaces. As a sample of our findings:
  (i) $\gamma^*(\mathcal{X})= 1$ when $\mathcal{X}$ is a separable octahedral Banach space, or $\mathcal{X}= \mathcal{C}(\mathcal{K})$, where $\mathcal{K}$ is zero-dimensional;
  (ii) $\gamma(\ell_p(\kappa)\oplus_r \mathcal{X})= \gamma^*(\ell_p(\kappa)\oplus_r \mathcal{X})= \frac{2}{2^{1/p}}$, whenever $\rm{dens}(\mathcal{X})&lt; \kappa$ and $1\leq r\leq p&lt; \infty$;
  (iii) $\gamma(L_p(\mu))= \gamma^*(L_p(\mu))= \frac{2}{2^{1/p}}$ for $1\leq p\leq 2$ and every measure $\mu$;
  (iv) there exist reflexive (resp. octahedral) Banach spaces $\mathcal{X}$ with $\gamma(\mathcal{X})= 2$.
  We leave a large area open for further research and we indicate several possible directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the Gannon-Lee incompleteness theorem for globally hyperbolic spacetimes. We assume the synthetic null energy condition of Ketterer and a trappedness condition we call "synthetically asymptotically regular". Our result generalizes this classical result to the weighted case. It also motivates and indicates extensions to low regularity, which are deferred to future work.</description>

      <title>Gel'fand's inverse problem under Ricci curvature bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Gel'fand's inverse problem asks whether a Riemannian manifold is uniquely determined by the knowledge of the heat kernel on any open subset of the manifold. We study this inverse problem in the non-smooth setting in the framework of ${\rm RCD}(K,N)$ spaces, namely, metric-measure spaces with synthetic Riemannian Ricci curvature bounded below by $K$ and dimension bounded above by $N$. We establish the unique solvability of Gel'fand's inverse problem for the class of compact ${\rm RCD}(K,N)$ spaces whose regular set admits $C^1$-Riemannian structure. As an application, we obtain the stability of Gel'fand's inverse problem in the class of closed Riemannian manifolds with bounded Ricci curvature, diameter and volume bounded from below. We note that the results are new even for Einstein orbifolds and (weighted) Riemannian manifolds with non-smooth boundary.</description>

      <title>Lower Estimates for $L_1$-Distortion of Transportation Cost Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the degree of dissimilarity between two probability distributions on a finite metric space is a fundamental task in Computer Science and Computer Vision. A natural dissimilarity measure based on optimal transport is the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD). A key technique for analyzing this metric, pioneered by Charikar (2002) and Indyk and Thaper (2003), involves constructing low-distortion embeddings of EMD(X) into the Lebesgue space $L_1$.
  It became a key problem to investigate whether the upper bound of $O(\log n)$ can be improved for important classes of metric spaces known to admit low-distortion embeddings into $L_1$. In the context of Computer Vision, grid graphs, especially planar grids, are among the most fundamental. Indyk posed the related problem of estimating the $L_1$-distortion of the space of uniform distributions on $n$-point subsets of $R^2$. The Progress Report, last updated in August 2011, highlighted two key results: first, the work of Khot and Naor (2006) on Hamming cubes, which showed that the $L_1$-distortion for Hamming cubes meets the described above upper estimate, and second, the result of Naor and Schechtman (2007) for planar grids, which established that the $L_1$-distortion of for a planar $n$ by $n$ grid is $\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})$.
  Our first result is the improvement of the lower bound on the $L_1$-distortion for grids to $\Omega(\log n)$, matching the universal upper bound up to multiplicative constants. The key ingredient allowing us to obtain these sharp estimates is a new Sobolev-type inequality for scalar-valued functions on the grid graphs. Our method is also applicable to many recursive families of graphs, such as diamond and Laakso graphs. We obtain the sharp distortion estimates of $\log n$ in these cases as well.</description>

      <title>Disintegrated optimal transport for metric fiber bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a new two-parameter family of metrics on subsets of Borel probability measures on general metric fiber bundles, called the $ \textit{disintegrated Monge--Kantorovich metrics}$. This family contains the classical Monge-Kantorovich metrics, linearized optimal transport distance, and fibered Wasserstein distances, and certain cases admit isometric embeddings of the sliced and max-sliced Wasserstein spaces. We prove these metrics are complete, separable (except an endpoint case), and geodesic, with a dual representation. Our results cannot be obtained by applying the theory of $L^q$ maps valued in spaces of probability measures, in fact the $L^q$ map case can be recovered from our results by taking the underlying bundle as a trivial product bundle, and the geodesicness and duality results are new even in the fibered Wasserstein case.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the quantization problem on metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of quantization of measures looks for best approximations of probability measures on a metric space by discrete measures supported on $N$ points, where the error of approximation is measured with respect to the Wasserstein distance. Zador's theorem states that, for measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ or $d$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds satisfying appropriate integrability conditions, the quantization error decays to zero as $N \to \infty$ at the rate $N^{-1/d}$.
  In this paper, we provide a general treatment of the asymptotics of quantization on metric measure spaces $(X, \nu)$. We show that a weaker version of Zador's theorem involving the Hausdorff densities of $\nu$ holds also in this general setting. We also prove Zador's theorem in full for appropriate $m$-rectifiable measures on Euclidean space, answering a conjecture by Graf and Luschgy in the affirmative. For both results, the higher integrability conditions of Zador's theorem are replaced with a general notion of $(p,s)$-quantizability, which follows from Pierce-type (non-asymptotic) upper bounds on the quantization error, and we also prove multiple such bounds at the level of metric measure spaces.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations Principle for Isoperimetry and Its Equivalence to Nonlinear Log-Sobolev Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04030v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The isoperimetric problem is a classic topic in geometric measure theory, yet critical questions regarding the characterization of optimal solutions -- even asymptotically optimal ones -- remain largely unresolved. In this paper, we investigate the large deviations asymptotics for the isoperimetric problem on the product Riemannian manifold $M^{n}$ endowed with the product probability measure $\nu^{\otimes n}$, where $(M,\nu)$ is a weighted Riemannian manifold with nonnegative Bakry--\'Emery--Ricci curvature. We establish an exact characterization of the large deviations asymptotics of the isoperimetric profile, which reveals a precise equivalence between this asymptotic isoperimetric inequality and the nonlinear log-Sobolev inequality. It is observed that conditional typical sets, a fundamental concept from information theory, form an asymptotically optimal solution to the isoperimetric problem. This class of subsets further yields an upper bound on the isoperimetric profile in the central limit regime. Although our results are stated for product spaces, they imply certain isoperimetric inequalities for non-product spaces, e.g., they can be used to recover the weaker equivalence established by Ledoux and Bobkov for arbitrary non-product spaces or used to establish quantitative relations among the optimal constants in isoperimetric, concentration and transport inequalities for product or non-product spaces. Our results provide a rigorous justification from the perspective of nonlinear log-Sobolev inequalities for why isoperimetric minimizers behave fundamentally differently across spaces with distinct geometric structures. Our proof idea is a new framework which integrates tools from information theory, optimal transport, and geometric measure theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Affine isoperimetric inequalities for the functional radial mean bodies are derived from the new affine chord Sobolev inequalities, which extend the recent affine isoperimetric inequalities of Haddad and Ludwig from convex bodies to functions. The affine chord Sobolev inequalities further imply a strengthening of the Euclidean chord Sobolev inequalities introduced by Ba\^eta and Cai. Moreover, for $s$-concave functions $f$ with compact support and $s&gt;0$, a parameter-dependent monotonicity property of the functional radial mean body $R_{\alpha}f$ is obtained: $R_\alpha f \subset $R_\beta f$ for $-1&lt;\alpha &lt; \beta$, and, after suitable normalization, the reverse inclusion also holds. These sharp results generalize the corresponding monotonicity for geometric radial mean bodies established by Gardner and Zhang.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we introduce rotation groups as a common generalisation of Coxeter groups and graph products of groups (including right-angled Artin groups). We characterise algebraically these groups by presentations (periagroups) and we propose a combinatorial geometry (mediangle graphs) to study them. As an application, we give natural and unified proofs for several results that hold for both Coxeter groups and graph products of groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that if a random vector satisfies a log-Sobolev inequality, all of its marginals have subgaussian tails. In the spirit of the KLS conjecture, we investigate whether this implication can be reversed under a log-concavity assumption. In the general setting, we improve on a result of Bobkov, establishing the best dimension dependent bound on the log-Sobolev constant of subgaussian log-concave measures, and we investigate some special cases.</description>

      <title>Optimal Frames for Phase Retrieval from Edge Vectors of Optimal Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04099v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to characterize the optimal frame for phase retrieval, defined as the frame whose condition number for phase retrieval attains its minimal value. In the context of the two-dimensional real case, we reveal the connection between optimal frames for phase retrieval and the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem, originally proposed by Reinhardt in 1922. Our work establishes that every optimal solution to the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem inherently leads to an optimal frame in ${\mathbb R}^2$. By recasting the optimal polygons problem as one concerning the discrepancy of roots of unity, we characterize all optimal polygons. Building upon this connection, we then characterize all optimal frames with $m$ vectors in ${\mathbb R}^2$ for phase retrieval when $m \geq 3$ has an odd factor. As a key corollary, we show that the harmonic frame $E_m \subset {\mathbb R}^2$ is {\em not} optimal for any even integer $m \geq 4$. This finding disproves a conjecture proposed by Xia, Xu, and Xu [{\em Math. Comp.}, 94 (2025), pp.~2931--2960]. Previous work has established that $E_m$ is indeed optimal when $m$ is an odd integer.</description>

Abstract: We refine the regularity of noncollapsed limits of 5-dimensional manifolds with bounded Ricci curvature. In particular, for noncollapsed limits of Einstein 5-manifolds, we prove that
  (1) tangent cones are unique of the form $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^4/\Gamma$ on the top stratum, hence outside a countable set of points; this follows from a new isolation result for cones of the form $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^4/\Gamma$ among all tangent cones,
  (2) the singular set is entirely contained in a countable union of Lipschitz curves and points,
  (3) away from a nowhere dense subset, these Lipschitz curves consist of smooth geodesics,
  (4) the interior of any geodesic is removable: limits of Einstein manifolds are real-analytic orbifolds with singularities along geodesic and bounded curvature away from their extreme points, and
  (5) if an asymptotically Ricci-flat 5-manifold with Euclidean volume growth has one tangent cone at infinity that splits off a line, then it is the unique tangent cone at infinity.
  These results prompt the question of the orbifold regularity of noncollapsed limits of Einstein manifolds off a codimension 5 set in arbitrary dimension.
  The proofs rely on a new result of independent interest: all spherical and hyperbolic 4-orbifolds are isolated among Einstein 4-orbifolds in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. This yields various gap theorems for Einstein 4-orbifolds, which do not extend to higher dimensions. The proofs of these gap theorems require a careful analysis of singular metrics and families of metrics that degenerate.</description>
