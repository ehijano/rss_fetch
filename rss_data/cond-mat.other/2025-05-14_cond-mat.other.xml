      <title>Experimental demonstration of an analogy between optical non-coherence and irreversibility of heat transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We probe experimentally a connection between coherence in the context of optical physics and the irreversibility present in heat transfer through an interface separating two media. The robustness of the experiment on the one hand, and the theoretical description taken from the statistical-mechanics treatment of the heat transfer problem, on the other hand, allows for the study of the arrow of time's problem within the clean and precise framework of experimental optical physics. The central aspect of the experiment is a light beam incident and split at an interface to produce a second common interaction point again at the interface. The experiment was carried out with two light sources that only differ in their coherence length. In the case of the highly coherent light source, we were able to combine the previously split parts of the light back into a single beam. This is indicative of the reversibility of the process of coherent light transmission through the interface. The light source with low coherence length, on the contrary, does not allow for such a recombination, thus producing an irreversible process. We explain how the latter case is analogous to the process of interfacial heat transport, thus establishing an important connection between optical non-coherence and irreversibility of transport phenomena. Our finding paves the way for the study of fundamental processes in heat transfer and the surge of irreversibility in the realm of optical physics.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Topological Parity Anomaly and Half-integer Hall Effect in High-dimensional Synthetic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in constructing synthetic dimension provide a powerful tool for exploring exotic topological states of matter in high dimensions. Here we report that the parity anomaly and associated \textit{half-integer} quantized Hall conductance, arising in 2$j$+1 (space-time) dimensions with a single or odd number of Dirac cones, can be realized by the boundary states of $n$-th order topological insulators in (2$j$+$n$)-dimensional synthetic lattices. We establish a general bulk-boundary correspondence by integrating the ``nested" Wilson loop theory with the time-reversal polarization at highly-symmetric momenta, a set of $Z_2$ topological invariants are extracted which determines the number of higher-order-boundary Dirac cones and their locations. We develop a general construction procedure for Hamiltonians supporting such higher-order topological parity anomaly. Moreover, we propose an experimental implementation scheme based on photonic synthetic dimensions and provide a method for probing the associated half-integer Hall conductance by the transmission spectra. Our work offers the realization and characterization of parity anomaly in general high-dimensional higher-order topological insulators and opens an avenue for exploring fundamental physics and possible device applications enabled by manipulating Dirac cones.</description>

      <title>The Migdal effect in solid crystals and the role of non-adiabaticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically apply the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to show that the Migdal effect in a solid crystal is entirely due to non-adiabatic effects, namely the deviation of the wave function from exact factorization of the electronic and nuclear contributions. The matrix element obtained this way matches exactly the result found by means of a previously derived low energy effective theory.</description>

      <title>Spatial Offset of Excited States in Non-Hermitian Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of light-wave packets injected into
  non-Hermitian microcavity lattices under highly dissipative
  conditions. While all eigenstates of the lattice exhibit exponential
  decay, a specifically excited state maintains coherent propagation. In
  a one-dimensional lattice, this state undergoes a spatial
  displacement shift away from the injection position, which is
  a fundamental property of non-Hermitian systems with a point
  gap when the spectrum encircles a finite region in the
  complex plane. Extending such a shift to two-dimensional lattices reveals
  a geometrically anomalous V-shaped wave packet formation with orientation-tunable arms.
  Notably, this geometric control mechanism
  enables all-optical steering of non-Hermitian photonic states without
  requiring structural modifications.</description>

      <title>Optimal randomized measurements for a family of non-linear quantum properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum learning encounters fundamental challenges when estimating non-linear properties, owing to the inherent linearity of quantum mechanics. Although recent advances in single-copy randomized measurement protocols have achieved optimal sample complexity for specific tasks like state purity estimation, generalizing these protocols to estimate broader classes of non-linear properties without sacrificing optimality remains an open problem. In this work, we introduce the observable-driven randomized measurement (ORM) protocol enabling the estimation of ${\rm Tr}(O\rho^2)$ for an arbitrary observable $O$ -- an essential quantity in quantum computing and many-body physics. ORM achieves this by decomposing the observable $O$ into dichotomic observables and extracting the information of each eigenspace through randomized measurements with block-diagonal unitaries. We establish an upper bound for ORM's sample complexity and prove its optimality for all Pauli observables, closing a gap in the literature. Furthermore, we develop simplified variants of ORM for local Pauli observables and introduce a braiding randomized measurement protocol for fidelity estimation, both of which significantly reduce circuit complexities in practical applications. Numerical experiments validate that ORM requires substantially fewer state samples to achieve the same precision compared to classical shadows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07002v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlike a single Carroll particle, a multiparticle Carroll system can move under suitable conditions, as we demonstrate it explicitly for two particles with a momentum-dependent interaction: the center-of-mass remains fixed, however relative motion is possible, confirming previous statements made by Bergshoeff, Casalbuoni, and their collaborators. Analogous results are obtained for electric dipoles with the roles of the center-of-mass and the relative position interchanged.</description>

      <title>Fast quantum gates for exchange-only qubits using simultaneous exchange pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The benefit of exchange-only qubits compared to other spin qubit types is the universal control using only voltage controlled exchange interactions between neighboring spins. As a compromise, qubit operations have to be constructed from non-orthogonal rotation axes of the Bloch sphere and result in rather long pulsing sequences. This paper aims to develop a faster implementation of single-qubit and two-qubit gates using simultaneous exchange pulses. We introduce pulse sequences in which single-qubit gates could be executed faster and show that subsequences on three spins in two-qubit gates could be implemented in fewer steps. Our findings can particularly speed up gate sequences for realistic idle times between sequential pulses and we show that this advantage increases with more interconnectivity of the quantum dots. We further demonstrate how a phase operation can introduce a relative phase between the computational and some of the leakage states, which can be advantageous for the construction of two-qubit gates. In addition to our theoretical analysis, we experimentally demonstrate and characterize a simultaneous exchange implementation of $X$ rotations in a SiGe quantum dot device and compare to the state of the art with sequential exchange pulses.</description>

      <title>Properties and dynamics of generalized squeezed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the properties and dynamics of generalized squeezed states. We find that, in stark contrast to displacement and two-photon squeezing, higher-order squeezing leads to oscillatory dynamics. The state is squeezed in the initial stages of the dynamics but the squeezing reverses at later stages, and the state reverts almost completely back to the initial state. We analyze various quantities to verify that the oscillatory dynamics is physical and not a mathematical artefact. We also show that the maximum squeezing diminishes with increasing squeezing order, rendering the squeezing mechanism increasingly ineffective. Our results provide important rules that can help guide the development of more effective higher-order squeezing techniques.</description>

      <title>Extended Tsallis-Cirto entropy for black and white holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05178v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In reference [1] we considered the black hole thermodynamics with the non-extensive entropy. This entropy obeys the composition rule which coincides with the composition rule in the non-extensive Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ statistics. Here we extend this approach to the thermodynamics of white holes. The entropy of the white hole is negative as follows from the rate of macroscopic quantum tunneling from black hole to white hole. The white hole entropy is with the minus sign the entropy of the black hole with the same mass, $S_{\rm WH}(M)=-S_{\rm BH}(M)$. This reflects the anti-symmetry with respect to time reversal, at which the shift vector in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism changes sign. This symmetry allows one to extend the Tsallis-Chirto entropy by adding a minus sign to the Tsallis-Chirto formula applied to white hole. As a result, the composition rule remains the same, with the only difference being that instead of entropy it contains the entropy modulus. The same non-extensive composition rule is obtained for the entropy of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. This entropy is formed by the positive entropy of the outer horizon and the negative entropy of the inner horizon. The model of the black hole formed by "black hole atoms" with Planck-scale mass is also extended to include the negative entropy of white holes.</description>
