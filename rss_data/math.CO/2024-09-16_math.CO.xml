      <title>Compression with wildcards: All induced metric subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by applications in the natural, social and computer sciences several algorithms have been proposed to enumerate all sets $X$ of vertices of a graph $G$ that induce a connected subgraph. Our algorithm AllMetricSets enumerates all $X$'s that induce (more exquisite) metric subgraphs. Here "metric" means that any distinct $s,t\in X$ are joined by a globally shortest $s-t$ path.</description>

      <title>Rational exponents for cliques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,\mathcal{F})$ be the maximum number of copies of $H$ in an $n$-vertex graph which contains no copy of a graph from $\mathcal{F}$. Thinking of $H$ and $\mathcal{F}$ as fixed, we study the asymptotics of $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,\mathcal{F})$ in $n$. We say that a rational number $r$ is \emph{realizable for $H$} if there exists a finite family $\mathcal{F}$ such that $\mathrm{ex}(n,H,\mathcal{F}) = \Theta(n^r)$. Using randomized algebraic constructions, Bukh and Conlon showed that every rational between $1$ and $2$ is realizable for $K_2$. We generalize their result to show that every rational between $1$ and $t$ is realizable for $K_t$, for all $t \geq 2$. We also determine the realizable rationals for stars and note the connection to a related Sidorenko-type supersaturation problem.</description>

      <title>Face Numbers of Shellable CW Balls and Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{X}$ be the boundary complex of a $(d+1)$-polytope, and let $\rho(d+1,k) = \frac{1}{2}[{\lceil (d+1)/2 \rceil \choose d-k} + {\lfloor (d+1)/2 \rfloor \choose d-k}]$. Recently, the author, answering B\'ar\'any's question from 1998, proved that for all $\lfloor \frac{d-1}{2} \rfloor \leq k \leq d$, \[
  f_k(\mathscr{X}) \geq \rho(d+1,k)f_d(\mathscr{X}). \] We prove a generalization: if $\mathscr{X}$ is a shellable, strongly regular CW sphere or CW ball of dimension $d$, then for all $\lfloor \frac{d-1}{2} \rfloor \leq k \leq d$, \[
  f_k(\mathscr{X}) \geq \rho(d+1,k)f_d(\mathscr{X}) + \frac{1}{2}f_k(\partial \mathscr{X}), \] with equality precisely when $k=d$ or when $k=d-1$ and $\mathscr{X}$ is simplicial. We further prove that if $\mathscr{S}$ is a strongly regular CW sphere of dimension $d$, and the face poset of $\mathscr{S}$ is both CL-shellable and dual CL-shellable, then $f_k(\mathscr{S}) \geq \min\{f_0(\mathscr{S}),f_d(\mathscr{S})\}$ for all $0 \leq k \leq d$.</description>

      <title>On a generalization of a result of Kleitman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical result of Kleitman determines the maximum number $f(n,s)$ of subsets in a family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ of sets that do not contain distinct sets $F_1,F_2,\dots,F_s$ that are pairwise disjoint in the case $n\equiv 0,-1$ (mod $s$). Katona and Nagy determined the maximum size of a family of subsets of an $n$-element set that does not contain $A_1,A_2,\dots,A_t,B_1,B_2,\dots,B_t$ with $\bigcup_{i=1}^t A_i$ and $\bigcup_{i=1}^t B_i$ being disjoint. In this paper, we consider the problem of finding the maximum number $vex(n,K_{s\times t})$ in a family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ without sets $F^1_1,\dots,F^1_t,\dots,F^s_1,\dots,F^s_t$ such that $G_j=\bigcup_{i=1}^tF^j_i$ $j=1,2,\dots,s$ are pairwise disjoint. We determine the asymptotics of $2^n-vex(n,K_{s\times t})$ if $n\equiv -1$ (mod $s$) for all $t$, and if $n\equiv 0$ (mod $s$), $t\ge 3$ and show that in this latter case the asymptotics of the $t=2$ subcase is different from both the $t=1$ and $t\ge 3$ subcases.</description>

      <title>Ramsey numbers for partially ordered sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we present quantitative Ramsey-type results in the setting of finite sets that are equipped with a partial order, so-called posets. A prominent example of a poset is the Boolean lattice $Q_n$, which consists of all subsets of $\{1,\dots,n\}$, ordered by inclusion. For posets $P$ and $Q$, the poset Ramsey number $R(P,Q)$ is the smallest $N$ such that no matter how the elements of $Q_N$ are colored in blue and red, there is either an induced subposet isomorphic to $P$ in which every element is colored blue, or an induced subposet isomorphic to $Q$ in which every element is colored red.
  The central focus of this thesis is to investigate $R(P,Q_n)$, where $P$ is fixed and $n$ grows large. Our results contribute to an active area of discrete mathematics, which studies the existence of large homogeneous substructures in host structures with local constraints, introduced for graphs by Erd\H{o}s and Hajnal. We provide an asymptotically tight bound on $R(P,Q_n)$ for $P$ from several classes of posets, and show a dichotomy in the asymptotic behavior of $R(P,Q_n)$, depending on whether $P$ contains a subposet isomorphic to one of two specific posets.
  A fundamental question in the study of poset Ramsey numbers is to determine the asymptotic behavior of $R(Q_n,Q_n)$ for large $n$. In this dissertation, we present improvements on the known lower and upper bound on $R(Q_n,Q_n)$. Moreover, we explore variations of the poset Ramsey setting, including Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal-type questions when the small forbidden poset has a non-monochromatic color pattern, and so-called weak poset Ramsey numbers, which are concerned with non-induced subposets.</description>

      <title>Injective colorings of Sierpi\'nski-like graphs and Kneser graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08856v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two relationships between the injective chromatic number and, respectively, chromatic number and chromatic index, are proved. They are applied to determine the injective chromatic number of Sierpi\'nski graphs and to give a short proof that Sierpi\'nski graphs are Class $1$. Sierpi\'nski-like graphs are also considered, including generalized Sierpi\'nski graphs over cycles and rooted products. It is proved that the injective chromatic number of a rooted product of two graphs lies in a set of six possible values. Sierpi\'nski graphs and Kneser graphs $K(n,r)$ are considered with respect of being perfect injectively colorable, where a graph is perfect injectively colorable if it has an injective coloring in which every color class forms an open packing of largest cardinality. In particular, all Sierpi\'nski graphs and Kneser graphs $K(n, r)$ with $n \ge 3r-1$ are perfect injectively colorable graph, while $K(7,3)$ is not.</description>

      <title>Simplicial maps between spheres and Davis' manifolds with positive simplicial volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the simplicial volume of manifolds obtained from Davis' reflection group trick, the goal being characterizing those having positive simplicial volume. In particular, we focus on checking whether manifolds in this class with nonzero Euler characteristic have positive simplicial volume (Gromov asked whether this holds in general for aspherical manifolds). This leads to a combinatorial problem about triangulations of spheres: we define a partial order on the set of triangulations -- the relation being the existence of a nonzero-degree simplicial map between two triangulations -- and the problem is to find the minimal elements of a specific subposet. We solve explicitly the case of triangulations of the two-dimensional sphere, and then perform an extensive analysis, with the help of computer searches, of the three-dimensional case. Moreover, we present a connection of this problem with the theory of graph minors.</description>

      <title>Upper tails for arithmetic progressions revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be the number of $k$-term arithmetic progressions contained in the $p$-biased random subset of the first $N$ positive integers. We give asymptotically sharp estimates on the logarithmic upper-tail probability $\log \Pr(X \ge E[X] + t)$ for all $\Omega(N^{-2/k}) \le p \ll 1$ and all $t \gg \sqrt{Var(X)}$, excluding only a few boundary cases. In particular, we show that the space of parameters $(p,t)$ is partitioned into three phenomenologically distinct regions, where the upper-tail probabilities either resemble those of Gaussian or Poisson random variables, or are naturally described by the probability of appearance of a small set that contains nearly all of the excess $t$ progressions. We employ a variety of tools from probability theory, including classical tilting arguments and martingale concentration inequalities. However, the main technical innovation is a combinatorial result that establishes a stronger version of `entropic stability' for sets with rich arithmetic structure.</description>

      <title>A Successive Refinement Algorithm for Tri-Level Stochastic Defender-Attacker Problems with Decision-Dependent Probability Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tri-level defender-attacker game models are a well-studied method for determining how best to protect a system (e.g., a transportation network) from attacks. Existing models assume that defender and attacker actions have a perfect effect, i.e., system components hardened by a defender cannot be destroyed by the attacker, and attacked components always fail. Because of these assumptions, these models produce solutions in which defended components are never attacked, a result that may not be realistic in some contexts. This paper considers an imperfect defender-attacker problem in which defender decisions (e.g., hardening) and attacker decisions (e.g., interdiction) have an imperfect effect such that the probability distribution of a component's capacity depends on the amount of defense and attack resource allocated to the component. Thus, this problem is a stochastic optimization problem with decision-dependent probabilities and is challenging to solve because the deterministic equivalent formulation has many high-degree multilinear terms. To address the challenges in solving this problem, we propose a successive refinement algorithm that dynamically refines the support of the random variables as needed, leveraging the fact that a less-refined support has fewer scenarios and multilinear terms and is, therefore, easier to solve. A comparison of the successive refinement algorithm versus the deterministic equivalent formulation on a tri-level stochastic maximum flow problem indicates that the proposed method solves many more problem instances and is up to $66$ times faster. These results indicate that it is now possible to solve tri-level problems with imperfect hardening and attacks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that every Hassett compactification of the moduli space of weighted stable rational curves that admits both a reduction map from the Losev-Manin compactification and a reduction map to projective space is a toric variety, whose corresponding polytope is a hypergraph associahedron (also known as a nestohedron). In addition, we present an analogous result for the moduli space of labeled weighted points in affine space up to translation and scaling. These results are interconnected, and we make their relationship explicit through the concept of ``inflation" of a hypergraph associahedron.</description>

      <title>Vertex identification to a forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a graph class and $k\in\mathbb{N}$. We say a graph $G$ admits a \emph{$k$-identification to $\mathcal{H}$} if there is a partition $\mathcal{P}$ of some set $X\subseteq V(G)$ of size at most $k$ such that after identifying each part in $\mathcal{P}$ to a single vertex, the resulting graph belongs to $\mathcal{H}$. The graph parameter ${\sf id}_{\mathcal{H}}$ is defined so that ${\sf id}_{\mathcal{H}}(G)$ is the minimum $k$ such that $G$ admits a $k$-identification to $\mathcal{H}$, and the problem of \textsc{Identification to $\mathcal{H}$} asks, given a graph $G$ and $k\in\mathbb{N}$, whether ${\sf id}_{\mathcal{H}}(G)\le k$. If we set $\mathcal{H}$ to be the class $\mathcal{F}$ of acyclic graphs, we generate the problem \textsc{Identification to Forest}, which we show to be {\sf NP}-complete. We prove that, when parameterized by the size $k$ of the identification set, it admits a kernel of size $2k+1$. For our kernel we reveal a close relation of \textsc{Identification to Forest} with the \textsc{Vertex Cover} problem. We also study the combinatorics of the \textsf{yes}-instances of \textsc{Identification to $\mathcal{H}$}, i.e., the class $\mathcal{H}^{(k)}:=\{G\mid {\sf id}_{\mathcal{H}}(G)\le k\}$, {which we show to be minor-closed for every $k$} when $\mathcal{H}$ is minor-closed. We prove that the minor-obstructions of $\mathcal{F}^{(k)}$ are of size at most $2k+4$. We also prove that every graph $G$ such that ${\sf id}_{\mathcal{F}}(G)$ is sufficiently big contains as a minor either a cycle on $k$ vertices, or $k$ disjoint triangles, or the \emph{$k$-marguerite} graph, that is the graph obtained by $k$ disjoint triangles by identifying one vertex of each of them into the same vertex.</description>

      <title>Shifts of Finite Type Obtained by Forbidding a Single Pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite word $w$, Guibas and Odlyzko (J. Combin. Theory Ser. A, 30, 1981, 183-208) showed that the autocorrelation polynomial $\phi_w(t)$ of $w$, which records the set of self-overlaps of $w$, explicitly determines for each $n$, the number $|B_n(w)|$ of words of length $n$ that avoid $w$. We consider this and related problems from the viewpoint of symbolic dynamics, focusing on the setting of $X_{\{w\}}$, the space of all bi-infinite sequences that avoid $w$. We first summarize and elaborate upon (J. Combin. Theory Ser. A, 30, 1981, 183-208) and other work to show that the sequence $|B_n(w)|$ is equivalent to several invariants of $X_{\{w\}}$. We then give a finite-state labeled graphical representation $L_w$ of $X_{\{w\}}$ and show that $w$ can be recovered from the graph isomorphism class of the unlabeled version of $L_w$. Using $L_w$, we apply ideas from probability and Perron-Frobenius theory to obtain results comparing features of $X_{\{w\}}$ for different $w$. Next, we give partial results on the problem of classifying the spaces $X_{\{w\}}$ up to conjugacy. Finally, we extend some of our results to spaces of multi-dimensional arrays that avoid a given finite pattern.</description>

      <title>Lyashko-Looijenga morphisms and primitive factorizations of the Coxeter element</title>

      <description>arXiv:1808.10395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a seminal work, Bessis gave a geometric interpretation of the noncrossing lattice $NC(W)$ associated to a well-generated complex reflection group $W$. Chief component of this was the trivialization theorem, a fundamental correspondence between families of chains of $NC(W)$ and the fibers of a finite quasi-homogeneous morphism, the $LL$ map.
  We consider a variant of the $LL$ map, prescribed by the trivialization theorem, and apply it to the study of finer enumerative and structural properties of $NC(W)$. In particular, we extend work of Bessis and Ripoll and enumerate the so-called "primitive factorizations" of the Coxeter element $c$. That is, length additive factorizations of the form $c=w\cdot t_1\cdots t_k$, where $w$ belongs to a given conjugacy class and the $t_i$'s are reflections.</description>

      <title>New Ramsey Multiplicity Bounds and Search Heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.04036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two related problems concerning the number of homogeneous subsets of given size in graphs that go back to questions of Erd\H{o}s. Most notably, we improve the upper bounds on the Ramsey multiplicity of $K_4$ and $K_5$ and settle the minimum number of independent sets of size $4$ in graphs with clique number at most $4$. Motivated by the elusiveness of the symmetric Ramsey multiplicity problem, we also introduce an off-diagonal variant and obtain tight results when counting monochromatic $K_4$ or $K_5$ in only one of the colors and triangles in the other. The extremal constructions for each problem turn out to be blow-ups of a graph of constant size and were found through search heuristics. They are complemented by lower bounds established using flag algebras, resulting in a fully computer-assisted approach. For some of our theorems we can also derive that the extremal construction is stable in a very strong sense. More broadly, these problems lead us to the study of the region of possible pairs of clique and independent set densities that can be realized as the limit of some sequence of graphs.</description>

      <title>Correlation inequalities for linear extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.16637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the combinatorial atlas technology to prove new correlation inequalities for the number of linear extensions of finite posets. These include the approximate independence of probabilities and expectations of values of random linear extensions, closely related to Stanley's inequality. We also give applications to the numbers of standard Young tableaux and to Euler numbers.</description>

      <title>Terwilliger algebras of generalized wreath products of association schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalized wreath product of symmetric association schemes was introduced by R.A.Bailey in the European Journal of Combinatorics 27 (2006) 428-435. It is recognized as a unification of both the wreath product and the direct product of symmetric association schemes. While its potential applicability to any association scheme had been implied, this paper provides a formal and explicit confirmation of that claim. Moreover, we establish the irreducible representations of its adjacency algebra and Terwilliger algebra.</description>

      <title>q-power symmetric functions and q-exponential formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\lambda =\left( \lambda_{1},\lambda_{2},...,\lambda_{r}\right) $ be an integer partition, and $\left[p_{\lambda }\right] $ the $q$-analog of the symmetric power function $%p_{\lambda }$. This $q$-analogue has been defined as a special case, in the author's previous article: "A $q$-analog of certain symmetric functions and one of its specializations". Here, we prove that a large part of the classical relations between $p_{\lambda }$, on one hand, and the elementary and complete symmetric functions $e_{n}$ and $h_{n}$, on the other hand, have $q$-analogues with $\left[ p_{\lambda }\right] $. In particular, the generating functions $E\left( t\right) =\sum\nolimits_{n\geq 0}e_{n}t^{n}$ and $H\left( t\right) =\sum\nolimits_{n\geq 0}h_{n}t^{n}$ are expressed in terms of $\left[ p_{n}\right] $, using Gessel's $q$-exponential formula and a variant of it. A factorization of these generating functions into infinite $q$-products, which has no classical counterpart, is established. By specializing these results, we show that the $q$-binomial theorem is a special case of these infinite $q$-products. We also obtain new formulas for the tree inversions enumerators and for certain $q$-orthogonal polynomials, detailing the case of dicrete $q$-Hermite polynomials.</description>

      <title>A note on the Erd\H{o}s Matching Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Erd\H os Matching Conjecture states that the maximum size $f(n,k,s)$ of a family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq \binom{[n]}{k}$ that does not contain $s$ pairwise disjoint sets is $\max\{|\mathcal{A}_{k,s}|,|\mathcal{B}_{n,k,s}|\}$, where $\mathcal{A}_{k,s}=\binom{[sk-1]}{k}$ and $\mathcal{B}_{n,k,s}=\{B\in \binom{[n]}{k}:B\cap [s-1]\neq \emptyset\}$. The case $s=2$ is simply the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem on intersecting families and is well understood. The case $n=sk$ was settled by Kleitman and the uniqueness of the extremal construction was obtained by Frankl. Most results in this area show that if $k,s$ are fixed and $n$ is large enough, then the conjecture holds true. Exceptions are due to Frankl who proved the conjecture and considered variants for $n\in [sk,sk+c_{s,k}]$ if $s$ is large enough compared to $k$. A recent manuscript by Guo and Lu considers non-trivial families with matching number at most $s$ in a similar range of parameters.
  In this short note, we are concerned with the case $s\ge 3$ fixed, $k$ tending to infinity and $n\in\{sk,sk+1\}$. For $n=sk$, we show the stability of the unique extremal construction of size $\binom{sk-1}{k}=\frac{s-1}{s}\binom{sk}{k}$ with respect to minimal degree. As a consequence we derive $\lim\limits_{k\rightarrow \infty}\frac{f(sk+1,k,s)}{\binom{sk+1}{k}}&lt;\frac{s-1}{s}-\varepsilon_s$ for some positive constant $\varepsilon_s$ which depends only on $s$.</description>

      <title>Loose Hamilton paths in the 3-uniform cube hypergraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that the $d$-dimensional hypercube contains a Hamilton cycle for $d\ge 2$. In this paper we address the analogous problem in the $3$-uniform cube hypergraph, a $3$-uniform analogue of the hypercube: for simple parity reasons, the $3$-uniform cube hypergraph can never admit a loose Hamilton cycle in any dimension, so we do the next best thing and consider loose Hamilton paths, and determine for which dimensions these exist.</description>

      <title>Ruzsa's problem on Bi-Sidon sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A subset $S$ of real numbers is called bi-Sidon if it is a Sidon set with respect to both addition and multiplication, i.e., if all pairwise sums and all pairwise products of elements of $S$ are distinct. Imre Ruzsa asked the following question: What is the maximum number $f(N)$ such that every set $S$ of $N$ real numbers contains a bi-Sidon subset of size at least $f(N)$? He proved that $f(N)\geq cN^{\frac13}$, for a constant $c&gt;0$. In this note, we improve this bound to $N^{\frac13+\frac7{78}+o(1)}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that if $\mathcal{A} \subset {[n] \choose n/2}$ with measure bounded away from zero and from one, then the $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$-iterated upper shadows of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{A}^c$ intersect in a set of positive measure. This confirms (in a strong form) a conjecture of Friedgut. It can be seen as a stability result for the Kruskal--Katona theorem.</description>

      <title>Determinants of Hodge-Riemann forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02737v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the determinant of the bilinear form in middle degree of the generic artinian reduction of the Stanley-Reisner ring of an odd-dimensional simplicial sphere. This proves the odd multiplicity conjecture of Papadakis and Petrotou and implies that this determinant is a complete invariant of the simplicial sphere. We extend this result to odd-dimensional connected oriented simplicial homology manifolds. In characteristic 2, we prove a generalization to the Hodge-Riemann forms of any connected simplicial homology manifold. To prove the latter theorem we establish the strong Lefschetz property for certain quotients of the Stanley-Reisner rings of connected simplicial pseudomanifolds.</description>

      <title>Counting simplicial pairs in hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two ways to measure the simplicial nature of a hypergraph: the simplicial ratio and the simplicial matrix. We show that the simplicial ratio captures the frequency, as well as the rarity, of simplicial interactions in a hypergraph while the simplicial matrix provides more fine-grained details. We then compute the simplicial ratio, as well as the simplicial matrix, for 10 real-world hypergraphs and, from the data collected, hypothesize that simplicial interactions are more and more deliberate as edge size increases. We then present a new Chung-Lu model that includes a parameter controlling (in expectation) the frequency of simplicial interactions. We use this new model, as well as the real-world hypergraphs, to show that multiple stochastic processes exhibit different behaviour when performed on simplicial hypergraphs vs. non-simplicial hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Approximately counting maximal independent set is equivalent to #SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A maximal independent set is an independent set that is not a subset of any other independent set. It is also the key problem of mathematics, computer science, and other fields. A counting problem is a type of computational problem that associated with the number of solutions. Besides, counting problems help us better understand several fields such as algorithm analysis, complexity theory, artificial intelligence, etc. The problem of counting maximal independent sets is #P-complete. So it is natural to think about approximate counting for maximal independent sets problem. In this article, we study the complexity of approximately counting maximal independent sets. Specifically, we are the first to prove that the #MIS problem is AP-interreducible with the #SAT of a given general graph.</description>
