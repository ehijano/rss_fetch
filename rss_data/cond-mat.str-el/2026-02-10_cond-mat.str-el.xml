      <title>Non-reciprocal spin excitations across the skyrmion-paramagnetic phase transition in MnSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic excitations of the skyrmion lattice in MnSi comprise a multitude of individual modes, which are non-reciprocal and thereby propagate unidirectionally. We report inelastic neutron scattering experiments for temperatures near and above the skyrmion-paramagnetic phase transition in the chiral magnet MnSi tracking the evolution from the skyrmion lattice towards the high-temperature paramagnetic state. Within the resolution of the triple-axis measurements the excitations vary smoothly across the skyrmion-paramagnetic boundary, and, the quasi-elastic paramagnetic signal under applied field retains the non-reciprocal character seen in the skyrmion phase even far above the critical temperature. Using a resolution-convolution our results are consistent with linear spin-wave theory.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure of Epitaxial Films of the Bilayer Strontium Ruthenate: Sr$_{3}$Ru$_2$O$_{7}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first combined study of the low-energy electronic band structure of epitaxial Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT). The complete Fermi-surface topography of the near-Fermi-level bands is determined from in-situ ARPES measurements. To investigate the effects of substrate-induced strain on the band structure, Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ thin films are epitaxially grown on SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and (LaAlO$_{3}$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_{2}$TaAlO$_{6}$)$_{0.7}$ (LSAT) substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. The combination of the measured Fermi-surfaces along with the theoretical interpretation, clearly show dramatic changes in the Fermi surface topologies that result from the underlying strain states of the films on the two substrates. We find that the Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films prepared on STO are tensile strained with tetragonal symmetry, whereas those grown on LSAT are compressively strained with orthorhombic symmetry. Within $\sim15~\text{meV}$ below the Fermi level, we observe two flat bands along $\Gamma$-$X$ in the orthorhombic phase and around $\Gamma$ in the tetragonal phase. These features could be favorable for van Hove singularities near the Fermi level, and highlight the emergence of magnetic instabilities in epitaxial Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films.</description>

      <title>Direct Evidence of a Near-Ideal Jeff = 1/2 Ground State in Triangular-Lattice Na2BaCo(PO4)2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the local Co 3d electronic structure of Na2BaCo(PO4)2 using polarization-dependent X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) in combination with full multiplet cluster calculations. We employed the line-fitting inverse partial fluorescence yield (IPFY) technique to obtain accurate XAS spectra from strong insulating materials. Our combined experimental and theoretical analysis reveals a very small effective trigonal distortion of only 11 meV in the CoO6 octahedra, indicating a close to ideal condition to render a ground state with the Jeff = 1/2 character. With our cluster model we were also able to simulate magnetic susceptibility measurements along different directions in the crystal. These findings highlight Na2BaCo(PO4)2 as a promising platform for exploring exotic magnetic phenomena associated with Jeff = 1/2 ground states on triangular lattices.</description>

      <title>Orientation-driven route to an intrinsic insulating ferromagnetic state in manganite superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing precision in the growth of superlattices sparks hope in applications that may arise from engineering layered structures. Heterostructuring and functionalization of magnetic oxides have been very popular due to their versatility and readiness for integration in modern electronics. In this study, we provide yet another example of this phenomenology by predicting that an insulating ferromagnetic state can be realized in superlattices of LaMnO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$ oriented along the (111) direction. In strike contrast with respect to other orientations, these properties are not of extrinsic origin but arise from the interplay of structural order, strain and quantum confinement. The bandgap is shown to be either direct and indirect, depending on the precise composition, which can be explained in terms of the geometrical properties of (111)-oriented bilayers of LaMnO$_3$. The electronic structure shows narrow bands indicating localized $e_g$ states for all the investigated superlattices. These features and the analysis of the inter-atomic magnetic coupling suggest that the investigated superlattices behave as a Kugel-Khomskii material, at least for the explored compositions. Our results provide not only a new route to an insulating ferromagnet, but also novel insight into the intricate interplay between lattice symmetry, Hubbard physics and Hund's coupling to be exploited in next-generation spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Structural studies on $A_2$ReCl$_6$ ($A$=K, Rb, Cs): absence of Jahn-Teller distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: K$_2$ReCl$_6$ belongs to the antifluorite family and exhibits a sequence of structural transitions above the onset of magnetic order at $T_N$ = 12 K. Because of its 5d3 electronic configuration in an octahedral coordination, the ground state is a pure spin state without orbital degeneracy within the LS coupling scheme, but it can become Jahn-Teller active in the strong spin-orbit coupling limit described by the $jj$ coupling [S. Streltsov and D. I. Khomskii, Phys. Rev. X 10, 031043 (2020)]. While the structural transitions in K$_2$ReCl$_6$ are understood in terms of octahedral rotation and tilting, the possible impact of a Jahn-Teller distortion remains an open issue. We report on comprehensive crystalstructure studies by means of powder neutron and single-crystal x-ray diffraction on K$_2$ReCl$_6$ and on K$_2$SnCl$_6$. The latter material is used as a reference, because it exhibits the same sequence of structural transitions as K$_2$ReCl$_6$, but possesses a filled 4d shell ruling out a Jahn-Teller distortion. While the ReCl$_6$ octahedron in K$_2$ReCl$_6$ presents sizable distortions at intermediate temperatures, there is no such distortion persisting to low temperatures excluding a sizable Jahn-Teller effect. Studies on polycrystalline samples of Rb$_2$ReCl$_6$ and Cs$_2$ReCl$_6$, in which the structural transitions are suppressed due to the larger alkaline ionic radius, also do not find any indications for a Jahn-Teller distortion.</description>

      <title>Frustrated spin models on two- and three-dimensional decorated lattices with high residual entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ground-state properties of a family of frustrated spin-1/2 Heisenberg models on two- and three-dimensional decorated lattices composed of connected star-shaped units. Each star is built from edge-sharing triangles with an antiferromagnetic interaction on the shared side and ferromagnetic interactions on the others. At a critical coupling ratio, the ideal star model - defined by equal ferromagnetic interactions - exhibits a macroscopically degenerate ground state, which we map onto a site percolation problem on the Lieb lattice. This mapping enables the calculation of exponential ground-state degeneracy and the corresponding residual entropy for square, triangular, honeycomb, and cubic lattices. Remarkably, the residual entropy remains high for all studied lattices, exceeding 60\% of the maximal value ln(2). Despite a gapless quadratic one-magnon spectrum, the low-temperature thermodynamics is governed by exponentially numerous gapped excitations. For a distorted-star variant of the model, the ground-state manifold is equivalent to that of decoupled ferromagnetic clusters, leading to exponential degeneracy with a lower, yet still substantial, residual entropy. At low temperature the system mimics a paramagnetic crystal of non-interacting spins with high spin value ($s=4$ for a square lattice). The obtained results establish a structural design principle for engineering quantum magnets with a high ground-state degeneracy, suggesting promising candidates for enhanced magnetocaloric cooling and quantum thermal machines.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy, frustration and saddle point in the twisted Kagome antiferromagnet ErPdPb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome lattice, with its inherent geometric frustration, provides a rich platform for exploring intriguing magnetic phenomena and topological electronic structures. In reduced-symmetry structures, such as twisted kagome systems involving rare earth elements, additional anisotropy can arise, enabling intriguing properties including spin-ice states, magnetocaloric effects, noncollinear magnetic ordering, and anomalous Hall effect. Here, we report the synthesis of single crystals of ErPdPb, which features a twisted kagome lattice net of Er atoms within the hexagonal ZrNiAl-type structure, and we investigate its magnetic, electronic, and thermal properties. The material exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering below 2.2 K, consistently observed in magnetic, transport, and heat capacity measurements. Magnetization measurements reveal 1/3 metamagnetic steps along the c-axis below the N\'eel temperature, suggesting an Ising-spin-like state on the twisted kagome lattice. A pronounced anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane resistivity is observed throughout the temperature range of 1.8-300 K, and the compound exhibits a significant frustration index of 13.6 (12.7) along the c-axis (ab-plane). Heat capacity measurements show a broad hump at 2.2 K, with an additional increase below 0.5 K. The anisotropic magnetic properties are further explored through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which suggest strong easy-axis anisotropy, consistent with experimental magnetic measurements and crystal-field model expectations, and quasi-one-dimensional bands and a spin-split saddle point at the zone center.</description>

      <title>Beyond Wigner: Non-Invertible Symmetries Preserve Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the traditional notion of symmetry in quantum theory was expanded to so-called generalised or categorical symmetries, which, unlike ordinary group symmetries, may be non-invertible. This appears to be at odds with Wigner's theorem, which requires quantum symmetries to be implemented by (anti)unitary -- and hence invertible -- operators in order to preserve probabilities. We resolve this puzzle for (higher) fusion category symmetries $\mathcal{C}$ by proposing that, instead of acting by unitary operators on a fixed Hilbert space, symmetry defects in $\mathcal{C}$ act as isometries between distinct Hilbert spaces constructed from twisted sectors. As a result, we find that non-invertible symmetries naturally act as trace-preserving quantum channels. Crucially, our construction relies on the symmetry category $\mathcal{C}$ being unitary. We illustrate our proposal through several examples that include Tambara-Yamagami, Fibonacci, and Yang-Lee as well as higher categorical symmetries.</description>

      <title>Zero-point energy of solids from vacuum fluctuation and quantum geometric force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that quantum fluctuations of electromagnetic fields induce an additional zero-point energy in solids, which scales with the volume. For insulators, the zero-point energy density is proportional to quantum fluctuation of electric polarization in the many-body ground state, a fundamental quantum geometric property of solids known as the quantum weight. Although the zero-point energy does not affect the dynamics of the electromagnetic fields, when the fields are produced by a superconducting LC circuit, the zero-point energy contributes to a repulsive force between the circuit and the material. In addition, since zero-point energy depends on the circuit's capacitor, it yields a measurable static force acting on the capacitor plates, which we call quantum geometric force. The proposed effects provide direct experimental access to the many-body quantum geometry and reveal a new macroscopic quantum effect in solids induced by vacuum fluctuation.</description>

      <title>New solution to the hyperon puzzle of neutron stars: Quantum many-body effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hyperon puzzle refers to the challenge of reconciling the existence of hyperons in neutron star cores and the observed high masses of neutron stars. The recent discovery of PSR J0952-0607 ($2.35\pm0.17 M_{\odot}$) has intensified this challenge. Existing solutions fail to achieve such a high mass, and often predict unrealistically fast cooling that is at odds with observations. Here, we propose a novel solution to the hyperon puzzle. Using the Dyson-Schwinger equation approach, we incorporate the quantum many-body effects caused by strong baryon-meson interactions into the equation of state for cold baryonic matter and find it stiff enough to support a maximum hyperon-star mass of $M_{\mathrm{max}} \approx 2.59 M_{\odot}$, which can explain all the observed high neutron-star masses. The resulting proton and hyperon fractions are remarkably low, thus the nucleonic and hyperonic direct Urca processes are significantly suppressed. As a result, fast cooling typically does not occur in ordinary neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Antiferromagnetic Spin Fluctuations and Superconductivity in La2SmNi2O7 Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between magnetic fluctuations and superconductivity is fundamental for understanding unconventional high-temperature superconductors. In the recently discovered Ruddlesden-Popper phase nickelates-which achieve superconducting transition temperatures up to ~100 K-this connection has been theoretically predicted but experimentally unverified. Using compressively strained La2SmNi2O7 thin films, we report direct evidence for this interplay. We observe a characteristic 'Mexican hat'-shaped magnetoresistance, a signature of superconductivity coexisting with emergent antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuations. This distinctive feature arises from a competition between the magnetic field's suppression of AFM fluctuation-driven scattering and its suppression of superconducting fluctuations. We quantify these AFM fluctuations by a crossover field, B*, whose magnitude decreases with increasing temperature and vanishes near the superconducting onset-behavior contrasting sharply with that in high-Tc cuprates. Our results establish not merely coexistence, but also a direct and novel correlation between AFM instability and superconductivity in nickelates, offering crucial insight into their pairing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Investigation of CeRh$_2$As$_2$ order parameters via ultrasound propagation anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductors with nearly degenerate pairing states are rare. CeRh$_2$As$_2$ has recently emerged as one of the few existing multi-phase superconductors. It exhibits a first-order phase transition between two distinct superconducting states when a magnetic field is applied along the crystallographic $c$-axis. While this behavior has been linked to locally broken inversion symmetry, a phase diagram based on a multi-component superconducting order parameter remains a possibility. Furthermore, superconductivity appears to coexist with an ordered state (phase I). Despite being the subject of many studies, little is known about the nature of the order parameters in both superconducting phases and phase I. Here, we use ultrasound-propagation measurements at low temperatures, in high magnetic fields and under hydrostatic pressure to address this issue. Our results strongly suggest that the superconducting order parameter in both phases is single-component, corroborating the role of local non-centrosymmetry in the development of multi-phase superconductivity in CeRh$_2$As$_2$. In addition, analysis of the elastic anomalies within the Landau framework of phase transitions strongly suggests the presence of an incommensurate magnetic order parameter in phase I.</description>

Abstract: Non-Hermiticity plays a fundamental role in open quantum systems and describes a wide variety of effects of interactions with environments, including quantum measurement. However, understanding its consequences in strongly interacting systems is still elusive due to the interplay between non-perturbative strong correlations and non-Hermiticity. While the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) method has been applied to tackle this problem, its foundation, based on the existence of the partition function, is ill-defined. In this paper, we establish a microscopic foundation of the non-Hermitian RG method from a few-body perspective. We show that the invariance of the scattering amplitude under RG transformations enables us to rigorously derive the non-Hermitian RG equation, giving a physically transparent interpretation of RG flows. We discuss a detailed structure of such RG flows in a non-relativistic two-body system with inelastic two-body loss, and show its relation to a non-Hermitian quantum scale anomaly. Our analysis suggests that non-Hermitian complex potentials often used in high-energy physics can be interpreted as being caused by quantum measurement, where the detection of elastically scattered particles updates the observer's knowledge, resulting in a nonunitary state change of the system. We apply our formalism to nuclear physics, find the emergence of a critical semicircle, and show that several nuclei are located near the critical semicircle in the coherent neutron-nucleus scattering. We also propose that the localized dineutron in two-neutron halo nuclei can be interpreted as the quantum measurement effect on the imaginary potential associated with absorption into the core nucleus. Our result bridges different contexts of non-Hermitian systems in high-energy and atomic, molecular, and optical physics, opening an interdisciplinary playground of non-Hermitian few-body physics.</description>

Abstract: We study the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model coupled with an optical cavity, which describes an interplay of the effect of vacuum fluctuation of light and the quantum phase transition between the charge- and spin-density-wave phases. The ground state and excitation spectrum of the model are calculated by numerically exact tensor-network methods. We find that the photon number of the ground state is enhanced (suppressed) along the quantum phase transition line when the light-matter coupling is comparable to (much smaller than) the cavity frequency. We also show that the exciton peak in the optical conductivity and photon spectrum that exists without the cavity exhibits the vacuum Rabi splitting at resonance due to the light-matter interaction. This behavior is in contrast to the case without excitons, where the photon spectrum is merely broadened without splitting due to the lack of a sharp resonance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18806v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to engineer topologically distinct materials opens the possibility of enabling novel phenomena in low-dimensional nano-systems, as well as manufacturing novel quantum devices. One of the simplest examples, the SSH model with both even and odd number of sites, demonstrates the connection between localized edge states and the topology of the system. We show that the SSH model hosts localized spin centers due to the interplay between the localized edge states and the on-site Hubbard interaction. We further show how one can engineer any number of localized spin centers within the chain by careful addition of defects. These spin centers are paired in spin-singlet or spin-triplet channels within each block separated by the defects, and together they construct an array of spin singlet and/or triplet qubits. As this system is realizable experimentally, our findings describe a novel way for manipulating and engineering spin qubits and therefore provide a platform for performing many-body quantum simulations on spin excitations like magnons and triplons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02221v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I explore a theory of transport and optical properties of strange metallic carriers in strongly correlated systems that follows from assuming that the diffusion constant has reached its quantum limit $D=\hbar/m$, and that such quantum carriers behave as distinguishable particles as they would in an electronic solid. These assumptions immediately lead to $T$-linear resistivities with apparent Planckian scattering rates and, extending to the frequency domain, to the stretched Drude peaks and $\omega/T$ scaling commonly observed in optical absorption experiments in strange metals. This behavior can be rationalized by observing that when the thermal de Broglie length $\lambda_{dB}$ exceeds the mean-free-path, the carrier motion can no longer be described in terms of random collisions of classical particles as assumed by Drude-Boltzmann theory and should be viewed instead as a sequence of projective measurements collapsing the wavefunction.</description>

      <title>Vanishing ordered moment in the frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnet CuNdO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic ground state of CuNdO$_2$, which is a delafossite with a triangular lattice of magnetic Nd$^{3+}$ ions that are well separated by non-magnetic Cu spacer layers. From inelastic neutron scattering measurements of the crystal electric field, we determine the strong Ising character of the pseudo-spin 1/2 Nd$^{3+}$ moments. Magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements reveal the onset of long-range antiferromagnetic order at $T_N=0.78$ K. While the magnetic transition is definitively observed with muon spin relaxation, accompanied by the formation of a weakly dispersing spin wave excitation, no dipole-ordered moment is detected with neutron diffraction. We show that the apparent absence of a dipolar ordered moment is a consequence of the dominant Ising character of the antiferromagnetically coupled Nd$^{3+}$ moments, which experience extreme frustration on the triangular lattice. Consequently, the frustration in CuNdO$_2$ is relieved through in-plane ordering of the substantially smaller perpendicular component of the Nd$^{3+}$ moments into a 120\textdegree\ structure, with a nearly vanishing ordered moment.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall to Chiral Spin Liquid transition in a Triangular Lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the weak interaction integer quantum Hall (IQH) phase, the intermediate interaction phase identified as a chiral spin liquid (CSL) and the transition between them in the triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model at a density of one electron per site in an orbital magnetic field corresponding to one-quarter flux per plaquette. Our primary tool is the finite system density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method with both interaction-strength scan and fixed interaction techniques for cylinders of circumference 3, 5, and 7 and lengths up to 240. For the IQH phase, we use single particle exact diagonalization to clarify finite size effects, including an excess charge on the edges of our cylinders, and the limitations of entanglement spectra degeneracies on small circumference cylinders. For both phases, we use DMRG to study the entanglement spectra, the entanglement entropy, and the effect of flux insertion on charge and spin pumping, all of which show key differences between the two phases. To study the transition, we use interaction-strength scans extending between the two phases, and apply a scaling data collapse of a bond-dimerization order parameter to extract critical exponents. We also extract critical behavior from the divergence of correlation lengths on the IQH side, measuring decay away from edges of both the dimerization order parameter and transverse edge currents. The critical behavior and exponents are consistent with an Ising transition in 1+1 dimensions. Finally, we obtain excited states in various quantum number sectors finding that the gap to a charge neutral momentum $\pi$ excitation corresponding to fluctuations of the dimerization order parameter closes in the vicinity of the critical point but gaps to other excitations remain large.</description>

      <title>Spin responses of a disordered helical superconducting edge under Zeeman field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate analytically and numerically the effects of disorder on the helical edge of the 2D topological insulator in the presence of the Zeeman field and superconductivity. Employing bosonization and a renormalization-group analysis, we study how impurity potentials modify charge- and spin-density wave correlations as well as superconducting pair correlations. Our results reveal that the Zeeman field controls the competition: in the attractive regime, it amplifies the superconducting gap, while in the repulsive regime, it stabilizes impurity effects by keeping the system longer in the relevant regime for disorder. We also find that disorder induces logarithmic suppression of transverse density-wave correlations, while at the same time introducing positive logarithmic corrections that enhance superconducting pair correlations and contribute to their stability. These effects directly modify the scaling of spin conductance, providing experimentally accessible signatures of the interplay between disorder and superconductivity in topological edge channels.</description>

      <title>Characterizing entanglement at finite temperature: how does a "classical" paramagnet become a quantum spin liquid?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSL) are phases of matter which are distinguished not by the symmetries they break, but rather by the patterns of entanglement within them. Although these entanglement properties have been widely discussed for ground states, the way in which QSL form at finite temperature remains an open question. Here we introduce a method of characterizing both the depth and spatial structure of entanglement, and use this to explore how patterns of entanglement form as temperature is reduced in two widely studied models of QSL, the Kitaev honeycomb model, and the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a Kagome lattice. These results enable us to evaluate both the temperature at which spins within the high-temperature paramagnet first become entangled, and the temperature at which the system first develops the structured, multipartite entanglement characteristic of its QSL ground state.</description>

      <title>Disorder Suppression of Charge Density Waves in the Honeycomb Holstein Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of charge-density-wave order in Dirac fermion systems via electron-phonon coupling represents a significant topic in condensed matter physics. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon within the Holstein model on the honeycomb lattice, with a specific focus on the effect of disorder. While the interplay between electron-electron interactions and disorder has long been a central theme in the field, recent attention has increasingly turned to the combined influence of disorder and electron-phonon coupling. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we concentrate on the phase transitions of charge-density-wave order on the honeycomb lattice. Disorder is introduced through the random hopping of electrons in the system, which can localize electrons via the Anderson effect. Our primary result is that disorder suppresses the charge-density-wave phase, and the interplay between disorder and electron-phonon interactions extends the phase area. We also determine the transition temperature \(\beta_c\) to the ordered phase as a function of the electron-phonon coupling. Additionally, we observed a suppression of electron kinetic energy and dc conductivity under disorder, highlighting the role of Anderson localization in the degradation of electronic transport. These findings offer significant theoretical insight into the stability and critical phenomena of correlated phases in disordered two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Ising Supercriticality and Universal Magnetocalorics in Spiral Antiferromagnet Nd$_3$BWO$_9$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated analogy between the pressure-temperature phase diagram of a liquid-gas system and the field-temperature phase diagram of ferromagnet has long been a cornerstone for understanding universality of phase transitions and critical phenomena. Here we extend this analogy to a highly frustrated antiferromagnet, the kagome-layered spiral Ising compound Nd$_3$BWO$_9$. In its field-temperature phase diagram, we identify a metamagnetic transition line with a critical endpoint (CEP) and corresponding Ising supercritical regime (ISR). The CEP is located at $\mu_0H_{\mathrm{c}} \simeq 1.04$ T and $T_{\mathrm{c}} \simeq 0.3$ K. Above this point, the ISR emerges with supercritical crossover lines that adhere to a universal scaling law, as evidenced by the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Remarkably, we observe a highly sensitive field dependence in the magnetic cooling near the emergent CEP, characterized by a divergent magnetic Gr\"uneisen ratio following $\Gamma_H \propto 1/t^{\beta+\gamma-1}$, with $\beta + \gamma \simeq 1.563$ the critical exponents of 3D Ising universality class and $t \equiv (T-T_{\rm c})/T_{\rm c}$ the reduced temperature. Our adiabatic demagnetization measurements on Nd$_3$BWO$_9$ reveal a lowest temperature of 195 mK, achieved from the initial condition of 2 K and 4 T. The findings here pave the way for studying supercritical phenomena and magnetic cooling in rare-earth RE$_3$BWO$_9$ family and, more broadly, in Ising-anisotropic magnets like spin ices.</description>

Abstract: Quantum phase transitions driven by electronic correlations are central to understanding the physics of graphene and related two-dimensional materials. A paradigmatic example is the semimetal-to-Mott-insulator transition on the honeycomb lattice, governed by the Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg universality class, yet consensus on its critical exponents has remained elusive for over a decade due to severe finite-size effects and the absence of rigorous conformal bootstrap benchmarks. Here we try to resolve this long-standing controversy by performing projector determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations on lattices of unprecedented size, reaching 10,368 sites. By developing a novel projected submatrix update algorithm, we achieve a significant algorithmic speedup that enables us to access the thermodynamic limit with high precision. We observe that the fermion anomalous dimension and the correlation length exponent converge rapidly, while the boson anomalous dimension exhibits a systematic size dependence that we resolve via linear extrapolation. To validate our analysis, we perform parallel large-scale simulations of the spinless $t$-$V$ model on the honeycomb lattice, which belongs to the Gross-Neveu-Ising class. Our results for the $t$-$V$ model show agreement with conformal bootstrap predictions, thereby corroborating the robustness of our methodology. Our work provides state-of-the-art critical exponents for the honeycomb Hubbard model and establishes a systematic finite-size scaling workflow applicable to a broad class of strongly correlated quantum systems, paving the way for resolving other challenging fermionic quantum critical phenomena.</description>

Abstract: Despite extensive study, the phase structure of the wavefunctions in frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnets (HAF) is not yet systematically characterized. In this work, we represent the Hilbert space of an HAF as a weighted graph, which we term the Hilbert graph (HG), whose vertices are spin configurations and whose edges are generated by off-diagonal spin-flip terms of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, with weights set by products of wavefunction amplitudes. Holding the amplitudes fixed and restricting phases to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ values, the phase-dependent variational energy can be recast as a classical Ising antiferromagnet on the HG, so that phase reconstruction of the ground state reduces to a weighted Max-Cut instance. This shows that phase reconstruction HAF is worst-case NP-hard and provides a direct link between wavefunction sign structure and combinatorial optimization.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning has made important headway in helping to improve the treatment of quantum many-body systems. A domain of particular relevance are correlated inhomogeneous systems. What has been missing so far is a general, scalable deep-learning approach that would enable the rapid prediction of spatial densities for strongly correlated systems in arbitrary potentials. In this work, we present a straightforward scheme, where we learn to predict densities using convolutional neural networks trained on random potentials. While we demonstrate this approach in 1D and 2D lattice models using data from numerical techniques like Quantum Monte Carlo, it is directly applicable as well to training data obtained from experimental quantum simulators. We train networks that can predict the densities of multiple observables simultaneously and that can predict for a whole class of many-body lattice models, for arbitrary system sizes. We show that our approach can handle well the interplay of interference and interactions and the behaviour of models with phase transitions in inhomogeneous situations, and we also illustrate the ability to solve inverse problems, finding a potential for a desired density.</description>

      <title>Revealing effects of local dimension on variable-range interacting model by connecting Lieb-Robinson bounds and multipartite entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A spin-$s$ variable-range interacting Ising model may display qualitatively different behaviors depending on the fall-off rate of the interactions, as already seen in equilibrium studies of spin-1/2 systems. We propose a dynamical method using weighted graph states, generated through time evolution that confirms the existence of the transition point in the fall-off rate for the spin-$s$ Ising model. Moreover, the dependence of local dimension on information spreading and multipartite entanglement profile in this model remains unclear, which we establish here. In particular, our analysis shows that the maximum of genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) with the fall-off rate serves as a clear indicator of the information spreading, which aligns with changes in the profile of the Lieb-Robinson bound. Further, in the case of an open chain, the spread of information is related to the divergence in the first derivative of GME. Additionally, we validate this signature by performing a scaling analysis of the time-averaged mutual information.</description>

      <title>Non-Universality from Conserved Superoperators in Unitary Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important result in the theory of quantum control is the "universality" of $2$-local unitary gates, i.e. the fact that any global unitary evolution of a system of $L$ qudits can be implemented by composition of $2$-local unitary gates. Surprisingly, recent results have shown that universality can break down in the presence of symmetries: in general, not all globally symmetric unitaries can be constructed using $k$-local symmetric unitary gates. This also restricts the dynamics that can be implemented by symmetric local Hamiltonians. In this paper, we show that obstructions to universality in such settings can in general be understood in terms of superoperator symmetries associated with unitary evolution by restricted sets of gates. These superoperator symmetries lead to block decompositions of the operator Hilbert space, which dictate the connectivity of operator space, and hence the structure of the dynamical Lie algebra. We demonstrate this explicitly in several examples by systematically deriving the superoperator symmetries from the gate structure using the framework of commutant algebras, which has been used to systematically derive symmetries in other quantum many-body systems. We clearly delineate two different types of non-universality, which stem from different structures of the superoperator symmetries, and discuss its signatures in physical observables. In all, our work establishes a comprehensive framework to explore the universality of unitary circuits and derive physical consequences of its absence.</description>

      <title>Fermi-liquid transport beyond the upper critical field in superconducting La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity typically emerges out of a strongly correlated normal state, manifesting as a highly renormalized Fermi liquid or a strange metal with $T$-linear resistivity. In Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelates, superconductivity with a critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$ exceeding 80 and 40~K has been respectively realised in pressurized bulk crystals and epitaxially strained thin films. These advancements call for the characterisation of fundamental normal-state and superconducting parameters in these new materials platforms of high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity. Here we report detailed magnetotransport experiments on superconducting La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ (LPNO) thin films under pulsed magnetic fields up to 64~T and access the normal-state behaviour over a wide temperature range between 1.5 and 300~K. We find that the normal state of thin-film LPNO exhibits the hallmarks of Fermi-liquid transport, including $T^2$ temperature dependence of resistivity and Hall angle, and $H^2$ magnetoresistance obeying Kohler scaling. Using the empirical Kadowaki-Woods ratio, we estimate a quasiparticle effective mass $m^*/m_e \simeq 10$, thereby revealing the highly renormalized Fermi liquid state therein. Our results demonstrate that thin-film LPNO follows the same $T_{\rm c}/T_{\rm F}$ scaling observed across a myriad of strongly correlated superconductors and establish key normal-state characteristics of strained bilayer superconducting nickelates.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy and its Transition in the Coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement and quantum magic are two distinct fundamental resources that enable quantum systems to exhibit complex phenomena beyond the capabilities of classical computer simulations. While quantum entanglement has been extensively used to characterize both equilibrium and dynamical phases, the study of quantum magic, typically quantified by the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE), remains largely limited to numerical simulations of moderate system sizes. In this Letter, we establish a general framework for analyzing the SRE in solvable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models in the large-$N$ limit, which enables the application of the saddle-point approximation. Applying this method to the Maldacena-Qi coupled SYK model, we identify a series of first-order transitions of the SRE as the temperature is tuned. In particular, we uncover an intrinsic transition of the SRE that cannot be detected through thermodynamic quantities. We also discuss the theoretical understanding of the SRE in both the high-temperature and low-temperature limits. Our results pave the way for studying the SRE in strongly correlated fermionic systems in the thermodynamic limit and suggest a new class of transitions for which the SRE serves as an order parameter.</description>

      <title>Topological Magnon-Plasmon Hybrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study magnon-plasmon coupling in effectively two-dimensional stacks of van der Waals layers in the context of the band structure topology. Invoking the quasiparticle approximation, we show that the magnetic dipole coupling between the plasmons in a metallic layer and the magnons in a neighboring magnetic layer gives rise to a Berry curvature. As a result, the hybrid quasiparticles acquire an anomalous velocity, leading to intrinsic anomalous thermal Hall and spin-Nernst effects in ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. We propose magnetic layers supporting skyrmion crystals as a platform to realize chiral magnon-plasmon edge states, inviting the notion of topological magnon-plasmonics.</description>

      <title>Large spin signal and spin rectification in folded-bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphene is a promising platform for spin-based non-volatile memory, logic, and neuromorphic computing by combining long-distance spin transport with electrical tunability at room temperature. However, advancing beyond passive spin channels requires devices capable of generating large spin signals with efficient rectification capabilities, which are essential for active spintronic components. Here, we demonstrate a folded-bilayer graphene spin-valve device with giant non-local spin signals in the several mV range with pronounced spin-rectification effects. Efficient spin injection creates a significant spin accumulation of 20 meV and generates a spin diode effect with an asymmetry of over an order of magnitude between forward and reverse bias conditions. This spin-diode effect is expected to arise from nonlinear spin-charge interactions in the folded-bilayer graphene channel. These observed large spin signals and spin-diode effects in graphene systems offer a promising platform for developing active two-dimensional spintronic devices.</description>
