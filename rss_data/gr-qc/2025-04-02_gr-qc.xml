      <title>Obstructions for trapped submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of $k-$future convex spacelike/null hypersurface $\Sigma$ in an $n+1$ dimensional spacetime $M$ and prove that no $k-$dimensional closed trapped submanifold (k-CTM) can be tangent to $\Sigma$ from its future side. As a consequence, k-CTMs cannot be found in open spacetime regions foliated by such hypersurfaces. In gravitational collapse scenarios, specific hypersurfaces of this kind act as past barriers for trapped submanifolds. A number of examples are worked out in detail, two of them showing 3+1 spacetime regions containing trapped loops ($k=1$) but no closed trapped surfaces ($k=2$). The use of trapped loops as an early indicator of black hole formation is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>On the bouncing completion of eternal inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a purely kinematical argument, the Borde-Guth-Vilenkin (BGV) theorem states that any maximal space-time with average positive expansion is geodesically incomplete, hence past eternal inflation would be necessarily singular. Recently, discussions about the broadness of this theorem have been resurfaced by applying it to new models and/or challenging the space-time maximality hypothesis. In the present work, we use reference frames of non co-moving observers and their kinematical properties in order to inquire into the nature of such possible singular beginnings. Using the spatially flat de Sitter (dS) space-time as a laboratory, this approach allows us to exhaust all possibilities bounded by the BGV theorem in the case of general spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) geometries. We show that either there exists a scalar or parallelly propagated curvature singularity, or the space-time must be past asymptotically dS (with a definite non-zero limit of the Hubble parameter when the scale factor becomes null, hence excluding certain cyclic models) in order to be extensible. We are able to present this local extension without violating the null energy condition, and we show that this extension must contain a bounce. This is a mathematical result based on purely kinematical arguments and intuition. The possible physical realization of such extensions are also discussed. As a side product, we present a new chart that covers all de Sitter space-time.</description>

      <title>Hairy charged black holes in a model with bounded scalar field potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrically and magnetically charged (a.k.a. dyonic) black holes with scalar hair have recently been constructed for a sextic scalar field potential. Here, we re-investigate this model, but with a bounded scalar field potential of exponential form. We demonstrate that qualitative differences appear. First, we present scalar clouds on (dyonic) Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes as well as (dyonically) charged clouds on Schwarzschild black holes, respectively. We then extend our results to the fully backreacted case and put the focus on the comparison of the electrically charged black holes with their dyonic counterparts.</description>

      <title>Inflation with Gauss-Bonnet correction: beyond slow-roll</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If a coupling between the inflaton and the Gauss-Bonnet term is introduced, many models of inflation that were ruled out by the most recent Planck data can be made viable again. The predictions for the scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio are typically computed using the slow-roll approximation. In this paper we instead study the full equations of motion and determine the necessary initial conditions for reasonable inflation epoch. We derive the conditions under which the Friedmann equation admits positive solutions for the Hubble parameter. Then we study the possibility of the inflaton becoming trapped in a local potential minimum induced by the Gauss-Bonnet term. Finally we demonstrate the results on monomial potential models with a quadratic and a quartic potential and show that the slow-roll approximation becomes imprecise in the quartic case.</description>

      <title>Can the poltergeist mechanism produce observable GWs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enhancement of induced gravitational waves (GWs) occurs due to a sudden transition from an early matter-dominated era to the radiation-dominated era. We analyze the impact of the transition rate on the scalar potential. We find that the finite transition duration suppresses the oscillation amplitude of the scalar potential, consequently suppressing the amplitude of the GW energy spectrum. By numerically solving the background and perturbation equations, we demonstrate that the physically motivated models, such as the evaporation of primordial black holes and the decay of Q-balls, cannot produce an observable GW signal.</description>

      <title>Black hole solutions in quantum phenomenological gravitational dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate black hole solutions within a phenomenological approach to quantum gravity based on spacetime thermodynamics developed by Alonso-Serrano and Li\v{s}ka. The field equations are traceless, similarly to unimodular gravity, and include quadratic curvature corrections. We find that static, spherically symmetric, vacuum spacetimes in this theory split into two branches. The first branch is indistinguishable from corresponding solutions in unimodular gravity and describes Schwarzschild-(Anti) de Sitter black holes. The second branch instead describes horizonless solutions and is characterized by large values of the spatial curvature. We analyze the dynamics of first-order metric perturbations on both branches, showing that there are no deviations from unimodular gravity at this level.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear electrodynamic black holes and their role in testing modified theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of black holes (BHs) and potential deviations from General Relativity (GR) remain key questions in astrophysics. Nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) offers a mechanism for constructing regular BHs that evade singularities. We perform a geometrical and observational analysis of NED-inspired BHs, constraining the magnetic parameter via Bayesian inference using EHT data, obtaining \( q = 0.98^{+0.09}_{-0.08} \) for M87* and \( q = 1.10\pm0.10 \) for Sgr A*. Deviations from Schwarzschild BHs manifest in horizon structure, shadow properties, and lensing effects. We analyze BH shadows under plasma conditions, identifying imprints of NED on strong-field processes. Future observations from LISA, next-generation X-ray telescopes, and EHT will further constrain these deviations and provide tests for alternative gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes and Stability Analysis of the JMN-1 Naked Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the quasinormal modes in the Joshi-Malafarina-Narayan (JMN-1) naked singularity by investigating its response to linear perturbations, including scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations. To analyze the stability of the JMN-1 naked singularity under axial perturbations, we compute the quasinormal mode frequencies using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin method. The quasinormal mode frequencies provides information about the stability of spacetime, with the real part of the frequency determining the oscillation rate and the imaginary part governing the decay or growth of perturbations. Our results indicate that by imposing appropriate boundary conditions, we find that the JMN-1 spacetime remains dynamically stable under axial perturbations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Brans-Dicke scalar-tensor cosmological models are studied in both Einstein and Jordan frames, using hydrodynamical and self-interacting scalar field representations of the energy-momentum tensor, leading to the same background solutions. The main features of the corresponding cosmological scenarios are determined. In many cases, we identify a transition from decelerated to accelerated regimes. The properties of the self-interacting scalar field, including the corresponding potential, are determined. Finally, some possible realistic configurations are analyzed.</description>

Abstract: We study quasinormal modes (QNMs) for the Klein-Gordon equation on Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter black holes with near-extremal charge. We locate all QNMs of size $\mathcal{O}(\kappa_{\rm C})$ where $\kappa_{\rm C}$ is the surface gravity of the Cauchy horizon (which vanishes at extremality): they are well-approximated by $\kappa_{\rm C}$ times QNMs of the near-horizon geometry ${\rm AdS}^2\times{\mathbb S}^2$ of the extremal limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work applies the principles of quantum cosmology to examine models incorporating a quintom field. Specifically, three distinct models are analyzed: a simplified toy model, a model featuring an exponential quintom potential, and one where the quintom field is coupled with a negative cosmological constant. For each case, we study the classical trajectories within the configuration space, present solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in quantum cosmology, and discuss physical interpretations and consequences. A key focus is the behavior of wave packets in the minisuperspace framework. Notably, the correspondence principle (connection between classical and quantum solutions) is also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Detector Response to Gravitational Wave Polarizations in Gravitational Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of gravitational wave polarization modes within Gravitational Quantum Field Theory (GQFT), a unified theoretical framework reconciling general relativity and quantum field theory. Our study focuses on five fundamental polarization states predicted in GQFT: two tensor ($+, \times$), two vector (x, y), and one scalar (breathing) mode, focusing on their distinctive detection signatures in space-based interferometers like LISA and Taiji. Using first-order orbital dynamics in the Solar System Barycenter frame, we identify three novel observational features: (1) characteristic interference patterns between polarization modes, (2) distinctive null-point signatures enabling mode discrimination, and (3) sky-position-dependent optimal detection windows. Our approach provides complete sky coverage through polarization mapping while remaining fully compatible with existing mission designs, notably avoiding the need for challenging direct breathing-mode measurements. The results are presented through comprehensive sky maps, offering both theoretical insights into gravitational wave polarization and practical tools for future detector networks. This work establishes a new paradigm for testing fundamental gravity theories through their unique polarization fingerprints, with particular relevance for upcoming multi-messenger gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>The Trinity of black hole correspondences: Shadows-quasinormal modes-graybody factors and cautionary remarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correspondences between apparently distant concepts are ubiquitous in theoretical physics. In the context of Black Holes (BHs), Quasi-Normal Modes (QNMs) were shown to be linked to both the shadows, in the so-called eikonal limit, and Gray-Body Factors (GBFs), using the WKB approximation. We test the accuracy of the quasinormal modes-graybody factors correspondence's in the context of the Hawking spectra for static and rotating black hole configurations, with particular attention to the superradiant regime. Our analysis reveals the correspondence failure to accurately reproduce the Hawking spectrum due to divergences. Furthermore, we bridge the gap between black shadows and graybody factors by drawing a correspondence between such quantities in the case of generic static and spherically symmetric spacetime configurations. The shadow-GBF correspondence is tested for some case studies, including regular BHs, and its limitations and applicability are thereof discussed. This study opens new perspectives, by introducing a new correspondence and remarking on the caution needed when considering these connections.</description>

      <title>General relativistic effects on photon spectrum emitted from dark matter halos around primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate general relativistic effects on the photon spectrum emitted from decaying (or annihilating) particle dark matter in the halo surrounding a primordial black hole. The spectrum undergoes significant modification due to gravitational redshifts, which induces broadening as a result of the intense gravitational field near the black hole. This characteristic alteration in the photon spectrum presents a unique observational signature. Future observations of such spectral features may provide critical evidence for a mixed dark matter scenario, involving both primordial black holes and particle dark matter.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Similarity in Higher-Order Classical Symplectic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many theories of physical interest, which admit a Hamiltonian description, exhibit symmetries under a particular class of non -strictly conformal transformation, known as dynamical similarities. The presence of such symmetries allows a reduction process to be carried out, eliminating a single degree of freedom from the system, which we associate with an overall scale. This process of `contact reduction' leads to theories of a frictional nature, in which the physically-observable quantities form an autonomous subsystem, that evolves in a predictable manner. We demonstrate that this procedure has a natural generalisation to theories of higher order; detailed examples are provided, and physical implications discussed.</description>

      <title>It costs nothing to teleport information into a black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is often claimed that adding a qubit to a black hole requires energy $\Delta E \geq T_H \log 2$ so that the extra Bekenstein-Hawking entropy can accommodate the qubit. In this essay, we explain how the recently discovered phenomenon of black hole decoherence allows quantum information to be teleported into a black hole, with arbitrarily small energy cost. The generalized second law is not violated and there is no conflict with unitarity because the teleportation creates new entanglement, analogous to Hawking radiation, between the black hole interior and exterior. In accordance with Landauer's principle, a nonzero minimum energy cost only appears when there is a net erasure of information and noise from the exterior or, equivalently, when ``zerobits'' are sent into the black hole.</description>

Abstract: Steven Weinberg productive scientific life teaches us many things, one of the most important of which is the power of his example. This essay contains personal reminiscences and a speculation about gravitational wave propagation based on one of his very last papers -- as seems fitting, given his penchant for putting interesting physics into the essays he wrote for other luminaries over the years.

      <title>A Renormalization Group Analysis of the Ising Model Coupled to Causal Dynamical Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the matrix model characterizing the Ising model coupled to Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT) from the point of view of the Functional Renormalization Group Equation (FRGE). This model is a dually weighted matrix model, whose Feynman diagrams are in correspondence with discrete triangulations of two-dimensional geometries with a preferred time foliation. In particular, we find the fixed points of the beta-function equations, showing that the number of relevant directions in each case is compatible with the physical interpretation of the CFT at the fixed point. In addition to recovering the fixed points for topological gravity and pure gravity with a cosmological constant, we find a new fixed point featuring three relevant directions which matches the number of primary fields in the Ising CFT.</description>

      <title>Power Spectra in Double-Field Inflation Using Renormalization-Group Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A perturbative strategy for inflation described by two-inflaton fields is developed using a mathematical analogy with the renormalization-group. Two small quantities, $\alpha$ and $\lambda$, corresponding to standard slow-roll parameters are defined and systematic expansions of all inflationary quantities in terms of powers of $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ are found. No other slow-roll parameters are needed. To illustrate this perturbative method in the multi-field context, we adopt a simple two-inflaton model with quadratic potentials in the parameter range where both fields contribute similarly to the dynamics of inflation. The model, even though it is not a viable alternative for phenomenological description of the inflationary period, nicely illustrates subtleties of the perturbative approach. In particular, this method allows us to derive two independent gauge-invariant scalar perturbations that are conserved in the superhorizon limit, overcoming typical problems that emerge in multi-field inflation. Furthermore, it is possible to perform nonperturbative resummations that allow to study the model in a true multi-field regime. We derive tensor and scalar power spectra to the next-to-next-to-leading and next-to-leading orders, respectively, as well as their spectral indices. The hierarchy between the two scalar perturbations allows us to single out the dominant entry of the scalar power-spectrum matrix. Modifications due to the second inflaton occur already at the leading order. Finally, we explain why the quadratic two-inflaton model is not compatible with the present experimental constraints even though non-trivial corrections to scalar perturbations do emerge.</description>

      <title>Quasar Pairs as Large--Scale Structure tracers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasars are effective tracers of the large-scale distribution of galaxies at high redshift thanks to their high luminosity and dedicated surveys. Previous studies have shown that quasars exhibit a bias similar to that of rich groups, indicating that quasar pairs may be linked to higher density environments, serving as protocluster proxies. In this work, we aim to characterize close quasar pairs within the same halo by identifying them in redshift space. We analyze pair-quasar cross correlations and CMB-derived lensing convergence profiles centered in these systems. We have identified 2777 pairs of quasars in the redshift range from 1.2 to 2.8. Quasar pairs exhibit a distribution of relative luminosities that differs from that of random pairs with the same redshift distribution, indicating that quasars in these systems are distinct from isolated ones. The cross-correlation between pairs and quasars shows a larger amplitude than the auto-correlation function of quasars, suggesting these systems are more strongly biased toward the large-scale mass distribution and reside in more massive halos. This is further supported by higher convergence CMB lensing profiles of pairs compared to isolated quasars with a similar redshift distribution. Our results indicate that quasar pairs are suitable precursors to present-day clusters of galaxies, unlike isolated quasars, which are associated with less dense environments.</description>

      <title>Graviton Scattering on Gravitational Atoms: Relic Graviton Shot Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the scattering of a graviton on a gravitational atom. By gravitational atom we mean a quantum mechanical system of a gravitational (bound) state of two massive particles, with possibly some boundary conditions (such as bouncing on a table or hanging as a pendulum). We demonstrate the unexpected fact, that the total absorption cross section is universal, it is independent of both the mass of the gravitationally bound particle or of the mass providing the binding potential. We find that the total absorption cross-section is simply proportional to the Planck area, multiplied by a dimensionless, numerical factor. We speculate about the potential for detection of relic gravitons shot noise.</description>

      <title>Local conformal symmetry and anomalies with antisymmetric tensor field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the trace anomaly, which results from the integration of the massless conformal fermion field with the background of metric and antisymmetric tensor fields. The non-local terms in the anomaly-induced effective action do not depend on the scheme of quantum calculations. On the other hand, total derivative terms in the anomaly and the corresponding local part of the induced action manifest scheme dependence and multiplicative anomaly.</description>

      <title>Relativistic quantum Otto heat engine using a three-level Unruh-DeWitt detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore a relativistic quantum Otto heat engine with a qutrit as the working substance interacting with a quantum scalar field in curved spacetime. Unlike qubits, which extract work by simply expanding or shrinking a single energy gap, qutrits allow multiple energy gaps to be adjusted independently, enabling more versatile work extraction in the quantum Otto cycle. We derive a general positive work condition in terms of the effective temperature that each pair of energy levels perceives. Moreover, we discuss additional subtleties that are absent when using a qubit, such as the generation of coherence terms in the density matrix due to interactions.</description>

      <title>Searching for kilonova with the SiTian prototype telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate the optical searching of gravitational-wave electromagnetic counterpart of the binary neutron star (BNS) merger event (i.e., a kilonova) using the ground based {\it SiTian} project prototype telescope with a 5-min limiting magnitude of 22.0, triggered by LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave detectors during the ongoing O4 run. Our simulations show that an average of 0.17-0.25 kilonova events can be observed over the entire O4 period of $\sim 2$ years in the most optimistic case we set, while no kilonova can be detected in other cases. We note that it is beneficial for {\it SiTian}'s kilonova searching by extending the exposure time to gain deeper limiting magnitude despite the rapid decline of kilonova luminosity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that many-partite entanglement is ubiquitous in holography and holographic quantum error correction codes. We base our claim on genuine multi-entropy, a new measure for multi-partite entanglement. We also discuss a connection between the bulk IR reconstruction and many-partite entanglement on a large number of boundary subregions.</description>

      <title>The CosmoVerse White Paper: Addressing observational tensions in cosmology with systematics and fundamental physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard model of cosmology has provided a good phenomenological description of a wide range of observations both at astrophysical and cosmological scales for several decades. This concordance model is constructed by a universal cosmological constant and supported by a matter sector described by the standard model of particle physics and a cold dark matter contribution, as well as very early-time inflationary physics, and underpinned by gravitation through general relativity. There have always been open questions about the soundness of the foundations of the standard model. However, recent years have shown that there may also be questions from the observational sector with the emergence of differences between certain cosmological probes. In this White Paper, we identify the key objectives that need to be addressed over the coming decade together with the core science projects that aim to meet these challenges. These discordances primarily rest on the divergence in the measurement of core cosmological parameters with varying levels of statistical confidence. These possible statistical tensions may be partially accounted for by systematics in various measurements or cosmological probes but there is also a growing indication of potential new physics beyond the standard model. After reviewing the principal probes used in the measurement of cosmological parameters, as well as potential systematics, we discuss the most promising array of potential new physics that may be observable in upcoming surveys. We also discuss the growing set of novel data analysis approaches that go beyond traditional methods to test physical models. [Abridged]</description>

      <title>Singularity-free cosmology from interactions in the dark sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker models where a dark energy component with a quadratic equation of state (EoS) nonlinearly interacts with cold dark matter. Thus, two energy scales naturally come into play: $\rho_*$ is the scale at which the nonlinearity of the EoS becomes relevant; $\rho_i$ is the energy scale around which the interaction starts to play an important role in the dynamics. Our focus is to understand whether there are parameter ranges for this system that can produce non-singular bouncing and emergent cosmologies for any initial condition. We complete a dynamical systems analysis, and find the parameter range such that trajectories always expand from a high energy non-singular de Sitter state. For flat and negative curvature models this de Sitter state is represented by a fixed point, the asymptotic past from which the universe emerges from. We find a subset of positive curvature models that during contraction get arbitrarily close to the de Sitter state, thus having a quasi-de Sitter bounce, then emerge from the bounce and expand, evolving toward spatial flatness. We find that the dimensionless parameter $q\equiv \rho_*/\rho_i$, which measures the relative strength of the nonlinear terms in the system, plays a crucial role in the topology of the phase space. When $q &lt; 3$, some trajectories expand toward a singularity, while others evolve toward a low energy cosmological constant at late-times, with a subset going through a decelerated matter dominate era before the final acceleration. When $q &gt; 3$, all trajectories are non-singular, and evolve toward a late-time cosmological constant. We find a subclass in this case in which all trajectories have at least one decelerated matter dominated phase, and accelerate at late-times.</description>

      <title>Is Lorentz invariance violation found?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) has long been recognized as an observable low-energy signature of quantum gravity. In spite of a great effort to detect LIV effects, so far only lower bounds have been derived. The high energy photons from the gamma ray burst GRB 221009A have been detected by the LHAASO collaboration and one at ${\cal E} \simeq 251 \, \rm TeV$ by the Carpet collaboration using a partial data set. Very recently, the Carpet collaboration has completed the full data analysis, reporting further support for their previously detected photon now at ${\cal E} = 300^{+ 43}_{- 38} \, {\rm TeV}$, which manifestly clashes with conventional physics. Taking this result at face value, we derive the first evidence for LIV and we show that such a detection cannot be explained by axion-like particles (ALPs), which allow for the observation of the highest energy photons detected by LHAASO. We also outline a scenario in which ALPs and LIV naturally coexist. If confirmed by future observations our finding would represent the first positive result in quantum gravity phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave constraints on the GWTC-2 events by measuring the tidal deformability and the spin-induced quadrupole moment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.09193v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences provide a unique laboratory to test properties of compact objects. As alternatives to the ordinary black holes in general relativity, various exotic compact objects have been proposed. Some of them have largely different values of the tidal deformability and spin-induced quadrupole moment from those of black holes, and their binaries could be distinguished from the binary black hole by using gravitational waves emitted during their inspiral regime, excluding the highly model-dependent merger and ringdown regimes. We reanalyze gravitational waves from low-mass merger events in the GWTC-2, detected by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. Focusing on the influence of tidal deformability and spin-induced quadrupole moment in the inspiral waveform, we provide model-independent constraints on deviations from the standard binary black hole case. We find that all events that we have analyzed are consistent with the waveform of the binary black hole in general relativity. Bayesian model selection shows that the hypothesis that the binary is composed of exotic compact objects is disfavored by all events.</description>

      <title>Fermat Principle and weak deflection angle from Lindstedt-Poincare method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fermat principle is advocated to be a convenient tool to analyze the light propagation in a curved space time. It is shown that in the weak deflection regime the light ray trajectories can be systematically described by applying the Lindstedt--Poincar\'e method of solving perturbatively the nonlinear oscillation equations. The expansion in terms of inverse invariant impact parameter for Schwarzschild, Reissner--Nordstr\"om and Kerr (equatorial motion) metrics is described. The corresponding deflection angles are computed to the third order. Only algebraic operations are involved in the derivation; no integrations or Fourier expansion of elliptic functions are necessary. It is argued, that contrary to the naive perturbative expansion, the Lindstedt--Poincar\'e approach correctly represents the main properties of light propagation in asymptotic regime. At each step it preserves the periodicity of the relevant nonlinear oscillations of the inverse radial coordinate which allows to group the trajectories with the same invariant impact parameter into disjoint sets of ones generated by particular oscillations. Moreover, it allows for partial summation of perturbative expansion leading to the uniformly bounded approximations.</description>

      <title>Testing eccentric corrections to the radiation-reaction force in the test-mass limit of effective-one-body models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we test an effective-one-body radiation-reaction force for eccentric planar orbits of a test mass in a Kerr background, which contains third-order post-Newtonian (PN) non-spinning and second-order PN spin contributions. We compare the analytical fluxes connected to two different resummations of this force, truncated at different PN orders in the eccentric sector, with the numerical fluxes computed through the use of frequency- and time-domain Teukolsky-equation codes. We find that the different PN truncations of the radiation-reaction force show the expected scaling in the weak gravitational-field regime, and we observe a fractional difference with the numerical fluxes that is $&lt;5 \%$, for orbits characterized by eccentricity $0 \le e \le 0.7$, central black-hole spin $-0.99 M \le a \le 0.99 M$ and fixed orbital-averaged quantity $x=\langle M\Omega \rangle^{2/3} = 0.06$, corresponding to the mildly strong-field regime with semilatera recta $9 M&lt;p&lt;17 M$. Our analysis provides useful information for the development of spin-aligned eccentric models in the comparable-mass case.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Systems Analysis of f(R,G) Cosmological Model with Dark Sector Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we examine the dynamical system of the $f(R,\mathcal{G})$ gravity model. This $f(R,G)$ model framework is composed of interactions between dark matter and scalar field through the linear coupling term. The key objective of the present study is to describe the cosmological viability of the modified gravity theory formulated with the gravity $ f(R, \mathcal{G}) $. We transform the cosmological equations into an autonomous system of ordinary differential equations by suitable transformation of variables. The $ f(R,\mathcal{G})$ model governed by $ f(R, \mathcal{G}) = \alpha R^m + \beta \mathcal{G}^n $ has been investigated in detail to characterize the stability properties of the critical points of the autonomous system. The model may explain the late-time accelerating universe expansion corresponding to the attractor in model. Depending on the effective equation of state parameter values corresponding to the critical points, we study the observational viability of the model using low-redshift observational data such as the observational Hubble data. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of parameters by using the effective equation of state parameter and statefinder diagnostics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The linear response of a Schwarzschild black hole to an external quadrupolar perturbation is studied in analogy to a mechanical electrodynamical system, with the goal to describe the gravitational polarizability. Its causality properties imply dispersion relations that relate fluctuation and dissipative properties. We review and combine results obtained via the Regge-Wheeler equation on one side and a perturbative, worldline effective field theory description on the other, obtaining a consistent description of the dispersion relations for the gravitational polarizability of a Schwarzschild black hole. We find that the classical part of the 2-point correlation function of the black hole multipole depends on the boundary conditions of the space-time the black hole is immersed in, which is relevant for the dispersion relations considered.</description>

      <title>How parameter constraining can influence the mass accretion process of a Black Hole in the Generalized Rastall Gravity Theory ?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black holes, one of the greatest enigmas of our Universe, are challenging to decipher. This work is dedicated to observing the changes in the mass of a non-singular black hole with the evolution of the Universe in the generalized Rastall gravity framework, considering the effects of parameter constraining. We examine two recently developed dynamical dark-energy equation of state parameterization models: Chaudhary-Bouali-Debnath-Roy-Mustafa-type~(CBDRM)~parameterization and Chaudhary-Debnath-Mustafa-Maurya-Atamurotov-type~(CDMMA)~parameterization. Starting with the concept and fundamental equations of the generalized Rastall gravity theory, we introduce the two models along with their equations of state, energy density equations, and corresponding Hubble parameter equations. We then constrain the required parameters using Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) analyses to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our study. Next, we discuss the non-singular black holes from the perspective of generalized Rastall gravity theory and some of their essential properties. Finally, we pursue the primary goal of our work: analyzing the mass accretion process. We derive the mass equation for both models in terms of the redshift function, represent the results graphically, and compare them with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model of the Universe. Our findings indicate that the accretion of both CBDRM~and~CDMMA dark energy parameterizations, considering constrained parameter values, leads to an increase in the mass of the black hole during the Universe's evolution within the generalized Rastall gravity theory, revealing the true nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Scattering of wave dark matter by supermassive black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00090v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent simulations of wave dark matter around black hole binaries revealed the formation of a universal density profile that co-rotates with the binary. We derive this profile from first principles, interpreting it as the steady state of a scattering process. We find that the scattering becomes particularly efficient when the ratio of the binary separation to the dark matter's de Broglie wavelength assumes certain discrete values, which can be interpreted as bound state resonances. After estimating the amount of dark matter that undergoes this type of scattering off supermassive black hole binaries at galactic centers, we demonstrate that the process can induce an observable modification of the slope of the Pulsar Timing Array spectrum. This opens up a new possibility to gain insights on the nature of dark matter from observations of low-frequency gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Quantum wormholes at spatial infinity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the interesting result that the two asymptotically flat Universes classically linked by the Einstein-Rosen bridge may also be quantum mechanically connected in their far out regions. This would be felt by the Newtonian potential far away from a black/white hole system, and raises the possibility of establishing communication via perturbations. We obtain our results by means of wavepackets with a small variance in the mass, solving the equations derived from a maximally symmetry-reduced canonical quantisation method. Mass and a proxy of the Newtonian potential appear as canonical duals, leading to a Heisenberg uncertainty relation between the two. Coherent states are then built, which become non-semiclassical only in two regions: asymptotic spatial infinity (where unitarity forces the packets to ''feel'' the other asymptotic spatial infinity), and inside the horizon at $r=Gm$ where there is ringing. Whilst the latter has been noted in the literature, the former -- the quantum wormhole -- seems to have eluded past scrutiny. Further studies are required to examine the stability of these conclusions beyond their symmetry-reduced test tube.</description>

Abstract: We recently studied spin precession in various stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes and applied it to the case of neutrinos propagating in those spacetimes. In this paper, the study of spin precession is extended to the case of a spinning particle propagating within the spacetime of a time-dependent gravitational plane wave. First, the angular velocity of spin precession of a particle propagating in a geodesic along an arbitrary direction relative to the gravitational wave is derived. Our general result is then used to derive the helicity flip probability for neutrinos freely propagating along such an arbitrary direction within the gravitational wave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the parametrization invariance of cosmological Lagrangians and their equivalence to systems describing the motion of particles in curved backgrounds, we identify the phase space analogue of the notion of proper time. We define the corresponding quantum operator, which results in being canonically conjugate to that of the vanishing Hamiltonian. In the context of particle dynamics, this leads to an uncertainty relation of the form $\Delta E_0 \,\Delta T \geq \hbar$, where $E_0$ is the rest energy of the particle. By studying the non-relativistic limit, we show that the action of the operator reduces to multiplication by the classical time coordinate. Finally, we derive the generic expression for the introduced time variable in the cosmological setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08267v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain the accretion, evaporation and superradiance phase diagram of astrophysical and primordial black holes in the mass range $10^{-33}-10^{11} \, M_\odot $. This black hole mass range corresponds to production of $10^{-21} - 10^{21}$ eV particles for superradiance (bosons) and evaporation (bosons and fermions). Only accretion and superradiance processes are relevant for heavy black holes, on the other hand for light black holes of primordial origin, all three processes can be relevant. We find that superradiance instability can happen even for black hole spin values as low as $10^{-9}-10^{-2}$. Since light black holes are very unstable to these perturbations and sensitive probes of bosonic particles, a single moderately spinning BH can probe 2-9 orders of magnitude of mass parameter space depending on the nature of the perturbations that are scalar (axion), vector (dark photon and/or photon with effective mass) and spin-2. If spinning black holes are observed and superradiance is not observed, possibly due to self-interactions, we find limits on the axion/scalar decay constant and energy density. We generalize these bounds for vector and spin-2 fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the first principles gauge theoretical construction of relativistic gapless fracton theory developed by A.~Blasi and N.~Maggiore. The difference is that, instead of considering a symmetric tensor field, we consider a vector field with a gauge group index, \emph{i.e.} the usual Einstein-Cartan variable used in the first order formalism of gravity. After discussing the most general quadratic action for this field, we explore the physical sectors contained in the model. Particularly, we show that the model contains not only linear gravity and fractons, but also ordinary Maxwell equations, suggesting an apparent electrically charged phase of, for instance, spin liquids and glassy dynamical systems. Moreover, by a suitable change of field variables, we recover the Blasi-Maggiore gauge model of fractons and linear gravity.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative quantum Yang--Mills at finite temperature beyond lattice: a Dyson--Schwinger approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a Dyson--Schwinger approach, we perform an analysis of the non-trivial ground state of thermal $SU(N)$ Yang--Mills theory in the non-perturbative regime where chiral symmetry is dynamically broken by a mass gap. Basic thermodynamic observables such as energy density and pressure are derived analytically, using Jacobi elliptic functions. The results are compared with lattice results. Good agreement is found at low temperatures, providing a viable scenario of a gas of massive glue states populating higher levels of the spectrum of the theory. At high temperatures a scenario without glue states consistent with a massive scalar field is observed, showing an interesting agreement with lattice data. The possibility is discussed that the results derived in this analysis open up a novel pathway beyond lattice to precision studies of phase transitions with false vacuum and cosmological relics that depend on the equations of state in strong coupled gauge theories of the type of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).</description>

      <title>Mirror-enhanced acceleration-induced geometric phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fulling-Davies-Unruh effect contains great amount of theoretical importance in various branches of physics. Requirement of very high acceleration hinders its experimental evidence. We put forward an idea to experimentally probe this effect by utilizing the Pancharatnam-Berry phase of an accelerated atom in presence of mirrors. We show that for much lower accelerations, the phase gets significantly enhanced in the presence of mirrors. We propose a schematic design of an interferometric set-up to experimentally capture this effect by utilizing the phase difference between an accelerated and an inertial atoms. For the choice of hydrogen atoms and suitable separation between atoms and mirrors, the required acceleration can be very low.</description>

      <title>Geometric measure of quantum complexity in cosmological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Nielsen's geometric approach to quantum complexity, the introduction of a suitable geometrical space, based on the Lie group formed by fundamental operators, facilitates the identification of complexity through geodesic distance in the group manifold. Earlier work has shown that the computation of geodesic distance can be challenging for Lie groups relevant to harmonic oscillators. Here, this problem is approached by working to leading order in an expansion by the structure constants of the Lie group. An explicit formula for an upper bound on the quantum complexity of a harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian with time-dependent frequency is derived. Applied to a massless test scalar field on a cosmological de Sitter background, the upper bound on complexity as a function of the scale factor exhibits a logarithmic increase on super-Hubble scales. This result aligns with the gate complexity and earlier studies of de Sitter complexity. It demonstrates the consistent application of Nielsen complexity to quantum fields in cosmological backgrounds and paves the way for further applications.</description>

      <title>The mass effect -- Variations of the electron mass and their impact on cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16845v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We summarize and explain the current status of time variations of the electron mass in cosmology, showing that such variations allow for significant easing of the Hubble tension, from the current $\sim5\sigma$ significance, down to between $3.4\sigma$ and $1.0\sigma$ significance, depending on the precise model and data. Electron mass variations are preferred by Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data in combination with the latest results on baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) and type Ia supernovae at a level of significance between $2\sigma$ and $3.6\sigma$ depending on the model and the data. This preference for a model involving an electron mass variation is neither tightly constrained from light element abundances generated during big bang nucleosynthesis nor from post-recombination observations using quasars and atomic clocks, though future data is expected to give strong evidence in favor of or against this model.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Early and Late Time Tensions with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility of accommodating both early and late-time tensions using a novel reinforcement learning technique. By applying this technique, we aim to optimize the evolution of the Hubble parameter from recombination to the present epoch, addressing both tensions simultaneously. To maximize the goodness of fit, our learning technique achieves a fit that surpasses even the $\Lambda$CDM model. Our results demonstrate a tendency to weaken both early and late time tensions in a completely model-independent manner.</description>

      <title>Exact d'Alembertian for Lorentz distance functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We refine a recent distributional notion of d'Alembertian of a signed Lorentz distance function to an achronal set in a metric measure spacetime obeying the timelike measure contraction property. We show precise representation formulas and comparison estimates (both upper and lower bounds). Under a condition we call "infinitesimally strict concavity" (known for infinitesimally Minkowskian structures and established here for Finsler spacetimes), we prove the associated distribution is a signed measure certifying the integration by parts formula. This treatment of the d'Alembertian using techniques from metric geometry expands upon its recent nonlinear yet elliptic interpretation; even in the smooth case, our formulas seem to pioneer its exact shape across the timelike cut locus. Two central ingredients our contribution unifies are the localization paradigm of Cavalletti-Mondino and the Sobolev calculus of Beran-Braun-Calisti-Gigli-McCann-Ohanyan-Rott-S\"amann.
  In the second part of our work, we present several applications of these insights. First, we show the equivalence of the timelike curvature-dimension condition with a Bochner-type inequality. Second, we set up synthetic mean curvature (as well as barriers for CMC sets) exactly. Third, we prove synthetic volume and area estimates of Heintze-Karcher-type, which enable us to show several synthetic volume singularity theorems.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlation between the curvature perturbations and magnetic fields in pure ultra slow roll inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the aim of producing significant number of primordial black holes, over the past few years, there has been a considerable interest in examining models of inflation involving a single, canonical field, that permit a brief period of ultra slow roll. Earlier, we had examined inflationary magnetogenesis - achieved by breaking the conformal invariance of the electromagnetic action through a coupling to the inflaton - in situations involving departures from slow roll. We had found that a transition from slow roll to ultra slow roll inflation can lead to a strong blue tilt in the spectrum of the magnetic field over small scales and also considerably suppress its strength over large scales. In this work, we consider the scenario of pure ultra slow roll inflation and show that scale invariant magnetic fields can be obtained in such situations with the aid of a non-conformal coupling function that depends on the kinetic energy of the inflaton. Apart from the power spectrum, an important probe of the primordial magnetic fields are the three-point functions, specifically, the cross-correlation between the curvature perturbations and the magnetic fields. We calculate the three-point cross-correlation between the curvature perturbations and the magnetic fields in pure ultra slow roll inflation for the new choice of the non-conformal coupling function. In particular, we examine the validity of the consistency condition that is expected to govern the three-point function in the squeezed limit and comment on the wider implications of the results we obtain.</description>

      <title>Holographic Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theories including a non-hydrodynamic mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theories for diffusion including the lowest non-hydrodynamic degree of freedom from holographic Gubser-Rocha systems. At low temperature the dynamical non-hydrodynamic mode could be either an IR mode or a slow mode, which is related to IR quantum critical excitations or encodes the information of all energy scales. This additional dynamical vector mode could be viewed as an ultraviolet sector of the diffusive hydrodynamic theory. We construct two different effective actions for each case and discuss their physical properties. In particular we show that the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger symmetry is preserved.</description>

      <title>Black hole pulsars and monster shocks as outcomes of black hole--neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The merger of a black hole (BH) and a neutron star (NS) in most cases is expected to leave no material around the remnant BH; therefore, such events are often considered as sources of gravitational waves without electromagnetic counterparts. However, a bright counterpart can emerge if the NS is strongly magnetized, as its external magnetosphere can experience radiative shocks and magnetic reconnection during/after the merger. We use magnetohydrodynamic simulations in the dynamical spacetime of a merging BH--NS binary to investigate its magnetospheric dynamics. We find that compressive waves excited in the magnetosphere develop into monster shocks as they propagate outward. After swallowing the NS, the BH acquires a magnetosphere that quickly evolves into a split monopole configuration and then undergoes an exponential decay (balding), enabled by magnetic reconnection and also assisted by the ring-down of the remnant BH. This spinning BH drags the split monopole into rotation, forming a transient pulsar-like state. It emits a striped wind if the swallowed magnetic dipole moment is inclined to the spin axis. We predict two types of transients from this scenario: (1) a fast radio burst emitted by the shocks as they expand to large radii and (2) an X/$\gamma$-ray burst emitted by the $e^\pm$ outflow heated by magnetic dissipation.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory on curved manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses how particle production from the vacuum can be explained by local analysis when the field theory is defined by differential geometry on curved manifolds. We have performed the local analysis in a mathematically rigorous way, respecting the Markov property. The exact WKB is used as a tool for extracting non-perturbative effect from the local system. After a serious application of the differential geometry and the exact WKB to particle production, we show that entanglement does not appear in the Unruh effect as far as the standard formulation by the differential geometry is valid. This result should not be attributed to a consistency problem between the ``entanglement state'' and the ``standard field theory by differential geometry'', but to the fact that the conventional calculation of the Unruh effect is done by extrapolation which is not consistent with the differential geometry. The situation is similar to that of the Dirac monopole, but topology is not relevant and the basis for building field theories in differential geometry is strongly involved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical observations of the cosmos allow us to probe extreme physics and answer foundational questions on our universe. Modern astronomy is increasingly operating under a holistic approach, probing the same question with multiple diagnostics including how sources vary over time, how they appear across the electromagnetic spectrum, and through their other signatures, including gravitational waves, neutrinos, cosmic rays, and dust on Earth. Astrophysical observations are now reaching the point where approximate physics models are insufficient. Key sources of interest are explosive transients, whose understanding requires multidisciplinary studies at the intersection of astrophysics, gravity, nuclear science, plasma physics, fluid dynamics and turbulence, computation, particle physics, atomic, molecular, and optical science, condensed matter and materials science, radiation transport, and high energy density physics. This white paper provides an overview of the major scientific advances that lay at the intersection of physics and astronomy and are best probed through time-domain and multimessenger astrophysics, an exploration of how multidisciplinary science can be fostered, and introductory descriptions of the relevant scientific disciplines and key astrophysical sources of interest.</description>

      <title>Spin precession and neutrino helicity flip in various spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically study spin precession of neutral particles freely moving in spacetime. We first derive the formula describing spin precession within a general stationary and axisymmetric spacetime. We then apply our formula to study spin precession of neutral spinning particles moving within various spacetimes that are among the most ubiquitous ones found in the literature. Our results are then used to extract the helicity flip probability for neutrinos propagating in each one of those selected spacetimes. It is found that low-energy neutrinos acquire a spin-flip probability that is as large as unity in all the spacetimes considered here. The remarkable result, however, is that while spin-flip probability for high-energy neutrinos remains insignificant in most of these spacetimes, some of them do allow spin-flip probability to reach unity even for high-energy neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Gauge preservation in renormalization for Yang-Mills and gravity theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work, multiplicative renormalization \cite{dixon} for Yang-Mills theories is reviewed. While this subject is not new, it is suggested that a clear understanding of these methods leads to a systematic way for interpreting the counter terms needed for non multiplicative renormalization of quantum gravity, for models such as \cite{dewitt}-\cite{stelle2}. These models are renormalizable but contain apparent instabilities leading to possible unitarity loss, an earlier analog is \cite{pais}. This systematic may be interesting, especially in the modern context, since there are efforts for avoiding with those apparent instabilities by employing variants of the standard quantization methods \cite{mannheim1}-\cite{salve}.</description>
