      <title>New Models of Jupiter's Magnetopause and Bow Shock through the $Juno$ Prime Mission: Probabilistic Location, Shape, and Internally-driven Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between Jupiter's magnetosphere and the solar wind is not well-constrained: while internal energetic plasma processes are thought to dominate plasma circulation, the solar wind nonetheless exerts significant control over the shape and scale of the whole structure. To better constrain this interaction, we derive new functional forms for Jupiter's magnetopause and bow shock using data from the $Ulysses$, $Galileo$, $Cassini$, and $Juno$ missions and calibrated solar wind estimates from the Multi-Model Ensemble System for the Heliosphere (MMESH). We design an empirical Bayesian model to estimate the locations of the boundaries using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, expanding our model to sample all times, not only boundary crossing events. The boundary surfaces which best describe the data are thus estimated without the need for a full, physics-based magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) treatment of the Jovian magnetosphere and the additional assumptions required for such. The new magnetopause model exhibits significant polar flattening and dawn-dusk asymmetry, and includes a narrowing of the magnetotail when compared to previous models. The new bow shock model is largely axisymmetric. Both boundary models describe surfaces which lie closer to Jupiter than previous models, which has important implications for the modern picture of Jupiter's dynamic magnetosphere and the expected science results of current and upcoming Jupiter-bound spacecraft. Applying these models to $Juno$'s trajectory, we estimate that the spacecraft should be expected to spend ${\sim}19\%$ of each orbit in the magnetosheath and ${\sim}4\%$ of each orbit in the solar wind starting from Perijove 64 (PJ64, 21 July 2021).</description>

      <title>Density fluctuation-Mach number scaling in compressible, high plasma beta turbulence: in-situ space observations and high-Reynolds number simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of compressible fluctuations in a broad range of turbulent plasmas, from the intracluster medium to the solar wind, has been an active field of research in the past decades. Theoretical frameworks for weakly compressible MHD turbulence in an inhomogeneous background magnetic field predict a linear scaling of the normalized mass density fluctuation ($\delta \rho / \rho_0$), as a function of the turbulent Mach number ($\mathcal{M}_t$), $\delta \rho / \rho_0 \propto \mathcal{M}_t$. However, so far the scaling relation has been tested only using moderate to low plasma beta ($\beta \lesssim 1$) solar wind observational data where the compressibility is weak $\delta \rho / \rho_0 \sim 0.1$. Here, we combine NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission data in Earth's magnetosheath, where $\beta \sim 10$ is high, and $\beta \sim 1$ highly-compressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulations at unprecedented resolutions. Both show that $\delta \rho / \rho_0 \propto \mathcal{M}_t$ holds across a broad range of $\delta \rho / \rho_0$, $\mathcal{M}_t$ and $\beta$, demonstrating that $\delta \rho / \rho_0 \propto \mathcal{M}_t$ is a robust compressible turbulence relation, going beyond the asymptotics of the weakly compressible theory. We discuss the findings in the context of understanding the nature of strongly compressible turbulent fluctuations and the driving parameter in astrophysical and space plasmas.</description>

      <title>Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe: Multi-viewpoint messengers of the inner heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NASA's Parker Solar Probe and ESA/NASA's Solar Orbiter are encounter missions that are currently both in their nominal science phases, venturing closer to the Sun than ever before. These complementary spacecraft are operating together in order to combine in situ measurements of solar wind plasma in the inner heliosphere with high-resolution remote sensing observations of their source regions in the solar atmosphere. This paper highlights the synergetic science that these multi-viewpoint messengers of the inner heliosphere enable and how they are working together to significantly advance our understanding of the physical processes that are important for solar wind formation, the eruption of coronal mass ejections and their space weather effects.</description>

      <title>An assessment of observational coverage and gaps for robust Sun to heliosphere integrated science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the generation and development of the continuous outflow from the Sun requires tracing the physical conditions from deep in the corona to the heliosphere. Detailed global observations of plasma state variables and the magnetic field are needed to provide critical constraints to the underlying physics driving models of the corona and solar wind. Key diagnostics of the solar wind require measurements at its formation site and during its outflow to continuously track it across rapidly changing regions of space. A unified view of the solar wind is only possible through coordinated remote and in situ observations that probe these different regions. Here, we discuss current observational coverage and gaps of different plasma properties and review recent coordinated studies. We highlight how these efforts may become more routine with the launch of upcoming and planned missions.</description>
