      <title>Continued activity of the 25th cycle: largest in 20 years. Ground-level enhancement and Forbush decrease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After a very calm 24th solar activity cycle, the 25th cycle has already seen several interesting events. A Ground Level Enhancement GLE77 was observed on 11 November 2025 following an X5.1 class solar flare. A strong Forbush decrease occurred on 19 and 20 January 2026 during one of the most intense geomagnetic storms of Solar Cycle 25. Events were recorded coherently by the global neutron monitor network and by SEVAN detectors at multiple altitudes. Using spectrometric capabilities, we reconstruct energy spectra of missing neutrons and muons during the FD and compare them with corresponding spectra measured during GLE77. The analysis demonstrates that FD and GLE signatures are intrinsically asymmetric. FDs selectively suppress the preexisting galactic cosmic ray population, whereas GLEs introduce an additional, harder particle component. Neutron and muon channels exhibit markedly different spectral behavior, particularly at higher deposited energies, reflecting their sensitivity to different primary energy ranges. These results show that combined NM and SEVAN observations provide robust, complementary diagnostics of rigidity dependent cosmic ray modulation during extreme heliospheric disturbances.</description>

      <title>Spread/Error relationship and spatial error structure of precipitation ensemble nowcasting: Comparison of STEPS and generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The predictability of the generative AI-based nowcasting model LDCast (trained on another region) is evaluated over Belgium, together with the pysteps implementation of the nowcasting algorithm STEPS. STEPS and LDCast are slightly underdispersive, but the ensemble spread provides an estimation of the error at almost all scales. Both models adapt the properties of their ensembles to the type of event, either convective or stratiform. The spatial scores of the STEPS and LDCast ensembles are compared with those of surrogate ensembles having some key properties, revealing that both STEPS and LDCast have very little ability to spatially localise the ensemble mean error vector through their ensemble members. This suggests that the content of STEPS and LDCast ensembles is informative in terms of statistics, but not in terms of dynamics.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Rays as an Interdisciplinary Earth Observation Tool: From Particle Physics and Atmospheric Processes to Geosciences and Urban Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of cosmic rays, which are high-energy particles originate from space and the atmosphere, has historically been associated with particle physics and astrophysics. In the last 20 years, these particles have evolved into valuable tools for observing Earth's systems. This review compiles the use of cosmic rays in three primary areas: (1) particle physics and atmospheric processes, which include cosmic-ray-induced cascades, ionization, and their impact on atmospheric chemistry and radiation; (2) geosciences, where cosmogenic radionuclides assist in the dating of geological materials and cosmic-ray neutrons are used for large-scale monitoring of soil moisture and snow water equivalents; and (3) urban science, where cosmic-ray muons are employed for non-invasive subsurface imaging and, when paired with distributed sensors, serve as the basis for smart city monitoring. The review places particular emphasis on integrating these methods with remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS), which helps close the persistent scale gap between point measurements and satellite observations, thereby enabling three-dimensional digital representations of subsurfaces. The review concludes by discussing the data standards, their integration into operational Earth observation workflows, and future research directions.</description>

      <title>OLB: An Open Lora Buoy for Coastal Water Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Oceanographic instrumentation technology is currently under rapid transition towards increasingly open-source technology. Open-source buoys compete with commercial and closed-source buoys both in price, functionality and availability. Long-range radio (LoRa) is a communication technology which is inexpensive both in terms of data transfer cost and power without the need for pre-existing infrastructure. In this paper, we present OLB, an open-source drifter buoy using LoRa for coastal water measurements. OLB is designed to be reliable, low-cost, modifiable and power efficient. We present validation experiments demonstrating that OLB can achieve a radio telemetry range of more than 2 kilometres, and has an expected battery lifetime of up to seven months. Finally, we discuss the role and contribution of OLB in the space of open-source instrumentation and ocean modelling.</description>
