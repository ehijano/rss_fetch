      <title>Synthesis and anisotropic magnetism of singlecrystalline GdPt2Si2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single crystals of GdPt$_2$Si$_2$ were grown using the Sn flux method, crystallizing in the CaBe$_2$Ge$_2$-type tetragonal structure with space group $P4/nmm$. Electrical resistivity, specific heat, and magnetization data revealed the presence of a double magnetic transition with $T_N \approx 8.4$~K and $T_0 \approx 6.8$~K. Analysis of the specific heat data suggest amplitude-modulated and equal-moment antiferromagnetic orderings, respectively. Field-induced magnetization and magnetic susceptibility data show a metamagnetic transition in the $H \parallel a$ direction at 2~K, as well as the suppression of the magnetic transition located at $T_0$ with increasing external magnetic field. Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) shows the Gd$^{3+}$ resonance followed by a small second resonance. Peak-to-peak linewidth ($\Delta H_{pp}$) analysis reveals slight broadening at $T \sim 120$~K, indicating an increase in magnetic fluctuations at high temperatures. Ferromagnetic (FM) local polarization at high temperatures is also observed through the $g$-factor analysis, which shows a notable positive shift ($\Delta g$). Our results establish the fundamental physical properties of this material to aid in further understanding of the magnetism in the RPt$_2$Si$_2$ series and related non-centrosymmetric systems.</description>

      <title>Defect-Mediated Pairing and Dissociation of Strongly Correlated Electrons in Low Dimensional Lattices: The Quantum Taxi Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of a strongly correlated electron pair in a one-dimensional lattice, focusing on the occurrence of local dissociation/pairing mechanisms induced by a site energy defect. To this end, we simulate the time evolution of two interacting electrons on a finite-size chain governed by an extended Hubbard Hamiltonian including on-site Coulomb repulsion $ U $ and nearest-neighbor interaction $V$, along with single-electron hopping $J$. By introducing a local site energy defect with amplitude $ \Delta $, we show that a transition between spatially paired/dissociated electrons can occur in the vicinity of this site. Such mechanisms arise in a strongly correlated regime with non-zero nearest neighbor Coulomb interactions and under the conditions $ (U \sim V \sim \Delta) \gg J$. To rationalize these phenomena, we reformulate the two-electron dynamics of the original Hubbard chain as an effective single-particle problem on a two-dimensional network. Within this framework, we show that the pairing/dissociation dynamics are driven by resonances between two distinct families of two-electron eigenstates: $(i)$ states with two spatially well-separated electrons with one located at the site defect, and $(ii)$ states with locally bound electron located away from the defect. At resonance, these states hybridize, allowing transitions from locally paired to dissociated electrons (and vice versa) in the vicinity of the defect. These results provide new insights into exotic pairing phenomena in strongly correlated electronic systems and may have implications for the design of tunable many-body states in low-dimensional quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Exciton condensation of composite fermions in double layer quantum Hall systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fractional quantum Hall states in double layer systems that can be interpreted as exciton condensates of composite fermions. An electron in one layer is dressed by two fluxes from the same layer and two fluxes from the other layer to become composite fermions that form effective Landau levels. It is found that two types of composite fermion exciton condensates could occur. In the first type ones, all effective levels are partially occupied and excitonic correlations are present between composite fermions in the same effective level. In the second type ones, composite fermions in the topmost effective levels of the two layers form exciton condensate whereas those in lower effective levels are independent. The electric transport signatures of these states are analyzed. We demonstrate using numerical calculations that some composite fermion exciton condensates can be realized in microscopic models that are relevant for graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides. For a fixed total filling factor, an exciton condensate may only be realized when the electron densities in the two layers belong to a certain range. It is possible that two types of states appear at the same total filling factor in different ranges. These results shed light on recent experimental observations and also suggest some promising future directions.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and inhomogeneous charge-ordered state in the two-Dimensional Hubbard model -- Off-Diagonal Wave Function Monte Carlo Studies of Hubbard Model IV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state properties of the two-dimensional Hubbard model, based on the off-diagonal wave function variational Monte Carlo method. We use an optimized wave function that is improved from an initial one-body wave function by multiplying by multiple correlation operators that are given by the form of exp($-S$)-type where $S$ is a suitable operator. We examine the inhomogeneous ground state at near 1/8 doping in the strongly correlated region where the on-site Coulomb interaction is larger than the bandwidth. The $d$-wave superconductivity with a spatially oscillating gap function can coexist with the charge ordering in the ground state without magnetic ordering, and superconducting condensation energy increases by this coexistence. We also show the $d$-wave pair correlation function as a function of lattice sites. The correlation function indicates that the long-range superconducting order indeed exists, and also that the strong electron correlation suppresses the pair correlation function.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing 2D symmetry protected topological states via mixed state anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases are short-range entangled quantum states characterized by anomalous edge behavior, a manifestation of the bulk-boundary correspondence for topological phases. Moreover, the Li-Haldane conjecture posits that the entanglement spectrum exhibits the same anomaly as the physical edge spectrum, thereby serving as an entanglement-based fingerprint for identifying topological phases. In this work, we extend the entanglement-based diagnostic tools by demonstrating that the edge anomaly is manifested not only in the entanglement spectrum but also in the reduced density matrix itself, a phenomenon we refer to as the mixed state anomaly. Focusing on the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ SPT phase, we show that this anomaly is subtly encoded in symmetry-twisted mixed states, leading to a topological contribution to the disorder parameter beyond the area law, as well as a spontaneous-symmetry-breaking type long-range order when time reversal symmetry is present.</description>

      <title>Computing and compressing local vertex functions in imaginary and real frequencies from the multipoint numerical renormalization group using quantics tensor cross interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multipoint numerical renormalization group (mpNRG) is a powerful impurity solver that provides accurate spectral data useful for computing local, dynamic correlation functions in imaginary or real frequencies non-perturbatively across a wide range of interactions and temperatures. It gives access to a local, non-perturbative four-point vertex in imaginary and real frequencies, which can be used as input for subsequent computations such as diagrammatic extensions of dynamical mean--field theory. However, computing and manipulating the real-frequency four-point vertex on large, dense grids quickly becomes numerically challenging when the density and/or the extent of the frequency grid is increased. In this paper, we compute four-point vertices in a strongly compressed quantics tensor train format using quantics tensor cross interpolation, starting from discrete partial spectral functions obtained from mpNRG. This enables evaluations of the vertex on frequency grids with resolutions far beyond the reach of previous implementations. We benchmark this approach on the four-point vertex of the single-impurity Anderson model across a wide range of physical parameters, both in its full form and its asymptotic decomposition. For imaginary frequencies, the full vertex can be represented to an accuracy on the order of $2\cdot 10^{-3}$ with maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 120. The more complex full real-frequency vertex requires maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 170 for an accuracy of $\lesssim 2\%$. Our work marks another step toward tensor-train-based diagrammatic calculations for correlated electronic lattice models starting from a local, non-perturbative mpNRG vertex.</description>

      <title>Excitations and dynamical structure factor of $J_1-J_2$ spin-$3/2$ and spin-$5/2$ Heisenberg spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamical structure factor of the frustrated spin-$3/2$ $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg chains, with particular focus on the partially dimerized phase that emerges between two Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Using a valence bond solid ansatz corroborated by density matrix renormalization group simulations, we investigate the nature of magnon and spinon excitations through the single-mode approximation. We show that the magnon develops an incommensurate dispersion at $J_2 \approx 0.32J_1$, while the spinons, viewed as domain walls between degenerate valence bond solid states, become incommensurate at $J_2 \approx 0.4J_1$ beyond the Lifshitz point ($J_2 \approx 0.388J_1$). The dynamical structure factor exhibits rich spectral features shaped by the interplay between these excitations, with magnons appearing as resonances embedded in the spinon continuum. The spinon gap shows a nonmonotonic behavior, reaching a peak near the center of the partially dimerized phase and closing at the boundaries, suggesting the appearance of a floating phase as a result of the condensation of incommensurate spinons. Comparative analysis with the spin-$5/2$ case confirms the universality of these phenomena across half-integer higher-spin systems. Our results provide detailed insight into how fractionalization and incommensurate condensation govern the spectral properties of frustrated spin chains, offering a unified picture across different spin magnitudes.</description>

      <title>Compact representation and long-time extrapolation of real-time data for quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representing real-time data as a sum of complex exponentials provides a compact form that enables both denoising and extrapolation. As a fully data-driven method, the Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Techniques (ESPRIT) algorithm is agnostic to the underlying physical equations, making it broadly applicable to various observables and experimental or numerical setups. In this work, we consider applications of the ESPRIT algorithm primarily to extend real-time dynamical data from simulations of quantum systems. We evaluate ESPRIT's performance in the presence of noise and compare it to other extrapolation methods. We demonstrate its ability to extract information from short-time dynamics to reliably predict long-time behavior and determine the minimum time interval required for accurate results. We discuss how this insight can be leveraged in numerical methods that propagate quantum systems in time, and show how ESPRIT can predict infinite-time values of dynamical observables, offering a purely data-driven approach to characterizing quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Universal Spreading of Nonstabilizerness and Quantum Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how transport properties of $U(1)$-conserving dynamics impact the growth of quantum resources characterizing the complexity of many-body states. We quantify wave-function delocalization using participation entropy (PE), a measure rooted in the coherence theory of pure states, and assess nonstabilizerness through stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE). Focusing on the XXZ spin chain initialized in domain-wall state, we demonstrate universal power-law growth of both PE and SRE, with scaling exponents explicitly reflecting the underlying transport regimes, ballistic, diffusive, or KPZ-type superdiffusive. Our results establish a solid connection between quantum resources and transport, providing insights into the dynamics of complexity within symmetry-constrained quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic echo protocols for robust quantum many-body state preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entangled many-body states are a key resource for quantum technologies. Yet their preparation through analog control of interacting quantum systems is often hindered by experimental imperfections. Here, we introduce the adiabatic echo protocol, a general approach to state preparation designed to suppress the effect of static perturbations. We provide an analytical understanding of its robustness in terms of dynamically engineered destructive interference. By applying quantum optimal control methods, we demonstrate that such a protocol emerges naturally in a variety of settings, without requiring assumptions on the form of the control fields. Examples include Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state preparation in Ising spin chains and two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays, as well as the generation of quantum spin liquid states in frustrated Rydberg lattices. Our results highlight the broad applicability of this protocol, providing a practical framework for reliable many-body state preparation in present-day quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Model on a Spin-Frustrated Kagome Lattice with the Contextual Subspace Variational Quantum Eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the ground state properties of a candidate quantum spin liquid using a superconducting Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) device. Specifically, we study the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a Kagome lattice, a geometrically frustrated structure that gives rise to a highly degenerate energy spectrum. To successfully simulate this system, we employ a qubit reduction strategy leveraging the Contextual Subspace methodology, significantly reducing the problem size prior to execution on the quantum device. We improve the quality of these subspaces by using the wavefunctions obtained from low bond dimension Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) calculations to bias the subspace stabilizers through a symplectic approximate symmetry generator extraction algorithm. Reducing the Hamiltonian size allows us to implement tiled circuit ensembles and deploy the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to estimate the ground state energy. We adopt a hybrid quantum error mitigation strategy combining Readout Error Mitigation (REM), Symmetry Verification (SV) and Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE). This approach yields high-accuracy energy estimates, achieving error rates on the order of 0.01% and thus demonstrating the potential of near-term quantum devices for probing frustrated quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of the frustrated decorated Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Kramers-Wannier transfer matrix method we studied several decorated Ising chains. The exact expressions for thermodynamic characteristics, including the ground state characteristics, were obtained. We considered a number of modeling chains with different signs and absolute values of exchange constants for the nearest- and the next-nearest neighbors. For these models we calculated the magnetization curves. The critical values of magnetic fields and corresponding magnetization plateau parameters were obtained. Analytic expressions for the ground state entropy were obtained for the chains with different interaction constants. The dependencies of the number of states with minimum energy (the degeneration of the ground state) as the function of the number of particles were found. It was shown that these dependencies are expressed in terms of well-known numerical sequences - Lucas numbers and Pell numbers, which, in the limit of a large number of particles, are proportional to the powers of the golden and silver sections. Therefore, the ground state entropy (per particle) of the systems under consideration can be described in terms of these sections and, therefore, is nonzero.</description>

      <title>Beyond Dicke superradiance: Universal scaling of the peak emission rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum optics, superradiance is a phenomenon in which a system of $N$ fully excited quantum emitters radiate intense flashes of light during collective decay. However, computing its peak intensity for many spatially separated emitters remained challenging due to the exponential growth of the underlying Hilbert space with system size $N$. Derived from exact numerics, we present an analytically compact and easily computable formula for the peak photon emission rate of fully excited quantum emitter systems undergoing superradiant decay. The result applies to emitter configurations in any geometry and reveals a universal behavior: spatially extended quantum systems have a geometry-dependent optimal emitter number and always reach a peak photon emission rate that increases only linearly with $N$. Our results encompass quantum systems ranging from cold atomic gases and neutral-atom arrays to molecular aggregates and solid-state materials.</description>

      <title>Role of topotactic hydrogen in Superconductivity of Infinite-layer Nickelate NdNiO$_{2}$: A first-principles and variational Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing combination of first-principles calculations, low-energy model construction, and variational Monte Carlo solution of the ab-initio derived Hubbard model, we study the effect of hydrogenation in the electronic structure and superconducting properties of infinite-layer nickelate, NdNiO$_2$. We find that the introduction of hydrogen at the apical oxygen vacancy position strongly influences the Wannier function corresponding to the effective interstitial orbital at the Ni site bound to the hydrogen. This results in the near disappearance of the electron pocket at the $k_z$ = $\pi$ Fermi surface, keeping that of $k_z$ = 0 unchanged, compared to the dehydrogenated case. The two-band model thus remains valid even in the presence of H. The calculated superconducting order parameters both in absence and presence of H, show a two-hump superconductivity arising the two overlapping domes, one arising from $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ and another arising from interstitial orbital degree of freedom. Hydrogenation strengthens the latter, marginally affecting the former.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Superfluid Density in Pair-Density-Wave Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the superfluid density $n_s(T)$ of pair-density-wave (PDW) superconductors; this determines where they are unstable and establishes signatures of their unusual order. Here we compute $n_s(T)$ for the 2D unidirectional PDW superconducting phases that emerge from a microscopic model (with nearest neighbor attraction). With gapped and gapless bands in the Bogoliubov quasiparticle dispersion, this theory provides self-consistently determined wavevectors \(\mathbf{Q}\) for the spatially modulated pairing. We report a negative $n_s$ for a significant fraction of the purportedly physical phase diagram. Independent of the microscopic model, we can generally understand that the implied instability in these superconductors arises from the variationally large \(|\mathbf{Q}|\). In the stable regime, the finite-temperature superfluid density \(n_s(T)\) displays unusual temperature dependences originating from the gapless Bogoliubov bands which reflect Van Hove-singularity-induced Sommerfeld contributions. These gapless bands, as well as the negative contributions from the Higgs mode, additionally lead to an anomalously small (highly anisotropic) superfluid density. This will then yield an unexpectedly large finite-frequency weight in the optical conductivity.</description>

      <title>Significant role of first-principles electron-phonon coupling in the electronic and thermoelectric properties of LiZnAs and ScAgC semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The half-Heusler (hH) compounds are currently considered promising thermoelectric (TE) materials due to their favorable thermopower and electrical conductivity. Accurate estimates of these properties are therefore highly desirable and require a detailed understanding of the microscopic mechanisms that govern transport. To enable such estimations, we carry out comprehensive first-principles computations of one of the primary factors limiting carrier transport, namely the electron-phonon ($e-ph$) interaction, in representative hH semiconductors such as LiZnAs and ScAgC. Our study first investigates the $e-ph$ renormalization of electronic dispersion based on the non-adiabatic Allen-Heine-Cardona theory. We then solve the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) under multiple relaxation-time approximations (RTAs) to evaluate the carrier transport properties. Phonon-limited electron and hole mobilities are comparatively assessed using the linearized self-energy and momentum RTAs (SERTA and MRTA), and the exact or iterative BTE (IBTE) solutions within $e-ph$ coupling. Electrical transport coefficients for TE performance are also comparatively analyzed under the constant RTA (CRTA), SERTA, and MRTA schemes. The lattice thermal conductivity, determined from phonon-phonon interaction, is further reduced through nanostructuring techniques. The bulk LiZnAs (ScAgC) compound achieves the highest figure of merit ($zT$) of 1.05 (0.78) at 900 K with an electron doping concentration of 10$^{18}$ (10$^{19}$) cm$^{-3}$ under the MRTA scheme. This value significantly increases to 1.53 (1.0) for a 20 nm nanostructured sample. The remarkably high $zT$ achieved through inherently present phonon-induced electron scattering and the grain-boundary effect in semiconductors opens a promising path for discovering highly efficient and accurate hH materials for TE technology.</description>

      <title>Observing the Birth of Rydberg Exciton Fermi Polarons on a Moire Fermi Sea</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical spectra of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are dominated by tightly bound excitons and trions. In the low doping limit, trions are often described as three-body quasiparticles consisting of two electrons and one hole or vice versa. However, trions are more rigorously understood as quasiparticles arising from the interaction between an exciton and excitation of the Fermi sea - referred to as exciton Fermi polaron. Here we employ pump-probe spectroscopy to directly observe the formation of exciton Fermi polarons in a model system composed of a WSe2 monolayer adjacent to twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG). Following the pump-injection of Rydberg excitons in WSe2, a time-delayed probe pulse tracks the development of Rydberg exciton Fermi polarons as interactions with localized carriers in the tBLG moire superlattice evolve. Both the exciton Fermi polaron relaxation rate and binding energy are found to increase with electron or hole density. Our findings provide insight into the optical response of fundamental excitations in 2D Van der Waals systems and reveal how many-body interactions give rise to emergent quasiparticles.</description>

Abstract: Chiral phonons, circularly polarized lattice vibrations carrying intrinsic angular momentum, offer unprecedented opportunities for controlling heat flow, manipulating quantum states through spin-phonon coupling, and realizing exotic transport phenomena. Despite their fundamental importance, a universal framework for identifying and classifying these elusive excitations has remained out of reach. Here, we address this challenge by establishing a comprehensive symmetry-based theory that systematically classifies the helicity and the velocity-angular momentum tensor underlying phonon magnetization in thermal transport across all 230 crystallographic space groups. Our approach, grounded in fundamental representations of phononic angular momentum, reveals three distinct classes of crystals: achiral crystals with vanishing angular momentum, chiral crystals with s-wave helicity, and achiral crystals exhibiting higher-order helicity patterns beyond the s-wave. By performing high-throughput computations and symmetry analysis of the dynamical matrices for 11614 crystalline compounds, we identified 2738 materials exhibiting chiral phonon modes and shortlisted the 170 most promising candidates for future experimental investigation. These results are compiled into an open-access Chiral Phonon Materials Database website, enabling rapid screening for materials with desired chiral phonon properties. Our theoretical framework transcends phonons--it provides a universal paradigm for classifying chiral excitations in crystalline lattices, from magnons to electronic quasiparticles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.08587v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a computational framework to identify Hamiltonians of interacting quantum many-body systems that host non-ergodic excited states. We combine quantum Monte Carlo simulations with the recently proposed eigenstate-to-Hamiltonian construction, which maps the ground state of a specified parent Hamiltonian to a single non-ergodic excited state of a new derived Hamiltonian. This engineered Hamiltonian contains non-trivial, systematically-obtained, and emergent features that are responsible for its non-ergodic properties. We demonstrate this approach by applying it to quantum many-body scar states where we discover a previously unreported family of Hamiltonians with spatially oscillating spin exchange couplings that host scar-like properties, including revivals in the quantum dynamics, and towers in the inverse participation ratio; and to many-body localization, where we find a two-dimensional Hamiltonian with correlated disorder that exhibits non-ergodic scaling of the participation entropy and inverse participation ratios of order unity. The method can be applied to other known ground states to discover new quantum many-body systems with non-ergodic excited states.</description>

Abstract: We provide an intuitive understanding of the collective low-energy spin excitation of the one-dimensional spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain, known as the spinon. To this end, we demonstrate how a single spinon can be excited by adding one extra spin to the ground state. This procedure accurately reproduces all key features of the spinon's dispersion. These follow from the vanishing norm of the excited state which is triggered by the ground state entanglement. Next, we show that the spinon dispersion can be approximately reproduced if we replace the true ground state with the simplest valence-bond solid. This proves that the spinon of the one-dimensional Heisenberg model can be understood as a single spin flowing through a valence-bond solid.</description>

      <title>Minimal Fractional Topological Insulator in half-filled conjugate moir\'{e} Chern bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a "minimal" fractional topological insulator (mFTI), motivated by the recent experimental report on the signatures of FTI at total filling factor $\nu_{\rm tot} = 3$ in a transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'{e} system. The observed FTI at $\nu_{\rm tot} = 3$ is likely given by a topological state living in a pair of half-filled conjugate Chern bands with Chern numbers $C=\pm 1$ on top of another pair of fully-filled conjugate Chern bands. We propose the mFTI as a strong candidate topological state in the half-filled conjugate Chern bands. The mFTI is characterized by the following features: (1) It is a fully gapped topological order (TO) with 16 Abelian anyons if the electron is considered trivial (32 including electrons); (2) the minimally-charged anyon carries electric charge $e^\ast = e/2$, together with the fractional quantum spin-Hall conductivity, implying the robustness of the mFTI's gapless edge state whenever time-reversal symmetry and charge conversation are present; (3) the mFTI is "minimal" in the sense that it has the smallest total quantum dimension (a metric for the TO's complexity) within all the TOs that can potentially be realized at the same electron filling and with the same Hall transports; the mFTI is also the unique one that respects time-reversal symmetry. (4) the mFTI is the common descendant of multiple valley-decoupled "product TOs" with larger quantum dimensions. It can also be viewed as the result of gauging multiple symmetry-protected topological states. Similar mFTIs can be constructed for a pair of $1/q$-filled conjugate Chern bands. We classify the mFTIs via the stability of the gapless interfaces between them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10273v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy has been a powerful tool for analyzing phases and criticality in pure ground states via quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). However, mixed-state entanglement, relevant to systems with dissipation, finite temperature, and disjoint regions, remains less explored due to the lack of efficient numerical methods. In this work, we present a practical and easy-to-implement QMC method within the reweight-annealing framework, enabling efficient computation of the entanglement R\'enyi negativity (RN) by tracking its variation along given parameter paths. This method is scalable, parallelizable, and well-suited for high-dimensional and large-scale simulations. Applying it to diverse scenarios-including 1D and 2D systems, ground and thermal states, and bipartite and tripartite partitions, not only the information of the underlying conformal field theory is achieved, but the role of entanglement in quantum and thermal phase transitions is revealed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of high-intensity ultrashort laser pulses unlocks the potential of pump-probe spectroscopy in sub-femtosecond timescale. Notably, subcycle pump pulses can generate electronic states unreachable by conventional multicycle pulses, leading to a phenomenon that we refer to as subcycle-pulse engineering. In this study, we employ the time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group method to unveil the transient absorption spectra of superconducting and metallic states in nearly half-filled one-dimensional and two-dimensional Hubbard models excited by an ultrashort half-cycle pulse, which can induce a current with inversion-symmetry breaking. In a superconducting state realized in attractive on-site interactions, we find the transient activation of absorptions at energies corresponding to the amplitude modes of superconducting and charge-density-wave states. On the other hand, in a metallic state realized in the two-dimensional model with repulsive on-site interactions, we obtain another type of absorption enhancements, which are distributed broadly in spin excitation energies. These findings indicate that superconducting and metallic states are sensitive to an ultrashort half-cycle pulse, leading to the transient activations of optical absorptions with their respective mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on high-throughput screening and experimental data, we find that CeCo$_2$P$_2$ is unique in heavy-fermion materials: it has a Kondo effect at a high temperature which is nonetheless below a Co-antiferromagnetic ordering temperature. This begs the question: how is the Kondo singlet formed? \emph{All} other magnetic Kondo materials do not first form magnetism on the atoms whose electrons are supposed to screen the local moments. We theoretically explain these observations and show the multifaceted uniqueness of CeCo$_2$P$_2$: a playground for Kondo, magnetism, flat band, and topological physics. At high temperatures, the itinerant Co $c$ electrons of the system form non-atomic bands with a narrow bandwidth, leading to a high antiferromagnetic transition temperature. We show that the quantum geometry of the bands promotes in-plane ferromagnetism, while the weak dispersion along the $z$ direction facilitates out-of-plane antiferromagnetism. At low temperatures, we uncover a novel phase that manifests the coexistence of Co-antiferromagnetism and the Kondo effect, linked to the $P\cdot T$-protected Kramers' doublets and the filling-enforced metallic nature of $c$ electrons in the antiferromagnetic phase. Subsequently, the emergence of the Kondo effect, in cooperation with glide-mirror-$z$ symmetry, creates nodal-line excitation near the Fermi energy. Our results emphasize the importance of lattice symmetry and quantum geometry, Kondo physics, and magnetism in the understanding of the correlation physics of this unique compound. We also test our theory on the structurally similar compound LaCo$_2$P$_2$ and show how we are able to understand its vastly different phase diagram.</description>

Abstract: The attention mechanism has transformed artificial intelligence research by its ability to learn relations between objects. In this work, we explore how a many-body wavefunction ansatz constructed from a large-parameter self-attention neural network can be used to solve the interacting electron problem in solids. By a systematic neural-network variational Monte Carlo study on a moir\'e quantum material, we demonstrate that the self-attention ansatz provides an accurate and efficient solution without human bias. Moreover, our numerical study finds that the required number of variational parameters scales roughly as $N^2$ with the number of electrons, which opens a path towards efficient large-scale simulations.</description>

      <title>Leveraging recurrence in neural network wavefunctions for large-scale simulations of Heisenberg antiferromagnets: the square lattice</title>

Abstract: Machine-learning-based variational Monte Carlo simulations are a promising approach for targeting quantum many-body ground states, especially in two dimensions and in cases where the ground state is known to have a non-trivial sign structure. While many state-of-the-art variational energies have been reached with these methods for finite-size systems, little work has been done to use these results to extract information about the target state in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we employ recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a variational ans\"{a}tze, and leverage their recurrent nature to simulate the ground states of progressively larger systems through iterative retraining. This transfer learning technique allows us to simulate spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems on lattices with more than 1,000 spins without beginning optimization from scratch for each system size, thus reducing the demands for computational resources. In this study, we focus on the square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, where it is possible to carefully benchmark our results. We show that we are able to systematically improve the accuracy of the results from our simulations by increasing the training time, and obtain results for finite-sized lattices that are in good agreement with the literature values. Furthermore, we use these results to extract accurate estimates of the ground-state properties in the thermodynamic limit. This work demonstrates that RNN wavefunctions can be used to accurately study quantum many-body physics in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

Abstract: Variational Monte Carlo simulations have been crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems, especially when the Hamiltonian is frustrated and the ground-state wavefunction has a non-trivial sign structure. In this paper, we use recurrent neural network (RNN) wavefunction ans\"{a}tze to study the triangular-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (TLAHM) for lattice sizes up to $30\times30$. In a recent study [M. S. Moss et al. arXiv:2502.17144], the authors demonstrated how RNN wavefunctions can be iteratively retrained in order to obtain variational results for multiple lattice sizes with a reasonable amount of compute. That study, which looked at the sign-free, square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, showed favorable scaling properties, allowing accurate finite-size extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, our present results illustrate in detail the relative difficulty in simulating the sign-problematic TLAHM. We find that the accuracy of our simulations can be significantly improved by transforming the Hamiltonian with a judicious choice of basis rotation. We also show that a similar benefit can be achieved by using variational neural annealing, an alternative optimization technique that minimizes a pseudo free energy. Ultimately, we are able to obtain estimates of the ground-state properties of the TLAHM in the thermodynamic limit that are in close agreement with values in the literature, showing that RNN wavefunctions provide a powerful toolbox for performing finite-size scaling studies for frustrated quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Discovery of Metal-Insulator Transition Compounds Using Physics-Informed Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metal-insulator transition (MIT) materials are a useful platform for emerging microelectronic, optoelectronic, and neuromorphic devices, but their discovery is hindered by the high computational cost of electronic structure modeling, the complexity of underlying mechanisms, and the challenges of experimental validation. Here, we present a physics-informed machine learning framework that accelerates the discovery of thermally driven MIT materials. Using a trained classifier, we screen a crystal structure database to identify promising candidates for higher fidelity simulations. We focus on Ca$_2$Fe$_3$O$_8$, CaCo$_2$O$_4$, and CaMn$_2$O$_4$, and use density functional theory (DFT) to determine their electronic and magnetic ground states and assess their microscopic MIT mechanisms. We further apply machine learning regression models to estimate their transition temperatures and employ synthesis prediction tools to identify likely precursors and reaction routes. This integrated approach reduces the time and effort required to identify, understand, and synthesize new MIT materials, providing a generalizable pathway for accelerating correlated quantum materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study on the possibility of high $T_c$ s$\pm$-wave superconductivity in the heavily hole-doped infinite layer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21461v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a possibility of realizing high $T_c$ superconductivity having $s\pm$-wave symmetry in the heavily hole-doped infinite layer nickelates La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$. We consider situations where the original $P4/mmm$ symmetry of LaNiO$_2$ is maintained even for a significant amount of Sr substitution by growing thin films on substrates having tetragonal symmetry. Considering such cases is indeed justified by our phonon calculations. For electron configurations somewhat close to $d^8$, the interaction between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ band and the other $3d$ bands that lie just below the Fermi level results in an enhancement of superconductivity where the sign of the gap function is reversed between the former and the latter bands. The strong enhancement of superconductivity can be attributed to the large energy level offset between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and other orbitals due to the absence of the apical oxygens, as has been pointed out in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Tuning transport in solid-state Bose-Fermi mixtures by Feshbach resonances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures have emerged as promising platforms for realizing tunable Bose-Fermi mixtures. Their constituents are fermionic charge carriers resonantly coupled to long-lived bosonic interlayer excitons, allowing them to form trion bound states. Such platforms promise to achieve comparable densities of fermions and bosons at low relative temperatures. Here, we predict the transport properties of Bose-Fermi mixtures close to a narrow solid-state Feshbach resonance. When driving a hole current, the response of doped holes, excitons, and trions are significantly modified by the resonant interactions, leading to deviations from the typical Drude behavior and to a sign change of the exciton drag. Our results on the temperature-dependent resistivities demonstrate that interaction effects dominate over established conventional scattering mechanisms in these solid-state Bose-Fermi mixtures.</description>

      <title>Emergent Fracton Hydrodynamics of Ultracold Atoms in Partially Filled Landau Levels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The realization of synthetic gauge fields for charge neutral ultracold atoms and the simulation of quantum Hall physics has witnessed remarkable experimental progress. Here, we establish key signatures of fractional quantum Hall systems in their non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. We show that in the lowest Landau level the system generically relaxes subdiffusively.The slow relaxation is understood from emergent conservation laws of the total charge and the associated dipole moment that arise from the effective Hamiltonian projected onto the lowest Landau level, leading to subdiffusive fracton hydrodynamics. We discuss the prospect of rotating quantum gases as well as ultracold atoms in optical lattices for observing this unconventional relaxation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Entanglement scaling and criticality of infinite-size quantum many-body systems in continuous space addressed by a tensor network approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating strongly-correlated quantum systems in continuous space belongs to the most challenging and long-concerned issues in quantum physics. This work investigates the quantum entanglement and criticality of the ground-state wave-functions of infinitely-many coupled quantum oscillators (iCQOs). The essential task involves solving a set of partial differential equations (Schr\"odinger equations in the canonical quantization picture) with infinitely-many variables, which currently lacks valid methods. By extending the imaginary-time evolution algorithm with translationally-invariant functional tensor network, we simulate the ground state of iCQOs with the presence of two- and three-body couplings. We determine the range of coupling strengths where there exists a real ground-state energy (dubbed as physical region). With two-body couplings, we reveal the logarithmic scaling law of entanglement entropy (EE) and the polynomial scaling law of correlation length against the virtual bond dimension $\chi$ at the dividing point of physical and non-physical regions. These two scaling behaviors are signatures of criticality, according to the previous results in quantum lattice models, but were not reported in continuous-space quantum systems. The scaling coefficients result in a central charge $c=1$, indicating the presence of free boson conformal field theory (CFT). We further show that the presence of three-body couplings, for which there are no analytical or numerical results, breaks down the CFT description at the dividing point. Our work reveals the scaling behaviors of EE in continuous-space quantum many-body systems. These results provide strong numerical evidence supporting the efficiency of TN in representing continuous-space quantum wave-functions in the thermodynamic limit and offer an efficient approach to studying entanglement properties and criticality in continuous space.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the matching decoder for the Chamon code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Different choices of quantum error-correcting codes can reduce the demands on the physical hardware needed to build a quantum computer. To achieve the full potential of a code, we must develop practical decoding algorithms that can correct errors that have occurred with high likelihood. Matching decoders are very good at correcting local errors while also demonstrating fast run times that can keep pace with physical quantum devices. We implement variations of a matching decoder for a three-dimensional, non-CSS, low-density parity check code known as the Chamon code, which has a non-trivial structure that does not lend itself readily to this type of decoding. The non-trivial structure of the syndrome of this code means that we can supplement the decoder with additional steps to improve the threshold error rate, below which the logical failure rate decreases with increasing code distance. We find that a generalized matching decoder that is augmented by a belief-propagation step prior to matching gives a threshold of 10.5% for depolarizing noise.</description>

      <title>Universal Anyon Tunneling in a Chiral Luttinger Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The edge modes of fractional quantum Hall liquids are described by chiral Luttinger liquid theory. Despite many years of experimental investigation fractional quantum Hall edge modes remain enigmatic with significant discrepancies between experimental observations and detailed predictions of chiral Luttinger liquid theory. Here we report measurements of tunneling conductance between counterpropagating edge modes at $\nu=1/3$ across a quantum point contact fabricated on an AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure designed to promote a sharp confinement potential. We present evidence for tunneling of anyons through a $\nu=1/3$ incompressible liquid that exhibits universal scaling behavior with respect to temperature, source-drain bias, and barrier transmission, as originally proposed by Wen [1, 2]. For transmission $t\geq0.800$, we measured the tunneling exponent $\bar{g} = 0.333 \pm 0.005$ averaged over 29 independent data sets, consistent with the scaling dimension $\Delta = g/2 = 1/6$ for a Laughlin quasiparticle at the edge. When combined with measurements of the fractional charge $e^*=e/3$ and the recently observed anyonic statistical angle $\theta_a=\frac{2\pi}{3}$, the measured tunneling exponent fully characterizes the topological order of the primary Laughlin state at $\nu=1/3$.</description>

      <title>Subexponential decay of local correlations from diffusion-limited dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chaotic quantum systems at finite energy density are expected to act as their own heat baths, rapidly dephasing local quantum superpositions. We argue that in fact this dephasing is subexponential for chaotic dynamics with conservation laws in one spatial dimension: all local correlation functions decay as stretched exponentials or slower. The stretched exponential bound is saturated for operators that are orthogonal to all hydrodynamic modes. This anomalous decay is a quantum coherent effect, which lies beyond standard fluctuating hydrodynamics; it vanishes in the presence of extrinsic dephasing. Our arguments are general, subject principally to the assumption that there exist zero-entropy charge sectors (such as the particle vacuum) with no nontrivial dynamics: slow relaxation is due to the persistence of regions resembling these inert vacua, which we term "voids". In systems with energy conservation, this assumption is automatically satisfied because of the third law of thermodynamics.</description>
