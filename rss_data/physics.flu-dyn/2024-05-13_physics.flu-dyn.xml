      <title>Symbolic construction of the chemical Jacobian of quasi-steady state (QSS) chemistries for Exascale computing platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quasi-Steady State Approximation (QSSA) can be an effective tool for reducing the size and stiffness of chemical mechanisms for implementation in computational reacting flow solvers. However, for many applications, stiffness remains, and the resulting model requires implicit methods for efficient time integration. In this paper, we outline an approach to formulating the QSSA reduction that is coupled with a strategy to generate C++ source code to evaluate the net species production rate, and the chemical Jacobian. The code-generation component employs a symbolic approach enabling a simple and effective strategy to analytically compute the chemical Jacobian. For computational tractability, the symbolic approach needs to be paired with common subexpression elimination which can negatively affect memory usage. Several solutions are outlined and successfully tested on a 3D multipulse ignition problem, thus allowing portable application across a chemical model sizes and GPU capabilities. The implementation of the proposed method is available at https://github.com/AMReX-Combustion/PelePhysics under an open-source license.</description>

      <title>Exact solution for heat transfer across the Sakiadis boundary layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of convective heat transfer across the laminar boundary-layer induced by an isothermal moving surface in a Newtonian fluid. In previous work (Barlow, Reinberger, and Weinstein, 2024, \textit{Physics of Fluids}, \textbf{36} (031703), 1-3) an exact power series solution was provided for the hydrodynamic flow, often referred to as the Sakiadis boundary layer. Here, we utilize this expression to develop an exact solution for the associated thermal boundary layer as characterized by the Prandtl number ($\Pr$) and local Reynolds number along the surface. To extract the location-dependent heat-transfer coefficient (expressed in dimensionless form as the Nusselt number), the dimensionless temperature gradient at the wall is required; this gradient is solely a function of $\Pr$, and is expressed as an integral of the exact boundary layer flow solution. We find that the exact solution for the temperature gradient is computationally unstable at large $\Pr$, and a large $\Pr$ expansion for the temperature gradient is obtained using Laplace's method. A composite solution is obtained that is accurate to $O(10^{-10})$. Although divergent, the classical power series solution for the Sakiadis boundary layer -- expanded about the wall -- may be used to obtain all higher-order corrections in the asymptotic expansion. We show that this result is connected to the physics of large Prandtl number flows where the thickness of the hydrodynamic boundary layer is much larger than that of the thermal boundary layer. The present model is valid for all Prandtl numbers and attractive for ease of use.</description>

      <title>Dispersivity calculation in digital twins of multiscale porous materials using the micro-continuum approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The micro-continuum method is a novel approach to simulate flow and transport in multiscale porous materials. For such materials, the domain can be divided into three sub-domains depending on the local porosity {\epsilon}: fully resolved solid phase, for which {\epsilon}=0, fully resolved pores, for which {\epsilon}=1.0, and unresolved pores, for which 0&lt;{\epsilon}&lt;1.0. For such domains, the flow can be solved using the Darcy-Brinkman-Stokes (DBS) equation, which offers a seamless transition between unresolved pores, where flow is described by Darcy's law, and resolved pores, where flow is described by the Navier-Stokes equations. Species transport can then be modelled using a volume-averaged equation. In this work, we present a derivation of the closure problem for the micro-continuum approach. Effective dispersivity tensors can then be calculated through a multi-stage process. First, high resolution images are chosen for characterizing the structure of the unresolved pores. Porosity, permeability and effective dispersivity for the unresolved part are calculated by solving a closure problem based on Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) in the high-resolution images. The effective dispersivity is then expressed as a function of the P\'eclet number, which describes the ratio of advective to diffusive transport. This relationship, along with porosity and permeability, is then integrated into the multiscale domain and the effective dispersivity tensor for the full image is calculated. Our novel method is validated by comparison with the numerical solution obtained for a fully-resolved simulation in a multiscale 2D micromodel. It is then applied to obtain an effective dispersivity model in digital twins for two multiscale materials: hierarchical ceramic foams and microporous carbonate rocks.</description>

      <title>Transition from laminar to turbulent pipe flow as a process of growing material instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we simulate the transition to turbulence in the pipe flow based on the modified NS theory incorporating the viscous fluid strength in the constitutive equations. The latter concept enriches theory by allowing for material instabilities in addition to the kinematic ones. We present results of comparative numerical simulations based on the classical NS model and the NS model enhanced with the finite viscous strength. As expected, simulations based on the classical NS model exhibit stable laminar flow in contrast to experimental observations. Conversely, simulations based on the modified NS model with viscous strength exhibit instabilities and transition to turbulence per experimental observations. The transition to turbulence is triggered by the growing material instabilities.</description>

      <title>Short-Time Force Response during the Impact of a Droplet with Gas Bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of gas or vapour bubbles may strongly influence the forces that occur during the impact of a liquid mass onto a solid. Here, we study this effect numerically, in a well-controlled manner, by simulating the short-time interaction between an impacting droplet and a solid surface, mediated by the gas layer between droplet and solid just before collision, in the presence and absence of bubbles. A boundary integral method is used to simulate the falling droplet, the mediating air layer is modeled using lubrication theory, whereas uniform gas bubbles are added to the droplet that obey a polytropic equation of state. We show that the presence of gas bubbles inside the droplet can have a significant influence on the force exerted on the substrate, even before touchdown. This is due to the transmission of load from the solid, through the gas layer and finally into the bubbly droplet, buffering the impact. We simulate different bubble configurations, modifying their number, size, shape and initial position. It is found that larger bubbles, as well as those close to the impact zone, dampen the collision more as compared to small bubbles or the ones that are far from the droplet's surface. In addition, multiple small bubbles are shown to have a similar or even greater effect as a single large bubble.</description>

      <title>Transmission of a Pressure Signal through a Confined Bubble Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pressure changes travel at an infinite sound speed in an incompressible ideal fluid, opposite to what happens in a bubbly liquid, where the presence of bubbles adds compressibility such that the sound speed becomes finite. Here, the transmission of a pressure signal through a confined bubble array is studied numerically. An axisymmetric Boundary Integral (BI) code was used to simulate a horizontal array of spherical bubbles inside a cylindrical container. On one end of the container, a piston is able to move in either a sinusoidal or impulsive way to excite the bubbles, whereas the other end of the cylinder is fixed. A one-dimensional model, hereafter called the Multiple Bagnold Problem (MBP) model, was developed to predict the behavior of the 3D system. A good agreement between the model and the simulations was found for initial excitation times and qualitatively good agreement for later times. The MBP model was subsequently used to obtain an expression for the sound speed in monodisperse systems, which depends on the ratio between the driving and the natural bubble frequency. Two regimes were found, one where the pressure signal travels unattenuated and the other where attenuation is present. Subsequently we turn to more complex, bidisperse systems, where the influence of the presence of bubbles of two different sizes is explored. Analytical expressions to predict the eigenfrequencies were obtained for monodisperse and bidisperse alternating systems. For bidisperse stacked systems the eigenfrequencies were computed numerically giving a good agreement with the MBP simulations. Finally, we discuss the propagation of a pressure signal through a polydisperse system.</description>

      <title>New comprehensive description of the scaling evolution of the cosmological magneto-hydrodynamic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of primordial magnetic fields until the recombination epoch, which is constrained by the conservation of magnetic helicity density if they are maximally helical and by the Hosking integral if they are non-helical. We combine these constraints with conditions obtained by estimating time scales of energy dissipation processes to describe the evolution of magnetic field strength and magnetic coherence length analytically. The dissipation processes depend on whether magnetic or kinetic energy is dominant, whether the decay dynamics is linear or not, and whether the dominant dissipation term is shear viscosity or drag force. We apply the description to compare constraints on primordial magnetic fields at different epochs in the early universe and argue that magnetogenesis before the electroweak symmetry breaking is not feasible.</description>

      <title>Koopman-Based Surrogate Modelling of Turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several related works have introduced Koopman-based Machine Learning architectures as a surrogate model for dynamical systems. These architectures aim to learn non-linear measurements (also known as observables) of the system's state that evolve by a linear operator and are, therefore, amenable to model-based linear control techniques. So far, mainly simple systems have been targeted, and Koopman architectures as reduced-order models for more complex dynamics have not been fully explored. Hence, we use a Koopman-inspired architecture called the Linear Recurrent Autoencoder Network (LRAN) for learning reduced-order dynamics in convection flows of a Rayleigh B\'enard Convection (RBC) system at different amounts of turbulence. The data is obtained from direct numerical simulations of the RBC system. A traditional fluid dynamics method, the Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition (KDMD), is used to compare the LRAN. For both methods, we performed hyperparameter sweeps to identify optimal settings. We used a Normalized Sum of Square Error measure for the quantitative evaluation of the models, and we also studied the model predictions qualitatively. We obtained more accurate predictions with the LRAN than with KDMD in the most turbulent setting. We conjecture that this is due to the LRAN's flexibility in learning complicated observables from data, thereby serving as a viable surrogate model for the main structure of fluid dynamics in turbulent convection settings. In contrast, KDMD was more effective in lower turbulence settings due to the repetitiveness of the convection flow. The feasibility of Koopman-based surrogate models for turbulent fluid flows opens possibilities for efficient model-based control techniques useful in a variety of industrial settings.</description>
