      <title>Development of a global landscape of undergraduate physics laboratory courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics Education Research (PER) is a global endeavour, with a wealth of work performed at a variety of institutions worldwide. However, results from research into undergraduate physics laboratory courses is often difficult to compare due to the broad variations in courses. We have created a survey to help classify these courses to compare and contrast them, which will be useful in two key endeavours: comparisons between PER studies and providing useful data for individual instructors hoping to improve their courses, thus providing information relevant to both researchers and instructors. While we are still in the process of collecting sufficient data to create a full taxonomy of laboratory courses, we present here details of the survey creation itself, as well as a first look at the data collected, which includes a broad landscape of lab courses in 41 countries. We used both quantitative and qualitative methods in analyzing the data collected. Some of these results include similarities between courses, such as students often using pre-constructed apparatuses and that instructors hope for students to learn technical skills. We also find differences in courses, such as in the number and types of goals of the course, as well as the activities students participate in.</description>

      <title>Juegos Serios: Matematizando la Fisica de forma Ludica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of a serious game is presented that served as an instrument to explore the transfer of computational thinking skills and mathematization of Physics principles, specifically the topic of free fall of objects, with diverse educational purposes, first to apply a set of teaching strategies focused on promoting supervised active learning and live programming and second, providing a serious game to illustrate the notions of kinematics and simulate the dynamics of rigid bodies using a video game engine. Thanks to the use of the Godot game engine, it was possible to help Physics students implement said serious game during a semester of an introductory Physics course.</description>

      <title>Connecting research in physics education, curriculum decisions and teaching practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the symposium contributions we discuss research in physics education and the consequences of its results for physics teaching. The symposium presents four different aspects of physics teaching and learning, but all of them have research-based problem analysis in common. The problems analysed cover different aspects of the physics teaching-learning process. Innovative aspects such as the effect on learning of the integration of engineering projects in the science teaching process, the influence on the learning process of conceptions about science and attitudes, and aspects related to teaching contents and students' learning difficulties. Its conclusions are not merely intuitive proposals based on teaching experience, but on a careful planning of data collection, analysis of results and empirical basis</description>

      <title>Perspectives from Physics Graduate Students on Their Experiences in NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: National Science Foundation (NSF) funded Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs) are explicitly intended to reach minoritized students in STEM and those who have few research opportunities. Many undergraduates are encouraged to seek them out, but their actual efficacy is not well-established, and the out-of-state travel required for many attendees may prove a significant barrier for the very students REUs wish to reach. We interviewed physics graduate students who attended REUs as undergrauates, focusing on how the REUs benefitted them, barriers they faced attending REUs, and their relationship with their REU mentors. Interviewees reported benefits that aligned with the NSF goals: skills, enculturation, and knowledge they had not received in their undergraduate institutions. They also reported financial barriers they faced which they were able to overcome due to their financial privilege. Participants also reported widely varying experiences with their mentors. Some mentors did and some did not meet their mentees where they were at in their career and skill levels. Some students did not know how to approach their mentors with their questions or needs.</description>

      <title>Chemically active droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These lecture notes describe a basic theory of chemically active droplets, which are droplets kept away from equilibrium by driven chemical reactions. The notes assume a basic familiarity with equilibrium thermodynamics of phase separation, and thus focus on three separate themes, which were discussed in three separate lectures: (i) The kinetics of phase separation, including the early-stage dynamics of spinodal decomposition and the late-stage dynamics of Ostwald ripening. (ii) Transition state theory as a simple, thermodynamically-consistent kinetic theory of chemical reactions, which permits explicit driving in open systems. (iii) The combination of phase separation and reactions, leading to active droplets. We discuss the two fundamental classes of internally-maintained and externally-maintained droplets. A simple version of externally-maintained droplets permits an effective electrostatic analogy, which indicates how the reaction-diffusion system mediates long-ranged interactions. All these aspects are discussed in the context of biomolecular condensates.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Curriculum Transformation in Quantum Information Science and Technology Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of Quantum Information Science &amp; Technology (QIST) is booming. Due to this, many new educational courses and university programs are needed in order to prepare a workforce for the developing industry. Owing to its specialist nature, teaching approaches in this field can easily become disconnected from the substantial degree of science education research which aims to support the best approaches to teaching in Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Mathematics (STEM) fields. In order to connect these two communities with a pragmatic and repeatable methodology, we have synthesised this educational research into a decision-tree based theoretical model for the transformation of QIST curricula, intended to provide a didactical perspective for practitioners. The Quantum Curriculum Transformation Framework (QCTF) consists of four steps: 1. choose a topic, 2. choose one or more targeted skills, 3. choose a learning goal and 4. choose a teaching approach that achieves this goal. We show how this can be done using an example curriculum and more specifically quantum teleportation as a basic concept of quantum communication within this curriculum. By approaching curriculum creation and transformation in this way, educational goals and outcomes are more clearly defined which is in the interest of the individual and the industry alike. The framework is intended to structure the narrative of QIST teaching, and with future testing and refinement it will form a basis for further research in the didactics of QIST.</description>

      <title>Quantum Technology masters: A shortcut to the quantum industry?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate a growing trend in the worldwide Quantum Technology (QT) education landscape, that of the development of masters programs, intended to provide graduates with the knowledge and skills to take a job in the quantum industry, while serving a much shorter timeline than a doctoral degree. Through a global survey, we identified 86 masters programs, with substantial growth since 2021. Over time masters have become increasingly interdisciplinary, organised by multiple faculties or through joint degree programs, and offer more hands-on experiences such as internships in companies. Information from program organisers and websites suggests that the intended career destinations of their graduates are a diverse range of industries, and therefore masters programs may be a boon to the industrialisation of quantum technologies. Finally, we identify a range of national efforts to grow the quantum workforce of many countries, quantum program enhancements, which augment the content of existing study programs with quantum content. This may further contribute to the growth and viability of masters programs as a route to the quantum industry.</description>

      <title>Why Teach Quantum In Your Own Time: The Values of Grassroots Organizations Involved in Quantum Technologies Education and Outreach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the intersection of goals and values within grassroots organizations operating in the realm of quantum technologies (QT) education. It delineates a fundamental distinction between the objective to provide education and the drive to democratize learning through principles of inclusivity, accessibility, and diversity. The analysis reveals how these organizations navigate their nascent stages, grappling with the dual challenge of adhering to their foundational values while aspiring for sustainable growth and development in the highly specialized field of QT. The study uncovers the strategic approaches adopted by these entities, including efforts to create educational ecosystems and foster community engagement. The research underscores the potential vulnerabilities of these grassroots organizations, particularly in relation to the longevity and evolution of their initiatives as members transition into professional roles within the quantum sector. Through this investigation, the paper contributes to a nuanced understanding of how emerging educational organizations in the QT field balance their ideological commitments with practical growth considerations, highlighting the critical factors that influence their trajectory and impact.</description>
