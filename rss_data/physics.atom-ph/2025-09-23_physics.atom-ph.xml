      <title>Investigating Roles of Triple Excitations for High-precision Determination of Clock Properties of Alkaline Earth Singly Charged Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-accuracy calculations of electric dipole polarizabilities and quadrupole moments ($\Theta$) of the clock states of the singly charged calcium (Ca$^+$), strontium (Sr$^+$) and barium (Ba$^+$) alkaline-earth ions are estimated by employing relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory. It demonstrates importance of the triple excitations in the RCC method for precise determination of the above quantities. We also observe a different trend of correlations in the $\Theta$ values than an earlier study with respect to orbitals from higher angular momenta. Reliability of the results is verified by comparing the calculated energies, magnetic dipole hyperfine structure constants, and lifetimes of the atomic states with the experimental values of the $^{43}$Ca$^+$, $^{87}$Sr$^+$ and $^{137}$Ba$^+$ ions. Nuclear quadrupole moments of these isotopes are also estimated by combining calculations with the measured electric quadrupole hyperfine structure constants, showing large deviations from the literature values.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Method of Planes - Local Pressure Definitions for Machine Learning Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stress or Pressure is a central quantity in engineering, and remains vital in molecular modelling. However, the commonly used virial stress tensor is not valid away from thermodynamic equilibrium, a common state required in fluid dynamics and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation. This is solved by using the method of planes (MoP), a mechanical form of pressure, simply interpreted as the force divided by area but derived from the firm foundations of statistical mechanics. We present an extension of MoP stress to the MACE potential, a particular form of machine learning (ML) potentials allowing quantum mechanical (QM) physics in classical simulation. We present the derivation of the MoP stress for the MACE potential using the theoretical framework set out by Irving &amp; Kirkwood (1950). For the testcase of an interface between water and Zirconium Oxide, we show the MoP measures the correct force balance while the virial form fails. Further, we demonstrate the MoP is valid arbitrarily far from equilibrium, showing exact conservation every timestep in a control volume bounded by MoP planes. This links the stress directly to the conservation equations and demonstrates the validity in non equilibrium molecular dynamics systems. All code to reproduce these validations for any MACE system, together with ASE accelerated code to calculate the MoP are provided as open source. This work helps build the foundation to extend the ML revolution in materials to NEMD and molecular fluid dynamics modelling.</description>

      <title>Fast momentum-selective transport of Bose-Einstein condensates via controlled non-adiabatic dynamics in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed numerical study of a protocol for momentum-selective transport of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a one-dimensional optical lattice, achieving narrow momentum distributions through controlled non-adiabatic dynamics. The protocol consists of non-adiabatic loading into the lattice, coherent acceleration using a symmetric trapezoidal acceleration profile, and non-adiabatic release into free space. Using the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we simulate the full sequence and analyze the role of non-adiabatic excitations on the final momentum distribution. We identify the intra-site breathing dynamics as the dominant mechanism governing spectral purity under fast loading conditions. By tracking the condensate's spatial width during the evolution, we demonstrate a direct correlation with the final momentum spread. A variational model based on a Gaussian ansatz quantitatively reproduces the observed dynamics and provides physical insight into the breathing mechanism. Our results reveal the existence of magic times, i.e. specific loading or acceleration durations synchronized with the breathing oscillation period, where quasi-monochromatic momentum distributions can be achieved even with loading times as short as 100 $\mu$s, offering a route to coherent transport that is faster than adiabatic protocols. This approach is particularly relevant for quantum sensors operating under stringent timing constraints.</description>

      <title>Universal two-excitation scattering in two-dimensional subwavelength atomic arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subwavelength atomic arrays are a leading platform for engineering strong light-matter interactions, presenting exciting opportunities for quantum science. However, a full understanding of their multi-excitation dynamics remains a significant challenge. In this work, we uncover a remarkable universal phenomenon that emerges in these arrays. Using scattering theory to analyze two-excitation interactions, we reveal a profound simplification near critical points of the collective atomic excitation band structure, determined solely from single-excitation properties. At these critical points, scattering becomes universal and the full two-excitation scattering matrix decomposes into a block-diagonal form. Remarkably, all scattering processes involving the photon field are completely suppressed, resulting in the perfect isolation of a unitary, nonlinear interaction channel between collective dark spin waves. Our findings provide exact analytical insights into few-body nonlinearities and establish a universal framework for analyzing complex scattering phenomena in ordered atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-excitation scattering in subwavelength atomic arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subwavelength atomic arrays are a leading platform for engineering light-matter interactions, enabling near-perfect single-photon mirrors and robust quantum memories based on long-lived dark spin waves. However, a comprehensive theory of their nonlinear, multi-excitation dynamics has remained a significant challenge. We present a unified quantum scattering theory that treats both photons and collective atomic spin waves as distinct propagating excitations interacting across different spatial dimensions. Our central result is a powerful analytical reduction: we demonstrate that the complete multi-channel S-matrix and the associated scattering cross sections are exactly determined by the effective scattering dynamics solely within the atomic spin wave subspace. This maps the complex physical problem of photon-atom interactions to a conceptually simpler one involving only atomic modes. We apply this formalism to the two-excitation case, deriving the complete analytical S-matrix and scattering cross sections for systems with two-level nonlinearities. Our work provides a versatile analytic tool for analyzing and engineering complex quantum nonlinear phenomena, including multi-excitation subradiance, in large-scale atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement manifestation of knot topology in a non-Hermitian lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the homotopy-knot theory has been utilized to implement effective topological classification for non-Hermitian systems, the physical implications underlying distinct knot topologies remain ambiguous and are rarely addressed. In this work, we propose a one-dimensional non-Hermitian four-band lattice model and map out its phase diagram according to the distinct knot structures residing in the moment space. The topological phase diagram is ascertained through a spectral winding number. Furthermore, we derive the exact analytic formula for the phase boundaries that delineate different knot topologies. To explore the concrete physical implications of distinct knot topologies, we investigate the many-body ground state entanglement entropy for free fermions loaded on such non-Hermitian lattice in real space. It turns out that different knot topologies imply different magnitudes of entanglement. Moreover, we show that the central charge c extracted from systematic finite-size scaling of entanglement entropy provides effective description of the phase diagram of the knot topology. Finally, we further confirm the phase boundaries for the topological phase transitions alternatively by numerical calculations of the many-body ground state fidelity susceptibility. Our results showcase the connection between knot topology and entanglement of non-Hermitian systems and may facilitate further exploration of the profound and practical physical implications of knot topology.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Trapping of Cold Atoms with Surface Forces and Blue-Detuned Evanescent Light on a Nanophotonic Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel hybrid nanophotonic trap for cold neutral atoms, leveraging surface forces for attraction and blue-detuned evanescent light for repulsion. We attribute the attractive potential to a combination of Casimir-Polder interactions and electrostatic charges distributed on the waveguide surface. Despite the trap's shallow depth, we efficiently load atoms into it via adiabatic transfer from a conventional two-color dipole trap. Remarkably, the hybrid trap supports a long atomic storage time of 140(9) ms and exhibits a Ramsey coherence time of 16.8(2) ms, the latter exceeding significantly previous reports for nanophotonic systems. Our results pave the way for further exploration of atom-surface interactions at the nanoscale and illustrate the potential of harnessing surface forces to enhance storage and coherence times for atoms coupled to nanophotonic waveguides. This advancement offers new opportunities for neutral-atom quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entangling gates are an essential capability of quantum computers. There are different methods for implementing two-qubit gates, with respective advantages and disadvantages. We investigate the experimentally relevant differences and commonalities of laser-based $\sigma_z\otimes\sigma_z$ light-shift and $\sigma_\phi\otimes\sigma_\phi$ Moelmer-Soerensen gates, highlighting the phases of experimental control fields and their long-term stabilities, in the specific case of mixed-species gates. We implement these gates on qubits with very different magnetic field sensitivities, encoded in $^{43}\mathrm{Ca}^+$ and $^{88}\mathrm{Sr}^+$, achieving fidelities of $99.8\%$ for the $\sigma_z\otimes\sigma_z$ and $99.6\%$ for the $\sigma_\phi\otimes\sigma_\phi$ gate.</description>

      <title>Detection of long-range coherence in driven hot atomic vapors by spin noise spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study intriguing dynamical features of hot Rubidium atoms driven by two light fields. The fields resonantly drive multiple Zeeman states within two hyperfine levels, yielding a cascaded-$\Lambda$ like structure in the frequency space. A non-Hermitian Floquet tight-binding lattice with imaginary hopping between the nearest states effectively describes the coherence dynamics between Zeeman states within the ground hyperfine manifold. By performing spin noise spectroscopy, we observe higher harmonic peaks in the noise spectrum that capture multi-photon transitions in the ground manifold. Moreover, the peak amplitudes reveal a power-law decay of long-range coherence with increasing separation between the ground states.</description>

      <title>Pseudogap in a Fermi-Hubbard quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding doped Mott insulators is a fundamental goal in condensed matter physics, with relevance to cuprate superconductors and other quantum materials. The doped Hubbard model minimally describes such systems, and has explicated some of their complex behavior. However, many open questions remain concerning the anomalous metallic states which emerge at low temperatures and intermediate doping and which, in cuprates, give rise to high-temperature superconductivity upon cooling. Here we observe a crossover between a normal metal and a pseudogapped metal in the Hubbard model by performing thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements in a cold atom quantum simulator, leveraging a recent several-fold reduction in experimentally achievable temperatures. Measurements of the compressibility show a maximum versus doping that develops upon cooling, signaling an inflection point in the equation of state. We track this maximum versus interaction strength, revealing a line of thermodynamic anomalies in the phase diagram that separates an underdoped from an overdoped metal at large interactions. Lattice modulation spectroscopy shows a loss of spectral weight at low energies in the underdoped regime which is non-uniform in the Brillouin zone, indicating the formation of a pseudogap. We use this signal to establish a pseudogap phase diagram as a function of interactions and doping. Our results experimentally demonstrate the existence of a pseudogapped metal in the Hubbard model, partially characterize the pseudogap regime, and suggest a link between the pseudogap and charge order which can be probed in future work. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the utility of quantum simulation in addressing frontier problems in correlated electron physics.</description>

Abstract: We describe how the annihilation of antiprotons can be utilized to generate highly charged isomeric ions in an ion-trap setup. We identify optical transitions in the hyperfine splitting of Hydrogen-like atoms composed of an isomer and a single electron in the ground state. We identify promising candidates in the isomers of Y, Nb, Rh, In, and Sb, for which the hyperfine transition lies in the infrared and whose excited state level lifetime is in the hundreds of milliseconds, which is suitable for metrology applications.</description>

      <title>Hyperfine van der Waals repulsion between open-shell polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a novel type of interaction between open-shell polar molecules at sub-millikelvin temperatures. This hyperfine van der Waals interaction occurs between two molecules in two rotational states that differ by one quantum. Normally, this induces resonant dipolar interactions that lead to rapid collisional loss. For specific hyperfine states, however, selection rules prevent this. One can effectively turn off the dipolar interaction by merely flipping a nuclear spin. The resulting van der Waals interaction can be repulsive and can suppress collisional loss. We focus on laser-coolable CaF, but show this effect occurs universally for open-shell molecules, including MgF, SrF, BaF and YO. We propose that this effect could be measured by merging molecules in optical tweezers, where flipping a spin in one of the tweezers enables tuning of collision rates by five orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the optical pumping on the $5s4d\,{}^1D_2-5s8p\,{}^1P_1$ transition in a magneto-optical trap of Sr atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the efficacy of optical pumping on the $5s4d\,{}^1D_2 - 5s8p\,{}^1P_1$ ($448\,\mathrm{nm}$) transition in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) of Sr atoms. The number of trapped atoms is enhanced by a factor of $12.0(6)$ relative to the case without repumping light, which is six times as large as that obtained using the pumping transition $5s4d\,{}^1D_2 - 5s6p\,{}^1P_1$ ($717\,\mathrm{nm}$). This enhancement is limited by decay pathways that bypass the $5s4d\,{}^1D_2$ state, namely $5s5p\,{}^1P_1 \to 5s4d\,{}^3D_1 \to 5s5p\,{}^3P_0$ and $5s5p\,{}^1P_1 \to 5s4d\,{}^3D_2 \to 5s5p\,{}^3P_2$, which account for 8% of the total loss of the trapped atoms. We determine the decay rates for the $5s5p\,{}^1P_1 \to 5s4d\,{}^3D_1$ and $5s5p\,{}^1P_1 \to 5s4d\,{}^3D_2$ transitions to be $66(6)\,\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ and $2.4(2)\times10^2\,\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, respectively. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate for the first time that, when the trap beam diameter is small, escape of atoms in the $5s4d\,{}^1D_2$ state, which has a relatively long lifetime of $400\,\mathrm{\mu s}$, becomes a dominant loss mechanism, and that the $448\,\mathrm{nm}$ pumping light effectively suppresses this escape. Our findings will contribute to improved laser cooling and fluorescence imaging in cold strontium atom platforms, such as quantum computers based on optical tweezer arrays.</description>

      <title>Circular RABBITT goes under threshold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce circular under-threshold RABBITT (cuRABBITT) as a new interferometric method to probe discrete electronic excitations in atoms with attosecond resolution. By combining circularly polarized attosecond pulses with broadband (rainbow) spectral analysis, we directly access two-photon ionization amplitudes and their relative phases. Time-dependent Schr\"odinger simulations, supported by Green's function theory, reveal strong resonances in helium and argon and a Cooper-like minimum in xenon. These results demonstrate that cuRABBITT provides continuous spectral mapping of bound-state resonances and extends Fano's propensity rule into the under-threshold regime. Our work establishes cuRABBITT as a powerful attosecond metrology technique, opening the way to polarization-resolved studies of resonant dynamics in atoms and molecules.</description>
