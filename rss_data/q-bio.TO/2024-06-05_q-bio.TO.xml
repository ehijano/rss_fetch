      <title>Dreaming of Electrical Waves: Generative Modeling of Cardiac Excitation Waves using Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Electrical waves in the heart form rotating spiral or scroll waves during life-threatening arrhythmias such as atrial or ventricular fibrillation. The wave dynamics are typically modeled using coupled partial differential equations, which describe reaction-diffusion dynamics in excitable media. More recently, data-driven generative modeling has emerged as an alternative to generate spatio-temporal patterns in physical and biological systems. Here, we explore denoising diffusion probabilistic models for the generative modeling of electrical wave patterns in cardiac tissue. We trained diffusion models with simulated electrical wave patterns to be able to generate such wave patterns in unconditional and conditional generation tasks. For instance, we explored the diffusion-based i) parameter-specific generation, ii) evolution and iii) inpainting of spiral wave dynamics, including reconstructing three-dimensional scroll wave dynamics from superficial two-dimensional measurements. Further, we generated arbitrarily shaped bi-ventricular geometries and simultaneously initiated scroll wave patterns inside these geometries using diffusion. We characterized and compared the diffusion-generated solutions to solutions obtained with corresponding biophysical models and found that diffusion models learn to replicate spiral and scroll waves dynamics so well that they could be used for data-driven modeling of excitation waves in cardiac tissue. For instance, an ensemble of diffusion-generated spiral wave dynamics exhibits similar self-termination statistics as the corresponding ensemble simulated with a biophysical model. However, we also found that diffusion models {produce artifacts if training data is lacking, e.g. during self-termination,} and `hallucinate' wave patterns when insufficiently constrained.</description>
