      <title>Constructing $\omega$-free Hardy fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that every Hardy field extends to an $\omega$-free Hardy field. This result relates to classical oscillation criteria for second-order homogeneous linear differential equations. It is essential in [12], and here we apply it to answer questions of Boshernitzan, and to generalize a theorem of his.</description>

      <title>$\Pi_{2}^{P}$ vs PSpace Dichotomy for the Quantified Constraint Satisfaction Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quantified Constraint Satisfaction Problem is the problem of evaluating a sentence with both quantifiers, over relations from some constraint language, with conjunction as the only connective. We show that for any constraint language on a finite domain the Quantified Constraint Satisfaction Problem is either in $\Pi_{2}^{P}$, or PSpace-complete. Additionally, we build a constraint language on a 6-element domain such that the Quantified Constraint Satisfaction Problem over this language is $\Pi_{2}^{P}$-complete.</description>

      <title>Refutability as Recursive as Provability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Godel numbering is an arithmetization of sintax which defines provability by coding a primitive recursive predicate, Pf(x,v). A multiplicity of researches and results all around this well-known recursive predicate are today widespread in many areas of logic and AI. Not equally investigated is the refutability predicate defined by Godel numbering within the same primitive recursive status. Rf(x,v) can be defined as a recursive predicate meaning that x is the Godel number of a refutation in PA of the formula with Godel number v. This article proposes a logical investigation of the interactive links between provability and refutability predicates when defined within the same recursive status. The resulting Lemmas are clarifying and open new perspectives for the incompleteness argument and the codings of its underlying notions.</description>

      <title>Part 1 of Martin's Conjecture for order-preserving and measure-preserving functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Martin's Conjecture is a proposed classification of the definable functions on the Turing degrees. It is usually divided into two parts, the first of which classifies functions which are not above the identity and the second of which classifies functions which are above the identity. Slaman and Steel proved the second part of the conjecture for Borel functions which are order-preserving (i.e. which preserve Turing reducibility). We prove the first part of the conjecture for all order-preserving functions. We do this by introducing a class of functions on the Turing degrees which we call "measure-preserving" and proving that part 1 of Martin's Conjecture holds for all measure-preserving functions and also that all non-trivial order-preserving functions are measure-preserving. Our result on measure-preserving functions has several other consequences for Martin's Conjecture, including an equivalence between part 1 of the conjecture and a statement about the structure of the Rudin-Keisler order on ultrafilters on the Turing degrees.</description>
