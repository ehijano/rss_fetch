      <title>Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior on TikTok: Challenges and Opportunities for Detection in a Video-First Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB) is central to the study of online influence operations. However, most methods focus on text-centric platforms, leaving video-first ecosystems like TikTok largely unexplored. To address this gap, we develop and evaluate a computational framework for detecting CIB on TikTok, leveraging a network-based approach adapted to the platform's unique content and interaction structures. Building on existing approaches, we construct user similarity networks based on shared behaviors, including synchronized posting, repeated use of similar captions, multimedia content reuse, and hashtag sequence overlap, and apply graph pruning techniques to identify dense networks of likely coordinated accounts. Analyzing a dataset of 793K TikTok videos related to the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, we uncover a range of coordinated activities, from synchronized amplification of political narratives to semi-automated content replication using AI-generated voiceovers and split-screen video formats. Our findings show that while traditional coordination indicators generalize well to TikTok, other signals, such as those based on textual similarity of video transcripts or Duet and Stitch interactions, prove ineffective, highlighting the platform's distinct content norms and interaction mechanics. This work provides the first empirical foundation for studying and detecting CIB on TikTok, paving the way for future research into influence operations in short-form video platforms.</description>

      <title>Protecting Young Users on Social Media: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Content Moderation and Legal Safeguards on Video Sharing Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video-sharing social media platforms, such as TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram, implement content moderation policies aimed at reducing exposure to harmful videos among minor users. As video has become the dominant and most immersive form of online content, understanding how effectively this medium is moderated for younger audiences is urgent. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of video moderation for different age groups on three of the main video-sharing platforms: TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram. We created experimental accounts for the children assigned ages 13 and 18. Using these accounts, we evaluated 3,000 videos served up by the social media platforms, in passive scrolling and search modes, recording the frequency and speed at which harmful videos were encountered. Each video was manually assessed for level and type of harm, using definitions from a unified framework of harmful content.
  The results show that for passive scrolling or search-based scrolling, accounts assigned to the age 13 group encountered videos that were deemed harmful, more frequently and quickly than those assigned to the age 18 group. On YouTube, 15\% of recommended videos to 13-year-old accounts during passive scrolling were assessed as harmful, compared to 8.17\% for 18-year-old accounts. On YouTube, videos labelled as harmful appeared within an average of 3:06 minutes of passive scrolling for the younger age group. Exposure occurred without user-initiated searches, indicating weaknesses in the algorithmic filtering systems. These findings point to significant gaps in current video moderation practices by social media platforms. Furthermore, the ease with which underage users can misrepresent their age demonstrates the urgent need for more robust verification methods.</description>

      <title>Learning hidden cascades via classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spreading dynamics in social networks are often studied under the assumption that individuals' statuses, whether informed or infected, are fully observable. However, in many real-world situations, such statuses remain unobservable, which is crucial for determining an individual's potential to further spread the infection. While this final status is hidden, intermediate indicators such as symptoms of infection are observable and provide important insights into the spread process. We propose a partial observability-aware Machine Learning framework to learn the characteristics of the spreading model. We term the method Distribution Classification, which utilizes the power of classifiers to infer the underlying transmission dynamics. We evaluate our method on two types of synthetic networks and extend the study to a real-world insider trading network. Results show that the method performs well, especially on complex networks with high cyclic connectivity, supporting its utility in analyzing real-world spreading phenomena where direct observation of individual statuses is not possible.</description>

      <title>Cosmos 1.0: a multidimensional map of the emerging technology frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes a novel methodology to map the universe of emerging technologies, utilising various source data that contain a rich diversity and breadth of contemporary knowledge to create a new dataset and multiple indices that provide new insights into these technologies. The Cosmos 1.0 dataset is a comprehensive collection of 23,544 technologies (ET23k) structured into a hierarchical model. Each technology is categorised into three meta clusters (ET3) and seven theme clusters (ET7) enhanced by 100-dimensional embedding vectors. Within the cosmos, we manually verify 100 emerging technologies called the ET100. This dataset is enriched with additional indices specifically developed to assess the landscape of emerging technologies, including the Technology Awareness Index, Generality Index, Deeptech, and Age of Tech Index. The dataset incorporates extensive metadata sourced from Wikipedia and linked data from third-party sources such as Crunchbase, Google Books, OpenAlex and Google Scholar, which are used to validate the relevance and accuracy of the constructed indices. Moreover, we trained a classifier to identify whether they are developed "technology" or technology-related "terms".</description>

      <title>ChestyBot: Detecting and Disrupting Chinese Communist Party Influence Stratagems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foreign information operations conducted by Russian and Chinese actors exploit the United States' permissive information environment. These campaigns threaten democratic institutions and the broader Westphalian model. Yet, existing detection and mitigation strategies often fail to identify active information campaigns in real time. This paper introduces ChestyBot, a pragmatics-based language model that detects unlabeled foreign malign influence tweets with up to 98.34% accuracy. The model supports a novel framework to disrupt foreign influence operations in their formative stages.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Patterns and Influence of Advertising in Print Newspapers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates advertising practices in print newspapers across India using a novel data-driven approach. We develop a pipeline employing image processing and OCR techniques to extract articles and advertisements from digital versions of print newspapers with high accuracy. Applying this methodology to five popular newspapers that span multiple regions and three languages, English, Hindi, and Telugu, we assembled a dataset of more than 12,000 editions containing several hundred thousand advertisements. Collectively, these newspapers reach a readership of over 100 million people. Using this extensive dataset, we conduct a comprehensive analysis to answer key questions about print advertising: who advertises, what they advertise, when they advertise, where they place their ads, and how they advertise. Our findings reveal significant patterns, including the consistent level of print advertising over the past six years despite declining print circulation, the overrepresentation of company ads on prominent pages, and the disproportionate revenue contributed by government ads. Furthermore, we examine whether advertising in a newspaper influences the coverage an advertiser receives. Through regression analyses on coverage volume and sentiment, we find strong evidence supporting this hypothesis for corporate advertisers. The results indicate a clear trend where increased advertising correlates with more favorable and extensive media coverage, a relationship that remains robust over time and across different levels of advertiser popularity.</description>

      <title>Alexandria: A Library of Pluralistic Values for Realtime Re-Ranking of Social Media Feeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media feed ranking algorithms fail when they too narrowly focus on engagement as their objective. The literature has asserted a wide variety of values that these algorithms should account for as well -- ranging from well-being to productive discourse -- far more than can be encapsulated by a single topic or theory. In response, we present a $\textit{library of values}$ for social media algorithms: a pluralistic set of 78 values as articulated across the literature, implemented into LLM-powered content classifiers that can be installed individually or in combination for real-time re-ranking of social media feeds. We investigate this approach by developing a browser extension, $\textit{Alexandria}$, that re-ranks the X/Twitter feed in real time based on the user's desired values. Through two user studies, both qualitative (N=12) and quantitative (N=257), we found that diverse user needs require a large library of values, enabling more nuanced preferences and greater user control. With this work, we argue that the values criticized as missing from social media ranking algorithms can be operationalized and deployed today through end-user tools.</description>

      <title>Locally Differentially Private Graph Clustering via the Power Iteration Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a locally differentially private graph clustering algorithm. Previous works have explored this problem, including approaches that apply spectral clustering to graphs generated via the randomized response algorithm. However, these methods only achieve accurate results when the privacy budget is in $\Omega(\log n)$, which is unsuitable for many practical applications. In response, we present an interactive algorithm based on the power iteration method. Given that the noise introduced by the largest eigenvector constant can be significant, we incorporate a technique to eliminate this constant. As a result, our algorithm attains local differential privacy with a constant privacy budget when the graph is well-clustered and has a minimum degree of $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{n})$. In contrast, while randomized response has been shown to produce accurate results under the same minimum degree condition, it is limited to graphs generated from the stochastic block model. We perform experiments to demonstrate that our method outperforms spectral clustering applied to randomized response results.</description>

      <title>Using co-sharing to identify use of mainstream news for promoting potentially misleading narratives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Much of the research quantifying volume and spread of online misinformation measures the construct at the source level, identifying a set of specific unreliable domains that account for a relatively small share of news consumption. This source-level dichotomy obscures the potential for users to repurpose factually true information from reliable sources to advance misleading narratives. We demonstrate this potentially far more prevalent form of misinformation by identifying articles from reliable sources that are frequently co-shared with (shared by users who also shared) "fake" news on social media, and concurrently extracting narratives present in fake news content and claims fact-checked as false. Specifically in this study, we use Twitter/X data from May 2018 to November 2021 matched to a U.S. voter file. We find that narratives present in misinformation content are significantly more likely to occur in co-shared articles than in articles from the same reliable sources that are not co-shared, consistent with users using information from mainstream sources to enhance the credibility and reach of potentially misleading claims.</description>

      <title>Staying Fresh: Efficient Algorithms for Timely Social Information Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13260v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In location-based social networks (LBSNs), users sense urban point-of-interest (PoI) information in the vicinity and share such information with friends in online social networks. Given users' limited social connections and severe lags in disseminating fresh PoI to all, major LBSNs aim to enhance users' social PoI sharing by selecting $k$ out of $m$ users as hotspots and broadcasting their fresh PoI information to the entire user community. This motivates us to study a new combinatorial optimization problem that involves the interplay between an urban sensing network and an online social network. We prove that this problem is NP-hard and also renders existing approximation solutions not viable. Through analyzing the interplay effects between the two networks, we successfully transform the involved PoI-sharing process across two networks to matrix computations for deriving a closed-form objective to hold desirable properties (e.g., submodularity and monotonicity). This finding enables us to develop a polynomial-time algorithm that guarantees a ($1-\frac{m-2}{m}(\frac{k-1}{k})^k$) approximation of the optimum. Furthermore, we allow each selected user to move around and sense more PoI information to share and propose an augmentation-adaptive algorithm with decent performance guarantees. Finally, our theoretical results are corroborated by our simulation findings using both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Spread of Online Incivility in Brazilian Politics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08960v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incivility refers to behaviors that violate collective norms and disrupt cooperation within the political process. Although large-scale online data and automated techniques have enabled the quantitative analysis of uncivil discourse, prior research has predominantly focused on impoliteness or toxicity, often overlooking other behaviors that undermine democratic values. To address this gap, we propose a multidimensional conceptual framework encompassing Impoliteness, Physical Harm and Violent Political Rhetoric, Hate Speech and Stereotyping, and Threats to Democratic Institutions and Values. Using this framework, we measure the spread of online political incivility in Brazil using approximately 5 million tweets posted by 2,307 political influencers during the 2022 Brazilian general election. Through statistical modeling and network analysis, we examine the dynamics of uncivil posts at different election stages, identify key disseminators and audiences, and explore the mechanisms driving the spread of uncivil information online. Our findings indicate that impoliteness is more likely to surge during election campaigns. In contrast, the other dimensions of incivility are often triggered by specific violent events. Moreover, we find that left-aligned individual influencers are the primary disseminators of online incivility in the Brazilian Twitter/X sphere and that they disseminate not only direct incivility but also indirect incivility when discussing or opposing incivility expressed by others. They relay those content from politicians, media agents, and individuals to reach broader audiences, revealing a diffusion pattern mixing the direct and two-step flows of communication theory. This study offers new insights into the multidimensional nature of incivility in Brazilian politics and provides a conceptual framework that can be extended to other political contexts.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of community recovery in geometrically-noised stochastic block models (SBM). This work presents two primary contributions: (1) Motif--Attention Spectral Operator (MASO), an attention-based spectral operator that improves upon traditional spectral methods; and (2) Iterative Geometric Denoising (GeoDe), a configurable denoising algorithm that boosts spectral clustering performance. We demonstrate that the fusion of GeoDe+MASO significantly outperforms existing community detection methods on noisy SBMs. Furthermore, we show that using GeoDe+MASO as a denoising step improves belief propagation's community recovery by 79.7% on the Amazon Metadata dataset.</description>

      <title>Tales of the 2025 Los Angeles Fire: Hotwash for Public Health Concerns in Reddit via LLM-Enhanced Topic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wildfires have become increasingly frequent, irregular, and severe in recent years. Understanding how affected populations perceive and respond during wildfire crises is critical for timely and empathetic disaster response. Social media platforms offer a crowd-sourced channel to capture evolving public discourse, providing hyperlocal information and insight into public sentiment. This study analyzes Reddit discourse during the 2025 Los Angeles wildfires, spanning from the onset of the disaster to full containment. We collect 385 posts and 114,879 comments related to the Palisades and Eaton fires. We adopt topic modeling methods to identify the latent topics, enhanced by large language models (LLMs) and human-in-the-loop (HITL) refinement. Furthermore, we develop a hierarchical framework to categorize latent topics, consisting of two main categories, Situational Awareness (SA) and Crisis Narratives (CN). The volume of SA category closely aligns with real-world fire progressions, peaking within the first 2-5 days as the fires reach the maximum extent. The most frequent co-occurring category set of public health and safety, loss and damage, and emergency resources expands on a wide range of health-related latent topics, including environmental health, occupational health, and one health. Grief signals and mental health risks consistently accounted for 60 percentage and 40 percentage of CN instances, respectively, with the highest total volume occurring at night. This study contributes the first annotated social media dataset on the 2025 LA fires, and introduces a scalable multi-layer framework that leverages topic modeling for crisis discourse analysis. By identifying persistent public health concerns, our results can inform more empathetic and adaptive strategies for disaster response, public health communication, and future research in comparable climate-related disaster events.</description>

      <title>Flexible Generation of Preference Data for Recommendation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating a recommendation system in a controlled environment, to identify specific behaviors and user preferences, requires highly flexible synthetic data generation models capable of mimicking the patterns and trends of real datasets. In this context, we propose HYDRA, a novel preferences data generation model driven by three main factors: user-item interaction level, item popularity, and user engagement level. The key innovations of the proposed process include the ability to generate user communities characterized by similar item adoptions, reflecting real-world social influences and trends. Additionally, HYDRA considers item popularity and user engagement as mixtures of different probability distributions, allowing for a more realistic simulation of diverse scenarios. This approach enhances the model's capacity to simulate a wide range of real-world cases, capturing the complexity and variability found in actual user behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HYDRA through extensive experiments on well-known benchmark datasets. The results highlight its capability to replicate real-world data patterns, offering valuable insights for developing and testing recommendation systems in a controlled and realistic manner.

      <title>Positional Encoder Graph Quantile Neural Networks for Geographic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Positional Encoder Graph Neural Networks (PE-GNNs) are among the most effective models for learning from continuous spatial data. However, their predictive distributions are often poorly calibrated, limiting their utility in applications that require reliable uncertainty quantification. We propose the Positional Encoder Graph Quantile Neural Network (PE-GQNN), a novel framework that combines PE-GNNs with Quantile Neural Networks, partially monotonic neural blocks, and post-hoc recalibration techniques. The PE-GQNN enables flexible and robust conditional density estimation with minimal assumptions about the target distribution, and it extends naturally to tasks beyond spatial data. Empirical results on benchmark datasets show that the PE-GQNN outperforms existing methods in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification, without incurring additional computational cost. We also provide theoretical insights and identify important special cases arising from our formulation, including the PE-GNN.</description>

      <title>LLM Content Moderation and User Satisfaction: Evidence from Response Refusals in Chatbot Arena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM safety and ethical alignment are widely discussed, but the impact of content moderation on user satisfaction remains underexplored. In particular, little is known about how users respond when models refuse to answer a prompt-one of the primary mechanisms used to enforce ethical boundaries in LLMs. We address this gap by analyzing nearly 50,000 model comparisons from Chatbot Arena, a platform where users indicate their preferred LLM response in pairwise matchups, providing a large-scale setting for studying real-world user preferences. Using a novel RoBERTa-based refusal classifier fine-tuned on a hand-labeled dataset, we distinguish between refusals due to ethical concerns and technical limitations. Our results reveal a substantial refusal penalty: ethical refusals yield significantly lower win rates than both technical refusals and standard responses, indicating that users are especially dissatisfied when models decline a task for ethical reasons. However, this penalty is not uniform. Refusals receive more favorable evaluations when the underlying prompt is highly sensitive (e.g., involving illegal content), and when the refusal is phrased in a detailed and contextually aligned manner. These findings underscore a core tension in LLM design: safety-aligned behaviors may conflict with user expectations, calling for more adaptive moderation strategies that account for context and presentation.</description>

      <title>Re-ranking Using Large Language Models for Mitigating Exposure to Harmful Content on Social Media Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms utilize Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered recommendation algorithms to maximize user engagement, which can result in inadvertent exposure to harmful content. Current moderation efforts, reliant on classifiers trained with extensive human-annotated data, struggle with scalability and adapting to new forms of harm. To address these challenges, we propose a novel re-ranking approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Our method dynamically assesses and re-ranks content sequences, effectively mitigating harmful content exposure without requiring extensive labeled data. Alongside traditional ranking metrics, we also introduce two new metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of re-ranking in reducing exposure to harmful content. Through experiments on three datasets, three models and across three configurations, we demonstrate that our LLM-based approach significantly outperforms existing proprietary moderation approaches, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for harm mitigation.</description>
