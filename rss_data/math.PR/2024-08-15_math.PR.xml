      <title>Spectral gap and cutoff of the simple exclusion process with IID conductances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the spectral gap and mixing time of the simple exclusion process with $k$ particles in the line segment $[1, N]$ with conductances $c(x, x+1)_{1\le x&lt;N}$ where $c(x, x+1)&gt;0$ is the rate of swapping the contents of the two sites $x$ and $ x+1$. Under the IID assumption on $(c(x, x+1))_{x \in \mathbb{N}}$ with unit inverse expectation $\mathbb{E}[1/c(x, x+1)]=1$, we prove that the spectral gap, denoted by $\mathrm{gap}_{N,k}$, of the process satisfies $\mathrm{gap}_{N, k}=(1+o(1))\pi^2/N^2$ and the eigenfunction $g_N$ with $g_N(1)=1$ corresponding to the spectral gap of one particle case is well approximated by $h_N(x) := \cos\left( (x-1/2)\pi/N \right)$. Under some further assumptions on $c(x, x+1)_{x \in \mathbb{N} }$ and $k$, we prove that around time $(1+o(1)) (2 \pi^2)^{-1} N^2 \log k$, the total variation distance to equilibrium drops abruptly from $1$ to $0$.</description>

      <title>A logical limit law for the sequential model of preferential attachment graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a sequence of random graphs, the limit law we refer to is the existence of a limiting probability of any graph property that can be expressed in terms of predicate logic. A zero-one limit law is shown by Shelah and Spencer for Erd\"{o}s-Renyi graphs given that the connection rate has an irrational exponent. We show a limit law for preferential attachment graphs which admit a P\'{o}lya urn representation. The two extreme cases of the parametric model, the uniform attachment graph and the sequential Barab\'{a}si-Albert model, are covered separately as they exhibit qualitative differences regarding the distribution of cycles of bounded length in the graph.</description>

      <title>Probability graphons and P-variables: two equivalent viewpoints for dense weighted graph limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop further the graph limit theory for dense weighted graph sequences. In particular, we consider probability graphons, which have recently appeared in graph limit theory as continuum representations of weighted graphs, and we introduce P-variables, which also appear in the context of the Aldous-Hoover theorem for exchangeable infinite random arrays, as an alternative continuum representation for weighted graphs. In particular, we explain how P-variables are related to probability graphons in a similar way in which random variables are related to probability measures. We define a metric for P-variables (inspired by action convergence in the graph limit theory of sparse graph sequences) and show that convergence of P-variables in this metric is equivalent to probability graphons convergence. We exploit this equivalence to translate several results from the theory of probability graphons to P-variables. In addition, we prove several properties of P-variables convergence, thus showing new properties also for probability graphons convergence and demonstrating the power of the connection between probability graphons and P-variables. Furthermore, we show how P-variables convergence can be easily modified and generalised to cover other combinatorial structures such as bipartite graphs and hypergraphs.</description>

Abstract: Stochastic dynamical systems consisting of non-invertible continuous maps on an interval are studied. It is proved that if they satisfy the recently introduced so-called $\mu$-injectivity and some mild assumptions, then proximality, asymptotic stability and a central limit theorem hold.</description>

      <title>Uniform Consistency of Generalized Fr\'echet Means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the Fr\'echet mean on metric spaces, which we call $\phi$-means. Our generalization is indexed by a convex function $\phi$. We find necessary and sufficient conditions for $\phi$-means to be finite and provide a tight bound for the diameter of the intrinsic mean set. We also provide sufficient conditions under which all the $\phi$-means coincide in a single point. Then, we prove the consistency of the sample $\phi$-mean to its population analogue. We also find conditions under which classes of $\phi$-means converge uniformly, providing a Glivenko-Cantelli result. Finally, we illustrate applications of our results and provide algorithms for the computation of $\phi$-means.</description>

      <title>Clique structure and other network properties of the tensor product of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the number of cliques of given size and the size of the largest clique in tensor product $G \times H$ of two Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs $G$ and $H$. Then an extended clustering coefficient is introduced and is studied for $G \times H$. Restriction to the standard clustering coefficient has a direct relation to the local efficiency of the graph, and the results are also interpreted in terms of the efficiency. As a last statistic of interest, the number of isolated vertices is analyzed for $G \times H$. The paper is concluded with a discussion of the modular product of random graphs, and the relation to the maximum common subgraph problem.</description>

      <title>Finite Dimensional Projections of HJB Equations in the Wasserstein Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper continues the study of controlled interacting particle systems with common noise started in [W. Gangbo, S. Mayorga and A. {\'{S}}wi{\k{e}}ch, \textit{SIAM J. Math. Anal.} 53 (2021), no. 2, 1320--1356] and [S. Mayorga and A. {\'{S}}wi{\k{e}}ch, \textit{SIAM J. Control Optim.} 61 (2023), no. 2, 820--851]. First, we extend the following results of the previously mentioned works to the case of multiplicative noise: (i) We generalize the convergence of the value functions $u_n$ corresponding to control problems of $n$ particles to the value function $V$ corresponding to an appropriately defined infinite dimensional control problem; (ii) we prove, under certain additional assumptions, $C^{1,1}$ regularity of $V$ in the spatial variable. The second main contribution of the present work is the proof that if $DV$ is continuous (which, in particular, includes the previously proven case of $C^{1,1}$ regularity in the spatial variable), the value function $V$ projects precisely onto the value functions $u_n$. Using this projection property, we show that optimal controls of the finite dimensional problem correspond to optimal controls of the infinite dimensional problem and vice versa. In the case of a linear state equation, we are able to prove that $V$ projects precisely onto the value functions $u_n$ under relaxed assumptions on the coefficients of the cost functional by using approximation techniques in the Wasserstein space, thus covering cases where $V$ may not be differentiable.</description>

      <title>Liouville conformal field theory and the quantum zipper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13200v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sheffield showed that conformally welding a $\gamma$-Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) surface to itself gives a Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) curve with parameter $\kappa = \gamma^2$ as the interface, and Duplantier-Miller-Sheffield proved similar results for $\kappa = \frac{16}{\gamma^2}$ for $\gamma$-LQG surfaces with boundaries decorated by looptrees of disks or by continuum random trees. We study these dynamics for LQG surfaces coming from Liouville conformal field theory (LCFT). At stopping times depending only on the curve, we give an explicit description of the surface and curve in terms of LCFT and SLE. This has applications to both LCFT and SLE. We prove the boundary BPZ equations for LCFT, a crucial input for subsequent work with Remy, Sun and Zhu deriving the structure constants of boundary LCFT. With Yu we prove the reversibility of whole-plane SLE$_\kappa$ for $\kappa &gt; 8$ via a novel radial mating-of-trees, and will show the space of LCFT surfaces is closed under conformal welding.</description>

      <title>Transience of vertex-reinforced jump processes with long-range jumps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the vertex-reinforced jump process on the $d$-dimensional lattice with long-range jumps is transient in any dimension $d$ as long as the initial weights do not decay too fast. The main ingredients in the proof are: an analysis of the corresponding random environment on finite boxes, a comparison with a hierarchical model, and the reduction of the hierarchical model to a non-homogeneous effective one-dimensional model. For $d\ge 3$ we also prove transience of the vertex-reinforced jump process with possibly long-range jumps as long as nearest-neighbor weights are large enough.</description>

Abstract: Reinforced Galton-Watson processes have been introduced in arxiv:2306.02476 as population models with non-overlapping generations, such that reproduction events along genealogical lines can be repeated at random. We investigate here some of their sample path properties such as asymptotic growth rates and survival, for which the effects of reinforcement on the evolution appear quite strikingly.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the Poisson additive process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Poisson additive process is a binary conditionally additive process such that the first is the Poisson process provided the second is given. We prove the existence and uniqueness of predictable increasing mean intensity for the Poisson additive process. Besides, we establish a likelihood ratio formula for the Poisson additive process. It directly implies there doesn't exist an anticipative Poisson additive process which is absolutely continuous with respect to the standard Poisson process, which confirms a conjecture proposed by P. Br\'emaud in his PhD thesis in 1972. When applied to the Hawkes process, it concludes that the self-exciting function is constant. Similar results are also obtained for the Wiener additive process and Markov additive process.</description>

      <title>Bernstein-type Inequalities for Markov Chains and Markov Processes: A Simple and Robust Proof</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04930v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a new Bernstein-type deviation inequality for general discrete-time Markov chains via an elementary approach. More robust than existing works in the literature, our result only requires the Markov chain to satisfy an iterated Poincar\'e inequality. Moreover, our method can be readily generalized to continuous-time Markov processes.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Ising Models: Contours, Phase Transitions and Decaying Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.06103v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Fr\"{o}hlich-Spencer and subsequent authors who introduced the notion of contour for long-range systems, we provide a definition of contour and a direct proof for the phase transition for ferromagnetic long-range Ising models on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 2$. The argument, which is based on a multi-scale analysis, works for the sharp region $\alpha&gt;d$ and improves previous results obtained by Park for $\alpha&gt;3d+1$, and by Ginibre, Grossmann, and Ruelle for $\alpha&gt; d+1$, where $\alpha$ is the power of the coupling constant. The key idea is to avoid a large number of small contours. As an application, we prove the persistence of the phase transition when we add a polynomially decaying magnetic field with power $\delta&gt;0$ as $h^*|x|^{-\delta}$, where $h^* &gt;0$. For $d&lt;\alpha&lt;d+1$, the phase transition occurs when $\delta&gt;\alpha-d$, and when $h^*$ is small enough over the critical line $\delta=\alpha-d$. For $\alpha \geq d+1$, $\delta&gt;1$ is enough to prove the phase transition, and for $\delta=1$ we have to ask $h^*$ small. The natural conjecture is that this region is also sharp for the phase transition problem when we have a decaying field.</description>

      <title>Convergence Error Analysis of Reflected Gradient Langevin Dynamics for Globally Optimizing Non-Convex Constrained Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.10215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient Langevin dynamics and a variety of its variants have attracted increasing attention owing to their convergence towards the global optimal solution, initially in the unconstrained convex framework while recently even in convex constrained non-convex problems. In the present work, we extend those frameworks to non-convex problems on a non-convex feasible region with a global optimization algorithm built upon reflected gradient Langevin dynamics and derive its convergence rates. By effectively making use of its reflection at the boundary in combination with the probabilistic representation for the Poisson equation with the Neumann boundary condition, we present promising convergence rates, particularly faster than the existing one for convex constrained non-convex problems.</description>

Using tools from homogenous dynamics and geometry of numbers we prove the existence of a continuous distribution function $F(r)$ for the normalized deepest cusp excursions of the unipotent flow. We find closed analytic formulas for $F(r)$ for $r \in [-\frac{1}{2} \log 2, \infty)$, and establish asymptotic behavior of $F(r)$ as $r \to -\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given two equally long, uniformly random binary strings, the expected length of their longest common subsequence (LCS) is asymptotically proportional to the strings' length. Finding the proportionality coefficient $\gamma$, i.e. the limit of the normalised LCS length for two random binary strings of length $n \to \infty$, is a very natural problem, first posed by Chv\'atal and Sankoff in 1975, and as yet unresolved. This problem has relevance to diverse fields ranging from combinatorics and algorithm analysis to coding theory and computational biology. Using methods of statistical mechanics, as well as some existing results on the combinatorial structure of LCS, we link constant $\gamma$ to the parameters of a certain stochastic particle process, which we use to obtain a new estimate for $\gamma$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers sequences of points on the real line which have been randomly translated, and provides conditions under which various notions of convergence to a limiting point process are equivalent. In particular we consider convergence in correlation, convergence in distribution, and convergence of spacings between points. We also prove a simple Tauberian theorem regarding rescaled correlations. The results are applied to zeros of the Riemann zeta-function to show that several ways to state the GUE Hypothesis are equivalent. The proof relies on a moment bound of A. Fujii.</description>

Abstract: We extend the work on optimal investment and consumption of a population considered in [2] to a general stochastic setting over a finite time horizon. We incorporate the Cobb-Douglas production function in the capital dynamics while the consumption utility function and the drift rate in the population dynamics can be general, in contrast with [2, 30, 31]. The dynamic programming formulation yields an unconventional nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, in which the Cobb-Douglas production function as the coefficient of the gradient of the value function induces the mismatching of power rates between capital and population. Moreover, the equation has a very singular term, essentially a very negative power of the partial derivative of the value function with respect to the capital, coming from the optimization of control, and their resolution turns out to be a complex problem not amenable to classical analysis. To show that this singular term, which has not been studied in any physical systems yet, does not actually blow up, we establish new pointwise generalized power laws for the partial derivative of the value function. Our contribution lies in providing a theoretical treatment that combines both the probabilistic approach and theory of partial differential equations to derive the pointwise upper and lower bounds as well as energy estimates in weighted Sobolev spaces. By then, we accomplish showing the well-posedness of classical solutions to a non-canonical parabolic equation arising from a long-lasting problem in macroeconomics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hydrodynamics for the Volterra lattice: Ballistic and nonballistic behavior of correlation functions</title>

Abstract: In recent years, a lot of effort has been put in describing the hydrodynamic behavior of integrable systems. In this paper, we describe such picture for the Volterra lattice. Specifically, we are able to explicitly compute the susceptibility matrix and the current-field correlation matrix in terms of the density of states of the Volterra lattice endowed with a Generalized Gibbs ensemble. Furthermore, we apply the theory of linear Generalized Hydrodynamics to describe the Euler scale behavior of the correlation functions. We anticipate that the solution to the Generalized Hydrodynamics equations develops shocks at $\xi_0=\frac{x}{t}$; so this linear approximation does not fully describe the behavior of correlation functions. Intrigued but this fact, we performed several numerical investigations which show that, exactly when the solution to the hydrodynamic equations develops shock, the correlation functions show an highly oscillatory behavior. In view of this empirical observation, we believe that at this point $\xi_0$ the diffusive contribution are not sub-leading corrections to the ballistic transport, but they are of the same order.</description>

      <title>Iterative Improvement of an Additively Regularized Topic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topic modelling is fundamentally a soft clustering problem (of known objects -- documents, over unknown clusters -- topics). That is, the task is incorrectly posed. In particular, the topic models are unstable and incomplete. All this leads to the fact that the process of finding a good topic model (repeated hyperparameter selection, model training, and topic quality assessment) can be particularly long and labor-intensive. We aim to simplify the process, to make it more deterministic and provable. To this end, we present a method for iterative training of a topic model. The essence of the method is that a series of related topic models are trained so that each subsequent model is at least as good as the previous one, i.e., that it retains all the good topics found earlier. The connection between the models is achieved by additive regularization. The result of this iterative training is the last topic model in the series, which we call the iteratively updated additively regularized topic model (ITAR). Experiments conducted on several collections of natural language texts show that the proposed ITAR model performs better than other popular topic models (LDA, ARTM, BERTopic), its topics are diverse, and its perplexity (ability to "explain" the underlying data) is moderate.</description>
