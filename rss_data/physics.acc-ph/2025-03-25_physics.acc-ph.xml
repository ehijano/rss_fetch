      <title>Nuclear Physics at BRIF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Beijing Radioactive Ion-beam Facility (BRIF), which is based on Isotope Separation On-Line (ISOL) technique, consists of a 100 MeV proton cyclotron as the driving accelerator, a two-stage ISOL system for ion separation, a 13-MV tandem accelerator for post-acceleration, a superconducting linac for further boosting beam energies. It is capable of providing ISOL beams in the energy range from 60 to 300 keV, and post-accelerated beams in the energy range from 3 to 10 MeV/u for nuclei with mass numbers of A &lt; 80 by Isotope Separation On-Line (ISOL) technique. For nuclei with A up to 170, energies are still able to reach 3 MeV/u. This facility offers opportunities to address key questions of current interest in nuclear astrophysics, nuclear structure and reactions of unstable nuclei. In this review we present a comprehensive introduction to the BRIF and the typical experimental instruments installed on it, and then summarize current experimental results on unstable Na and Rb isotopes and future plan for further development of the BRIF to improve its performance.</description>

      <title>Offset Finding of Beamline Parameters on the METRIXS Beamline at BESSY II Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beamline alignment is challenging as the beamline components must be set up ideally so that the rays follow the desired optical path. Automated methods using a digital twin allow for faster diagnostics and improved beam properties compared to manual tuning. We introduce an automated method of finding the offsets to improve this digital twin model. These offsets represent the unknown but constant differences between the beamline parameter positions as set up at the physical beamline and the corresponding parameter positions of its digital twin. Our method assumes the capability to execute precise relative movements with a known step size for these parameters, although the absolute position information is unknown. By combining the surrogate model with a global optimizer, we successfully determine offsets for 34 beamline parameters on a simulated METRIXS beamline at the BESSY II synchrotron radiation source in Berlin.</description>

      <title>Experimental Evidence of Vortex $\gamma$ Photons in All-Optical Inverse Compton Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vortex $\gamma$ photons carrying orbital angular momenta (OAM) hold great potential for various applications. However, their generation remains a great challenge. Here, we successfully generate sub-MeV vortex $\gamma$ photons via all-optical inverse Compton scattering of relativistic electrons colliding with a sub-relativistic Laguerre-Gaussian laser. In principle, directly measuring the OAM of $\gamma$ photons is challenging due to their incoherence and extremely short wavelength. Therein, we put forward a novel method to determine the OAM properties by revealing the quantum opening angle of vortex $\gamma$ photons, since vortex particles exhibit not only a spiral phase but also transverse momentum according to the quantum electrodynamics theory. Thus,$\gamma$ photons carrying OAM anifest a much larger angular distribution than those without OAM, which has been clearly observed in our experiments. This angular expansion is considered as an overall effect lying beyond classical theory. Our method provides the first experimental evidence for detecting vortex $\gamma$ photons and opens a new perspective for investigating OAM-induced quantum phenomena in broad fields.</description>

      <title>A method for reversing the laser modulation in a Storage ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10573v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pursuit of coherent radiation generation remains a key direction in the advancement of storage ring light sources. Despite the potential of laser modulation in achieving this goal, it leads to a significant decline in the quality of the electron beam. Efforts to mitigate this decline have resulted in the proposal of demodulation schemes. However, implementing modulation and demodulation within the storage ring presents significant challenges due to dynamical and spatial constraints within straight sections. In this study, we propose a straightforward and easily implementable method for achieving reversible laser modulation in a storage ring. Notably, our approach circumvents the need for special storage ring requirements, such as lengthy straight sections or bypass section. Simulation results demonstrate a substantial restoration of beam quality following demodulation. This innovative scheme holds great promise for the realization of high repetition rate coherent storage ring light sources.</description>
