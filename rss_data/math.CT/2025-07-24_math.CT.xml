      <title>Resourceful Traces for Commuting Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, when the actions of a Mazurkiewicz trace are considered not merely as atomic (i.e., mere names) but transformations from a specified type of inputs to a specified type of outputs, we obtain a novel notion of presentation for effectful categories (also known as generalised Freyd categories), a well-known algebraic structure in the semantics of side-effecting computation. Like the usual representation of traces as graphs, our notion of presentation gives rise to a graphical calculus for effectful categories. We use our presentations to give a construction of the commuting tensor product of free effectful categories, capturing the combination of systems in which the actions of each must commute with one another, while still permitting exchange of resources</description>

      <title>Distributing Retractions, Weak Distributive Laws and Applications to Monads of Hyperspaces, Continuous Valuations and Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given two monads $S$, $T$ on a category where idempotents split, and a weak distributive law between them, one can build a combined monad $U$. Making explicit what this monad $U$ is requires some effort. When we already have an idea what $U$ should be, we show how to recognize that $U$ is indeed the combined monad obtained from $S$ and $T$: it suffices to exhibit what we call a distributing retraction of $ST$ onto $U$. We show that distributing retractions and weak distributive laws are in one-to-one correspondence, in a 2-categorical setting. We give three applications, where $S$ is the Smyth, Hoare or Plotkin hyperspace monad, $T$ is a monad of continuous valuations, and $U$ is a monad of previsions or of forks, depending on the case. As a byproduct, this allows us to describe the algebras of monads of superlinear, resp. sublinear previsions. In the category of compact Hausdorff spaces, the Plotkin hyperspace monad is sometimes known as the Vietoris monad, the monad of probability valuations coincides with the Radon monad, and we infer that the associated combined monad is the monad of normalized forks.</description>

      <title>Additive Invariants of Open Petri Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01643v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify all additive invariants of open Petri nets: these are $\mathbb{N}$-valued invariants which are additive with respect to sequential and parallel composition of open Petri nets. In particular, we prove two classification theorems: one for open Petri nets and one for monically open Petri nets (i.e. open Petri nets whose interfaces are specified by monic maps). Our results can be summarized as follows. The additive invariants of open Petri nets are completely determined by their values on a particular class of single-transition Petri nets. However, for monically open Petri nets, the additive invariants are determined by their values on transitionless Petri nets and all single-transition Petri nets. Our results confirm a conjecture of John Baez (stated during the AMS' 2022 Mathematical Research Communities workshop).</description>
