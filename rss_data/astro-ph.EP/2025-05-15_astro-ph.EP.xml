      <title>Diversity of Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review article delves into the study of low-mass exoplanets: super-Earths, mini-Neptunes and the new categories within and between that we are starting to discover. We provide an overview of current exoplanet observational capabilities, their limitations, and what they are allowing us to learn about low-mass planets. We briefly summarize the most important aspects of planet formation, with an emphasis on processes that may be testable with small exoplanets, in particular those that affect their composition. We also describe the observed compositional diversity of low-mass exoplanets and what it teaches us about planet formation pathways. We finish this review summarizing the study of the composition of small exoplanets during the very last stage of stellar evolution, by studying white dwarfs. This review is written as the JWST is making its first contributions to small planet characterization, rapidly opening new lines of inquiry.</description>

      <title>Velocity shift and SNR limits for high-resolution spectroscopy of hot Jupiters using Keck/KPIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS) is a technique for detecting the atmospheres of close-in planets using the change in the projected planet velocity over a few hours. To date, this technique has most often been applied to hot Jupiters, which show a large change in velocity on short timescales. Applying this technique to planets with longer orbital periods requires an improved understanding of how the size of the velocity shift and the observational signal-to-noise ratio impact detectability. We present grids of simulated Keck/KPIC observations of hot Jupiter systems, varying the observed planet velocity shift and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), to estimate the minimum thresholds for a successful detection. These simulations realistically model the cross-correlation process, which includes a time-varying telluric spectrum in the simulated data and data detrending via PCA. We test three different planet models based on an ultra-hot Jupiter, a classical hot Jupiter, and a metal-rich hot Saturn. For a ${6}\sigma$ detection suitable for retrieval analysis, we estimate a minimum velocity shift of $\Delta v_\text{pl} \sim {30, 50, 60}$ km/s, compared to an instrumental resolution of 9 km/s, and minimum SNR $\sim 370, 800, 1200$ for the respective planet models. We find that reported KPIC detections to-date fall above or near the ${6}\sigma$ limit. These simulations can be efficiently re-run for other planet models and observational parameters, which can be useful in observation planning and detection validation.</description>

      <title>Open Source High-Resolution Exoplanet Atmosphere Retrievals with POSEIDON</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution spectroscopy (R &gt; 25,000) has opened new opportunities to characterize exoplanet atmospheres from the ground. By resolving individual lines in planetary emission and transmission spectra, one can sensitively probe the chemical inventory and temperature structure of exoplanets. However, a significant challenge to reliable and reproducible atmospheric inferences from high-resolution datasets has been the lack of open source codes for high-resolution retrievals. Here, we present a unified high-resolution retrieval framework, for both emission and transmission spectroscopy, made publicly available within the open source POSEIDON retrieval code. Our high-resolution retrieval framework is fast (typically &lt; 12 hours), accessible (no GPUs required), and well-documented via Python notebooks. We validate our framework by reproducing previous emission retrievals of the hot Jupiter WASP-77Ab and transmission retrievals of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b. Our results are broadly consistent with those of published works when making the same data detrending assumptions, but we demonstrate that user choices can subtly propagate into retrieved chemical abundances.</description>

      <title>Resonance Capture of a Test Particle by an Eccentric Planet in the Presence of Externally-Driven Apsidal Precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planets undergoing convergent migration can be captured into mean-motion resonance (MMR), in which the planets' periods are related by integer ratios. The dynamics of MMR are typically considered in isolation, including only the forces between the planets and with the central star. However, the planets are often subjected to external forces that induce apsidal precessions, which may split the MMR into two sub-resonances and give rise to chaotic motion due to resonance overlap. In this study, we investigate how such externally induced differential apsidal precession affects capture into first-order $j:j+1$ MMRs. We study the restricted three-body problem for a test particle outside of an eccentric planet, with the planet undergoing outward migration. We find that capture can be sensitive to the differential apsidal precession, even when the precession rate is much smaller than the resonance overlap criterion. We identify two critical precession frequencies -- related to resonance overlap and secular apsidal resonance -- around which capture is disrupted even for very small planet eccentricity. Our results may help clarify the capture process of resonant trans-Neptunian objects by outward-migrating Neptune in early Solar System.</description>

      <title>The Hot-Neptune Initiative (HONEI) I. Two hot sub-Neptunes on a close-in, eccentric orbit (TOI-5800 b) and a farther-out, circular orbit (TOI-5817 b)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neptune-sized exoplanets are key targets for atmospheric studies, yet their formation and evolution remain poorly understood due to their diverse characteristics and limited sample size. The so-called "Neptune desert", a region of parameter space with a dearth of short-period sub- to super-Neptunes, is a critical testbed for theories of atmospheric escape and migration. The HONEI program aims to confirm and characterize the best Neptune-sized candidates for composition, atmospheric and population studies. By measuring planetary masses with high precision, we want to provide the community with optimal targets whose atmosphere can be effectively explored with the JWST or by ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy. For this purpose, we started a radial velocity follow-up campaign, using the twin high-precision spectrographs HARPS and HARPS-N, to measure the masses of TESS Neptune-sized candidates and confirm their planetary nature. In this first paper of the series, we confirm the planetary nature of two candidates: TOI-5800b and TOI-5817b. TOI-5800b is a hot sub-Neptune ($R_p=2.44\pm0.29$ $R_\oplus$, $M_p=9.4\pm1.8$ $M_\oplus$, $T_{eq} = 1108\pm20$ K) located at the lower edges of the Neptune desert ($P=2.628$ days) and is the most eccentric planet ($e\sim0.3$) ever found within $P&lt;3$ d. TOI-5800b is expected to be still in the tidal migration phase with its parent star, a K3 V dwarf ($V=9.6$ mag), although its eccentricity could arise from interactions with another object in the system. Having a high-transmission spectroscopy metric ($TSM\sim103$), it represents a prime target for future atmospheric characterization. TOI-5817b is a relatively hot sub-Neptune ($R_p=3.08\pm0.14$ $R_\oplus$, $M_p=10.3\pm1.4$ $M_\oplus$, $T_{eq}=950\pm21$ K) located in the Neptune savanna ($P=15.610$ d) [...]</description>

      <title>Non-transiting exoplanets as a means to understand star-planet interactions in close-in systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies showed evidence of a dearth of close-in exoplanets around fast rotators, which can be explained by the combined action of intense tidal and magnetic interactions between planet and their host star. Detecting more exoplanets experiencing such interactions, with orbits evolving on short timescales, is therefore crucial to improve our understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms. For this purpose, we perform a new search for close-in non-transiting substellar companions in the Kepler data, focusing on orbital periods below 2.3 days. We focus on main-sequence solar-type stars and subgiant stars for which a surface rotation period was measured. For each star, we look for an excess in the power spectral density of the light curve, that could correspond to the signature of a close-in non-transiting companion. We compare our candidates with existing catalogues to eliminate potential contaminants in our sample, and we visually inspect the phase-folded light curve and its wavelet decomposition. We identify 88 stars, exhibiting a signature consistent with the presence of a close non-transiting substellar companion. We show that the objects in our sample are located mostly within the dearth zone, emphasising the importance of performing follow-up of such systems in order to gather observational evidence of star-planet interactions.</description>

      <title>Cislunar Mean-Motion Resonances: Definitions, Widths, and Comparisons with Resonant Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lunar mean-motion resonances (MMRs) significantly shape cislunar dynamics beyond GEO, forming stable-unstable orbit pairs with corresponding intermingled chaotic and regular regions. The resonance zone is rigorously defined using the separatrix of unstable resonant periodic orbits surrounding stable quasi-periodic regions. Our study leverages the planar, circular, restricted three-body problem (PCR3BP) to estimate the (stable) resonance widths and (unstable) chaotic resonance zones of influence of the 2:1 and 3:1 MMRs across various Jacobi constants, employing a Poincar\'e map at perigee and presenting findings in easily interpretable geocentric orbital elements. An analysis of the semi-major axis versus eccentricity plane reveals broader regions of resonance influence than those predicted by semi-analytical models based on the perturbed Kepler problem. A comparison with high-fidelity 3-dimensional ephemeris propagation of several spacecraft - TESS, IBEX, and Spektr-R - in these regions is made, which shows good agreement with the simplified CR3BP model.</description>

      <title>Retrieving interior properties of hot Jupiters with Love numbers and atmospheric measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding exoplanet interiors is crucial for interpreting atmospheric observations and constraining their evolution and formation. However, due to limited observational constraints, interiors structures remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate how new observational constraints, such as the Love number and atmospheric metallicity, improve our ability to characterize the interiors of hot Jupiters, planets for which Love number measurements are most feasible. We assess the precision required in Love number measurements to derive interior properties using both a simple two-layer homogeneous model and a more complex dilute core model. To account for observational uncertainties, we implement a retrieval framework. Our results show that accurately constraining core mass and bulk metallicity requires a high-precision Love number measurement, better than 40% for a homogeneous model and 15% for a dilute core model, along with an atmospheric metallicity measurement. We apply our retrieval framework to five planets with observed Love numbers, of which only WASP-19Ab has both an atmospheric metallicity constraint and a highly precise Love number measurement, with a precision of 12%. For this flagship planet, both models confirm the presence of a core, although we cannot yet distinguish between a compact core or diluted core. With the homogeneous model, we find a core mass fraction of $0.21^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$, corresponding to $79^{+21}_{-18}$ $M_\mathrm{earth}$. Upcoming JWST observations are expected to provide high-precision Love number measurements and precise atmospheric data, offering new insights into the structure and composition of gas giant interiors.</description>

      <title>An Eccentric Sub-Neptune Moving Into the Evaporation Desert</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though missions such as Kepler, K2, and TESS have discovered $&gt;$2,000 sub-Neptune and Neptunian planets, there is a dearth of such planets at close-in (P$\lesssim$3 days) orbits. This feature, called the Neptune desert or the evaporation desert, is believed to be primarily shaped by planetary migration and photoevaporation. However, this region is not completely devoid of planets--a small number of very hot Neptunes reside within the desert. These planets provide an opportunity to directly probe the effects of migration and photoevaporation. We present confirmation of TOI-5800 b, an eccentric sub-Neptune on a $\approx$2.6 day period that is likely actively undergoing tidal migration. We use radial velocity measurements from the Carnegie Planet Finder Spectrograph (PFS) to constrain TOI-5800 b's mass and eccentricity. We find that it has an unusually high eccentricity (0.39$\pm$0.07) for its short orbit. TOI-5800 is therefore currently experiencing high levels of tidal heating as it moves into the desert. Ranked as a top candidate for transmission and emission spectroscopy within its temperature and radius regime, TOI-5800 b is a prime target for atmospheric characterization with JWST. TOI-5800 b presents a unique opportunity to study the atmosphere of a planet undergoing tidal heating and to probe the composition of sub-Neptune planets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main bottleneck in assessing the accuracy of Mars orbit is the unknown value of the asteroids in the Main Asteroid Belt. Nowadays a modeling with 343 asteroids as point masses is used, with the relative masses fitted to observational data. In the current work we propose an innovative methodology to reduce the number of asteroids implemented as point masses, thus reducing the number of parameters to be fitted, without a significant degradation of the postfit residuals.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Search for Trace Molecules in Exoplanet K2-18 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first transmission spectrum of the habitable-zone sub-Neptune K2-18 b with JWST has opened a new avenue for atmospheric characterisation of temperate low-mass exoplanets. The observations led to inferences of methane and carbon dioxide, as well as of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and/or dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), both potential biosignatures. However, robust identification of DMS and/or DMDS requires further observations to increase the detection significances. More theoretical studies are also needed to identify potential false positives and possible abiotic sources for these molecules. In the present work we demonstrate the next step in this direction with a comprehensive and agnostic search for other chemical species in the atmosphere of K2-18 b. Our exploration includes 650 molecules, spanning a wide range of trace gases, including biotic, abiotic, and anthropogenic gases on Earth. We investigate possible evidence for any of these gases using three metrics: (a) evidence in the JWST mid-infrared spectrum, (b) evidence in the JWST near-infrared spectrum, and (c) plausible sources of production. We find three molecules, including DMS, which appear promising across the datasets considered. The two molecules besides DMS are diethyl sulfide and methyl acrylonitrile, which are more complex than DMS, biogenic on Earth, and have no significant sources known beyond Earth. A few other gases also provide comparable fits to a subset of the data considered but again with limited known plausible sources. Our study highlights the need for further observations to distinguish between possible trace gases in K2-18 b and theoretical work to establish their plausible sources if confirmed on this planet.</description>

      <title>"Ashfall" Induced by Molecular Outflow in Protostar Evolution. II. Analytical Study on the Maximum Size of Dust Grains Lifted by Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the dust dynamics in the molecular outflow using an analytical magnetohydrodynamical outflow model. Specifically, we investigate the maximum size of dust grains $a_{\rm d,max}$ that can be lifted by the outflow and whether they can escape into interstellar space. We also investigate the dependence of the maximum size of the dust grains on various outflow parameters, such as the mass ejection rate of the outflow $\dot{M}$, the disk size $r_{\rm disk}$, the mass of the central protostar $M_{*}$ and the internal dust density $\rho_{\rm mat}$. We find the empirical formula for the maximum dust size as a function of the outflow parameters. $a_{\rm d,max}$ depends on the parameters as $a_{\rm d,max}$ $\propto$ $\dot{M}^{1.0}$ $r_{\rm disk}^{-0.44}$ $M_{*}^{-0.82}$ $\rho_{\rm mat}^{-1.0}$. We also find that the dust grains with size of 100 $\rm \mu$m to 1 mm can be lifted by the outflow and can distribute in the well outside of the disk when the mass ejection rate of the outflow has the value of $10^{-7}\,M_{\odot}\rm \,yr^{-1}$ to $10^{-6}\,M_{\odot}\rm \,yr^{-1}$. This result is consistent with recent observations that show a correlation between the mass ejection rate of the outflow and the spectral index $\beta$ of the dust opacity at the envelope scale.</description>

Abstract: Hierarchical triple systems play a crucial role in various astrophysical contexts, and therefore the understanding of their stability is important. Traditional empirical stability criteria rely on a threshold value of $Q$, the ratio between the outer orbit's pericenter distance and the inner orbit's semi-major axis. However, determining a single critical value of $Q$ is impossible because there is a range of the value of $Q$ for which both stable and unstable systems exist, referred to as the mixed-region. In this study, we introduce a novel method to assess the stability of triple systems within this mixed-region. We numerically integrate equal-mass, coplanar hierarchical triples within the mixed-region. By performing Fourier analysis of the time evolution of the semi-major axes ratio during the first 1000 inner orbital periods of the systems, we find notable features in stable systems: if the main peaks are periodically spaced in the frequency domain and the continuous components and irregularly spaced peaks are small, the system tends to be stable. This observation indicates that the evolution of stable triples is more periodic than that of unstable ones. We quantified the periodicity of the triples and investigated the correlation between the Fourier power distribution and the system's lifetime. Using this correlation, we show that it is possible to determine if a triple system in the mixed-region is stable or not with very high accuracy. These findings suggest that periodicity in orbital evolution can serve as a robust indicator of stability for hierarchical triples.</description>

      <title>Mass, Gas, and Gauss around a T Tauri Star with SPIRou</title>

Abstract: Studies of young planets help us understand planet evolution and investigate important evolutionary processes such as atmospheric escape. We monitored IRAS 04125+2902, a 3 Myr-old T Tauri star with a transiting planet and a transitional disk, with the SPIRou infrared spectropolarimeter on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Using these data, we constrained the mass and density of the Jupiter-size companion to &lt;0.16 M_J and &lt;0.23 g/cm^3, respectively (90\% upper limits). These rule out a Jovian-like object and support the hypothesis that it is an ancestor to the numerous sub-Neptunes found around mature stars. We unambiguously detect magnetic fields at the stellar surface, small-scale fields reaching 1.5 kG and the large-scale field mostly consisting of a 0.80-0.95 kG dipole inclined by 5-15deg to the rotation axis. Accretion onto the star is low and/or episodic at a maximum rate of ~10^{-11} Msun/yr, indicating that IRAS 04125+2902 is most likely in a magnetic 'propeller' regime, possibly maintaining the star's slow rotation (11.3~d). We discover persistent Doppler-shifted absorption in a metastable He I line, clear evidence for a magnetized wind from a gaseous inner disk. Variability in absorption suggests structure in the disk wind that could reflect disk-planet interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Impact of the Dust Torque on the Migration of Low-mass Planets II: The Role of Pebble Accretion in Planet Growth within a Global Planet Formation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16169</link>

Abstract: Although dust constitutes only about 1% of the mass of a protoplanetary disk, recent studies demonstrate that it can exert a significant torque on low- and intermediate-mass planetary cores. We compute and quantify for the first time the influence of the dust torque on the evolution of growing planetary embryos as they move in a protoplanetary disk while growing via gas and pebble accretion. Our global model evolves the gaseous disk via viscous accretion and X-ray photoevaporation, while accounting for dust growth and evolution including coagulation, drift, and fragmentation. Our research indicates that dust torque significantly influences planetary migration, particularly driving substantial outward migration for planets forming within the water ice-line. This effect occurs due to an increased dust-to-gas mass ratio in the inner disk, resulting from inward pebble drift from outer regions. In contrast, for planets initially located beyond the water ice-line, the dust torque mitigates inward migration but does not significantly alter their paths, as the dust-to-gas ratio diminishes rapidly due to rapid pebble drift and the brief timescales of planet formation in these areas. These findings underscore the pivotal role of dust torque in shaping the migration patterns of low- and intermediate-mass planets, especially when enhanced dust concentrations in the inner disk amplify its effects</description>

      <title>Too fast to be single: Tidal evolution and photometric identification of stellar and planetary companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03839</link>

Abstract: Many stars, including those in binary or multiple systems, exhibit modified rotational evolution due to tidal interactions. While magnetic braking slows rotation in single stars, close binaries experience synchronization from tidal forces, resulting in high spin rates. Thus, fast rotators often signify synchronized binaries or planetary systems. We analyze stellar rotation in the Kepler field to photometrically identify non-single systems. Establishing an initial rotation-temperature relationship for individual stars via young clusters, we confirm our findings through magnitude excess and prior binary star system studies. Stars rotating faster than this relationship display a bimodal distribution in peculiar velocity, indicative of non-single or young stars. Leveraging this, we separate non-single stars when peculiar velocity is measurable, or estimate likelihood for those without. Our method identifies 2229 potential non-single star systems with rotation periods exceeding 3 days. For ultra-fast rotators ($P_{rot} &lt; 3 days$), we compile a catalog of 1518 ultra-short-period binary candidates, often part of hierarchical triples, reinforcing rapid spin's association with multiplicity. Applying our method to planet-host stars uncovers Kepler-1184 as a potential circumbinary system and identifies Kepler-493 and Kepler-957 potentially synchronized by close-in planets, with three others as potential false positives. Analysis of known non-single stars reveals clear tidal effects: period synchronization, orbit circularization, and a minimal pericenter constraint for binaries ($r_p \propto (P_{orb}/P_{rot})^{0.77}$). These findings offer insights into tidal evolution, provide a robust method for identifying stellar multiplicity, and have implications for stellar evolution, binary formation, and exoplanet dynamics.</description>

      <title>Architecture of Tianyu Software: Relative Photometry as a Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tianyu telescope, an one-meter robotic optical survey instrument to be constructed in Lenghu, Qinghai, China, is designed for detecting transiting exoplanets, variable stars and transients. It requires a highly automated, optimally distributed, easily extendable, and highly flexible software to enable the data processing for the raw data at rates exceeding 500MB/s. In this work, we introduce the architecture of the Tianyu pipeline and use relative photometry as a case to demonstrate its high scalability and efficiency. This pipeline is tested on the data collected from Muguang observatory and Xinglong observatory. The pipeline demonstrates high scalability, with most processing stages increasing in throughput as the number of consumers grows. Compared to a single consumer, the median throughput of image calibration, alignment, and flux extraction increases by 41%, 257%, and 107% respectively when using 5 consumers, while image stacking exhibits limited scalability due to I/O constraints. In our tests, the pipeline was able to detect two transiting sources. Besides, the pipeline captures variability in the light curves of nine known and two previously unknown variable sources in the testing data. Meanwhile, the differential photometric precision of the light curves is near the theoretical limitation. These results indicate that this pipeline is suitable for detecting transiting exoplanets and variable stars. This work builds the fundation for further development of Tianyu software.
