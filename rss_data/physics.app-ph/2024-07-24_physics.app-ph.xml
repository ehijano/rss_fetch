      <title>Synthesis of graphene aerogels toward the absorption of liquid and gas pollutants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environmental disasters, such as the oil spill in Mexico gulf or, more recently, the Mauritius oil spill caused by a bulk carrier vessel, are some of the ecological issues that the modern society faces frequently. These accidents highlight the need for development of efficient materials that can be employed to eliminate pollutants including crude oil and its derivatives, as well as toxic organic solvents. The objective of the present study is to achieve the synthesis of graphene aerogels with two main methods and to determine their efficiency as absorbents of liquid and gas pollutants. Graphene aerogels were prepared according to the information given by Hong et al. (2015) and Yang et al. (2015). Both methods are based on the chemical reduction of graphene oxide as the first step and the formation of the aerogel as the second, providing a more cost-effective solution and resulting in a lattice structure similar to graphene. The fabricated materials were investigated for their absorption capacity for liquid and gas pollutants. The specimens were mounted in airtight microenvironments saturated with a specific Volatile Organic Compound (VOC). Three VOCs were tested; formaldehyde, acetic acid and hydrochloric acid and the results were based on gravimetric measurements. In order to increase the accuracy of the obtained data, a VOCs sensor was used to measure the change of voltage before and after the introduction of graphene aerogels in a saturated microenvironment. Furthermore, the graphene aerogels were evaluated as absorbents in organic solvents, namely acetone, ethanol and methanol.</description>

      <title>Post-resonance reflections break the loss-vs-phase-resolution trade-off in microwave electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise phase control of microwaves and millimeter waves is critical for today's wireless communication and signal processing electronics. For decades, achieving even modest phase-shifting resolution has demanded a complex mix of transistor switches and passive electromagnetic structures. These true-phase delay, true-time-delay or quasi-true-time-delay circuits operate near resonances that heavily attenuate and distort signals, limiting transmission bandwidth. Despite numerous attempts, passive phase shifters have remained lossy and incompatible with high-channel-capacity beamforming, irrespective of the semiconductor fabrication process. In this article, we introduce a mechanism whereby waveguide reflectors based on coupled resonances can be reprogrammed to evade loss. Central to their operation is that loss from internal resonances is confined to low frequencies, while at high frequencies, their reflectivity is maximized and broadband phase variations, induced by those resonances, still persist. Since performance in the low-loss post-resonance spectrum is largely agnostic to the number of switches, ultra-fine digital tuning is possible. This breaks the historical tradeoff between loss and precision to achieve resolution surpassing state-of-the-art integrated circuits by over three orders (bits) of magnitude. The device does not distort the transmitted signal and consumes no power. Moreover, the chip occupies a sub-wavelength footprint in a Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor platform. This makes it an optimal candidate for seamless integration in on-chip multi-gigabit data links, radio astronomy transceivers and control hardware for millimeter-wave qubits.</description>

      <title>Ramsey interferometry of nuclear spins in diamond using stimulated Raman adiabatic passage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first experimental demonstration of stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) in nuclear-spin transitions of $^{14}$N within nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond. It is shown that the STIRAP technique suppresses the occupation of the intermediate state, which is a crucial factor for improvements in quantum sensing technology. Building on that advantage, we develop and implement a generalized version of the Ramsey interferometric scheme, employing half-STIRAP pulses to perform the necessary quantum-state manipulation with high fidelity. The enhanced robustness of the STIRAP-based Ramsey scheme to variations in the pulse parameters is experimentally demonstrated, showing good agreement with theoretical predictions. Our results pave the way for improving the long-term stability of diamond-based sensors, such as gyroscopes and frequency standards.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to combine two promising research topics in accelerator physics, i.e., optical stochastic cooling (OSC) and steady-state microbunching (SSMB). The motivation is to provide a powerful radiation source which could benefit fundamental science research and industry applications. Our study shows that such a compact OSC-SSMB storage ring using present technology can deliver EUV light with an average power of kilowatt, and spectral flux $&gt;10^{20}$ phs/s/0.1\%b.w., which is four orders of magnitude higher than existing synchrotron sources. It is expected that the presented work is of value for the development of both OSC and SSMB.</description>

      <title>Electro-Optical Switching in a Nonlinear Metasurface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear metasurfaces are multifunctional photonic elements that generate and control light, enabling multiple proof-of-principle applications, such as in nonlinear holography, beam shaping, and nanoscale sources of entangled photon pairs. Active tuning of nonlinear metasurfaces will considerably expand their prospects for integrated photonics. Here, we demonstrate a highly-tunable metasurface device that combines electrical and optical switching in a broadband frequency conversion process. Our device employs electrically tunable hybrid graphene-gold plasmons to convert mid-infrared pulses into visible light by optical gating. A strong electrical modulation of the generated visible light is attained for a broad range of mid-infrared input frequencies, and this modulation is up to 3.5x stronger for the metasurface than for plain graphene. All-optical switching measurements indicate that the device can be optically switched at Terahertz rates. Our results may lead to new applications of metasurfaces such as ultrafast signal processing, nonlinear sensing, and optical transduction.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a variational quantum eigensolver with a solid-state spin system under ambient conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulators offer the potential to utilize the quantum nature of a physical system to study another physical system. In contrast to conventional simulation, which experiences an exponential increase in computational complexity, quantum simulation cost increases only linearly with increasing size of the problem, rendering it a promising tool for applications in quantum chemistry. The variational-quantum-eigensolver algorithm is a particularly promising application for investigating molecular electronic structures. For its experimental implementation, spin-based solid-state qubits have the advantage of long decoherence time and high-fidelity quantum gates, which can lead to high accuracy in the ground-state finding. This study uses the nitrogen-vacancy-center system in diamond to implement the variational-quantum-eigensolver algorithm and successfully finds the eigenvalue of a specific Hamiltonian without the need for error-mitigation techniques. With a fidelity of 98.9% between the converged state and the ideal eigenstate, the demonstration provides an important step toward realizing a scalable quantum simulator in solid-state spin systems.</description>

      <title>Ultrabroadband thin-film lithium tantalate modulator for high-speed communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuous growth of global data traffic over the past three decades, along with advances in disaggregated computing architectures, presents significant challenges for optical transceivers in communication networks and high-performance computing systems. Specifically, there is a growing need to significantly increase data rates while reducing energy consumption and cost. High-performance optical modulators based on materials such as InP, thin-film lithium niobate (LiNbO3), or plasmonics have been developed, with LiNbO3 excelling in high-speed and low-voltage modulation. Nonetheless, the widespread industrial adoption of thin film LiNbO3 remains compounded by the rather high cost of the underlying 'on insulator' substrates -- in sharp contrast to silicon photonics, which can benefit from strong synergies with high-volume applications in conventional microelectronics. Here, we demonstrate an integrated 110 GHz modulator using thin-film lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) -- a material platform that is already commercially used for millimeter-wave filters and that can hence build upon technological and economic synergies with existing high-volume applications to offer scalable low-cost manufacturing. We show that the LiTaO3 photonic integrated circuit based modulator can support 176 GBd PAM8 transmission at net data rates exceeding 400 Gbit/s, while exhibiting a lower bias drift compared to LiNbO3. Moreover, we show that using silver electrodes can reduce microwave losses compared to previously employed gold electrodes. Our demonstration positions LiTaO3 modulator as a novel and highly promising integration platform for next-generation high-speed, energy-efficient, and cost-effective transceivers.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of Li decorated Si6C14 and Si8C12 nanocages as promising hydrogen storage media: A computational study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents the reversible hydrogen storage capacities of Li-decorated Si6C14 and Si8C12 using Density Functional Theory (DFT). The chemical stabilities of the designed Si6C14Li6 and Si8C12Li4 nanocages are investigated using HOMO-LUMO gaps and various global reactivity descriptors such as chemical hardness and electrophilicity index. Our study reveals that each Li atom decorated over the designed Si6C14 and Si8C12 nanocages can hold up to 5H2 molecules with adsorption energy lying in the optimum range of 0.14-0.085 eV, thereby yielding an overall gravimetric density of 13.8% and 9.2% respectively. The interaction between adsorbed H2 molecules and the Li metal sites is found to occur via non-covalent and closed shell type of interaction. The H2 molecules are adsorbed in a quasi-molecular fashion with elongated bond length. The molecular dynamics study reveals that most of the H2 molecules get desorbed from the designed host nanocages at 300K without causing any significant structural changes, which confirms their reversibility. When the adsorption and desorption conditions are set at 100K/60bar and 240K/1bar respectively, the practical storage gravimetric densities of Si6C14Li6 and Si8C12Li4 cages are estimated to be 13.73 wt% and 9.08 wt%, which are relatively high in comparison to the US-DOE target of 5.5 wt% by the year 2020. Hence, the computationally designed Si6C14Li6 and Si8C12Li4 nanocages can be regarded as prospective systems for hydrogen storage applications.</description>

      <title>Sub-milliwatt threshold power and tunable-bias all-optical nonlinear activation function using vanadium dioxide for wavelength-division multiplexing photonic neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for efficient hardware in neural computation highlights the limitations of electronic-based systems in terms of speed, energy efficiency, and scalability. Wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) photonic neural networks offer a high-bandwidth, low-latency alternative but require effective photonic activation functions. Here, we propose a power-efficient and tunable-bias all-optical nonlinear activation function using vanadium dioxide (VO2) for WDM photonic neural networks. We engineered a SiN/BTO waveguide with a VO2 patch to exploit the phase-change material's reversible insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) for nonlinear activation. We conducted numerical simulations to optimize the waveguide geometry and VO2 parameters, minimizing propagation and coupling losses while achieving a strong nonlinear response and low-threshold activation power. Our proposed device features a sub-milliwatt threshold power, a footprint of 5 $\mu$m, and an ELU-like activation function. Temporal dynamics show a rise time as low as 5 $\mu$s. Moreover, the bias of our device could be thermally tuned, improving the speed and power efficiency. On the other hand, performance evaluations using the CIFAR-10 dataset confirmed the device's potential for convolutional neural networks (CNN). Our results show that a hybrid VO2/SiN/BTO platform could play a prominent role in the path towards the development of high-performance photonic neural networks.</description>

      <title>Geometrical properties of 3D crossed nanowire networks</title>

Abstract: Three-dimensional interconnected nanowire networks have recently attracted notable attention for the fabrication of new devices for energy harvesting/storage, sensing, catalysis, magnetic and spintronic applications and for the design of new hardware neuromorphic computing architectures. However, the complex branching of these nanowire networks makes it challenging to investigate these 3D nanostructured systems theoretically. Here, we present a theoretical description and simulations of the geometric properties of these 3D interconnected nanowire networks with selected characteristics. Our analysis reveals that the nanowire segment length between two crossing zones follows an exponential distribution. This suggests that shorter nanowire segments have a more pronounced influence on the nanowire network properties compared to their longer counterparts. Moreover, our observations reveal a homogeneous distribution in the smallest distance between the cores of two crossing nanowires. The results are highly reproducible and unaffected by changes in the nanowire network characteristics. The density of crossing zones and interconnected nanowire segments are found to vary as the square of the nanowire density multiplied by their diameter, further multiplied by a factor dependent on the packing factor. Finally, densities of interconnected segments up to 10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ can be achieved for 22-$\mu$m-thick nanowire networks with high packing factors. This has important implications for neuromorphic computing applications, suggesting that the realization of 10$^{14}$ interconnections, which corresponds to the approximate number of synaptic connections in the human brain, is achievable with a nanowire network of about 10 cm$^{2}$.</description>

      <title>Elastic Softening in Synthetic Diamonds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03377v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study reveals a novel phenomenon demonstrating the elastic softening of synthetic diamonds when cooled to very low temperatures below 1 K. We present the results of ultrasonic measurements of single-crystalline synthetic diamonds without irradiation, namely type-IIa (colorless) and Ib (yellow) diamonds grown by high-pressure-high-temperature synthesis as well as type-IIa diamond grown by chemical vapor deposition. We observed a divergent decrease of the elastic stiffness constant $C_{44}$ in all samples at low temperatures down to 20 mK. We argue for the existence of electric quadrupolar degrees of freedom with irreducible representation $T_2$ in diamond as the origin of this elastic softening. The possible ground state preserves local $T_d$ symmetry presumably down to absolute zero. Of the ground states of atomic vacancies in diamond proposed thus far, the only relevant one is the positively charged single atomic vacancy V$^+$, which has not been observed in previous optical measurements in diamonds.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a methodology to calibrate in situ a set of coils generating bi- or tri-axial magnetic fields, at frequencies where a calibration performed under static conditions would be inaccurate. The coil constants are determined in a two-step procedure. Considering the presence of a static and a time-dependent field, firstly, the static one is oriented perpendicularly to the polarization plane of a time-dependent one; secondly, the polarization of the latter is made accurately circular. The methodology uses harmonic analysis of one component of the magnetization of an atomic sample whose spins adiabatically follow the time-dependent field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we build a general model of memristors suitable for the simulation of event-based systems, such as hardware spiking neural networks, and more generally, neuromorphic computing systems. We extend an existing general model of memristors - the Generalised Metastable Switch Model - to an event-driven setting, eliminating errors associated discrete time approximation, as well as offering potential improvements in terms of computational efficiency for simulation. We introduce the notion of a volatility state variable, to allow for the modelling of memory-dependent and dynamic switching behaviour, succinctly capturing and unifying a variety of volatile phenomena present in memristive devices, including state relaxation, structural disruption, Joule heating, and drift acceleration phenomena. We supply a drift dataset for titanium dioxide memristors and introduce a linear conductance model to simulate the drift characteristics, motivated by a proposed physical model of filament growth. We then demonstrate an approach for fitting the parameters of the event-based model to the drift model.</description>

      <title>Error correction for encoded quantum annealing revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: F. Pastawski and J. Preskill discussed error correction of quantum annealing (QA) based on a parity-encoded spin system, known as the Sourlas-Lechner-Hauke-Zoller (SLHZ) system. They pointed out that the SLHZ system is closely related to a classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) code and demonstrated its error-correcting capability through a belief propagation (BP) algorithm assuming independent random spin-flip errors. In contrast, Ablash et al. suggested that the SLHZ system does not receive the benefits of post-readout decoding. The reason is that independent random spin-flips are not the most relevant error arising from sampling excited states during the annealing process, whether in closed or open system cases. In this work, we revisit this issue: we propose a very simple decoding algorithm to eliminate errors in the readout of SLHZ systems and show experimental evidence suggesting that SLHZ system exhibits error-correcting capability in decoding annealing readouts. Our new algorithm can be thought of as a bit-flipping algorithm for LDPC codes. Assuming an independent and identical noise model, we found that the performance of our algorithm is comparable to that of the BP algorithm. The error correcting-capability for the sampled readouts was investigated using Monte Carlo calculations that simulate the final time distribution of QA. The results show that the algorithm successfully eliminates errors in the sampled readouts under conditions where error-free state or even code state is not sampled at all. Our simulation suggests that decoding of annealing readouts will be successful if the correctable states can be sampled by annealing, and annealing can be considered to play a role as a pre-process of the classical decoding process. This knowledge will be useful for designing and developing practical QA based on the SLHZ system in the near future.</description>
