      <title>Optimal Auction Design in the Joint Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online advertising is a vital revenue source for major internet platforms. Recently, joint advertising, which assigns a bundle of two advertisers in an ad slot instead of allocating a single advertiser, has emerged as an effective method for enhancing allocation efficiency and revenue. However, existing mechanisms for joint advertising fail to realize the optimality, as they tend to focus on individual advertisers and overlook bundle structures. This paper identifies an optimal mechanism for joint advertising in a single-slot setting. For multi-slot joint advertising, we propose \textbf{BundleNet}, a novel bundle-based neural network approach specifically designed for joint advertising. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the mechanisms generated by \textbf{BundleNet} approximate the theoretical analysis results in the single-slot setting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in the multi-slot setting. This significantly increases platform revenue while ensuring approximate dominant strategy incentive compatibility and individual rationality.</description>

      <title>Incentive Mechanism for Mobile Crowd Sensing with Assumed Bid Cost Reverse Auction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) is the mechanism wherein people can contribute in data collection process using their own mobile devices which have sensing capabilities. Incentives are rewards that individuals get in exchange for data they submit. Reverse Auction Bidding (RAB) is a framework that allows users to place bids for selling the data they collected. Task providers can select users to buy data from by looking at bids. Using the RAB framework, MCS system can be optimized for better user utility, task provider utility and platform utility. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Reverse Auction with Assumed Bid Cost (RA-ABC) which allows users to place a bid in the system before collecting data. We opine that performing the tasks only after winning helps in reducing resource consumption instead of performing the tasks before bidding. User Return on Investment (ROI) is calculated with which they decide to further participate or not by either increasing or decreasing their bids. We also propose an extension of RA-ABC with dynamic recruitment (RA-ABCDR) in which we allow new users to join the system at any time during bidding rounds. Simulation results demonstrate that RA-ABC and RA-ABCDR outperform the widely used Tullock Optimal Prize Function, with RA-ABCDR achieving up to 54.6\% higher user retention and reducing auction cost by 22.2\%, thereby ensuring more efficient and sustainable system performance. Extensive simulations confirm that dynamic user recruitment significantly enhances performance across stability, fairness, and cost-efficiency metrics.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Advertising in the Sponsored Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online advertisements are a primary revenue source for e-commerce platforms. Traditional advertising models are store-centric, selecting winning stores through auction mechanisms. Recently, a new approach known as joint advertising has emerged, which presents sponsored bundles combining one store and one brand in ad slots. Unlike traditional models, joint advertising allows platforms to collect payments from both brands and stores. However, each of these two advertising models appeals to distinct user groups, leading to low click-through rates when users encounter an undesirable advertising model. To address this limitation and enhance generality, we propose a novel advertising model called ''Hybrid Advertising''. In this model, each ad slot can be allocated to either an independent store or a bundle. To find the optimal auction mechanisms in hybrid advertising, while ensuring nearly dominant strategy incentive compatibility and individual rationality, we introduce the Hybrid Regret Network (HRegNet), a neural network architecture designed for this purpose. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that the mechanisms generated by HRegNet significantly improve platform revenue compared to established baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Improving the Price of Anarchy via Predictions in Parallel-Link Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study non-atomic congestion games on parallel-link networks with affine cost functions. We investigate the power of machine-learned predictions in the design of coordination mechanisms aimed at minimizing the impact of selfishness. Our main results demonstrate that enhancing coordination mechanisms with a simple advice on the input rate can optimize the social cost whenever the advice is accurate (consistency), while only incurring minimal losses even when the predictions are arbitrarily inaccurate (bounded robustness). Moreover, we provide a full characterization of the consistent mechanisms that holds for all monotone cost functions, and show that our suggested mechanism is optimal with respect to the robustness. We further explore the notion of smoothness within this context: we extend our mechanism to achieve error-tolerance, i.e. we provide an approximation guarantee that degrades smoothly as a function of the prediction error, up to a predetermined threshold, while achieving a bounded robustness.</description>

      <title>Search and Matching for Adoption from Foster Care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.10145v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To find families for the more than 100,000 children in need of adoptive placements, most United States child welfare agencies have employed a family-driven search approach in which prospective families respond to announcements made by the agency. However, some agencies have switched to a caseworker-driven search approach in which the caseworker directly contacts families recommended for a child. We introduce a novel search-and-matching model that captures the key features of the adoption process and compare family-driven with caseworker-driven search in a game-theoretical framework. Under either approach, the equilibria are generated by threshold strategies and form a lattice structure. Our main theoretical finding then shows that no family-driven equilibrium can Pareto dominate any caseworker-driven outcome, whereas it is possible that each caseworker-driven equilibrium Pareto dominates every equilibrium attainable under family-driven search. We also find that when families are sufficiently impatient, caseworker-driven search is better for all children. We illustrate numerically that most agents are better off under caseworker-driven search for a wide range of parameters. Finally, we provide empirical evidence from an agency that switched to caseworker-driven search and achieved a three-year adoption probability that outperformed a statewide benchmark by 24%, as well as a statistically significant 27% improvement in adoption hazard rates.</description>

      <title>Capacity Modification in the Stable Matching Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04645v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of capacity modification in the many-to-one stable matching of workers and firms. Our goal is to systematically study how the set of stable matchings changes when some seats are added to or removed from the firms. We make three main contributions: First, we examine whether firms and workers can improve or worsen upon changing the capacities under worker-proposing and firm-proposing deferred acceptance algorithms. Second, we study the computational problem of adding or removing seats to either match a fixed worker-firm pair in some stable matching or make a fixed matching stable with respect to the modified problem. We develop polynomial-time algorithms for these problems when only the overall change in the firms' capacities is restricted, and show NP-hardness when there are additional constraints for individual firms. Lastly, we compare capacity modification with the classical model of preference manipulation by firms and identify scenarios under which one mode of manipulation outperforms the other. We find that a threshold on a given firm's capacity, which we call its peak, crucially determines the effectiveness of different manipulation actions.</description>

      <title>Constant-Approximate and Constant-Strategyproof Two-Facility Location</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study deterministic mechanisms for the two-facility location problem. Given the reported locations of n agents on the real line, such a mechanism specifies where to build the two facilities. The single-facility variant of this problem admits a simple strategyproof mechanism that minimizes social cost. For two facilities, however, it is known that any strategyproof mechanism is $\Omega(n)$-approximate. We seek to circumvent this strong lower bound by relaxing the problem requirements. Following other work in the facility location literature, we consider a relaxed form of strategyproofness in which no agent can lie and improve their outcome by more than a constant factor. Because the aforementioned $\Omega(n)$ lower bound generalizes easily to constant-strategyproof mechanisms, we introduce a second relaxation: Allowing the facilities (but not the agents) to be located in the plane. Our first main result is a natural mechanism for this relaxation that is constant-approximate and constant-strategyproof. A characteristic of this mechanism is that a small change in the input profile can produce a large change in the solution. Motivated by this observation, and also by results in the facility reallocation literature, our second main result is a constant-approximate, constant-strategyproof, and Lipschitz continuous mechanism.</description>

      <title>Prediction-Augmented Mechanism Design for Weighted Facility Location</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Facility location is fundamental in operations research, mechanism design, and algorithmic game theory, with applications ranging from urban infrastructure planning to distributed systems. Recent research in this area has focused on augmenting classic strategyproof mechanisms with predictions to achieve an improved performance guarantee against the uncertainty under the strategic environment. Previous work has been devoted to address the trade-off obstacle of balancing the consistency (near-optimality under accurate predictions) and robustness (bounded inefficiency under poor predictions) primarily in the unweighted setting, assuming that all agents have the same importance. However, this assumption may not be true in some practical scenarios, leading to research of weighted facility location problems.
  The major contribution of the current work is to provide a prediction augmented algorithmic framework for balancing the consistency and robustness over strategic agents with non-uniform weights. In particular, through a reduction technique that identifies a subset of \emph{representative} instances and maps the other given locations to the representative ones, we prove that there exists a \emph{strategyproof} mechanism achieving a bounded consistency guarantee of $\frac{\sqrt{(1+c)^2W^2_{\min}+(1-c)^2W^2_{\max}}}{(1+c)W_{\min}}$ and a bounded robustness guarantee of $\frac{\sqrt{(1-c)^2W^2_{\min}+(1+c)^2W^2_{\max}}}{(1-c)W_{\min}}$ in weighted settings, where $c$ can be viewed as a parameter to make a trade-off between the consistency and robustness and $W_{\min}$ and $W_{\max}$ denote the minimum and maximum agents' weight. We also proved that there is no strategyproof deterministic mechanism that reach $1$-consistency and $O\left( n \cdot \frac{W_{\max}}{W_{\min}} \right)$-robustness in weighted FLP, even with fully predictions of all agents.</description>
