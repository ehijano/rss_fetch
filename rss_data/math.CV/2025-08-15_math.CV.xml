      <title>Sharp bounds for the valence of certain logharmonic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a logharmonic polynomial; that is, a product of the form $p(z)\overline{q(z)}$, where $p$, $q$ are holomorphic polynomials. Assume $q$ is linear and denote by $n$ the degree of $p$. It was recently shown in arXiv:2302.04339 [math.CV] that the valence of such a logharmonic polynomial is at most $3n-1$; in this paper we show that their $3n-1$ upper bound is sharp. Together with the work of arXiv:2302.04339 [math.CV], this resolves a conjecture of Bshouty and Hengartner.</description>

      <title>An interpolation approach to Schoenberg type inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Schoenberg inequality relates the squared moduli of the critical points of a polynomial to those of its zeros, under the condition that the centroid of the zeros lies at the origin. Its generalizations to other orders are referred to as Schoenberg type inequalities. While higher-order analogues have been established for certain even exponents, the general case remains poorly understood. In this paper, we substantially extend the known results by introducing an interpolation-based framework that unifies the treatment of Schoenberg type inequalities across a continuum of exponents. Our approach employs complex interpolation between $\ell^p$ spaces and Schatten $p$-classes $S_p$, yielding sharp Schoenberg type inequalities of order $p$ for all $p \ge 1$, including previously inaccessible intermediate exponents. This completely resolves an open problem posed by Kushel and Tyaglov. In the process, we also provide a new proof of the Schoenberg type inequality of order $1$.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of the conformally covariant geodesic metric on non-simple conformal loop ensemble gaskets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the canonical geodesic metric on the gasket of conformal loop ensembles (CLE$_\kappa$) in the regime $\kappa \in (4,8)$ where the loops intersect themselves, each other, and the domain boundary. Previous work of the authors and V. Ambrosio showed that the subsequential limits associated with certain approximation procedures for such a metric exist and are non-trivial. In this work, we show that the limit exists by proving that there is at most one geodesic metric on the CLE$_\kappa$ gasket which satisfies certain properties. Further, we obtain that the limit is conformally covariant. This paper is the foundation of future work which show that the metric for $\kappa=6$ is the continuum scaling limit of the chemical distance metric for critical percolation in two dimensions. We further conjecture that for $\kappa \in (4,8)$, the geodesic CLE$_\kappa$ metric is the scaling limit of the chemical distance metric associated with discrete models that converge to CLE$_\kappa$.</description>

      <title>Indices of holomorphic foliations and the bifurcation conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit local invariants (G\'omez-Mont-Seade-Verjovsky, variation, Camacho-Sad and Baum-Bott indices) associated with singular holomorphic foliations on $(\mathbb{C}^2 , 0)$ and we provide semi-global formulas for them in terms of the reduction of singularities of the foliation. A key technical ingredient is the Cholesky-type factorization of the intersection matrix of the exceptional divisor, which allows for an explicit control of multiplicities and indices along the resolution process. Using this factorization, we express the Milnor number and other indices as quadratic forms in intersection vectors associated to balanced divisors introduced by Y. Genzmer. As a main application, we address a conjecture posed by A. Szawlowski concerning pencils of plane holomorphic germs. We prove that the excess of Milnor numbers along the pencil is precisely captured by the invariants derived from our formulas, thereby confirming the conjecture in full generality. This also yields a new expression for the dimension of the parameter space of universal unfoldings of meromorphic functions in the sense of T. Suwa.</description>

      <title>On the Practical Use of Blaschke Decomposition in Nonstationary Signal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Blaschke decomposition-based algorithm, {\em Phase Dynamics Unwinding} (PDU), possesses several attractive theoretical properties, including fast convergence, effective decomposition, and multiscale analysis. However, its application to real-world signal decomposition tasks encounters notable challenges. In this work, we propose two techniques, divide-and-conquer via tapering and cumulative summation (cumsum), to handle complex trends and amplitude modulations and the mode-mixing caused by winding. The resulting method, termed {\em windowed PDU}, enhances PDU's performance in practical decomposition tasks. We validate our approach through both simulated and real-world signals, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>Mirrors of conformal dynamics: Interplay between anti-rational maps, reflection groups, Schwarz reflections, and correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this survey is to present intimate interactions between four branches of conformal dynamics: iterations of anti-rational maps, actions of Kleinian reflection groups, dynamics generated by Schwarz reflections in quadrature domains, and algebraic correspondences. We start with several examples of Schwarz reflections as well as algebraic correspondences obtained by matings between anti-rational maps and reflection groups, and examples of Julia set realizations for limit sets of reflection groups (including classical Apollonian-like gaskets). We follow up these examples with dynamical relations between explicit Schwarz reflection parameter spaces and parameter spaces of anti-rational maps and of reflection groups. These are complemented by a number of general results and illustrations of important technical tools, such as David surgery and straightening techniques. We also collect several analytic applications of the above theory.</description>

      <title>Continuity of solutions to complex Monge-Amp\`{e}re equations on compact K\"{a}hler spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the continuity of bounded solutions to complex Monge-Amp\`{e}re equations on reduced, locally irreducible compact K\"{a}hler spaces. This in particular implies that any singular K\"{a}hler-Einstein potentials constructed in \cite{EGZ09} and \cite{Tsuji88, TianZhang06, ST17} are continuous. We also provide an affirmative answer to a conjecture in \cite{EGZ09} by showing that a resolution of any compact normal K\"{a}hler space satisfies the continuous approximation property. Finally, we settle the continuity of the potentials of the weak K\"{a}hler-Ricci flows \cite{ST17, GLZ20} on compact K\"{a}hler varieties with log terminal singularities.</description>

      <title>Topologizability and Power Boundedness of Convolutions and Toeplitz Operators on Power Series Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We completely characterize the topologizability and power boundedness of convolution and dual convolution operators on power series spaces. We determine necessary conditions for a Toeplitz operator to be m-topologizable, and power bounded on $\Lambda_{1}(n)$ and $\Lambda_{\infty}(n)$, and consequently on $H(\mathbb{C})$ and $H(\mathbb{D})$.</description>
