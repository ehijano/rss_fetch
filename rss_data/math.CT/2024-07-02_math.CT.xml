      <title>An elementary proof of a criterion for subfunctors of Ext to be closed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an abelian category and let $F$ be a subbifunctor of the additive bifunctor $\text{Ext}_{\mathcal{A}}^{1}(-,-)\colon \mathcal{A}^{\text{op}}\times \mathcal{A}\to \mathsf{Ab}$. Buan proved in [4] that $F$ is closed if, and only if, $F$ has the $3\times 3$-lemma property, a certain diagrammatic property satisfied by the class of $F$-exact sequences. The proof of this result relies on the theory of exact categories and on the Freyd--Mitchell embedding theorem, a very well-known overpowered result. In this paper we provide a proof of Buan's result only by means of elementary methods in abelian categories. To achieve this we survey the required theory of subfunctors leading us to a self-contained exposition of this topic.</description>

      <title>Regular Lagrangians are smooth Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for any element in the $\gamma$-completion of the space of smooth compact exact Lagrangian submanifolds of a cotangent bundle, if its $\gamma$-support is a smooth Lagrangian submanifold, then the element itself is a smooth Lagrangian. We also prove that if the $\gamma$-support of an element in the completion is compact, then it is connected.</description>

      <title>An invitation to game comonads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Game comonads offer a categorical view of a number of model-comparison games central to model theory, such as pebble and Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'e games. Remarkably, the categories of coalgebras for these comonads capture preservation of several fragments of resource-bounded logics, such as (infinitary) first-order logic with n variables or bounded quantifier rank, and corresponding combinatorial parameters such as tree-width and tree-depth. In this way, game comonads provide a new bridge between categorical methods developed for semantics, and the combinatorial and algorithmic methods of resource-sensitive model theory.
  We give an overview of this framework and outline some of its applications, including the study of homomorphism counting results in finite model theory, and of equi-resource homomorphism preservation theorems in logic using the axiomatic setting of arboreal categories. Finally, we describe some homotopical ideas that arise naturally in the context of game comonads.</description>

      <title>Symplectic double groupoids and the generalized K\"ahler potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A description of the fundamental degrees of freedom underlying a generalized K\"ahler manifold, which separates its holomorphic moduli from the space of compatible metrics in a similar way to the K\"ahler case, has been sought since its discovery in 1984. In this paper, we describe a full solution to this problem for arbitrary generalized K\"ahler manifolds, which involves the new concept of a holomorphic symplectic Morita 2-equivalence between double symplectic groupoids, equipped with a Lagrangian bisection of its real symplectic core. Essentially, any generalized K\"ahler manifold has an associated holomorphic symplectic manifold of quadruple dimension and equipped with an anti-holomorphic involution; the metric is determined by a Lagrangian submanifold of its fixed point locus. This finally resolves affirmatively a long-standing conjecture by physicists concerning the existence of a generalized K\"ahler potential.
  We demonstrate the theory by constructing explicitly the above Morita 2-equivalence and Lagrangian bisection for the well-known generalized K\"ahler structures on compact even-dimensional semisimple Lie groups, which have until now escaped such analysis. We construct the required holomorphic symplectic manifolds by expressing them as moduli spaces of flat connections on surfaces with decorated boundary, through a quasi-Hamiltonian reduction.</description>

      <title>Generalized multicategories: change-of-base, embedding, and descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Via the adjunction $ - \boldsymbol{\cdot} 1 \dashv \mathcal V(1,-) \colon \mathsf{Span}(\mathcal V) \to \mathcal V \text{-} \mathsf{Mat} $ and a cartesian monad $ T $ on an extensive category $ \mathcal V $ with finite limits, we construct an adjunction $ - \boldsymbol{\cdot} 1 \dashv \mathcal V(1,-) \colon \mathsf{Cat}(T,\mathcal V) \to (\overline T, \mathcal V)\text{-}\mathsf{Cat} $ between categories of generalized enriched multicategories and generalized internal multicategories, provided the monad $ T $ satisfies a suitable condition, which is satisfied by several examples.
  We verify, moreover, that the left adjoint is fully faithful, and preserves pullbacks, provided that the copower functor $ - \boldsymbol{\cdot} 1 \colon \mathsf{Set} \to \mathcal V $ is fully faithful. We also apply this result to study descent theory of generalized enriched multicategorical structures.
  These results are built upon the study of base-change for generalized multicategories, which, in turn, was carried out in the context of categories of horizontal lax algebras arising out of a monad in a suitable 2-category of pseudodouble categories.</description>
