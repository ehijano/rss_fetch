      <title>The Marginal Effects of Ethereum Network MEV Transaction Re-Ordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two MEV builders now produce nearly 80\% of Ethereum blocks. Block builders have the ability to reorder transactions on the blockchain in a way that can be harmful to participants. We estimate they would pay in the aggregate nearly \$14 million per month to ensure that they remained in the first quartile of the block. Sandwich attacks, in which a transaction is front-run, are frequent, averaging more than one per block. Gas fees on these transactions pay for nearly 15\% of the MEV payments to the validator. These attacks have especially large marginal effects and skew the distribution. Reforms such as gas fee priority or private transaction pools might be helpful.</description>

      <title>Performative Market Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial models do not merely analyse markets, but actively shape them. This effect, known as performativity, describes how financial theories and the subsequent actions based on them influence market processes, by creating self-fulfilling prophecies. Although discussed in the literature on economic sociology, this deeply rooted phenomenon lacks mathematical formulation in financial markets. Our paper closes this gap by breaking down the canonical separation of diffusion processes between the description of the market environment and the financial model. We do that by embedding the model in the process itself, creating a closed feedback loop, and demonstrate how prices change towards greater conformity to the prevailing financial model used in the market. We further show, with closed-form solutions and machine learning, how a performative market maker can reverse engineer the current dominant strategies in the market and effectively arbitrage them while maintaining competitive quotes and superior P&amp;L.</description>
