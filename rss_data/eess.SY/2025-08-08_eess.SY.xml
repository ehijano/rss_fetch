      <title>Linear Program-Based Stability Conditions for Nonlinear Autonomous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluating the asymptotic stability of equilibrium points in both continuous-time (CT) and discrete-time (DT) nonlinear autonomous systems. By utilizing indirect Lyapunov methods and linearizing system dynamics through Jacobian matrices, the methodology replaces traditional semi-definite programming (SDP) techniques with computationally efficient linear programming (LP) conditions. This substitution substantially lowers the computational burden, including time and memory usage, particularly for high-dimensional systems. The stability criteria are developed using matrix transformations and leveraging the structural characteristics of the system, improving scalability. Several examples demonstrated the computational efficiency of the proposed approach compared to the existing SDP-based criteria, particularly for high-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Sequence Aware SAC Control for Engine Fuel Consumption Optimization in Electrified Powertrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) gain traction in heavy-duty trucks, adaptive and efficient energy management is critical for reducing fuel consumption while maintaining battery charge for long operation times. We present a new reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm to optimize engine control in series HEVs. We reformulate the control task as a sequential decision-making problem and enhance SAC by incorporating Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and Decision Transformers (DTs) into both actor and critic networks to capture temporal dependencies and improve planning over time. To evaluate robustness and generalization, we train the models under diverse initial battery states, drive cycle durations, power demands, and input sequence lengths. Experiments show that the SAC agent with a DT-based actor and GRU-based critic was within 1.8% of Dynamic Programming (DP) in fuel savings on the Highway Fuel Economy Test (HFET) cycle, while the SAC agent with GRUs in both actor and critic networks, and FFN actor-critic agent were within 3.16% and 3.43%, respectively. On unseen drive cycles (US06 and Heavy Heavy-Duty Diesel Truck (HHDDT) cruise segment), generalized sequence-aware agents consistently outperformed feedforward network (FFN)-based agents, highlighting their adaptability and robustness in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Influence Flow Model of Transistor Amplifiers, Its Reconstruction and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multistage transistor amplifiers can be effectively modeled as network of dynamic systems where individual amplifier stages interact through couplings that are dynamic in nature. Using circuit analysis techniques, we show that a large class of transistor amplifiers can be modeled as Linear Dynamic Influence Model (LDIM), where the interactions between different amplifier stages are modeled as linear dynamic equations. LDIM modeling of transistor circuits leads to application of data-driven network reconstruction techniques to characterize stage interactions and identify faults and critical circuit parameters efficiently. Employing graphical modeling techniques and Wiener filtering, we demonstrate that the network structure can be reconstructed solely from voltage time-series measurements sampled at specified points in the circuit. The efficacy of these network reconstruction methods in multistage amplifiers is demonstrated through extensive simulations involving multiple amplifier circuits in Cadence, as well as experimental results on physical hardware. The ability to infer network structure directly from measurement data offers designers and users efficient tools to design, analyze, and debug amplifier circuits. To demonstrate the utility of network reconstruction in multistage amplifier circuits, a fault diagnosis method leveraging these techniques is presented.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Alternating Simulations for Policy Synthesis in Uncertain Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical approach to formal policy synthesis in stochastic dynamical systems is to construct a finite-state abstraction, often represented as a Markov decision process (MDP). The correctness of these approaches hinges on a behavioural relation between the dynamical system and its abstraction, such as a probabilistic simulation relation. However, probabilistic simulation relations do not suffice when the system dynamics are, next to being stochastic, also subject to nondeterministic (i.e., set-valued) disturbances. In this work, we extend probabilistic simulation relations to systems with both stochastic and nondeterministic disturbances. Our relation, which is inspired by a notion of alternating simulation, generalises existing relations used for verification and policy synthesis used in several works. Intuitively, our relation allows reasoning probabilistically over stochastic uncertainty, while reasoning robustly (i.e., adversarially) over nondeterministic disturbances. We experimentally demonstrate the applicability of our relations for policy synthesis in a 4D-state Dubins vehicle.</description>

      <title>Preparing for the worst: Long-term and short-term weather extremes in resource adequacy assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Security of supply is a common and important concern when integrating renewables in net-zero power systems. Extreme weather affects both demand and supply leading to power system stress; in Europe this stress spreads continentally beyond the meteorological root cause. We use an approach based on shadow prices to identify periods of elevated stress called system-defining events and analyse their impact on the power system. By classifying different types of system-defining events, we identify challenges to power system operation and planning. Crucially, we find the need for sufficient resilience back-up (power) capacities whose financial viability is precarious due to weather variability. Furthermore, we disentangle short- and long-term resilience challenges with distinct metrics and stress tests to incorporate both into future energy modelling assessments. Our methodology and implementation in the open model PyPSA-Eur can be re-applied to other systems and help researchers and policymakers in building more resilient and adequate energy systems.</description>

      <title>Overview of Controllability Definitions in Supervisory Control Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of supervisory control theory, the literature often proposes different definitions for the same concept, making it difficult to understand how these definitions are related. This is definitely so for the fundamental notion of controllability of a supervisor w.r.t. a plant. This paper lists definitions of controllability found in the literature and studies their relationships in settings of both deterministic and nondeterministic automata. In the general context, where both the supervisor and the plant are allowed to be nondeterministic, the notions of controllability as described by Flordal and Malik, and uncontrollable event admissibility by Kushi and Takai are equivalent. These are also the only notions that imply the traditional notion of (language) controllability. From a practical perspective, one is often more interested in controllability of a supervised plant w.r.t. a plant. In this context, in addition to the previous two controllability notions, state controllability by Zhou et al. implies language controllability.</description>

      <title>Passive nonlinear FIR filters for data-driven control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new class of passive nonlinear finite impulse response operators. This class is constructed by the action of finite impulse response filters in a lifted space. This allows for efficient control synthesis through constrained optimization. Closed-loop performance is taken into account through least-squares fitting, based on the theory of virtual reference feedback tuning. Passivity is established through efficient linear constraints, based on sampling in the frequency domain. Because of passivity, this class of operators is particularly suited for the control of physical systems, such as electromechanical systems.</description>

      <title>A 20-Year Retrospective on Power and Thermal Modeling and Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As processor performance advances, increasing power densities and complex thermal behaviors threaten both energy efficiency and system reliability. This survey covers more than two decades of research on power and thermal modeling and management in modern processors. We start by comparing analytical, regression-based, and neural network-based techniques for power estimation, then review thermal modeling methods, including finite element, finite difference, and data-driven approaches. Next, we categorize dynamic runtime management strategies that balance performance, power consumption, and reliability. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of emerging challenges and promising research directions.</description>

      <title>Research on integrated intelligent energy management system based on big data analysis and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of big data is one of the significant features of integrated smart energy. Applying it to the file management of integrated smart energy projects is of great significance for improving the efficiency of project management and control. This article first discussed the benefits and challenges of implementing big data analysis in document management and control of integrated smart energy projects. In addition, an implementation framework for big data analysis in integrated smart energy project document management was developed, and a method for optimizing the efficiency of integrated smart energy project document management through machine learning was proposed. Using various types of data and information generated during the project document management process, the efficiency of the entire process project document control through three different machine learning methods was optimized. The result of fitting a penalty linear regression model shows that when there is enough data as a training set, the accuracy of the model achieved can reach over 95\%. By using big data analysis and machine learning to analyze the efficiency of comprehensive smart energy project document management, it is possible to track the entire process of comprehensive smart energy project documents and optimize business processes, thereby strengthening project construction control and improving project construction efficiency.</description>

      <title>Error Bounds for Radial Network Topology Learning from Quantized Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We probabilistically bound the error of a solution to a radial network topology learning problem where both connectivity and line parameters are estimated. In our model, data errors are introduced by the precision of the sensors, i.e., quantization. This produces a nonlinear measurement model that embeds the operation of the sensor communication network into the learning problem, expanding beyond the additive noise models typically seen in power system estimation algorithms. We show that the error of a learned radial network topology is proportional to the quantization bin width and grows sublinearly in the number of nodes, provided that the number of samples per node is logarithmic in the number of nodes.</description>

      <title>A General Control Method for Human-Robot Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14762v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new generalized control method designed for multi-degrees-of-freedom devices to help people with limited motion capabilities in their daily activities. The challenge lies in finding the most adapted strategy for the control interface to effectively map user's motions in a low-dimensional space to complex robotic assistive devices, such as prostheses, supernumerary limbs, up to remote robotic avatars. The goal is a system which integrates the human and the robotic parts into a unique system, moving so as to reach the targets decided by the human while autonomously reducing the user's effort and discomfort. We present a framework to control general multi DoFs assistive systems, which translates user-performed compensatory motions into the necessary robot commands for reaching targets while canceling or reducing compensation. The framework extends to prostheses of any number of DoF up to full robotic avatars, regarded here as a sort of whole-body prosthesis of the person who sees the robot as an artificial extension of their own body without a physical link but with a sensory-motor integration. We have validated and applied this control strategy through tests encompassing simulated scenarios and real-world trials involving a virtual twin of the robotic parts (prosthesis and robot) and a physical humanoid avatar.</description>

      <title>Optimality Principles and Neural Ordinary Differential Equations-based Process Modeling for Distributed Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most recent advances in machine learning and analytics for process control pose the question of how to naturally integrate new data-driven methods with classical process models and control. We propose a process modeling framework enabling integration of data-driven algorithms through consistent topological properties and conservation of extensive quantities. Interconnections among process network units are represented through connectivity matrices and network graphs. We derive the system's natural objective function equivalent to the non-equilibrium entropy production in a steady state system as a driving force for the process dynamics. We illustrate how distributed control and optimization can be implemented into process network structures and how control laws and algorithms alter the system's natural equilibrium towards engineered objectives. The basic requirement is that the flow conditions can be expressed in terms of conic sector (passivity) conditions. Our formalism allows integration of fundamental conservation properties from topology with learned dynamic relations from data through sparse deep neural networks.
  We demonstrate in a practical example of a simple inventory control system how to integrate the basic topology of a process with a neural network ordinary differential equation model. The system specific constitutive equations are left undescribed and learned by the neural ordinary differential equation algorithm using the adjoint method in combination with an adaptive ODE solver from synthetic time-series data. The resulting neural network forms a state space model for use in e.g. a model predictive control algorithm.</description>

      <title>RCUKF: Data-Driven Modeling Meets Bayesian Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling is crucial in many engineering and scientific applications, yet obtaining a reliable process model for complex systems is often challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, reservoir computing with unscented Kalman filtering (RCUKF), which integrates data-driven modeling via reservoir computing (RC) with Bayesian estimation through the unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The RC component learns the nonlinear system dynamics directly from data, serving as a surrogate process model in the UKF prediction step to generate state estimates in high-dimensional or chaotic regimes where nominal mathematical models may fail. Meanwhile, the UKF measurement update integrates real-time sensor data to correct potential drift in the data-driven model. We demonstrate RCUKF effectiveness on well-known benchmark problems and a real-time vehicle trajectory estimation task in a high-fidelity simulation environment.</description>

      <title>Advanced Hybrid Transformer LSTM Technique with Attention and TS Mixer for Drilling Rate of Penetration Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rate of Penetration (ROP) is crucial for optimizing drilling operations; however, accurately predicting it is hindered by the complex, dynamic, and high-dimensional nature of drilling data. Traditional empirical, physics-based, and basic machine learning models often fail to capture intricate temporal and contextual relationships, resulting in suboptimal predictions and limited real-time utility. To address this gap, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning architecture integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Transformer encoders, Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) blocks, and attention mechanisms to synergistically model temporal dependencies, static feature interactions, global context, and dynamic feature importance. Evaluated on a real-world drilling dataset, our model outperformed benchmarks (standalone LSTM, TS-Mixer, and simpler hybrids) with an R-squared score of 0.9988 and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 1.447%, as measured by standard regression metrics (R-squared, MAE, RMSE, MAPE). Model interpretability was ensured using SHAP and LIME, while actual vs. predicted curves and bias checks confirmed accuracy and fairness across scenarios. This advanced hybrid approach enables reliable real-time ROP prediction, paving the way for intelligent, cost-effective drilling optimization systems with significant operational impact.</description>

      <title>A Multi-view Landmark Representation Approach with Application to GNSS-Visual-Inertial Odometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) has been a significant technique in vision-aided sensor fusion. However, it usually suffers from high computational burden when jointly optimizing camera poses and the landmarks. To improve its efficiency and applicability for multi-sensor fusion, we present a multi-view pose-only estimation approach with its application to GNSS-Visual-Inertial Odometry (GVIO) in this paper. Our main contribution is deriving a visual measurement model which directly associates landmark representation with multiple camera poses and observations. Such a pose-only measurement is proven to be tightly-coupled between landmarks and poses, and maintain a perfect null space that is independent of estimated poses. Finally, we apply the proposed approach to a filter based GVIO with a novel feature management strategy. Both simulation tests and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>F2PASeg: Feature Fusion for Pituitary Anatomy Segmentation in Endoscopic Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pituitary tumors often cause deformation or encapsulation of adjacent vital structures. Anatomical structure segmentation can provide surgeons with early warnings of regions that pose surgical risks, thereby enhancing the safety of pituitary surgery. However, pixel-level annotated video stream datasets for pituitary surgeries are extremely rare. To address this challenge, we introduce a new dataset for Pituitary Anatomy Segmentation (PAS). PAS comprises 7,845 time-coherent images extracted from 120 videos. To mitigate class imbalance, we apply data augmentation techniques that simulate the presence of surgical instruments in the training data. One major challenge in pituitary anatomy segmentation is the inconsistency in feature representation due to occlusions, camera motion, and surgical bleeding. By incorporating a Feature Fusion module, F2PASeg is proposed to refine anatomical structure segmentation by leveraging both high-resolution image features and deep semantic embeddings, enhancing robustness against intraoperative variations. Experimental results demonstrate that F2PASeg consistently segments critical anatomical structures in real time, providing a reliable solution for intraoperative pituitary surgery planning.

      <title>Distributionally Robust System Level Synthesis With Output Feedback Affine Control Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the finite-horizon robust optimal control of linear systems subject to model mismatch and additive stochastic disturbances. Utilizing the system level synthesis (SLS) parameterization, we propose a novel SLS design using output-feedback affine control policy and extend it to a distributionally robust setting to improve system resilience by minimizing the cost function while ensuring constraint satisfaction against the worst-case uncertainty distribution. The scopes of model mismatch and stochastic disturbances are quantified using the 1-norm and a Wasserstein metric-based ambiguity set, respectively. For the closed-loop dynamics, we analyze the distributional shift between the predicted output-input response -- computed using nominal parameters and empirical disturbance samples -- and the actual closed-loop distribution, highlighting its dependence on model mismatch and SLS parameterization. Assuming convex and Lipschitz continuous cost functions and constraints, we derive a tractable reformulation of the distributionally robust SLS (DR-SLS) problem by leveraging tools from robust control and distributionally robust optimization (DRO). Numerical experiments validate the performance and robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Sub- {\mu} W Battery-Less and Oscillator-Less Wi-Fi Backscattering Transmitter Reusing RF Signal for Harvesting, Communications, and Motion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a sub-uW power 802.11b backscattering transmitter is presented to enable reuse of the same incident wave for three purposes: RF harvesting, backscattering communications and position/motion sensing. The removal of the battery and any off-chip motion sensor (e.g., MEMS) enables unprecedented level of miniaturization and ubiquity, unrestricted device lifespan, low fabrication and maintenance cost. The uW power wall for WiFi transmitters is broken for the first time via local oscillator elimination, as achieved by extracting its frequency through second-order intermodulation of a twotone incident wave. The two-tone scheme also enables a cumulative harvesting/transmission/sensing sensitivity down to Pmin -19 dBm. Position/motion sensing is enabled by using the harvested voltage as a proxy for the Received Signal Strength (RSS), allowing to sense the chip location with respect to the tone generator(s) shared across tags in indoor neighborhoods.</description>

      <title>Design and Analysis of a Vanadium Dioxide-Based Ultra-Broadband Terahertz Metamaterial Absorber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a VO2-based metamaterial absorber optimized for ultra-broadband, polarization-insensitive performance in the terahertz (THz) frequency range. The absorber consists of a patterned VO2 metasurface, a low-loss MF2 dielectric spacer, and a gold ground plane. Exploiting the phase transition of VO2, the design enables dynamic control of electromagnetic absorption. Full-wave simulations show an average absorptance of 98.15% across a 5.38THz bandwidth (5.72-11.11THz) and over 99% absorption sustained across 3.35THz. The absorber maintains stable performance for varying polarization angles and both TE and TM modes under oblique incidence. Impedance analysis confirms strong matching to free space, reducing reflection and eliminating transmission. Parametric analysis investigates the influence of VO2 conductivity, MF2 thickness, and unit cell periodicity on performance. Compared to recent THz metamaterial absorbers, the proposed design achieves broader bandwidth, higher efficiency, and simpler implementation. These characteristics make it suitable for THz sensing, imaging, wireless communication, and adaptive photonic systems, and position it as a promising platform for tunable and reconfigurable THz modules.</description>

      <title>Towards Generalizable Safety in Crowd Navigation via Conformal Uncertainty Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile robots navigating in crowds trained using reinforcement learning are known to suffer performance degradation when faced with out-of-distribution scenarios. We propose that by properly accounting for the uncertainties of pedestrians, a robot can learn safe navigation policies that are robust to distribution shifts. Our method augments agent observations with prediction uncertainty estimates generated by adaptive conformal inference, and it uses these estimates to guide the agent's behavior through constrained reinforcement learning. The system helps regulate the agent's actions and enables it to adapt to distribution shifts. In the in-distribution setting, our approach achieves a 96.93% success rate, which is over 8.80% higher than the previous state-of-the-art baselines with over 3.72 times fewer collisions and 2.43 times fewer intrusions into ground-truth human future trajectories. In three out-of-distribution scenarios, our method shows much stronger robustness when facing distribution shifts in velocity variations, policy changes, and transitions from individual to group dynamics. We deploy our method on a real robot, and experiments show that the robot makes safe and robust decisions when interacting with both sparse and dense crowds. Our code and videos are available on https://gen-safe-nav.github.io/.</description>

      <title>On the effects of angular acceleration in orientation estimation using inertial measurement units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the orientation estimation problem using inertial measurement units. Many estimation algorithms suffer degraded performance when accelerations other than gravity affect the accelerometer. We show that linear accelerations resulting from rotational accelerations cannot be treated as external disturbance to be attenuated, rather, they change the dynamic behavior of the filter itself. In particular, this results in the introduction of additional zeros in the linearized transfer functions. These zeros lead to nonminimum phase behavior, which is known to be challenging for control. We validate these findings experimentally. Further, we demonstrate that Mahony and Madgwick filters can attenuate the acceleration at the expense of reduced bandwidth. In addition, we show that validation schemes based on precollected data fail to capture these closed-loop effects accurately.</description>

      <title>GNN-Enhanced Fault Diagnosis Method for Parallel Cyber-physical Attacks in Power Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parallel cyber-physical attacks (PCPA) simultaneously damage physical transmission lines and block measurement data transmission in power grids, impairing or delaying system protection and recovery. This paper investigates the fault diagnosis problem for a linearized (DC) power flow model under PCPA. The physical attack mechanism includes not only line disconnection but also admittance modification, for example via compromised distributed flexible AC transmission system (D-FACTS) devices. To address this problem, we propose a fault diagnosis framework based on meta-mixed-integer programming (MMIP), integrating graph attention network-based fault localization (GAT-FL). First, we derive measurement reconstruction conditions that allow reconstructing unknown measurements in attacked areas from available measurements and the system topology. Based on these conditions, we formulate the diagnosis task as an MMIP model. The GAT-FL predicts a probability distribution over potential physical attacks, which is then incorporated as objective coefficients in the MMIP. Solving the MMIP yields optimal attack location and magnitude estimates, from which the system states are also reconstructed. Experimental simulations are conducted on IEEE 30/118 bus standard test cases to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Time Splitting Based Optimization Method for Nonlinear MHE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moving Horizon Estimation~(MHE) is essentially an optimization-based approach designed to estimate the states of dynamic systems within a moving time horizon. Traditional MHE solutions become computationally prohibitive due to the \textit{curse of dimensionality} arising from increasing problem complexity and growing length of time horizon. To address this issue, we propose novel computationally efficient algorithms for solving nonlinear MHE problems. Specifically, we first introduce a distributed reformulation utilizing a time-splitting technique. Leveraging this reformulation, we develop the Efficient Gauss-Newton Augmented Lagrangian Alternating Direction Inexact Newton (ALADIN) to achieve computational efficiency. Additionally, to accommodate limited computational capabilities inherent in some sub-problem solvers, we propose the Efficient Sensitivity Assisted ALADIN, which enables sub-problems to be solved inexactly without hindering computational efficiency. Furthermore, recognizing scenarios where sub-problem solvers possess no computational power, we propose a Distributed Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) that relies solely on first- and second-order information of local objective functions. We demonstrate the performance and advantages of our proposed methods through numerical experiments on differential drive robots case, a practical nonlinear MHE problem. Our results demonstrate that the three proposed algorithms achieve computational efficiency while preserving high accuracy, thereby satisfying the real-time requirements of MHE.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Distributed Output Synchronization of Heterogeneous Discrete-Time Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we assume that an autonomous exosystem generates a reference output, and we consider the problem of designing a distributed data-driven control law for a family of discrete-time heterogeneous LTI agents, connected through a directed graph, in order to synchronize the agents' outputs to the reference one. The agents of the network are split into two categories: leaders, with direct access to the exosystem output, and followers, that only receive information from their neighbors. All agents aim to achieve output synchronization by means of a state feedback that makes use of their own states as well as of an estimate of the exogenous system state, provided by an internal state observer. Such observer has a different structure for leaders and followers. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution are first derived in the model-based set-up and then in a data-driven context. An example illustrates both the implementation procedure and the performance of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Skew-Induced Insertion Loss Deviation (SILD) and FOM_SILD: Metrics for Quantifying P/N Skew Effects in High-Speed Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of AI workloads and growing data center demands have driven the need for ultra-high-speed interconnects exceeding 200 Gb/s. As unit intervals (UI) shrink, even a few picoseconds of P/N skew can degrade serializer-deserializer (SerDes) performance. Traditional methods for quantifying skew fall short in capturing its impact. We introduce two new metrics: 1) Skew-Induced Insertion Loss Deviation (SILD) and 2) its complementary Figure of Merit (FOM_SILD), analytically developed to assess P/N skew effects. Measured S-parameters confirm FOM_SILD reciprocity, while simulations of 224G PAM4 SerDes show strong correlation with bit error rate (BER) trends. This approach offers a robust framework for analyzing skew in next-generation ultra-high-speed interconnects.</description>

Abstract: Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites are essential for providing accurate navigation and timing information worldwide. Operating in medium Earth orbit (MEO), these satellites must maintain precise Earth-pointing attitudes to transmit signals effectively. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the operational dynamics, attitude determination and control systems (ADCS), and orbital insertion techniques for GPS satellites. We explore the integration of sensors and actuators, control algorithms, stabilization strategies, and the launch procedures required to deploy these satellites. Key equations related to orbital mechanics and attitude control are discussed, and references to recent technical literature are included.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Preventive and Reactive Defense Resource Allocation with Uncertain Sensor Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cyber attacks continue to be a cause of concern despite advances in cyber defense techniques. Although cyber attacks cannot be fully prevented, standard decision-making frameworks typically focus on how to prevent them from succeeding, without considering the cost of cleaning up the damages incurred by successful attacks. This motivates us to investigate a new resource allocation problem formulated in this paper: The defender must decide how to split its investment between preventive defenses, which aim to harden nodes from attacks, and reactive defenses, which aim to quickly clean up the compromised nodes. This encounters a challenge imposed by the uncertainty associated with the observation, or sensor signal, whether a node is truly compromised or not; this uncertainty is real because attack detectors are not perfect. We investigate how the quality of sensor signals impacts the defender's strategic investment in the two types of defense, and ultimately the level of security that can be achieved. In particular, we show that the optimal investment in preventive resources increases, and thus reactive resource investment decreases, with higher sensor quality. We also show that the defender's performance improvement, relative to a baseline of no sensors employed, is maximal when the attacker can only achieve low attack success probabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14297v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a synthesis method for robust, regret optimal control. The plant is modeled in discrete-time by an uncertain linear time-invariant (LTI) system. An optimal non-causal controller is constructed using the nominal plant model and given full knowledge of the disturbance. Robust regret is defined relative to the performance of this optimal non-causal control. It is shown that a controller achieves robust regret if and only if it satisfies a robust $H_\infty$ performance condition. DK-iteration can be used to synthesize a controller that satisfies this condition and hence achieve a given level of robust regret. The approach is demonstrated three examples: (i) a simple single-input, single-output classical design, (ii) a longitudinal control for a simplified model for a Boeing 747 model, and (iii) an active suspension for a quarter car model. All examples compare the robust regret optimal against regret optimal controllers designed without uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Quaternion-Based Sliding Mode Control for Six Degrees of Freedom Flight Control of Quadrotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive research on sliding mode control (SMC) design for quadrotors, the existing approaches suffer from certain limitations. Euler angle-based SMC formulations suffer from poor performance in high-pitch or -roll maneuvers. Quaternion-based SMC approaches have unwinding issues and complex architecture. Coordinate-free methods are slow and only almost globally stable. This paper presents a new six degrees of freedom SMC flight controller to address the above limitations. We use a cascaded architecture with a position controller in the outer loop and a quaternion-based attitude controller in the inner loop. The position controller generates the desired trajectory for the attitude controller using a coordinate-free approach. The quaternion-based attitude controller uses the natural characteristics of the quaternion hypersphere, featuring a simple structure while providing global stability and avoiding unwinding issues. We compare our controller with three other common control methods conducting challenging maneuvers like flip-over and high-speed trajectory tracking in the presence of model uncertainties and disturbances. Our controller consistently outperforms the benchmark approaches with less control effort and actuator saturation, offering highly effective and efficient flight control.</description>

Abstract: Transformer neural networks (TNN) excel in natural language processing (NLP), machine translation, and computer vision (CV) without relying on recurrent or convolutional layers. However, they have high computational and memory demands, particularly on resource-constrained devices like FPGAs. Moreover, transformer models vary in processing time across applications, requiring custom models with specific parameters. Designing custom accelerators for each model is complex and time-intensive. Some custom accelerators exist with no runtime adaptability, and they often rely on sparse matrices to reduce latency. However, hardware designs become more challenging due to the need for application-specific sparsity patterns. This paper introduces ADAPTOR, a runtime-adaptive accelerator for dense matrix computations in transformer encoders and decoders on FPGAs. ADAPTOR enhances the utilization of processing elements and on-chip memory, enhancing parallelism and reducing latency. It incorporates efficient matrix tiling to distribute resources across FPGA platforms and is fully quantized for computational efficiency and portability. Evaluations on Xilinx Alveo U55C data center cards and embedded platforms like VC707 and ZCU102 show that our design is 1.2$\times$ and 2.87$\times$ more power efficient than the NVIDIA K80 GPU and the i7-8700K CPU respectively. Additionally, it achieves a speedup of 1.7 to 2.25$\times$ compared to some state-of-the-art FPGA-based accelerators.</description>

      <title>How to Adapt Control Barrier Functions? A Learning-Based Approach with Applications to a VTOL Quadplane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03038v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel theoretical framework for online adaptation of Control Barrier Function (CBF) parameters, i.e., of the class K functions included in the CBF condition, under input constraints. We introduce the concept of locally validated CBF parameters, which are adapted online to guarantee finite-horizon safety, based on conditions derived from Nagumo's theorem and tangent cone analysis. To identify these parameters online, we integrate a learning-based approach with an uncertainty-aware verification process that account for both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties inherent in neural network predictions. Our method is demonstrated on a VTOL quadplane model during challenging transition and landing maneuvers, showcasing enhanced performance while maintaining safety.</description>

      <title>Subframework-based Bearing Rigidity Maintenance Control in Multirobot Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel approach for \textit{bearing rigidity} analysis and control in multi-robot networks with sensing constraints and dynamic topology. By decomposing the system's framework into \textit{subframeworks}, we express bearing rigidity -- a global property -- as a set of \textit{local} properties, with rigidity eigenvalues serving as natural \textit{local rigidity measures}. We propose a decentralized gradient-based controller to execute mission-specific commands using only bearing measurements. The controller preserves bearing rigidity by keeping the rigidity eigenvalues above a threshold, using only information exchanged within subframeworks. Simulations evaluate the scheme's effectiveness, underscoring its scalability and practicality.</description>

      <title>Enabling On-Device Medical AI Assistants via Input-Driven Saliency Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant impact on the healthcare scenarios but remain prohibitively large for deployment in real-time, resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. In this work, we introduce a novel medical assistant system, optimized through our general-purpose compression framework, which tailors Large Language Models (LLMs) for deployment in specialized domains. By measuring neuron saliency on domain-specific data, our method can aggressively prune irrelevant neurons, reducing model size while preserving performance. Following pruning, we apply post-training quantization to further reduce the memory footprint, and evaluate the compressed model across medical benchmarks including MedMCQA, MedQA, and PubMedQA. We also deploy the 50\% compressed Gemma and the 67\% compressed LLaMA3 models on Jetson Orin Nano (18.7W peak) and Raspberry Pi 5 (6.3W peak), achieving real-time, energy-efficient inference under hardware constraints.</description>

      <title>Data-driven control of a magnetohydrodynamic flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the feedback control of a weakly conducting magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow via Lorentz forces generated by externally applied electric and magnetic fields. Specifically, we steer the flow of an electrolyte toward prescribed velocity or vorticity patterns using arrays of electrodes and electromagnets positioned around and beneath a fluid reservoir, with feedback provided by planar particle image velocimetry (PIV). Control is implemented using a model predictive control (MPC) framework, in which control signals are computed by minimizing a cost function over the predicted evolution of the flow. The predictor is constructed entirely from data using Koopman operator theory, which enables a linear representation of the underlying nonlinear fluid dynamics. This linearity allows the MPC problem to be solved by alternating between two small and efficiently solvable convex quadratic programs (QPs): one for the electrodes and one for the electromagnets. The resulting controller runs in a closed loop on a standard laptop, enabling real-time control of the flow. We demonstrate the functionality of the approach through experiments in which the flow is shaped to match a range of reference velocity fields and a time-varying vorticity field.</description>

      <title>Systolic Array-based Accelerator for Structured State-Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequence modeling is crucial for AI to understand temporal data and detect complex time-dependent patterns. While recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Transformers have advanced in capturing long-range dependencies, they struggle with achieving high accuracy with very long sequences due to limited memory retention (fixed context window). State-Space Models (SSMs) leverage exponentially decaying memory enabling lengthy context window and so they process very long data sequences more efficiently than recurrent and Transformer-based models. Unlike traditional neural models like CNNs and RNNs, SSM-based models require solving differential equations through continuous integration, making training and inference both compute- and memory-intensive on conventional CPUs and GPUs. In this paper we introduce a specialized hardware accelerator, EpochCore, for accelerating SSMs. EpochCore is based on systolic arrays (SAs) and is designed to enhance the energy efficiency and throughput of inference of SSM-based models for long-range sequence tasks. Within the SA, we propose a versatile processing element (PE) called LIMA-PE to perform traditional and specialized MAC operations to support traditional DNNs and SSMs. To complement the EpochCore microarchitecture, we propose a novel dataflow, ProDF, which enables highly efficient execution of SSM-based models. By leveraging the LIMA-PE microarchitecture and ProDF, EpochCore achieves on average 2000x improvement in performance on LRA datasets compared to a GPU and 250x gains in performance and 45x improvement in energy efficiency, over traditional SA-based accelerators (TPU).</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization applied for accelerated Virtual Validation of the Autonomous Driving Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rigorous Verification and Validation (V&amp;V) of Autonomous Driving Functions (ADFs) is paramount for ensuring the safety and public acceptance of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). Current validation relies heavily on simulation to achieve sufficient test coverage within the Operational Design Domain (ODD) of a vehicle, but exhaustively exploring the vast parameter space of possible scenarios is computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work introduces a framework based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) to accelerate the discovery of critical scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework on an Model Predictive Controller (MPC)-based motion planner, showing that it identifies hazardous situations, such as off-road events, using orders of magnitude fewer simulations than brute-force Design of Experiments (DoE) methods. Furthermore, this study investigates the scalability of the framework in higher-dimensional parameter spaces and its ability to identify multiple, distinct critical regions within the ODD of the motion planner used as the case study .</description>

      <title>Tunable Leg Stiffness in a Monopedal Hopper for Energy-Efficient Vertical Hopping Across Varying Ground Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the design and implementation of HASTA (Hopper with Adjustable Stiffness for Terrain Adaptation), a vertical hopping robot with real-time tunable leg stiffness, aimed at optimizing energy efficiency across various ground profiles (a pair of ground stiffness and damping conditions). By adjusting leg stiffness, we aim to maximize apex hopping height, a key metric for energy-efficient vertical hopping. We hypothesize that softer legs perform better on soft, damped ground by minimizing penetration and energy loss, while stiffer legs excel on hard, less damped ground by reducing limb deformation and energy dissipation. Through experimental tests and simulations, we find the best leg stiffness within our selection for each combination of ground stiffness and damping, enabling the robot to achieve maximum steady-state hopping height with a constant energy input. These results support our hypothesis that tunable stiffness improves energy-efficient locomotion in controlled experimental conditions. In addition, the simulation provides insights that could aid in the future development of controllers for selecting leg stiffness.</description>
