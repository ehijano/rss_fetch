      <title>Fairness-aware Age-of-Information Minimization in WPT-Assisted Short-Packet THz Communications for mURLLC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The technological landscape is swiftly advancing towards large-scale systems, creating significant opportunities, particularly in the domain of Terahertz (THz) communications. Networks designed for massive connectivity, comprising numerous Internet of Things (IoT) devices, are at the forefront of this advancement. In this paper, we consider Wireless Power Transfer (WPT)-enabled networks that support these IoT devices with massive Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communication (mURLLC) services.The focus of such networks is information freshness, with the Age-of-Information (AoI) serving as the pivotal performance metric. In particular, we aim to minimize the maximum AoI among IoT devices by optimizing the scheduling policy. Our analytical findings establish the convexity property of the problem, which can be solved efficiently. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of AoI-oriented cluster capacity, examining the relationship between the number of supported devices and the AoI performance in the network. Numerical simulations validate the advantage of our proposed approach in enhancing AoI performance, indicating its potential to guide the design of future THz communication systems for IoT applications requiring mURLLC services.</description>

      <title>FastqZip: An Improved Reference-Based Genome Sequence Lossy Compression Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Storing and archiving data produced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a huge burden for research institutions. Reference-based compression algorithms are effective in dealing with these data. Our work focuses on compressing FASTQ format files with an improved reference-based compression algorithm to achieve a higher compression ratio than other state-of-the-art algorithms. We propose FastqZip, which uses a new method mapping the sequence to reference for compression, allows reads-reordering and lossy quality scores, and the BSC or ZPAQ algorithm to perform final lossless compression for a higher compression ratio and relatively fast speed. Our method ensures the sequence can be losslessly reconstructed while allowing lossless or lossy compression for the quality scores. We reordered the reads to get a higher compression ratio. We evaluate our algorithms on five datasets and show that FastqZip can outperform the SOTA algorithm Genozip by around 10% in terms of compression ratio while having an acceptable slowdown.</description>

      <title>An Online Joint Optimization Approach for QoE Maximization in UAV-Enabled Mobile Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given flexible mobility, rapid deployment, and low cost, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled mobile edge computing (MEC) shows great potential to compensate for the lack of terrestrial edge computing coverage. However, limited battery capacity, computing and spectrum resources also pose serious challenges for UAV-enabled MEC, which shorten the service time of UAVs and degrade the quality of experience (QoE) of user devices (UDs) {\color{b} without effective control approach}. In this work, we consider a UAV-enabled MEC scenario where a UAV serves as an aerial edge server to provide computing services for multiple ground UDs. Then, a joint task offloading, resource allocation, and UAV trajectory planning optimization problem (JTRTOP) is formulated to maximize the QoE of UDs under the UAV energy consumption constraint. To solve the JTRTOP that is proved to be a future-dependent and NP-hard problem, an online joint optimization approach (OJOA) is proposed. Specifically, the JTRTOP is first transformed into a per-slot real-time optimization problem (PROP) by using the Lyapunov optimization framework. Then, a two-stage optimization method based on game theory and convex optimization is proposed to solve the PROP. Simulation results validate that the proposed approach can achieve superior system performance compared to the other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>A remark on conditional entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The following note proves that conditional entropy of a sequence is almost time-reversal invariant, specifically they only differ by a small constant factor dependent only upon the forward and backward models that the entropies are being calculated with respect to. This gives rise to a numerical value that quantifies learnability, as well as a methodology to control for distributional shift between datasets. Rough guidelines are given for practitioners.</description>

      <title>Distributed and Rate-Adaptive Feature Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of distributed and rate-adaptive feature compression for linear regression. A set of distributed sensors collect disjoint features of regressor data. A fusion center is assumed to contain a pretrained linear regression model, trained on a dataset of the entire uncompressed data. At inference time, the sensors compress their observations and send them to the fusion center through communication-constrained channels, whose rates can change with time. Our goal is to design a feature compression {scheme} that can adapt to the varying communication constraints, while maximizing the inference performance at the fusion center. We first obtain the form of optimal quantizers assuming knowledge of underlying regressor data distribution. Under a practically reasonable approximation, we then propose a distributed compression scheme which works by quantizing a one-dimensional projection of the sensor data. We also propose a simple adaptive scheme for handling changes in communication constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the distributed adaptive compression scheme through simulated experiments.</description>

      <title>Generating gaussian pseudorandom noise with binary sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian random number generators attract a widespread interest due to their applications in several fields. Important requirements include easy implementation, tail accuracy, and, finally, a flat spectrum. In this work, we study the applicability of uniform pseudorandom binary generators in combination with the Central Limit Theorem to propose an easy to implement, efficient and flexible algorithm that leverages the properties of the pseudorandom binary generator used as an input, specially with respect to the correlation measure of higher order, to guarantee the quality of the generated samples. Our main result provides a relationship between the pseudorandomness of the input and the statistical moments of the output. We propose a design based on the combination of pseudonoise sequences commonly used on wireless communications with known hardware implementation, which can generate sequences with guaranteed statistical distribution properties sufficient for many real life applications and simple machinery. Initial computer simulations on this construction show promising results in the quality of the output and the computational resources in terms of required memory and complexity.</description>

      <title>Classification and Regression Error Bounds for Inhomogenous Data With Applications to Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study classification and regression error bounds for inhomogenous data that are independent but not necessarily identically distributed. First, we consider classification of data in the presence of non-stationary noise and establish ergodic type sufficient conditions that guarantee the achievability of the Bayes error bound, using universal rules. We then perform a similar analysis for $k$-nearest neighbour regression and obtain optimal error bounds for the same. Finally, we illustrate applications of our results in the context of wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Energy Allocation for Multi-User Cooperative Molecular Communication Systems in the Internet of Bio-Nano Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative molecular communication (MC) is a promising technology for facilitating communication between nanomachines in the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) field. However, the performance of IoBNT is limited by the availability of energy for cooperative MC. This paper presents a novel transmitter design scheme that utilizes molecule movement between reservoirs, creating concentration differences through the consumption of free energy, and encoding information on molecule types. The performance of the transmitter is primarily influenced by energy costs, which directly impact the overall IoBNT system performance. To address this, the paper focuses on optimizing energy allocation in cooperative MC for enhanced transmitter performance. Theoretical analysis is conducted for two transmitters. For scenarios with more than two users, a genetic algorithm is employed in the energy allocation to minimize the total bit error rate (BER). Finally, numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed energy allocation strategies in the considered cooperative MC system.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis and ISI Mitigation with Imperfect Transmitter in Molecular Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In molecular communication (MC), molecules are released from the transmitter to convey information. This paper considers a realistic molecule shift keying (MoSK) scenario with two species of molecule in two reservoirs, where the molecules are harvested from the environment and placed into different reservoirs, which are purified by exchanging molecules between the reservoirs. This process consumes energy, and for a reasonable energy cost, the reservoirs cannot be pure; thus, our MoSK transmitter is imperfect, releasing mixtures of both molecules for every symbol, resulting in inter-symbol interference (ISI). To mitigate ISI, the properties of the receiver are analyzed and a detection method based on the ratio of different molecules is proposed. Theoretical and simulation results are provided, showing that with the increase of energy cost, the system achieves better performance. The good performance of the proposed detection scheme is also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Some bounds on the cardinality of the $b$-symbol weight spectrum of codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The size of the Hamming distance spectrum of a code has received great attention in recent research. The main objective of this paper is to extend these significant theories to the $b$-symbol distance spectrum. We examine this question for various types of codes, including unrestricted codes, additive codes, linear codes, and cyclic codes, successively. For the first three cases, we determine the maximum size of the $b$-symbol distance spectra of these codes smoothly. For the case of cyclic codes, we introduce three approaches to characterize the upper bound for the cardinality of the $b$-symbol weight spectrum of cyclic codes, namely the period distribution approach, the primitive idempotent approach, and the $b$-symbol weight formula approach. As two by-products of this paper, the maximum number of symplectic weights of linear codes is determined, and a basic inequality among the parameters $[n,k,d_H(\C)]_q$ of cyclic codes is provided.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Unsupervised Deep Learning for Robust Joint AP Clustering and Beamforming Design in Cell-Free Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider robust joint access point (AP) clustering and beamforming design with imperfect channel state information (CSI) in cell-free systems. Specifically, we jointly optimize AP clustering and beamforming with imperfect CSI to simultaneously maximize the worst-case sum rate and minimize the number of AP clustering under power constraint and the sparsity constraint of AP clustering. By transformations, the semi-infinite constraints caused by the imperfect CSI are converted into more tractable forms for facilitating a computationally efficient unsupervised deep learning algorithm. In addition, to further reduce the computational complexity, a computationally effective unsupervised deep learning algorithm is proposed to implement robust joint AP clustering and beamforming design with imperfect CSI in cell-free systems. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed unsupervised deep learning algorithm achieves a higher worst-case sum rate under a smaller number of AP clustering with computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Peak Age of Information in MEC Systems: Computing Preemption and Non-preemption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The freshness of information in real-time monitoring systems has received increasing attention, with Age of Information (AoI) emerging as a novel metric for measuring information freshness. In many applications, update packets need to be computed before being delivered to a destination. Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a promising approach for efficiently accomplishing the computing process, where the transmission process and computation process are coupled, jointly affecting freshness. In this paper, we aim to minimize the average peak AoI (PAoI) in an MEC system. We consider the generate-at-will source model and study when to generate a new update in two edge server setups: 1) computing preemption, where the packet in the computing process will be preempted by the newly arrived one, and 2) non-preemption, where the newly arrived packet will wait in the queue until the current one completes computing. We prove that the fixed threshold policy is optimal in a non-preemptive system for arbitrary transmission time and computation time distributions. In a preemptive system, we show that the transmission-aware threshold policy is optimal when the computing time follows an exponential distribution. Our numerical simulation results not only validate the theoretical findings but also demonstrate that: 1) in our problem, preemptive systems are not always superior to non-preemptive systems, even with exponential distribution, and 2) as the ratio of the mean transmission time to the mean computation time increases, the optimal threshold increases in preemptive systems but decreases in non-preemptive systems.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Identification Codes for Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many communication applications incorporate event-triggered behavior, where the conventional Shannon capacity may not effectively gauge performance. Consequently, we advocate for the concept of identification capacity as a more suitable metric for assessing these systems. We consider deterministic identification codes for the Gaussian AWGN, the slow fading, and the fast fading channels with power constraints. We prove lower bounds on capacities for the slow and the fast fading channels with side information for a wide range of fading distributions. Additionally, we present the code construction with efficient encoding which achieves the lower bound on capacity both for the slow and the fast fading channels. At last, we prove the same lower bound on the capacity of the fast fading channel without side information, i.e. the same lower bound holds even when the receiver doesn't know the fading coefficients. As a result we show that compared with Shannon's message transmission paradigm we achieved completely different capacity scaling for deterministic identification codes for all relevant fading channels.</description>

      <title>Wideband Beamforming for Near-Field Communications with Circular Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The beamforming performance of the uniform circular array (UCA) in near-field wideband communication systems is investigated. Compared to uniform linear array (ULA), UCA exhibits uniform effective array aperture in all directions, thus enabling more users to benefit from near-field communications. In this paper, the unique beam squint effect in near-field wideband UCA systems is comprehensively analyzed in both the distance and angular domains. It is rigorously demonstrated that the beam focal point only exists at a specific frequency in wideband UCA systems, resulting in significant beamforming loss. To alleviate this unique beam squint effect, the true-time delay (TTD)-based beamforming architecture is exploited. In particular, two wideband beamforming optimization approaches leveraging TTD units are proposed. 1) Analytical approach: In this approach, the phase shifters (PSs) and the time delay of TTD units are designed based on the analytical formula for beamforming gain. Following this design, the minimum number of TTD units required to achieve a predetermined beamforming gain is quantified. 2) Joint-optimization approach: In this method, the PSs and the TTD units are jointly optimized under practical maximum delay constraints to approximate the optimal unconstrained analog beamformer. Specifically, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is proposed, where the PSs and the TTD units are alternately updated using either the closed-form solution or the low-complexity linear search approach. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that 1) the proposed beamforming schemes effectively mitigate the beam squint effect, and 2) the joint-optimization approach outperforms the analytical approach in terms of array gain and achievable spectral efficiency.</description>

      <title>An Error-Bounded Lossy Compression Method with Bit-Adaptive Quantization for Particle Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents error-bounded lossy compression tailored for particle datasets from diverse scientific applications in cosmology, fluid dynamics, and fusion energy sciences. As today's high-performance computing capabilities advance, these datasets often reach trillions of points, posing significant visualization, analysis, and storage challenges. While error-bounded lossy compression makes it possible to represent floating-point values with strict pointwise accuracy guarantees, the lack of correlations in particle data's storage ordering often limits the compression ratio. Inspired by quantization-encoding schemes in SZ lossy compressors, we dynamically determine the number of bits to encode particles of the dataset to increase the compression ratio. Specifically, we utilize a k-d tree to partition particles into subregions and generate ``bit boxes'' centered at particles for each subregion to encode their positions. These bit boxes ensure error control while reducing the bit count used for compression. We comprehensively evaluate our method against state-of-the-art compressors on cosmology, fluid dynamics, and fusion plasma datasets.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of task offloading in multi-access edge computing (MEC) systems constituting $N$ devices assisted by an edge server (ES), where the devices can split task execution between a local processor and the ES. Since the local task execution and communication with the ES both consume power, each device must judiciously choose between the two. We model the problem as a large population non-cooperative game among the $N$ devices. Since computation of an equilibrium in this scenario is difficult due to the presence of a large number of devices, we employ the mean-field game framework to reduce the finite-agent game problem to a generic user's multi-objective optimization problem, with a coupled consistency condition. By leveraging the novel age of information (AoI) metric, we invoke techniques from stochastic hybrid systems (SHS) theory and study the tradeoffs between increasing information freshness and reducing power consumption. In numerical simulations, we validate that a higher load at the ES may lead devices to upload their task to the ES less often.</description>

      <title>Trainable Least Squares to Reduce PAPR in OFDM-based Hybrid Beamforming Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a trainable least squares (LS) approach for reducing the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals in a hybrid beamforming (HBF) system. Compared to digital beamforming (DBF), in HBF technology the number of antennas exceeds the number of digital ports. Therefore, PAPR reduction capabilities are restricted by both a limited bandwidth and the reduced size of digital space. The problem is to meet both conditions. Moreover, the major HBF advantage is a reduced system complexity, thus the complexity of the PAPR reduction algorithm is expected to be low. To justify the performance of the proposed trainable LS, we provide a performance bound achieved by convex optimization using the CVX Matlab package. Moreover, the complexity of the proposed algorithm can be comparable to the minimal complexity of the digital ``twin'' calculation in HBF. The abovementioned features prove the feasibility of the trained LS for PAPR reduction in fully-connected HBF.</description>

      <title>Virtual Sectorization to Enable Hybrid Beamforming in mm-Wave mMIMO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid beamforming (HBF) is a key technology to enable mm-wave Massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) receivers for future-generation wireless communications. It combines beamforming in both analog (via phase shifters) and digital domains, resulting in low power consumption and high spectral efficiency. In practice, the problem of joint beamforming in multi-user scenarios is still open because an analog beam can't cover all users simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical approach to divide users into clusters. Each cluster consists of users inside a virtual sector produced by the analog beamforming of an HBF-based mMIMO receiver. Thus, inside each sector, a lower-cost digital beamforming serves a limited number of users within the same cluster. Simulations with realistic non-line-of-sight scenarios generated by the QuaDRiGa 2.0 demonstrate that our methods outperform standard FFT-based alternatives and almost achieve SVD-based beamspace performance bound.</description>

      <title>LoS Sensing-based Channel Estimation in UAV-Assisted OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, the potential advantage of the line-of-sight (LoS) path, characterized by its high probability of existence, has not been fully harnessed, thereby impeding the improvement of channel estimation (CE) accuracy. Inspired by the ideas of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), this letter develops a LoS sensing method aimed at detecting the presence of LoS path. Leveraging the prior information obtained from LoS path detection, the detection thresholds for resolvable paths are proposed for LoS and Non-LoS (NLoS) scenarios, respectively. By employing these specifically designed detection thresholds, denoising processing is applied to classical least square (LS) CE, thereby improving the CE accuracy. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing CE accuracy and demonstrate its robustness against parameter variations.</description>

Abstract: Given a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$, we introduce a new class of evaluation toric codes called edge codes derived from $\mathcal{H}$. We analyze these codes, focusing on determining their basic parameters. We provide estimations for the minimum distance, particularly in scenarios involving $d$-uniform clutters. Additionally, we demonstrate that these codes exhibit self-orthogonality. Furthermore, we compute the minimum distances of edge codes for all graphs with five vertices.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization on Uplink OFDMA and MU-MIMO for IEEE 802.11ax: Deep Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter tackles a joint user scheduling, frequency resource allocation (USRA), multi-input-multi-output mode selection (MIMO MS) between single-user MIMO and multi-user (MU) MIMO, and MU-MIMO user selection problem, integrating uplink orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) in IEEE 802.11ax. Specifically, we focus on \textit{unsaturated traffic conditions} where users' data demands fluctuate. In unsaturated traffic conditions, considering packet volumes per user introduces a combinatorial problem, requiring the simultaneous optimization of MU-MIMO user selection and RA along the time-frequency-space axis. Consequently, dealing with the combinatorial nature of this problem, characterized by a large cardinality of unknown variables, poses a challenge that conventional optimization methods find nearly impossible to address. In response, this letter proposes an approach with deep hierarchical reinforcement learning (DHRL) to solve the joint problem. Rather than simply adopting off-the-shelf DHRL, we \textit{tailor} the DHRL to the joint USRA and MS problem, thereby significantly improving the convergence speed and throughput. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves significantly improved throughput compared to the existing schemes under various unsaturated traffic conditions.</description>

      <title>A Universal Deep Neural Network for Signal Detection in Wireless Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, deep learning (DL) has been emerging as a promising approach for channel estimation and signal detection in wireless communications. The majority of the existing studies investigating the use of DL techniques in this domain focus on analysing channel impulse responses that are generated from only one channel distribution such as additive white Gaussian channel noise and Rayleigh channels. In practice, to cope with the dynamic nature of the wireless channel, DL methods must be re-trained on newly non-aged collected data which is costly, inefficient, and impractical. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a novel universal deep neural network (Uni-DNN) that can achieve high detection performance in various wireless environments without retraining the model. In particular, our proposed Uni-DNN model consists of a wireless channel classifier and a signal detector which are constructed by using DNNs. The wireless channel classifier enables the signal detector to generalise and perform optimally for multiple wireless channel distributions. In addition, to further improve the signal detection performance of the proposed model, convolutional neural network is employed. Extensive simulations using the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing scheme demonstrate that the bit error rate performance of our proposed solution can outperform conventional DL-based approaches as well as least square and minimum mean square error channel estimators in practical low pilot density scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) assisted terahertz (THz) wireless communications have been expected to play a vital role in the next generation of wireless networks. UAVs can serve as either repeaters or data collectors within the communication link, thereby potentially augmenting the efficacy of communication systems. Despite their promise, the channel analysis and modeling specific to THz wireless channels leveraging UAVs remain under explored. This work delves into a ground-to-UAV channel at 140 GHz, with a specific focus on the influence of UAV hovering behavior on channel performance. Employing experimental measurements through an unmodulated channel setup and a geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) that integrates three-dimensional positional coordinates and beamwidth, this work evaluates the impact of UAV dynamic movements and antenna orientation on channel performance. Our findings highlight the minimal impact of UAV orientation adjustments on channel performance and underscore the diminishing necessity for precise alignment between UAVs and ground stations as beamwidth increases.</description>

      <title>Information propagation in far-from-equilibrium molecular templating networks is optimised by pseudo-equilibrium systems with negligible dissipation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Far-from equilibrium molecular templating networks, like those that maintain the populations of RNA and protein molecules in the cell, are key biological motifs. These networks share the general property that assembled products are produced and degraded via complex pathways controlled by catalysts, including molecular templates. Although it has been suggested that the information propagated from templates to products sets a lower bound on the thermodynamic cost of these networks, this bound has not been explored rigorously to date. We show that, for an arbitrarily catalytic reaction network in steady state, the specificity with which a single product can dominate the ensemble is upper bounded, and the entropy of the product ensemble lower bounded, by a function of $\Delta G$, the difference between the maximal and minimal free-energy changes along pathways to assembly. These simple bounds are particularly restrictive for systems with a smaller number of possible products $M$. Remarkably, however, although $\Delta G$ constrains the information propagated to the product distribution, the systems that saturate the bound operate in a pseudo-equilibrium fashion, and there is no minimal entropy production rate for maintaining this non-equilibrium distribution. Moreover, for large systems, a vanishingly small subset of the possible products can dominate the product ensemble even for small values of $\Delta G/\ln M$.</description>

Abstract: Adaptation of a wireless system to the polarization state of the propagation channel can improve reliability and throughput. This paper in particular considers polarization reconfigurable multiple input multiple output (PR-MIMO) systems, where both transmitter and receiver can change the (linear) polarization orientation at each element of their antenna arrays. We first introduce joint polarization pre-post coding to maximize bounds on the capacity and the maximum eigenvalue of the channel matrix. For this we first derive approximate closed form equations of optimal polarization vectors at one link end, and then use iterative joint polarization pre-post coding to pursue joint optimal polarization vectors at both link ends. Next we investigate the combination of PR-MIMO with hybrid antenna selection / maximum ratio transmission (PR-HS/MRT), which can achieve a remarkable improvement of channel capacity and symbol error rate (SER). Further, two novel schemes of element wise and global polarization reconfiguration are presented for PR-HS/MRT. Comprehensive simulation results indicate that the proposed schemes provide 3 to 5 dB SNR gain in PR-MIMO spatial multiplexing and approximately 3 dB SNR gain in PRHS/ MRT, with concomitant improvements of channel capacity and SER.</description>

      <title>Tight Exponential Strong Converse for Source Coding Problem with Encoded Side Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The source coding problem with encoded side information is considered. A lower bound on the strong converse exponent has been derived by Oohama, but its tightness has not been clarified. In this paper, we derive a tight strong converse exponent. For the special case such that the side-information does not exists, we demonstrate that our tight exponent of the WAK problem reduces to the known tight expression of that special case while Oohama's lower bound is strictly loose. The converse part is proved by a judicious use of the change-of-measure argument, which was introduced by Gu-Effros and further developed by Tyagi-Watanabe. Interestingly, the soft Markov constraint, which was introduced by Oohama as a proof technique, is naturally incorporated into the characterization of the exponent. A technical innovation of this paper is recognizing that the soft Markov constraint is a part of the exponent, rather than a penalty term that should be vanished. In fact, via numerical experiment, we provide evidence that the soft Markov constraint is strictly positive. The achievability part is derived by a careful analysis of the type argument; however, unlike the conventional analysis for the achievable rate region, we need to derive the soft Markov constraint in the analysis of the correct probability. Furthermore, we present an application of our derivation of strong converse exponent to the privacy amplification.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces for Wireless Communication: Modeling and Physical Layer Aspects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.05928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) for wireless communications have a local position-dependent (phase-gradient) scattering response on the surface. We consider more general RIS structures, called nonlocal (or redirective) RIS, that are capable of selectively manipulate the impinging waves depending on the incident angle. Redirective RIS have nonlocal wavefront-selective scattering behavior and can be implemented using multilayer arrays such as metalenses. We demonstrate that this more sophisticated type of surfaces has several advantages such as: lower overhead through coodebook-based reconfigurability, decoupled wave manipulations, and higher efficiency in multiuser scenarios via multifunctional operation. Additionally, redirective RIS architectures greatly benefit form the directional nature of wave propagation at high frequencies and can support integrated fronthaul and access (IFA) networks most efficiently. We also discuss the scalability and compactness issues and propose efficient nonlocal RIS architectures such as fractionated lens-based RIS and mirror-backed phase-masks structures that do not require additional control complexity and overhead while still offering better performance than conventional local RIS.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Analysis of Maximum Power Association Policy for Cellular Networks Using Distance and Angular Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09939v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel stochastic geometry framework is proposed in this paper to study the downlink coverage performance in a millimeter wave (mmWave) cellular network by jointly considering the polar coordinates of the Base Stations (BSs) with respect to the typical user located at the origin. Specifically, both the Euclidean and the angular distances of the BSs in a maximum power-based association policy for the UE are considered to account for realistic beam management considerations, which have been largely ignored in the literature, especially in the cell association phase. For completeness, two other association schemes are considered and exact-form expressions for the coverage probability are derived. Subsequently, the key role of angular distances is highlighted by defining the dominant interferer using angular distance-based criteria instead of Euclidean distance-based, and conducting a dominant interferer-based coverage probability analysis. Among others, the numerical results revealed that considering angular distance-based criteria for determining both the serving and the dominant interfering BS, can approximate the coverage performance more accurately as compared to utilizing Euclidean distance-based criteria. To the best of the authors$'$ knowledge, this is the first work that rigorously explores the role of angular distances in the association policy and analysis of cellular networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a chaotic waveform-based multi-antenna receiver design for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). Particularly, we present a differential chaos shift keying (DCSK)-based SWIPT multiantenna receiver architecture, where each antenna switches between information transfer (IT) and energy harvesting (EH) modes depending on the receiver's requirements. We take into account a generalized frequency-selective Nakagami-m fading model as well as the nonlinearities of the EH process to derive closed-form analytical expressions for the associated bit error rate (BER) and the harvested direct current (DC), respectively. We show that, both depend on the parameters of the transmitted waveform and the number of receiver antennas being utilized in the IT and EH mode. We investigate a trade-off in terms of the BER and energy transfer by introducing a novel achievable `success rate - harvested energy' region. Moreover, we demonstrate that energy and information transfer are two conflicting tasks and hence, a single waveform cannot be simultaneously optimal for both IT and EH. Accordingly, we propose appropriate transmit waveform designs based on the application specific requirements of acceptable BER or harvested DC or both. Numerical results demonstrate the importance of chaotic waveform-based signal design and its impact on the proposed receiver architecture.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on Near-Field XL-MIMO Communications Towards 6G</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11044v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is a promising technology for the sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication networks. By significantly boosting the antenna number or size to at least an order of magnitude beyond current massive MIMO systems, XL-MIMO is expected to unprecedentedly enhance the spectral efficiency and spatial resolution for wireless communication. The evolution from massive MIMO to XL-MIMO is not simply an increase in the array size, but faces new design challenges, in terms of near-field channel modelling, performance analysis, channel estimation, and practical implementation. In this article, we give a comprehensive tutorial overview on near-field XL-MIMO communications, aiming to provide useful guidance for tackling the above challenges. First, the basic near-field modelling for XL-MIMO is established, by considering the new characteristics of non-uniform spherical wave (NUSW) and spatial non-stationarity. Next, based on the near-field modelling, the performance analysis of XL-MIMO is presented, including the near-field signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scaling laws, beam focusing pattern, achievable rate, and degrees-of-freedom (DoF). Furthermore, various XL-MIMO design issues such as near-field beam codebook, beam training, channel estimation, and delay alignment modulation (DAM) transmission are elaborated. Finally, we point out promising directions to inspire future research on near-field XL-MIMO communications.</description>

Abstract: As the demand for high-quality services proliferates, an innovative network architecture, the fully-decoupled RAN (FD-RAN), has emerged for more flexible spectrum resource utilization and lower network costs. However, with the decoupling of uplink base stations and downlink base stations in FD-RAN, the traditional transmission mechanism, which relies on real-time channel feedback, is not suitable as the receiver is not able to feedback accurate and timely channel state information to the transmitter. This paper proposes a novel transmission scheme without relying on physical layer channel feedback. Specifically, we design a radio map based complex-valued precoding network~(RMCPNet) model, which outputs the base station precoding based on user location. RMCPNet comprises multiple subnets, with each subnet responsible for extracting unique modal features from diverse input modalities. Furthermore, the multi-modal embeddings derived from these distinct subnets are integrated within the information fusion layer, culminating in a unified representation. We also develop a specific RMCPNet training algorithm that employs the negative spectral efficiency as the loss function. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme on the public DeepMIMO dataset and show that RMCPNet can achieve 16\% and 76\% performance improvements over the conventional real-valued neural network and statistical codebook approach, respectively.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic positioning via ray tracing with noisy angle of arrival measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00611v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the positioning problem in non line-of-sight (NLoS) situations, where several base stations (BS) try to locate a user equipment (UE) based on uplink angle of arrival (AoA) measurements and a digital twin of the environment. Ray launching in a Monte Carlo manner according to the AoA statistics enables to produce a map of points for each BS. These points represent the intersections of the rays with a xy plane at a given user equipment (UE) elevation. We propose to fit a parametric probability density function (pdf), such as a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), to each map of points. Multiplying the obtained pdfs for each BS enables to compute the position probability of the UE. This approach yields an algorithm robust to a reduced number of launched rays. Moreover, these parametric pdfs may be fitted and stored in an offline phase such that ray tracing can be avoided in the online phase. This significantly reduces the computational complexity of the positioning method.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Multi-Antenna Users and Phase Misalignments: A Novel Partially Coherent Transmission Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a promising technology for next-generation communication systems. This work proposes a novel partially coherent (PC) transmission framework to cope with the challenge of phase misalignment among the access points (APs), which is important for unlocking the full potential of cell-free massive MIMO technology. With the PC operation, the APs are only required to be phase-aligned within clusters. Each cluster transmits the same data stream towards each user equipment (UE), while different clusters send different data streams. We first propose a novel algorithm to group APs into clusters such that the distance between two APs is always smaller than a reference distance ensuring the phase alignment of these APs. Then, we propose new algorithms that optimize the combining at UEs and precoding at APs to maximize the downlink sum data rates. We also propose a novel algorithm for data stream allocation to further improve the sum data rate of the PC operation. Numerical results show that the PC operation using the proposed framework with a sufficiently small reference distance can offer a sum rate close to the sum rate of the ideal fully coherent (FC) operation that requires network-wide phase alignment. This demonstrates the potential of PC operation in practical deployments of cell-free massive MIMO networks.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Enabled Interference Network: Joint Antenna Position and Beamforming Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the utility of movable antenna (MA) assistance for the multiple-input single-output (MISO) interference channel. We exploit an additional design degree of freedom provided by MA to enhance the desired signal and suppress interference so as to reduce the total transmit power of interference network. To this end, we jointly optimize the MA positions and transmit beamforming, subject to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio constraints of users. To address the non-convex optimization problem, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm to alternately optimize the MA positions via successive convex approximation method and the transmit beamforming via second-order cone program approach. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MA-enabled MISO interference network outperforms its conventional counterpart without MA, which significantly enhances the capability of inter-cell frequency reuse and reduces the complexity of transmitter design.</description>

      <title>On the Performance of Low-complexity Decoders of LDPC and Polar Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient decoding is crucial to high-throughput and low-power wireless communication scenarios. A theoretical analysis of the performance-complexity tradeoff toward low-complexity decoding is required for a better understanding of the fundamental limits in the above-mentioned scenarios. This study aims to explore the performance of decoders with complexity constraints. Specifically, we investigate the performance of LDPC codes with different numbers of belief-propagation iterations and the performance of polar codes with an SSC decoder. We found that the asymptotic error rates of both polar codes and LDPC codes are functions of complexity $T$ and code length $N$, in the form of $2^{-a2^{b\frac{T}{N}}}$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants that depend on channel and coding schemes. Our analysis reveals the different performance-complexity tradeoffs for LDPC and polar codes. The results indicate that if one aims to further enhance the decoding efficiency for LDPC codes, the key lies in how to efficiently pass messages on the factor graph. In terms of decoding efficiency, polar codes asymptotically outperform $(J, K)$-regular LDPC codes with a code rate $R \le 1-\frac{J(J-1)}{2^J+(J-1)}$ in the low-complexity regime $(T \le O(NlogN))$.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Algorithm Framework for Discrete Probability Distributions with Applications to R\'enyi Entropy Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating statistical properties is fundamental in statistics and computer science. In this paper, we propose a unified quantum algorithm framework for estimating properties of discrete probability distributions, with estimating R\'enyi entropies as specific examples. In particular, given a quantum oracle that prepares an $n$-dimensional quantum state $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sqrt{p_{i}}|i\rangle$, for $\alpha&gt;1$ and $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$, our algorithm framework estimates $\alpha$-R\'enyi entropy $H_{\alpha}(p)$ to within additive error $\epsilon$ with probability at least $2/3$ using $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{1-\frac{1}{2\alpha}}/\epsilon + \sqrt{n}/\epsilon^{1+\frac{1}{2\alpha}})$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{\frac{1}{2\alpha}}/\epsilon^{1+\frac{1}{2\alpha}})$ queries, respectively. This improves the best known dependence in $\epsilon$ as well as the joint dependence between $n$ and $1/\epsilon$. Technically, our quantum algorithms combine quantum singular value transformation, quantum annealing, and variable-time amplitude estimation. We believe that our algorithm framework is of general interest and has wide applications.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Dataset Reconstruction from Interpretable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interpretability is often pointed out as a key requirement for trustworthy machine learning. However, learning and releasing models that are inherently interpretable leaks information regarding the underlying training data. As such disclosure may directly conflict with privacy, a precise quantification of the privacy impact of such breach is a fundamental problem. For instance, previous work have shown that the structure of a decision tree can be leveraged to build a probabilistic reconstruction of its training dataset, with the uncertainty of the reconstruction being a relevant metric for the information leak. In this paper, we propose of a novel framework generalizing these probabilistic reconstructions in the sense that it can handle other forms of interpretable models and more generic types of knowledge. In addition, we demonstrate that under realistic assumptions regarding the interpretable models' structure, the uncertainty of the reconstruction can be computed efficiently. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of our approach on both decision trees and rule lists, by comparing the theoretical information leak associated to either exact or heuristic learning algorithms. Our results suggest that optimal interpretable models are often more compact and leak less information regarding their training data than greedily-built ones, for a given accuracy level.</description>

      <title>Efficient Computation of the Quantum Rate-Distortion Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum rate-distortion function plays a fundamental role in quantum information theory, however there is currently no practical algorithm which can efficiently compute this function to high accuracy for moderate channel dimensions. In this paper, we show how symmetry reduction can significantly simplify common instances of the entanglement-assisted quantum rate-distortion problems. This allows us to better understand the properties of the quantum channels which obtain the optimal rate-distortion trade-off, while also allowing for more efficient computation of the quantum rate-distortion function regardless of the numerical algorithm being used. Additionally, we propose an inexact variant of the mirror descent algorithm to compute the quantum rate-distortion function with provable sublinear convergence rates. We show how this mirror descent algorithm is related to Blahut-Arimoto and expectation-maximization methods previously used to solve similar problems in information theory. Using these techniques, we present the first numerical experiments to compute a multi-qubit quantum rate-distortion function, and show that our proposed algorithm solves faster and to higher accuracy when compared to existing methods.</description>
