      <title>PDStream: Slashing Long-Tail Delay in Interactive Video Streaming via Pseudo-Dual Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) delay is critical for interactive video streaming (IVS) experiences, but remains unsatisfactory for its long-tail distribution caused by periodic large keyframes. Conventional optimization strategies, such as jitter buffer, bitrate adaptation, and customized encoding, either sacrifice clarity, average delay, or compatibility. To address this issue, we propose PDStream, a novel pseudo-dual streaming algorithm, aimed at minimizing E2E delay while maintaining video clarity. The core idea is to split the two functions, delay-sensitive playback and delay-tolerant reference, on keyframes through dual streaming. Specifically, the playback function is held by a second parallel stream, which comprises much smaller non-keyframes and is allocated more immediate bandwidth for real-time performance. The reference function is ensured by the first stream with keyframe preservation, allocated more subsequent bandwidth to smooth out bursty traffic. Additionally, ``pseudo'' minimizes computational and transmission overheads by restricting dual streams to brief activation only when keyframes appear, supported by corresponding dual-stream bitrate allocation and adaptation to ensure delay and clarity. We implement PDStream on a WebRTC-based IVS testbed with real-world network traces. Results show that PDStream significantly outperforms prior algorithms, reducing average E2E delay by 17.5\% and slashing its 97th percentile by 33.3\%, while keeping clarity under varying bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Towards Multimodal Empathetic Response Generation: A Rich Text-Speech-Vision Avatar-based Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empathetic Response Generation (ERG) is one of the key tasks of the affective computing area, which aims to produce emotionally nuanced and compassionate responses to user's queries. However, existing ERG research is predominantly confined to the singleton text modality, limiting its effectiveness since human emotions are inherently conveyed through multiple modalities. To combat this, we introduce an avatar-based Multimodal ERG (MERG) task, entailing rich text, speech, and facial vision information. We first present a large-scale high-quality benchmark dataset, \textbf{AvaMERG}, which extends traditional text ERG by incorporating authentic human speech audio and dynamic talking-face avatar videos, encompassing a diverse range of avatar profiles and broadly covering various topics of real-world scenarios. Further, we deliberately tailor a system, named \textbf{Empatheia}, for MERG. Built upon a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with multimodal encoder, speech and avatar generators, Empatheia performs end-to-end MERG, with Chain-of-Empathetic reasoning mechanism integrated for enhanced empathy understanding and reasoning. Finally, we devise a list of empathetic-enhanced tuning strategies, strengthening the capabilities of emotional accuracy and content, avatar-profile consistency across modalities. Experimental results on AvaMERG data demonstrate that Empatheia consistently shows superior performance than baseline methods on both textual ERG and MERG. Overall, this work is expected to pioneer the MERG research by introducing a novel benchmark and an end-to-end model, laying a solid foundation for future advancements in multimodal empathetic response generation.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Prototype Knowledge Transfer for Federated Learning with Mixed Modalities and Heterogeneous Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train models on multimodal data while ensuring clients' privacy. However, modality and task heterogeneity hinder clients from learning a unified representation, weakening local model generalization, especially in MFL with mixed modalities where only some clients have multimodal data. In this work, we propose an Adaptive prototype-based Multimodal Federated Learning (AproMFL) framework for mixed modalities and heterogeneous tasks to address the aforementioned issues. Our AproMFL transfers knowledge through adaptively-constructed prototypes without a prior public dataset. Clients adaptively select prototype construction methods in line with tasks; server converts client prototypes into unified multimodal prototypes and aggregates them to form global prototypes, avoid clients keeping unified labels. We divide the model into various modules and only aggregate mapping modules to reduce communication and computation overhead. To address aggregation issues in heterogeneity, we develop a client relationship graph-based scheme to dynamically adjust aggregation weights. Extensive experiments on representative datasets evidence effectiveness of AproMFL.</description>

      <title>Latent Swap Joint Diffusion for Long-Form Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous work on long-form audio generation using global-view diffusion or iterative generation demands significant training or inference costs. While recent advancements in multi-view joint diffusion for panoramic generation provide an efficient option, they struggle with spectrum generation with severe overlap distortions and high cross-view consistency costs. We initially explore this phenomenon through the connectivity inheritance of latent maps and uncover that averaging operations excessively smooth the high-frequency components of the latent map. To address these issues, we propose Swap Forward (SaFa), a frame-level latent swap framework that synchronizes multiple diffusions to produce a globally coherent long audio with more spectrum details in a forward-only manner. At its core, the bidirectional Self-Loop Latent Swap is applied between adjacent views, leveraging stepwise diffusion trajectory to adaptively enhance high-frequency components without disrupting low-frequency components. Furthermore, to ensure cross-view consistency, the unidirectional Reference-Guided Latent Swap is applied between the reference and the non-overlap regions of each subview during the early stages, providing centralized trajectory guidance. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that SaFa significantly outperforms existing joint diffusion methods and even training-based long audio generation models. Moreover, we find that it also adapts well to panoramic generation, achieving comparable state-of-the-art performance with greater efficiency and model generalizability.

      <title>An End-to-End Pipeline Perspective on Video Streaming in Best-Effort Networks: A Survey and Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remaining a dominant force in Internet traffic, video streaming captivates end users, service providers, and researchers. This paper takes a pragmatic approach to reviewing recent advances in the field by focusing on the prevalent streaming paradigm that involves delivering long-form two-dimensional videos over the best-effort Internet with client-side adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms and assistance from content delivery networks (CDNs). To enhance accessibility, we supplement the survey with tutorial material. Unlike existing surveys that offer fragmented views, our work provides a holistic perspective on the entire end-to-end streaming pipeline, from video capture by a camera-equipped device to playback by the end user. Our novel perspective covers the ingestion, processing, and distribution stages of the pipeline and addresses key challenges such as video compression, upload, transcoding, ABR algorithms, CDN support, and quality of experience. We review over 200 papers and classify streaming designs by their problem-solving methodology, whether based on intuition (simple heuristics), theory (formal optimization), or machine learning (generalizable data patterns). The survey further refines these methodology-based categories and characterizes each design by additional traits such as compatible codecs and use of super resolution. We connect the reviewed research to real-world applications by discussing the practices of commercial streaming platforms. Finally, the survey highlights prominent current trends and outlines future directions in video streaming.</description>

      <title>Improving Accuracy and Generalization for Efficient Visual Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient visual trackers overfit to their training distributions and lack generalization abilities, resulting in them performing well on their respective in-distribution (ID) test sets and not as well on out-of-distribution (OOD) sequences, imposing limitations to their deployment in-the-wild under constrained resources. We introduce SiamABC, a highly efficient Siamese tracker that significantly improves tracking performance, even on OOD sequences. SiamABC takes advantage of new architectural designs in the way it bridges the dynamic variability of the target, and of new losses for training. Also, it directly addresses OOD tracking generalization by including a fast backward-free dynamic test-time adaptation method that continuously adapts the model according to the dynamic visual changes of the target. Our extensive experiments suggest that SiamABC shows remarkable performance gains in OOD sets while maintaining accurate performance on the ID benchmarks. SiamABC outperforms MixFormerV2-S by 7.6\% on the OOD AVisT benchmark while being 3x faster (100 FPS) on a CPU. Our code and models are available at https://wvuvl.github.io/SiamABC/.</description>

      <title>Long-tailed Medical Diagnosis with Relation-aware Representation Learning and Iterative Classifier Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently computer-aided diagnosis has demonstrated promising performance, effectively alleviating the workload of clinicians. However, the inherent sample imbalance among different diseases leads algorithms biased to the majority categories, leading to poor performance for rare categories. Existing works formulated this challenge as a long-tailed problem and attempted to tackle it by decoupling the feature representation and classification. Yet, due to the imbalanced distribution and limited samples from tail classes, these works are prone to biased representation learning and insufficient classifier calibration. To tackle these problems, we propose a new Long-tailed Medical Diagnosis (LMD) framework for balanced medical image classification on long-tailed datasets. In the initial stage, we develop a Relation-aware Representation Learning (RRL) scheme to boost the representation ability by encouraging the encoder to capture intrinsic semantic features through different data augmentations. In the subsequent stage, we propose an Iterative Classifier Calibration (ICC) scheme to calibrate the classifier iteratively. This is achieved by generating a large number of balanced virtual features and fine-tuning the encoder using an Expectation-Maximization manner. The proposed ICC compensates for minority categories to facilitate unbiased classifier optimization while maintaining the diagnostic knowledge in majority classes. Comprehensive experiments on three public long-tailed medical datasets demonstrate that our LMD framework significantly surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.
