      <title>The Optimal Growth Mode in the Relaxation to Statistical Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems far from equilibrium approach stability slowly due to "anti-mixing" characterized by regions of the phase-space that remain disconnected after prolonged action of the flow. We introduce the Optimal Growth Mode (OGM) to capture this slow initial relaxation. The OGM is calculated from Markov matrices approximating the action of the Fokker-Planck operator onto the phase space. It is obtained as the mode having the largest growth in energy before decay. Important nuances between the OGM and the more traditional slowest decaying mode are detailed in the case of the Lorenz 63 model. The implications for understanding how complex systems respond to external forces, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous transition to chaos in a canonical random neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a paradigmatic random recurrent neural network introduced by Sompolinsky, Crisanti, and Sommers (SCS). In the infinite size limit, this system exhibits a direct transition from a homogeneous rest state to chaotic behavior, with the Lyapunov exponent gradually increasing from zero. We generalize the SCS model considering odd saturating nonlinear transfer functions, beyond the usual choice $\phi(x)=\tanh x$. A discontinuous transition to chaos occurs whenever the slope of $\phi$ at 0 is a local minimum (i.e., for $\phi'''(0)&gt;0$). Chaos appears out of the blue, by an attractor-repeller fold. Accordingly, the Lyapunov exponent stays away from zero at the birth of chaos.</description>

      <title>Isles of regularity in a sea of chaos amid the gravitational three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The three-body problem (3BP) poses a longstanding challenge in physics and celestial mechanics. Despite the impossibility of obtaining general analytical solutions, statistical theories have been developed based on the ergodic principle. This assumption is justified by chaos, which is expected to fully mix the accessible phase space of the 3BP. This study probes the presence of regular (i.e. non chaotic) trajectories within the 3BP and assesses their impact on statistical escape theories. Using numerical simulations, we establish criteria for identifying regular trajectories and analyse their impact on statistical outcomes. Our analysis reveals that regular trajectories occupy up to 32% of the phase space, and their outcomes defy the predictions of statistical escape theories. The coexistence of regular and chaotic regions at all scales is characterized by a multi-fractal behaviour. Integration errors manifest as numerical chaos, artificially enhancing the mixing of the phase space and affecting the reliability of individual simulations, yet preserving the statistical correctness of an ensemble of realizations. Our findings underscore the challenges in applying statistical escape theories to astrophysical problems, as they may bias results by excluding the outcome of regular trajectories. This is particularly important in the context of formation scenarios of gravitational wave mergers, where biased estimates of binary eccentricity can significantly impact estimates of coalescence efficiency and detectable eccentricity.</description>

      <title>System identification based on characteristic curves: a mathematical connection between power series and Fourier analysis for first-order nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the sinosoidal output response in power series (SORPS) formalism was presented for system identification and simulation. Based on the concept of characteristic curves (CCs), it establishes a mathematical connection between power series and Fourier series for a first-order nonlinear system [F. J. Gonzalez, Sci. Rep. 13, 1955, (2023)]. However, the system identification procedure discussed there, based on fast Fourier transform (FFT), presents the limitations of requiring a sinusoidal single tone for the dynamical variable and equally spaced time steps for the input-output dataset (DS). These limitations are here addressed by introducing a different approach: we use a power series-based model for system modeling using two hyperparameters $\hat{A}_0$ and $\hat{A}_1$ optimally defined depending on the DS. Overall, this work expands the applicability of the SORPS formalism to arbitrary DSs and represents a groundbreaking contribution for the concept of CCs. The method of CCs is complementary to the commonly used approaches of NARMAX-models and sparse regression techniques, which emphasize the estimation of the individual parameter values of the model. However, the CCs-based methods emphasize the computation of the CCs as a whole, thus presenting the advantages that the system identification is uniquely defined, and that it can be applied for any system without additional algebraic operations. Thus, the parsimonious principle defined by the NARMAX-philosophy is extended from the concept of a model with as few parameters as possible to the concept of finding the lowest model order that correctly describe the input-output DS. This opens up a wide variety of potential applications in vibration analysis, structural dynamics, viscoelastic materials, nonlinear electric circuits, voltammetry techniques, structural health monitoring, and fault diagnosis.</description>
