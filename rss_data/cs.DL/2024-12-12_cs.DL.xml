      <title>Time, bits, and nickel: Managing digital and analog continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1998, the Getty Center hosted the ''Time and Bits: Managing Digital Continuity'' conference, gathering the founders and thinkers of two San Francisco non-profit organizations interested in long-term thinking and archiving: the Internet Archive and the Long Now Foundation. This chapter proposes to discuss two different ways of archiving through time, in digital and analog formats, for virtual web contents and physical paper-based ones. It explores various types of archiving methods and tools and the management challenges they raise, in terms of time and space, but also innovation, maintenance, and ''continuity''. It depicts two distinct visions of the future of archiving which nonetheless converge in their mission of safeguarding, sharing, and giving access to information and knowledge for the decades and centuries to come.</description>

      <title>Publication Trends in Artificial Intelligence Conferences: The Rise of Super Prolific Authors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Papers published in top conferences contribute influential discoveries that are reshaping the landscape of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI). We analyzed 87,137 papers from 11 AI conferences to examine publication trends over the past decade. Our findings reveal a consistent increase in both the number of papers and authors, reflecting the growing interest in AI research. We also observed a rise in prolific researchers who publish dozens of papers at the same conference each year. In light of this analysis, the AI research community should consider revisiting authorship policies, addressing equity concerns, and evaluating the workload of junior researchers to foster a more sustainable and inclusive research environment.</description>

      <title>Automatic answering of scientific questions using the FACTS-V1 framework: New methods in research to increase efficiency through the use of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) offers various possibilities to expand and support educational research. Specifically, the implementation of AI can be used to develop new frameworks to establish new research tools that accelerate and meaningfully expand the efficiency of data evaluation and interpretation (Buckingham Shum et al., 2023). This article presents the prototype of the FACTS-V1 (Filtering and Analysis of Content in Textual Sources) framework. With the help of the application, numerous scientific papers can be automatically extracted, analyzed and interpreted from open access document servers without having to rely on proprietary applications and their limitations. The FACTS-V1 prototype consists of three building blocks. The first part deals with the extraction of texts, the second with filtering and interpretation, and the last with the actual statistical evaluation (topic modeling) using an interactive overview. The aim of the framework is to provide recommendations for future scientific questions based on existing data. The functionality is illustrated by asking how the use of AI will change the education sector. The data used to answer the question comes from 82 scientific papers on the topic of AI from 2024. The papers are publicly available on the peDOCS document server of the Leibniz Institute for Educational Research and Educational Information.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Scholarly Ontology Generation: An Extensive Analysis in the Engineering Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ontologies of research topics are crucial for structuring scientific knowledge, enabling scientists to navigate vast amounts of research, and forming the backbone of intelligent systems such as search engines and recommendation systems. However, manual creation of these ontologies is expensive, slow, and often results in outdated and overly general representations. As a solution, researchers have been investigating ways to automate or semi-automate the process of generating these ontologies. This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the ability of large language models (LLMs) to identify semantic relationships between different research topics, which is a critical step in the development of such ontologies. To this end, we developed a gold standard based on the IEEE Thesaurus to evaluate the task of identifying four types of relationships between pairs of topics: broader, narrower, same-as, and other. Our study evaluates the performance of seventeen LLMs, which differ in scale, accessibility (open vs. proprietary), and model type (full vs. quantised), while also assessing four zero-shot reasoning strategies. Several models have achieved outstanding results, including Mixtral-8x7B, Dolphin-Mistral-7B, and Claude 3 Sonnet, with F1-scores of 0.847, 0.920, and 0.967, respectively. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that smaller, quantised models, when optimised through prompt engineering, can deliver performance comparable to much larger proprietary models, while requiring significantly fewer computational resources.</description>

      <title>From Division to Unity: A Large-Scale Study on the Emergence of Computational Social Science, 1990-2021</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on the emergence of Computational Social Science (CSS) - an interdisciplinary field leveraging computational methods to address social science questions - and its impact on adjacent social sciences. We trained a robust CSS classifier using papers from CSS-focused venues and applied it to 11 million papers spanning 1990 to 2021. Our analysis yielded three key findings. First, there were two critical inflections in the rise of CSS. The first occurred around 2005 when psychology, politics, and sociology began engaging with CSS. The second emerged in approximately 2014 when economics finally joined the trend. Sociology is currently the most engaged with CSS. Second, using the density of yearly knowledge embeddings constructed by advanced transformer models, we observed that CSS initially lacked a cohesive identity. Between 2005 and 2014, however, it began to form a distinct cluster, creating boundaries between CSS and other social sciences, particularly in politics and sociology. After 2014, these boundaries faded, and CSS increasingly blended with the social sciences. Third, shared data-driven methods homogenized CSS papers across disciplines, with politics and economics showing the most alignment, likely due to the combined influence of CSS and causal identification. Nevertheless, non-CSS papers in sociology, psychology, and politics became more divergent. Taken together, these findings highlight the dynamics of division and unity as new disciplines emerge within existing knowledge landscapes.

      <title>RatanSunPy: A robust preprocessing pipeline for RATAN-600 solar radio observations data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of observational technologies and software for processing and visualizing spectro-polarimetric microwave data obtained with the RATAN-600 radio telescope opens new opportunities for studying the physical characteristics of solar plasma at the levels of the chromosphere and corona. These levels remain some difficult to detect in the ultraviolet and X-ray ranges. The development of such methods allows for more precise investigation of the fine structure and dynamics of the solar atmosphere, thereby deepening our understanding of the processes occurring in these layers. The obtained data also can be utilized for diagnosing solar plasma and forecasting solar activity. However, using RATAN-600 data requires extensive data processing and familiarity with the RATAN-600. This paper introduces RatanSunPy, an open-source Python package developed for accessing, visualizing, and analyzing multi-band radio observations of the Sun from the RATAN-600 solar complex. The package offers comprehensive data processing functionalities, including direct access to raw data, essential processing steps such as calibration and quiet Sun normalization, and tools for analyzing solar activity. This includes automatic detection of local sources, identifying them with NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) active regions, and further determining parameters for local sources and active regions. By streamlining data processing workflows, RatanSunPy enables researchers to investigate the fine structure and dynamics of the solar atmosphere more efficiently, contributing to advancements in solar physics and space weather forecasting.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Information Retrieval and Summarisation to Support Systematic Review on Outcomes Based Contracting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As academic literature proliferates, traditional review methods are increasingly challenged by the sheer volume and diversity of available research. This article presents a study that aims to address these challenges by enhancing the efficiency and scope of systematic reviews in the social sciences through advanced machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) tools. In particular, we focus on automating stages within the systematic reviewing process that are time-intensive and repetitive for human annotators and which lend themselves to immediate scalability through tools such as information retrieval and summarisation guided by expert advice. The article concludes with a summary of lessons learnt regarding the integrated approach towards systematic reviews and future directions for improvement, including explainability.</description>

      <title>Decoding University Hierarchy and Prestige in China through Domestic Ph.D. Hiring Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The academic job market for fresh Ph.D. students to pursue postdoctoral and junior faculty positions plays a crucial role in shaping the future orientations, developments, and status of the global academic system. In this work, we focus on the domestic Ph.D. hiring network among universities in China by exploring the doctoral education and academic employment of nearly 28,000 scientists across all Ph.D.-granting Chinese universities over three decades. We employ the minimum violation rankings algorithm to decode the rankings for universities based on the Ph.D. hiring network, which offers a deep understanding of the structure and dynamics within the network. Our results uncover a consistent, highly structured hierarchy within this hiring network, indicating the imbalances wherein a limited number of universities serve as the main sources of fresh Ph.D. across diverse disciplines. Furthermore, over time, it has become increasingly challenging for Chinese Ph.D. graduates to secure positions at institutions more prestigious than their alma maters. This study quantitatively captures the evolving structure of talent circulation in the domestic environment, providing valuable insights to enhance the organization, diversity, and talent distribution in China's academic enterprise.</description>
