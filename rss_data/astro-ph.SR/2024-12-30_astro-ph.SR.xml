      <title>Proton Flux Measurement from Neutron Monitor Data Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate measurements of cosmic ray proton flux are crucial for studying the modulation processes of cosmic rays during the solar activity cycle. We present a proton flux measurement method based on ground-based neutron monitor (NM) data and machine learning techniques. After preprocessing the NM data, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to simulate the relationship between the NM observations and proton flux measured by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02). We obtain daily proton flux data ranging from 1GV to 100GV for the period from 2011 to 2024, showing that the measured values are in good agreement with the observed ones. In particular, we provide daily proton flux measurements for periods when AMS-02 data are unavailable due to operational reasons. We also perform wavelet analyses on the continuous proton flux data to investigate the relationship between proton flux and solar activity variations, particularly during late 2014 when AMS-02 measurements were missing.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Core-Envelope Rotational Misalignment in the Mixed-Mode Asteroseismology of Kepler-56</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing asteroseismic rotational measurements assume that stars rotate around a single axis. However, tidal torques from misaligned companions, or their possible engulfment, may bring the rotational axis of a star's envelope out of alignment with its core, breaking azimuthal symmetry. I derive perturbative expressions for asteroseismic signatures of such hitherto unexamined rotational configurations, under the ``shellular approximation'' of constant rotation rates on radially stratified mass shells. In the aligned case, the distribution of power between multiplet components is determined by the inclination of the rotational axis; radial differential misalignment causes this to vary from multiplet to multiplet. I examine in particular detail the phenomenology of gravitoacoustic mixed modes as seen in evolved sub- and red giants, where near-resonance avoided crossings may break geometrical degeneracies. Upon applying the revised asteroseismic observational methodology that results from this theoretical discussion to revisit Kepler-56 -- a red giant with a misaligned planetary system -- I find that its core and envelope rotate around different rotational axes. While the rotational axis of its core is indeed misaligned from the orbit normal of its transiting planets (consistently with earlier studies), its envelope's rotational axis is close to lying in the sky plane, and may well be aligned with them. More detailed asteroseismic modelling, and spectroscopic follow-up, will be required to fully elucidate the full spin-orbit geometry of the Kepler-56 system, and potentially discriminate between hypotheses for how it formed.</description>

      <title>Solar Gamma-Ray Evidence for a Distinct Population of $&gt;$ 1 MeV Flare-Accelerated Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant improvements in our understanding of nuclear $\gamma$-ray line production and instrument performance allow us to better characterize the continuum emission from electrons at energies $\gtrsim$ 300 keV during solar flares. We represent this emission by the sum of a power-law extension of hard X-rays (PL) and a power law times an exponential function (PLexp). We fit the $\gamma$-ray spectra in 25 large flares observed by SMM, RHESSI, and Fermi with this summed continuum along with calculated spectra of all known nuclear components. The PL, PLexp, and nuclear components are separated spectroscopically. A distinct origin of the PLexp is suggested by significant differences between its time histories and those of the PL and nuclear components. RHESSI imaging/spectroscopy of the 2005 January 20 flare, reveals that the PL and nuclear components come from the footpoints while the PLexp component comes from the corona. While the index and flux of the anisotropic PL component are strongly dependent on the flares' heliocentric angle, the PLexp parameters show no such dependency and are consistent with a component that is isotropic. The PLexp spectrum is flat at low energies and rolls over at a few MeV. Such a shape can be produced by inverse Compton scattering of soft X-rays by 10--20 MeV electrons and by thin-target bremsstrahlung from electrons with a spectrum that peaks between 3 -- 5 MeV, or by a combination of the two processes. These electrons can produce radiation detectable at other wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Impacts of dineutrons on nuclear compositions and neutrino reactions of the core-collapse supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nuclear compositions and neutrino reaction rates in the central region of the core-collapse supernova, assuming the existence of dineutrons ($^2n$) and tetraneutrons ($^4n$). At 100 ms after core bounce, $^2n$ and $^4n$ are more abundant than deuterons within radii of approximately 100 km and 50 km, respectively. Compared to the model ignoring the existence of $^2n$ and $^4n$, the mass fraction of neutrons up to a radius of 100 km reduces. Hence, the neutrino absorption and antineutrino emission rates decrease by approximately 40%-50%. Conversely, those of protons, deuterons, and $^4He$ increase, leading to the increase in the neutrino emission and antineutrino absorption rates by approximately eight times within a radius of 100 km.</description>

      <title>Magnetic fields on different spatial scales of the L328 cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: L328 core has three sub-cores S1, S2, and S3, among which the sub-core S2 contains L328-IRS, a Very Low Luminosity Object (VeLLO), which shows a CO bipolar outflow. Earlier investigations of L328 mapped cloud/envelope (parsec-scale) magnetic fields (B-fields). In this work, we used JCMT/POL-2 submillimeter (sub-mm) polarisation measurements at 850 $\mu$m to map core-scale B-fields in L328. The B-fields were found to be ordered and well-connected from cloud to core-scales, i.e., from parsec- to sub-parsec-scale. The connection in B-field geometry is shown using $Planck$ dust polarisation maps to trace large-scale B-fields, optical and near-infrared (NIR) polarisation observations to trace B-fields in the cloud and envelope, and 850 $\mu$m polarisation mapping core-scale field geometry. The core-scale B-field strength, estimated using the modified Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi relation, was found to be 50.5 $\pm$ 9.8 $\mu$G, which is $\sim$2.5 times higher than the envelope B-field strength found in previous studies. This indicates that B-fields are getting stronger on smaller (sub-parsec) scales. The mass-to-flux ratio of 1.1 $\pm$ 0.2 suggests that the core is magnetically transcritical. The energy budget in the L328 core was also estimated, revealing that the gravitational, magnetic, and non-thermal kinetic energies were comparable with each other, while thermal energy was significantly lower.</description>

      <title>Stellar evolution along the AGB as revealed by the shape of Miras' visual light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18044v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new analysis of a sample of visual light curves of Mira variables is presented. The curves cover the past four decades and are selected from the AAVSO database as including a very large number of high-density and high-quality observations. The aim of the analysis is to offer a more precise, more quantitative and more systematic picture than available from earlier studies. The results corroborate earlier descriptions and reveal new correlations between the shapes of the light curves and the evolution of the star along the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB). A family of nearly sinusoidal curves associated with M spectral types and displaying no sign of having experienced third-dredge-up events, is identified with good confidence. A detailed study of its properties is presented and used to suggest possible interpretations. All other curves are clearly distinct from this family and usually start departing from it by displaying a broader luminosity minimum, progressively taking the form of a hump climbing the ascending branch as the star evolves along the AGB. The properties displayed by this hump are studied in some detail and possible interpretations are considered. New correlations between parameters defining the shape of the light curve and the state of the star are revealed; while the average trend is established with good confidence, deviations from it cause a significant scatter of the parameters defining the shapes of the curves. Comments aimed at shedding light on the underlying physics are presented together with speculative interpretations, in the hope that they could encourage and inspire new studies, in particular based on simulations using state-of-the-art models of the inner star dynamics.</description>

      <title>Photometric Stellar Parameters for 195,478 Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16930v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stellar atmospheric parameters and physical properties of stars in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) are of great significance for the study of exoplanets, stellar activity, and asteroseismology. However, despite extensive effort over the past decades, accurate spectroscopic estimates of these parameters are available for only about half of the stars in the full KIC catalog. In our work, by training relationships between photometric colors and spectroscopic stellar parameters from Gaia DR3, the Kepler Issac-Newton Survey, LAMOST DR10, and APOGEE DR17, we have obtained atmospheric-parameter estimates for over 195,000 stars, accounting for 97$\%$ of the total sample of KIC stars. We obtain 1$\sigma$ uncertainties of 0.1 dex on metallicity [Fe/H], 100 K on effective temperature $T_{\rm eff}$, and 0.2 dex on surface gravity log $g$. In addition, based on these atmospheric parameters, we estimated the ages, masses, radii, and surface gravities of these stars using the commonly adopted isochrone-fitting approach. External comparisons indicate that the resulting precision for turn-off stars is 20$\%$ in age; for dwarf stars, it is 0.07 $M_{\odot}$ in mass, 0.05 $R_{\odot}$ in radius, and 0.12 dex in surface gravity; and for giant stars, it is 0.14 $M_{\odot}$ in mass, 0.73 $R_{\odot}$ in radius, and 0.11 dex in surface gravity.</description>

      <title>Remnant masses from 1D+ core-collapse supernovae simulations: bimodal neutron star mass distribution and black holes in the low-mass gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05927v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The explosion of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is an extremely challenging problem, and there are still large uncertainties regarding which stars lead to successful explosions that leave behind a neutron star, and which ones will form a black hole instead. In this paper, we simulate 341 progenitors at three different metallicities using spherically symmetric simulations that include neutrino-driven convection via a mixing-length theory. We use these simulations to improve previously derived explosion criteria based on the density and entropy profiles of the pre-supernova progenitor. We also provide numerical fits to calculate the final mass of neutron stars based on either compactness, the location of the Si/Si-O interface, or the Chandrasekhar mass. The neutron star birth mass distribution derived from our 1D+ simulations is bimodal, contrary to what the most popular 1D CCSN simulations have shown so far. We compare the theoretically derived neutron star mass distributions with the observed ones and discuss potential implications for population synthesis studies. We also analyze the black hole mass distribution predicted by our simulations. To be consistent with current models of matter ejection in failed SNe, a large fraction of the envelope must be expelled, leading to small black holes in the low-mass gap. One black hole in this mass region has recently been observed in the GW230529 event by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. Our results naturally agree with this detection, which the most popular prescriptions for explodability and remnant masses are not able to reproduce. In general, we find that the explosion outcome and mass of the remnant strongly depend on the pre-collapse structure of the progenitor. However, their dependence on the initial mass of the star and the mass of the CO core is highly uncertain and non-linear.</description>
