      <title>H-PRM: A Pluggable Hotword Pre-Retrieval Module for Various Speech Recognition Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hotword customization is crucial in ASR to enhance the accuracy of domain-specific terms. It has been primarily driven by the advancements in traditional models and Audio large language models (LLMs). However, existing models often struggle with large-scale hotwords, as the recognition rate drops dramatically with the number of hotwords increasing. In this paper, we introduce a novel hotword customization system that utilizes a hotword pre-retrieval module (H-PRM) to identify the most relevant hotword candidate by measuring the acoustic similarity between the hotwords and the speech segment. This plug-and-play solution can be easily integrated into traditional models such as SeACo-Paraformer, significantly enhancing hotwords post-recall rate (PRR). Additionally, we incorporate H-PRM into Audio LLMs through a prompt-based approach, enabling seamless customization of hotwords. Extensive testing validates that H-PRM can outperform existing methods, showing a new direction for hotword customization in ASR.</description>

      <title>SwiftF0: Fast and Accurate Monophonic Pitch Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and real-time monophonic pitch estimation in noisy conditions, particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains an open challenge in audio processing. We present \emph{SwiftF0}, a novel, lightweight neural model that sets a new state-of-the-art for monophonic pitch estimation. Through training on diverse speech, music, and synthetic datasets with extensive data augmentation, SwiftF0 achieves robust generalization across acoustic domains while maintaining computational efficiency. SwiftF0 achieves a 91.80\% harmonic mean (HM) at 10 dB SNR, outperforming baselines like CREPE by over 12 percentage points and degrading by only 2.3 points from clean audio. SwiftF0 requires only 95,842 parameters and runs approximately 42x faster than CREPE on CPU, making it ideal for efficient, real-time deployment. To address the critical lack of perfectly accurate ground truth pitch in speech corpora (which typically rely on algorithmic estimators or laryngograph signals), we introduce \emph{SpeechSynth}. This synthetic speech dataset, generated by a phoneme-level TTS model, provides exact, on-demand ground-truth pitch curves, enabling more robust model training and evaluation. Furthermore, we propose a unified metric, combining six complementary performance measures for comprehensive and reliable pitch evaluation, and release an open-source pitch benchmark suite. A live demo of SwiftF0 is available at https://swift-f0.github.io/, the source code at https://github.com/lars76/swift-f0, and the benchmark framework at https://github.com/lars76/pitch-benchmark.</description>

      <title>Cross-Learning Fine-Tuning Strategy for Dysarthric Speech Recognition Via CDSD database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dysarthric speech recognition faces challenges from severity variations and disparities relative to normal speech. Conventional approaches individually fine-tune ASR models pre-trained on normal speech per patient to prevent feature conflicts. Counter-intuitively, experiments reveal that multi-speaker fine-tuning (simultaneously on multiple dysarthric speakers) improves recognition of individual speech patterns. This strategy enhances generalization via broader pathological feature learning, mitigates speaker-specific overfitting, reduces per-patient data dependence, and improves target-speaker accuracy - achieving up to 13.15% lower WER versus single-speaker fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>SegReConcat: A Data Augmentation Method for Voice Anonymization Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anonymization of voice seeks to conceal the identity of the speaker while maintaining the utility of speech data. However, residual speaker cues often persist, which pose privacy risks. We propose SegReConcat, a data augmentation method for attacker-side enhancement of automatic speaker verification systems. SegReConcat segments anonymized speech at the word level, rearranges segments using random or similarity-based strategies to disrupt long-term contextual cues, and concatenates them with the original utterance, allowing an attacker to learn source speaker traits from multiple perspectives. The proposed method has been evaluated in the VoicePrivacy Attacker Challenge 2024 framework across seven anonymization systems, SegReConcat improves de-anonymization on five out of seven systems.</description>

      <title>The Sound of Risk: A Multimodal Physics-Informed Acoustic Model for Forecasting Market Volatility and Enhancing Market Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information asymmetry in financial markets, often amplified by strategically crafted corporate narratives, undermines the effectiveness of conventional textual analysis. We propose a novel multimodal framework for financial risk assessment that integrates textual sentiment with paralinguistic cues derived from executive vocal tract dynamics in earnings calls. Central to this framework is the Physics-Informed Acoustic Model (PIAM), which applies nonlinear acoustics to robustly extract emotional signatures from raw teleconference sound subject to distortions such as signal clipping. Both acoustic and textual emotional states are projected onto an interpretable three-dimensional Affective State Label (ASL) space-Tension, Stability, and Arousal. Using a dataset of 1,795 earnings calls (approximately 1,800 hours), we construct features capturing dynamic shifts in executive affect between scripted presentation and spontaneous Q&amp;A exchanges. Our key finding reveals a pronounced divergence in predictive capacity: while multimodal features do not forecast directional stock returns, they explain up to 43.8% of the out-of-sample variance in 30-day realized volatility. Importantly, volatility predictions are strongly driven by emotional dynamics during executive transitions from scripted to spontaneous speech, particularly reduced textual stability and heightened acoustic instability from CFOs, and significant arousal variability from CEOs. An ablation study confirms that our multimodal approach substantially outperforms a financials-only baseline, underscoring the complementary contributions of acoustic and textual modalities. By decoding latent markers of uncertainty from verifiable biometric signals, our methodology provides investors and regulators a powerful tool for enhancing market interpretability and identifying hidden corporate uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Emotion Omni: Enabling Empathetic Speech Response Generation through Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the development of speech large language models (speech LLMs), users can now interact directly with assistants via speech. However, most existing models simply convert the response content into speech without fully understanding the rich emotional and paralinguistic cues embedded in the user's query. In many cases, the same sentence can have different meanings depending on the emotional expression. Furthermore, emotional understanding is essential for improving user experience in human-machine interaction. Currently, most speech LLMs with empathetic capabilities are trained on massive datasets. This approach requires vast amounts of data and significant computational resources. Therefore, a key challenge lies in how to develop a speech LLM capable of generating empathetic responses with limited data and without the need for large-scale training. To address this challenge, we propose Emotion Omni, a novel model architecture designed to understand the emotional content of user speech input and generate empathetic speech responses. Additionally, we developed a data generation pipeline based on an open-source TTS framework to construct a 200k emotional dialogue dataset, which supports the construction of an empathetic speech assistant. The demos are available at https://w311411.github.io/omni_demo/</description>

Abstract: We present DESAMO, an on-device smart home system for elder-friendly use powered by Audio LLM, that supports natural and private interactions. While conventional voice assistants rely on ASR-based pipelines or ASR-LLM cascades, often struggling with the unclear speech common among elderly users and unable to handle non-speech audio, DESAMO leverages an Audio LLM to process raw audio input directly, enabling a robust understanding of user intent and critical events, such as falls or calls for help.</description>

      <title>MDD: a Mask Diffusion Detector to Protect Speaker Verification Systems from Adversarial Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speaker verification systems are increasingly deployed in security-sensitive applications but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. In this work, we propose the Mask Diffusion Detector (MDD), a novel adversarial detection and purification framework based on a \textit{text-conditioned masked diffusion model}. During training, MDD applies partial masking to Mel-spectrograms and progressively adds noise through a forward diffusion process, simulating the degradation of clean speech features. A reverse process then reconstructs the clean representation conditioned on the input transcription. Unlike prior approaches, MDD does not require adversarial examples or large-scale pretraining. Experimental results show that MDD achieves strong adversarial detection performance and outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, including both diffusion-based and neural codec-based approaches. Furthermore, MDD effectively purifies adversarially-manipulated speech, restoring speaker verification performance to levels close to those observed under clean conditions. These findings demonstrate the potential of diffusion-based masking strategies for secure and reliable speaker verification systems.</description>

      <title>VibeVoice Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report presents VibeVoice, a novel model designed to synthesize long-form speech with multiple speakers by employing next-token diffusion, which is a unified method for modeling continuous data by autoregressively generating latent vectors via diffusion. To enable this, we introduce a novel continuous speech tokenizer that, when compared to the popular Encodec model, improves data compression by 80 times while maintaining comparable performance. The tokenizer effectively preserves audio fidelity while significantly boosting computational efficiency for processing long sequences. Thus, VibeVoice can synthesize long-form speech for up to 90 minutes (in a 64K context window length) with a maximum of 4 speakers, capturing the authentic conversational ``vibe'' and surpassing open-source and proprietary dialogue models.</description>

      <title>Revisiting SSL for sound event detection: complementary fusion and adaptive post-processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) models offer powerful representations for sound event detection (SED), yet their synergistic potential remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates state-of-the-art SSL models to guide optimal model selection and integration for SED. We propose a framework that combines heterogeneous SSL representations (e.g., BEATs, HuBERT, WavLM) through three fusion strategies: individual SSL embedding integration, dual-modal fusion, and full aggregation. Experiments on the DCASE 2023 Task 4 Challenge reveal that dual-modal fusion (e.g., CRNN+BEATs+WavLM) achieves complementary performance gains, while CRNN+BEATs alone delivers the best results among individual SSL models. We further introduce normalized sound event bounding boxes (nSEBBs), an adaptive post-processing method that dynamically adjusts event boundary predictions, improving PSDS1 by up to 4% for standalone SSL models. These findings highlight the compatibility and complementarity of SSL architectures, providing guidance for task-specific fusion and robust SED system design.</description>
