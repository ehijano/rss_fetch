      <title>The $r$-equilibrium Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the $r$-equilibrium problem and discuss connections to the map $det^{S^r}$. The case $r=2$ is an application of Newton's third law of motion, while $r=3$ deals with equilibrium of torque-like forces.</description>

      <title>Formal self-duality and numerical self-duality for symmetric association schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let ${\mathcal X} = (X, \{R_i\}_{i=0}^d)$ denote a symmetric association scheme. Fix an ordering $\{E_i\}_{i=0}^d$ of the primitive idempotents of $\mathcal{X}$, and let $P$ (resp.\ $Q$) denote the corresponding first eigenmatrix (resp.\ second eigenmatrix) of $\mathcal X$. The scheme $\mathcal X$ is said to be formally self-dual (with respect to the ordering $\{E_i\}_{i=0}^d$) whenever $P=Q$. We define $\mathcal X$ to be numerically self-dual (with respect to the ordering $\{E_i\}_{i=0}^d$) whenever the intersection numbers and Krein parameters satisfy $p^h_{i,j} =q^h_{i,j}$ for $0 \leq h,i,j \leq d$. It is known that with respect to the ordering $\{E_i\}_{i=0}^d$, formal self-duality implies numerical self-duality. This raises the following question: is it possible that with respect to the ordering $\{E_i\}_{i=0}^d$, $\mathcal X$ is numerically self-dual but not formally self-dual? This is possible as we will show. We display an example of a symmetric association scheme and an ordering the primitive idempotents with respect to which the scheme is numerically self-dual but not formally self-dual. We have the following additional results about self-duality. Assume that $\mathcal X$ is $P$-polynomial. We show that the following are equivalent: (i) $\mathcal X$ is formally self-dual with respect to the ordering $\{E_i\}_{i=0}^d$; (ii)
  $\mathcal X$ is numerically self-dual with respect to the ordering $\{E_i\}_{i=0}^d$. Assume that the ordering $\{E_i\}_{i=0}^d$ is $Q$-polynomial. We show that the following are equivalent: (i) $\mathcal X$ is formally self-dual with respect to the ordering $\{E_i\}_{i=0}^d$; (ii)
  $\mathcal X$ is numerically self-dual with respect to the ordering $\{E_i\}_{i=0}^d$.</description>

      <title>Framization and Deframization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from the geometric construction of the framed braid group, we define and study the framization of several Brauer-type monoids and also the set partition monoid, all of which appear in knot theory. We introduce the concept of deframization, which is a procedure to obtain a tied monoid from a given framed monoid. Furthermore, we show in detail how this procedure works on the monoids mentioned above. We also discuss the framization and deframization of some algebras, which are deformations, respectively, of the framized and deframized monoids discussed here.</description>

      <title>Skew derivations of quantum tori and quantum spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the $\sigma$-derivations of quantum tori and quantum affine spaces for a toric automorphism $\sigma$. By standard results, every toric automorphism $\sigma$ of a quantum affine space $\mathcal{A}$ and every $\sigma$-derivation of $\mathcal{A}$ extend uniquely to the corresponding quantum torus $\mathcal{T}$. We shall see that, for a toric automorphism $\sigma$, every $\sigma$-derivation of $\mathcal{T}$ is a unique sum of an inner $\sigma$-derivation and a $\sigma$-derivation that is conjugate to a derivation and that the latter is non-zero only if $\sigma$ is an inner automorphism of $\mathcal{T}$. This is applied to determine the $\sigma$-derivations of $\mathcal{A}$ for a toric automorphism $\sigma$, generalizing results of Alev and Chamarie for the derivations of quantum affine spaces and of Almulhem and Brzezi\'{n}ski for $\sigma$-derivations of the quantum plane.
  We apply the results to iterated Ore extensions $A$ of the base field for which all the defining endomorphisms are automorphisms and each of the adjoined indeterminates is an eigenvector for all the subsequent defining automorphisms. We present an algorithm which, in characteristic zero, will, for such an algebra $A$, either construct a quantum torus between $A$ and its quotient division algebra or show that no such quantum torus exists.
  Also included is a general section on skew derivations which become inner on localization at the powers of a normal element which is an eigenvector for the relevant automorphism. This section explores a connection between such skew derivations and normalizing sequences of length two. This connection is illustrated by known examples of skew derivations and by the construction of a family of skew derivations for the parametric family of subalgebras of the Weyl algebra that has been studied in three papers by Benkart, Lopes and Ondrus.</description>

      <title>Tropical friezes and cluster-additive functions via Fock-Goncharov duality and a conjecture of Ringel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study tropical friezes and cluster-additive functions associated to symmetrizable generalized Cartan matrices in the framework of Fock-Goncharov duality in cluster algebras. In particular, we generalize and prove a conjecture of C. M. Ringel on cluster-additive functions associated to arbitrary Cartan matrices of finite type. For a Fock-Goncharov dual pair of positive spaces of finite type, we use tropical friezes and cluster-additive functions to explicitly express the Fock-Goncharov pairing between their tropical points and the bijections between global monomials on one and tropical points of the other.</description>

      <title>$\tau$-Tilting finiteness of group algebras over generalized symmetric groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that weakly symmetric $\tau$-tilting finite algebras have positive definite Cartan matrices, which implies that we can prove $\tau$-tilting infiniteness of weakly symmetric algebras by calculating their Cartan matrices. Similarly, we obtain the condition on Cartan matrices that selfinjective algebras are $\tau$-tilting infinite. By applying this result, we show that a group algebra of $(\mathbb{Z}/p^l\mathbb{Z})^n\rtimes H$ is $\tau$-tilting infinite when $p^l\geq n$ and $\#\mathrm{IBr}\,H\geq\min\{p,3\}$, where $p&gt;0$ is the characteristic of the ground field, $H$ is a subgroup of the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ of degree $n$, the action of $H$ permutes the entries of $(\mathbb{Z}/p^l\mathbb{Z})^n$, and $\mathrm{IBr}\,H$ denotes the set of irreducible $p$-Brauer characters of $H$. Moreover, we show that under the assumption that $p^l\geq n$ and $H$ is a $p'$-subgroup of $\mathfrak{S}_n$, $\tau$-tilting finiteness of a group algebra of a group $(\mathbb{Z}/p^l\mathbb{Z})^n\rtimes H$ is determined by its $p$-hyperfocal subgroup.</description>

      <title>A note on generation and descent for derived categories of noncommutative schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work demonstrates classical generation is preserved by the derived pushforward along the canonical morphism of a noncommutative scheme to its underlying scheme. There are intriguing examples illustrating this phenomenon, particularly from noncommutative resolutions, categorical resolutions, and homological projective duality. Additionally, we establish that the Krull dimension of a variety over a field is a lower bound for the Rouquier dimension of the bounded derived category associated with a noncommutative scheme on it. This is an extension of a classical result of Rouquier to the noncommutative context.</description>

      <title>Indecomposable involutive set-theoretical solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation of size $p^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum Yang-Baxter equation is a braiding condition on vector spaces which is of high relevance in several fields of mathematics, such as knot theory and quantum group theory. Their combinatorial counterpart are set-theoretic solutions to the Yang--Baxter equation, whose investigation is strongly driven by the study of algebraic objects called (skew) braces. In this article, we focus on indecomposable involutive non-degenerate set-theoretic solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation. More specifically, through a thorough analysis of their associated braces, we give a full classification of those which are of size $p^2$, for $p$ a prime.</description>
