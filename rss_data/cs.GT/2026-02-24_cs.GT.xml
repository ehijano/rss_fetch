      <title>Control in Hedonic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of control in hedonic games, where an external actor influences coalition formation by adding or deleting agents. We consider three basic control goals (1) enforcing that an agent is not alone (NA); (2) enforcing that a pair of agents is in the same coalition (PA); (3) enforcing that all agents are in the same grand coalition (GR), combined with two control actions: adding agents (AddAg) or deleting agents (DelAg). We analyze these problems for friend-oriented and additive preferences under individual rationality, individual stability, Nash stability, and core stability. We provide a complete computational complexity classification for control in hedonic games.</description>

      <title>LMFPPO-UBP: Local Mean Field Proximal Policy Optimization with Unbalanced Punishment for Spatial Public Goods Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial public goods games are characterized by high-dimensional state spaces and localized externalities, which pose significant challenges for achieving stable and widespread cooperation. Traditional approaches often struggle to effectively capture neighborhood-level strategic interactions and dynamically align individual incentives with collective welfare. To resolve this issue, this paper introduces a novel intelligent decision-making framework called Local Mean-Field Proximal Policy Optimization with Unbalanced Punishment (LMFPPO-UBP). The conventional mean field concept is reformulated as a socio-statistical sensor embedded directly into the policy gradient space of deep reinforcement learning, allowing agents to adapt their strategies based on mesoscale neighborhood dynamics. Additionally, an unbalanced punishment mechanism is integrated to penalize defectors proportionally to the local density of cooperators, thereby reshaping the payoff structures without imposing direct costs on cooperative agents. Experimental results demonstrate that the LMFPPO-UBP promotes rapid and stable global cooperation even under low enhancement factors, consistently outperforming baseline methods such as Q-learning and Fermi update rules. Statistical analyses further validate the framework's effectiveness in lowering the cooperation threshold and achieving better coordinated outcomes.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Weighted Hypergraphic Networks and Fractional Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network formation theory studies how agents create and maintain relationships, and the stability of those relationships with respect to individual incentives. A central stability concept in this literature is pairwise stability, introduced by Jackson and Wolinsky (1996) for unweighted networks (agents are either connected or not) and later extended by Bich and Morhaim (2020) to weighted networks (connections can have different intensities). In this paper, we pursue two main objectives. First, we extend the notion of stability to networks defined on hypergraphs, where relationships may involve more than two agents simultaneously and where agents face budget constraints on the sum of the intensity of all their connections. We introduce a stability concept that preserves the core intuition of pairwise stability while generalizing it to relationships involving more than two agents, and that accounts for budget constraints. Second, we propose a stronger notion that we call full stability, inspired by stability concepts from matching theory, in which agents are allowed to adjust multiple connections simultaneously rather than through single-link deviations. We give existence results for both stability notions under various assumptions, as well as explicit solutions or algorithms, and provide counter-examples for most cases that do not satisfy those assumptions, establishing an almost complete theory. Our framework provides a unified approach to constrained network formation in hypergraphic settings and builds a conceptual bridge between the theories of weighted network formation and fractional matching.</description>

      <title>Matching with Committee Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a many-to-one matching model inspired by school choice, where schools evaluate applicants using multiple rankings rather than a single priority order. We model each school's evaluation with social choice criteria to reflect the school's internal ranking process. In particular, we define acceptable choices as candidates ranked above a top percentile of the accepted cohort by a sufficient number of evaluators. Stability is then defined in terms of acceptability: accepted candidates must receive strong support, while rejected candidates receive at most weak support. Since exact acceptability and stability may not exist, we construct approximately stable outcomes using a new equilibrium concept that combines matching with a Lindahl equilibrium over ordinal preferences, providing a flexible, equilibrium-based framework for committee-based matching markets.</description>

      <title>Mechanism Design via Market Clearing-Prices for Value Maximizers under Budget and RoS Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to auto-bidding in online advertising has shifted the focus of auction theory from quasi-linear utility maximization to value maximization subject to financial constraints. We study mechanism design for buyers with private budgets and private Return-on-Spend (RoS) constraints, but public valuations, a setting motivated by modern advertising platforms where valuations are predicted via machine learning models. We introduce the extended Eisenberg-Gale program, a convex optimization framework generalized to incorporate RoS constraints. We demonstrate that the solution to this program is unique and characterizes the market's competitive equilibrium. Based on this theoretical analysis, we design a market-clearing mechanism and prove two key properties: (1) it is incentive-compatible with respect to financial constraints, making truthful reporting the optimal strategy; and (2) it achieves a tight 1/2-approximation of the first-best revenue benchmark, the maximum revenue of any feasible mechanism, regardless of IC. Finally, to enable practical implementation, we present a decentralized online algorithm. Ignoring logarithmic factors, we prove that under this algorithm, both the seller's revenue and each buyer's utility converge to the equilibrium benchmarks with a sublinear regret of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{m})$ over $m$ auctions.</description>

      <title>Strategic Gaussian Signaling under Linear Sensitivity Mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes Stackelberg Gaussian signaling games under linear sensitivity mismatch, generalizing standard additive and constant-bias models. We characterize the Stackelberg equilibrium structure for both noiseless and noisy signaling regimes. In the noiseless case, we show that the encoder selectively reveals information along specific eigenspaces of a cost-mismatch matrix. We then extend the analysis to the noisy regime and derive analytical thresholds for the existence of informative equilibria, demonstrating a sharp phase transition where communication collapses into silence if the sensitivity mismatch is sufficiently high, in contrast with the fully revealing equilibria often found in constant-bias models.</description>

      <title>The Welfare Gap of Strategic Storage: Universal Bounds and Price Non-Linearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the efficiency of battery storage operations in electricity markets by comparing the social welfare gain achieved by a central planner to that of a decentralized profit-maximizing operator. The problem is formulated in a generalized continuous-time stochastic setting, where the battery follows an adaptive, non-anticipating policy subject to periodicity and other constraints. We quantify the efficiency loss by bounding the ratio of the optimal welfare gain to the gain under profit maximization. First, for linear price functions, we prove that this ratio is tightly bounded by $4/3$. We show that this bound is a structural invariant: it is robust to arbitrary stochastic demand processes and accommodates general convex operational constraints. Second, we demonstrate that the efficiency loss can be unbounded for general convex price functions, implying that convexity alone is insufficient to guarantee market efficiency. Finally, to bridge these regimes, we analyze monomial price functions, where the degree controls the curvature. For specific discrete demand scenarios, we demonstrate that the ratio is bounded by $2$, independent of the degree.</description>

Abstract: Computational social choice (COMSOC) studies principled ways to aggregate conflicting individual preferences into collective decisions. In this paper, we call for an increased effort towards Computational Social Choice: Research &amp; Development (COMSOC-R&amp;D), a problem-driven research agenda that explicitly aims to design, implement, and test collective decision-making systems in the real world. We articulate the defining features of COMSOC-R&amp;D, argue for its value, and discuss various roadblocks and possible solutions.</description>

      <title>Modeling Epidemiological Dynamics Under Adversarial Data and User Deception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epidemiological models increasingly rely on self-reported behavioral data such as vaccination status, mask usage, and social distancing adherence to forecast disease transmission and assess the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). While such data provide valuable real-time insights, they are often subject to strategic misreporting, driven by individual incentives to avoid penalties, access benefits, or express distrust in public health authorities. To account for such human behavior, in this paper, we introduce a game-theoretic framework that models the interaction between the population and a public health authority as a signaling game. Individuals (senders) choose how to report their behaviors, while the public health authority (receiver) updates their epidemiological model(s) based on potentially distorted signals. Focusing on deception around masking and vaccination, we characterize analytically game equilibrium outcomes and evaluate the degree to which deception can be tolerated while maintaining epidemic control through policy interventions. Our results show that separating equilibria-with minimal deception-drive infections to near zero over time. Remarkably, even under pervasive dishonesty in pooling equilibria, well-designed sender and receiver strategies can still maintain effective epidemic control. This work advances the understanding of adversarial data in epidemiology and offers tools for designing more robust public health models in the presence of strategic user behavior.</description>

      <title>Evolution of fairness in hybrid populations with specialised AI agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fairness in hybrid societies hinges on a simple choice: should AI be a generous host or a strict gatekeeper? Moving beyond symmetric models, we show that asymmetric social structures--like those in hiring, regulation, and negotiation--AI that guards fairness outperforms AI that gifts it. We bridge this gap with a bipartite hybrid population model of the Ultimatum Game, separating humans and AI into distinct proposer and receiver groups. We first introduce Samaritan AI agents, which act as either unconditional fair proposers or strict receivers. Our results reveal a striking asymmetry: Samaritan AI receivers drive population-wide fairness far more effectively than Samaritan AI proposers. To overcome the limitations of the Samaritan AI proposer, we design the Discriminatory AI proposer, which predicts co-players' expectations and only offers fair portions to those with high acceptance thresholds. Our results demonstrate that this Discriminatory AI outperforms both types of Samaritan AI, especially in strong selection scenarios. It not only sustains fairness across both populations but also significantly lowers the critical mass of agents required to reach an equitable steady state. By transitioning from unconditional modelling to strategic enforcement, our work provides a pivotal framework for deploying asymmetric AIs in the increasingly hybrid society.</description>

      <title>Orbital Escalation: Modeling Satellite Ransomware Attacks Using Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ransomware has yet to reach orbit, but the conditions for such an attack already exist. This paper presents the first game-theoretic framework for modeling ransomware against satellites: the orbital escalation game. In this model, the attacker escalates ransom demands across orbital passes, while the defender chooses their best strategy, e.g., attempt a restore procedure. Using dynamic programming, we solve the defender's optimal strategy and the attacker's expected payoff under real orbital constraints. Additionally, we provide a GPS III satellite case study that demonstrates how our orbital escalation game can be applied in the context of a fictional but feasible ransomware attack to derive the best strategies at every step. In conclusion, this foundational model offers satellite owners, policy makers and researchers, a formal framework to better prepare their responses when a spacecraft is held for ransom.</description>

Abstract: We investigate an algorithm that assigns to any game in normal form an approximating game that admits an ordinal potential function. Due to the properties of potential games, the algorithm equips every game with a surrogate reward structure that allows efficient multi-agent learning. Numerical simulations using the replicator dynamics show that 'potentialization' guarantees convergence to stable agent behavior.</description>

      <title>Arena-Independent Memory Bounds for Nash Equilibria in Reachability Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the memory requirements of Nash equilibria in turn-based multiplayer games on possibly infinite graphs with reachability, safety, shortest-path, B\"uchi and co-B\"uchi objectives.
  We present constructions for finite-memory Nash equilibria in these games that apply to arbitrary game graphs, bypassing the finite-arena requirement that is central in existing approaches. We show that, for these five types of games, from any Nash equilibrium, we can derive another Nash equilibrium where all strategies are finite-memory such that all objectives satisfied by the outcome of the original equilibrium also are by the outcome of the derived equilibrium, without increasing costs for shortest-path games.
  Furthermore, we provide memory bounds that are independent of the size of the game graph for reachability, safety and shortest-path games. These bounds depend only on the number of players.
  To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first results pertaining to finite-memory constrained Nash equilibria in infinite arenas and the first arena-independent memory bounds for Nash equilibria.</description>

      <title>The NTU Partitioned Matching Game for International Kidney Exchange Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the real-world problem of international kidney exchange (IKEP), recent literature introduced a generalized transferable utility matching game featuring a partition of the vertex set of a graph into players, and analyzed its complexity. We explore the non-transferable utility (NTU) variant of the game, where the utility of players is given by the number of their matched vertices. Our motivation for studying this problem is twofold. First, the NTU version is arguably a more natural model of the international kidney exchange program, as the utility of a participating country mostly depends on how many of its patients receive a kidney, which is non-transferable by nature. Second, the special case where each player has two vertices, which we call the NTU matching game with couples, is interesting in its own right and has intriguing structural properties.
  We study the core of the NTU game, which suitably captures the notion of stability of an IKEP, as it precludes incentives to deviate from the proposed solution for any possible coalition of the players. We prove computational complexity results about the weak and strong cores under various assumptions on the players. In particular, we show that if every player has two vertices, then the weak core is always nonempty, and the existence of a strong core solution can be decided in polynomial time. Moreover, one can efficiently optimize on the strong core. In contrast, it is NP-hard to decide whether the strong core is empty when each player has three vertices. We also show that if the number of players is constant, then the non-emptiness of the weak and strong cores is polynomial-time decidable, and we can find a minimum-cost core solution in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>On the Fairness of Additive Welfarist Rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Allocating indivisible goods is a ubiquitous task in fair division. We study additive welfarist rules, an important class of rules which choose an allocation that maximizes the sum of some function of the agents' utilities. Prior work has shown that the maximum Nash welfare (MNW) rule is the unique additive welfarist rule that guarantees envy-freeness up to one good (EF1). We strengthen this result by showing that MNW remains the only additive welfarist rule that ensures EF1 for identical-good instances, two-value instances, as well as normalized instances with three or more agents. On the other hand, if the agents' utilities are integers, we demonstrate that several other rules offer the EF1 guarantee, and provide characterizations of these rules for various classes of instances.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative AI (GenAI), mechanism design adapted to its unique characteristics poses new theoretical and practical challenges. Unlike traditional goods, content from one domain can enhance the training and performance of GenAI models in other domains. For example, OpenAI's video generation model Sora (Liu et al., 2024b) relies heavily on image data to improve video generation quality. In this work, we study nonlinear procurement mechanism design under data transferability, where online platforms employ both human creators and GenAI to satisfy cross-domain content demand. We propose optimal mechanisms that maximize either platform revenue or social welfare and identify the specific properties of GenAI that make such high-dimensional design problems tractable. Our analysis further reveals which domains face stronger competitive pressure and which tend to experience overproduction. Moreover, the growing role of data intermediaries, including labeling companies such as Scale AI and creator organizations such as The Wall Street Journal, introduces a third layer into the traditional platform-creator structure. We show that this three-layer market can result in a lose-lose outcome, reducing both platform revenue and social welfare, as large pre-signed contracts distort creators' incentives and lead to inefficiencies in the data market. These findings suggest a need for government regulation of the GenAI data ecosystem, and our theoretical insights are further supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Discovering Multiagent Learning Algorithms with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Much of the advancement of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) in imperfect-information games has historically depended on manual iterative refinement of baselines. While foundational families like Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) and Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) rest on solid theoretical ground, the design of their most effective variants often relies on human intuition to navigate a vast algorithmic design space. In this work, we propose the use of AlphaEvolve, an evolutionary coding agent powered by large language models, to automatically discover new multiagent learning algorithms. We demonstrate the generality of this framework by evolving novel variants for two distinct paradigms of game-theoretic learning. First, in the domain of iterative regret minimization, we evolve the logic governing regret accumulation and policy derivation, discovering a new algorithm, Volatility-Adaptive Discounted (VAD-)CFR. VAD-CFR employs novel, non-intuitive mechanisms-including volatility-sensitive discounting, consistency-enforced optimism, and a hard warm-start policy accumulation schedule-to outperform state-of-the-art baselines like Discounted Predictive CFR+. Second, in the regime of population based training algorithms, we evolve training-time and evaluation-time meta strategy solvers for PSRO, discovering a new variant, Smoothed Hybrid Optimistic Regret (SHOR-)PSRO. SHOR-PSRO introduces a hybrid meta-solver that linearly blends Optimistic Regret Matching with a smoothed, temperature-controlled distribution over best pure strategies. By dynamically annealing this blending factor and diversity bonuses during training, the algorithm automates the transition from population diversity to rigorous equilibrium finding, yielding superior empirical convergence compared to standard static meta-solvers.</description>

      <title>Positional $\omega$-regular languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15384v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of two-player games over graphs, a language $L$ is called positional if, in all games using $L$ as winning objective, the protagonist can play optimally using positional strategies, that is, strategies that do not depend on the history of the play. In this work, we describe the class of parity automata recognising positional languages, providing a complete characterisation of positionality for $\omega$-regular languages. As corollaries, we establish decidability of positionality in polynomial time, finite-to-infinite and 1-to-2-players lifts, and show the closure under union of prefix-independent positional objectives, answering a conjecture by Kopczy\'nski in the $\omega$-regular case.</description>

      <title>SpinGPT: A Large-Language-Model Approach to Playing Poker Correctly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithm and its variants have enabled the development of pokerbots capable of beating the best human players in heads-up (1v1) cash games and competing with them in six-player formats. However, CFR's computational complexity rises exponentially with the number of players. Furthermore, in games with three or more players, following Nash equilibrium no longer guarantees a non-losing outcome. These limitations, along with others, significantly restrict the applicability of CFR to the most popular formats: tournaments. Motivated by the recent success of Large Language Models (LLM) in chess and Diplomacy, we present SpinGPT, the first LLM tailored to Spin &amp; Go, a popular three-player online poker format. SpinGPT is trained in two stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning on 320k high-stakes expert decisions; (2) Reinforcement Learning on 270k solver-generated hands. Our results show that SpinGPT matches the solver's actions in 78% of decisions (tolerant accuracy). With a simple deep-stack heuristic, it achieves 13.4 +/- 12.9 BB/100 versus Slumbot in heads-up over 30,000 hands (95% CI). These results suggest that LLMs could be a new way to deal with multi-player imperfect-information games like poker.</description>

      <title>Blind Inverse Game Theory: Jointly Decoding Rewards and Rationality in Entropy-Regularized Competitive Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse Game Theory (IGT) methods based on the entropy-regularized Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) offer a tractable approach for competitive settings, but critically assume the agents' rationality parameter (temperature $\tau$) is known a priori. When $\tau$ is unknown, a fundamental scale ambiguity emerges that couples $\tau$ with the reward parameters ($\theta$), making them statistically unidentifiable. We introduce Blind-IGT, the first statistical framework to jointly recover both $\theta$ and $\tau$ from observed behavior. We analyze this bilinear inverse problem and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for unique identification by introducing a normalization constraint that resolves the scale ambiguity. We propose an efficient Normalized Least Squares (NLS) estimator and prove it achieves the optimal $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$ convergence rate for joint parameter recovery. When strong identifiability conditions fail, we provide partial identification guarantees through confidence set construction. We extend our framework to Markov games and demonstrate optimal convergence rates with strong empirical performance even when transition dynamics are unknown.</description>

      <title>Ev-Trust: An Evolutionary Stable Trust Mechanism for Decentralized LLM-Based Multi-Agent Service Economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous LLM-based agents are increasingly engaging in decentralized service interactions to collaboratively execute complex tasks. However, the intrinsic instability and low-cost generativity of LLMs introduce a systemic vulnerability, where self-interested agents are incentivized to pursue short-term gains through deceptive behaviors. Such strategies can rapidly proliferate within the population and precipitate a systemic trust collapse. To address this, we propose Ev-Trust, a strategy-equilibrium trust mechanism grounded in evolutionary game theory. Ev-Trust constructs a dynamic feedback loop that couples trust evaluation with evolutionary incentives, embedding interaction history and reputation directly into the agent's expected revenue function. This mechanism fundamentally reshapes the revenue structure, converting trustworthiness into a decisive survival advantage that suppresses short-sightedness. We provide a rigorous theoretical foundation based on the Replicator Dynamics, proving the asymptotic stability of Evolutionary Stable Strategies (ESS) that favor cooperation. Experimental results indicate that Ev-Trust effectively eliminates malicious strategies and enhances collective revenue, exhibiting resilience against the invasion of mutant behaviors.</description>
