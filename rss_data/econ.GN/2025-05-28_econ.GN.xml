      <title>Academic Research Output Derivatives: Structuring Futures and Options on Research Output Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores an innovative financial concept--Academic Research Output Futures (AROFs)--which aim to bring the tools of market-based finance into the realm of academic research. At the heart of this idea lies a cash-settled futures contract tethered to a composite Research Output Index (ROI), a metric designed to quantify the research productivity of universities and research institutions. By allowing investors to take positions--speculative or hedging--on the projected trajectory of academic performance, AROFs open the door to a fundamentally new funding model. For universities, this could mean access to capital markets without relying solely on grants, donations, or government subsidies. Accompanying these futures are Academic Research Output Options (AROOs), providing a layer of strategic nuance and risk control, much like options in traditional financial markets. The paper delves into the architecture of the ROI, the mechanics of the derivative instruments, regulatory and legal challenges, and the broader strategic consequences of such a framework. If realized, this model could represent a significant departure from conventional research funding approaches--one that aligns scholarly output with financial incentives in ways both promising and provocative.</description>

      <title>Financial literacy, robo-advising, and the demand for human financial advice: Evidence from Italy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of objective financial knowledge, confidence in one's financial skills, and digital financial literacy on individuals' decisions to seek financial advice from robo-advice platforms. Using microdata from the Bank of Italy's survey on adults' "Financial Literacy and Digital Financial Skills in Italy", we find that individuals with greater financial knowledge are less inclined to rely on online services for automated financial advice. On the contrary, confidence in one's financial abilities and digital financial literacy enhance the likelihood of using robo-advice services. Trust in financial innovation, the use of digital financial services, and the propensity to take risks and save also emerge as significant predictors of an individual's use of robo-advice. We also provide evidence of a significant complementary relationship between using robo-advisory services and the demand for independent professional human advice. In contrast, a substitution effect is found for non-independent human advice. These findings highlight the importance of hybrid solutions in professional financial consulting, where robo-advisory services complement human financial advice.</description>

      <title>Manufacturing Revolutions: Industrial Policy and Industrialization in South Korea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study the impact of industrial policies on industrial development by considering an important episode during the East Asian miracle: South Korea's heavy and chemical industry (HCI) drive, 1973--1979. Based on newly assembled data, I use the introduction and termination of industrial policies to study their impacts during and after the intervention period. (1) I reveal that heavy-chemical industrial policies promoted the expansion and dynamic comparative advantage of directly targeted industries. (2) Using variation in exposure to policies through the input-output network, I demonstrate that the policy indirectly benefited downstream users of targeted intermediates. (3) The benefits of HCI persisted even after the policy ended, as some results were slower to appear. The findings suggest that the temporary drive shifted Korean manufacturing into more advanced markets and supported durable change. This study helps clarify the lessons drawn from the East Asian growth miracle.

      <title>Prestige in Numbers: How Test Scores and Choices Reveal School Rankings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel revealed-preference approach to ranking colleges and professional schools based on applicants' choices and standardized test scores. Unlike traditional rankings that rely on data supplied by institutions or expert opinions, our methodology leverages the decentralized beliefs of potential students, as revealed through their application decisions. We develop a theoretical model where students with higher test scores apply to more selective institutions, allowing us to establish a clear relationship between test score distributions and school prestige. Using comprehensive data from over 490,000 GMAT test-takers applying to U.S. full-time MBA programs, we implement two ranking methods: one based on monotone functions of test scores across schools, and another using score-adjusted tournaments between school pairs. Our approach has distinct advantages over traditional rankings: it reflects the collective judgment of the entire applicant pool rather than a small group of experts, and it utilizes data from an independent testing organization, making it resistant to manipulation by institutions. The resulting rankings correlate strongly with leading published MBA rankings ($\rho = 0.72$) while offering the additional benefit of being customizable for different student subgroups. This method provides a transparent alternative to existing ranking systems that have been subject to well-documented manipulation.</description>

      <title>The Effect of the Gotthard Base Tunnel on Road Traffic: A Synthetic Control Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The opening of the Gotthard Base Tunnel in 2017, the longest railway tunnel in the world, marked a milestone in Swiss transport policy. The tunnel, a part of the New Rail Link through the Alps, serves as a key instrument of the so-called "modal shift policy," which aims to transfer transalpine freight traffic from road to rail. The reduction in travel time by train between northern and southern Switzerland raised expectations that a substantial share of tourist-oriented passenger traffic would also shift from car to rail. In this paper, we conduct a causal analysis of the impact of the Gotthard Base Tunnel's opening at the end of 2016 on the number of cars using the parallel Gotthard motorway section in the subsequent years. To this end, we apply the synthetic control and the synthetic difference-in-differences methods to construct a synthetic Gotthard motorway section based on a weighted combination of other alpine road crossings (a so-called donor pool) that did not experience the construction of a competing rail infrastructure. Our results reveal only a modest but statistically significant decline in the number of cars between the actual and the synthetic Gotthard motorway in the short run. Given the consistently strong and increasing demand for the new rail connection through the Gotthard Base Tunnel, we infer a substantial induced short-run demand effect resulting from the rail travel time savings.</description>

      <title>Do Betting Markets Sense a Goal Coming? Evidence from the German Bundesliga</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the fertile ground of betting markets to study the anticipation of major news in financial markets. While there is a considerable body of literature on the accuracy and efficiency of betting markets after important in-match events, there are no studies dealing with the anticipation of such events. This paper tracks bookmaker odds and betting stakes to provide insights into the movement of both prior to goals. Utilising high-resolution (1 Hz) data from a leading European bookmaker for a full season of the top German football league, we analyse whether market participants anticipate major news. In particular, we consider the case of the first goal scored within a match, with its strong impact on the match outcome. Using regression models and state-space models (SSMs) accounting for an underlying market activity level, we investigate whether the bookmaker adjusts odds and bettors tend to place higher stakes on the scoring team right before the first goal is scored. Our results indicate that neither side of the market anticipates goals by significantly adjusting their behaviour.</description>

      <title>The Families that Stay Together: A Network Analysis of Dynastic Power in Philippine Politics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynasties have long dominated Philippine politics. Despite the theoretical consensus that dynastic rule erodes democratic accountability, there is limited empirical evidence establishing dynasties' true impact on development. A key challenge has been developing robust metrics for characterizing dynasties that facilitate meaningful comparisons across geographies and election cycles. Using election data from 2004 to 2022, we leverage methods from graph theory to develop four indicators to investigate dynastic evolution: Political Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), measuring dynastic power concentration; Centrality Gini Coefficient (CGC), reflecting inequalities of influence between clan members; Connected Component Density (CCD), representing the degree of inter-clan connection; and Average Community Connectivity (ACC), quantifying intra-clan cohesion. Our analysis reveals three key findings. Firstly, dynasties have grown stronger and more interconnected, occupying an increasing share of elected positions. Dominant clans have also remained tightly knit, but with great power imbalances between members. Secondly, we examine variations in party-hopping between dynastic and non-dynastic candidates. Across every election cycle, party-hopping rates are significantly higher (p&lt;0.01) among dynastic candidates than non-dynasts, suggesting that the dominance of dynasties may weaken institutional trust within parties. Finally, applying a Linear Mixed Model regression, controlling for geographic random-effects and time fixed-effects, we observe that provinces with high power asymmetries within clans (high CGCs) and with deeply interconnected clans (high CCDs) record significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) Human Development Index scores. These findings suggest that clan structure, rather than power concentration alone--may be the chief determinant of a ruling dynasty's developmental impact.</description>

      <title>When Experimental Economics Meets Large Language Models: Tactics with Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have sparked a growing interest in measuring and understanding their behavior through experimental economics. However, there is still a lack of established guidelines for designing economic experiments for LLMs. By combining principles from experimental economics with insights from LLM research in artificial intelligence, we outline and discuss eight practical tactics for conducting experiments with LLMs. We further perform two sets of experiments to demonstrate the significance of these tactics. Our study enhances the design, replicability, and generalizability of LLM experiments, and broadens the scope of experimental economics in the digital age.</description>

      <title>NGO Activism: Exposure vs. Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06875v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the timing of NGO campaigns to shed light on NGOs' strategies and how they evolve over time. Data from 2,500 campaigns show that NGOs are six times more likely to launch campaigns on their target's Annual General Meeting (AGM) date. Although this strategy increases media exposure and stakeholder scrutiny, resulting in consumer backlash and related shareholder proposals at the following AGM of the targeted firm, it has no impact on current AGM votes. As NGOs build reputational capital, they adjust their timing to influence AGM votes, revealing the trade-offs they face to drive corporate change.</description>

      <title>The AI Penalization Effect: People Reduce Compensation for Workers Who Use AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether and why people might adjust compensation for workers who use AI tools. Across 11 studies (N = 3,846), participants consistently lowered compensation for AI-assisted workers compared to those who were unassisted. This "AI Penalization" effect was robust across (1) different types of work (e.g., specific tasks or general work scenarios) and worker statuses (e.g., full-time, part-time, or freelance), (2) different forms of compensation (e.g., required payments or optional bonuses) and their timing, (3) various methods of eliciting compensation (e.g., slider scale, multiple choice, and numeric entry), and (4) conditions where workers' output quality was held constant, subject to varying inferences, or statistically controlled. Moreover, the effect emerged not only in hypothetical compensation scenarios (Studies 1-9) but also with real gig workers and real monetary compensation (Studies 10 and 11). People reduced compensation for workers using AI because they believed these workers deserved less credit than those who did not use AI (Studies 7 and 8). This mediated effect attenuated when it was less permissible to reduce worker compensation, such as when employment contracts provide stricter constraints (Study 8). Our findings suggest that adoption of AI tools in the workplace may exacerbate inequality among workers, as those protected by structured contracts are less vulnerable to compensation reductions, while those without such protections are at greater risk of financial penalties for using AI.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Collusion under Observed Demand Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing reliance on AI-driven pricing algorithms has raised antitrust concerns, particularly that third-party use of nonpublic competitor data may facilitate information sharing and undermine market competition. This paper examines a setting in which firms receive demand information from a common third party and incorporate it into their pricing algorithms. Specifically, I analyze the pricing behavior of Q-learning agents when demand shocks are observable. The simulation results show that at high discount factors, agents consistently charge constant supracompetitive prices across demand states, resulting in price rigidity. This pricing pattern is sustained through collusive strategies that effectively punish deviations and feature a discontinuous switch from punishment back to cooperation. At medium discount factors, however, agents lower prices during booms to reduce incentives to deviate and raise them during downturns, resulting in countercyclical pricing consistent with Rotemberg and Saloner (1986). The findings highlight both the pricing adaptability of Q-learning to fluctuating market demand and the robustness of algorithmic collusion. Compared to settings with unobserved demand shocks, demand observability reduces firm profits and enhances consumer surplus, suggesting that access to market information under algorithmic pricing does not necessarily harm consumers.</description>

      <title>Who Bears the Cost? High-Frequency Evidence on Minimum Wage Effects and Amenity Pass-Through in Spot Labor Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides causal evidence on the short-run effects of minimum wage hikes in a spot labor market, using confidential contract-level data from Timee, a Japanese job-matching platform. Leveraging high-frequency variation and a bin-level difference-in-differences design, we find a 2 percentage point decline in employment within affected wage bins, with losses concentrated below the new threshold. Transportation reimbursement--a flexible nonwage amenity--remains largely unchanged, indicating limited pass-through. These findings suggest that spot labor markets adjust rapidly through wage compliance, with the cost burden borne by establishments rather than offset through reductions in job amenities.</description>

      <title>Why do financial prices exhibit Brownian motion despite predictable order flow?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17906v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In financial market microstructure, there are two enigmatic empirical laws: (i) the market-order flow has predictable persistence due to metaorder splitters by institutional investors, well formulated as the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model. However, this phenomenon seems paradoxical given the diffusive and unpredictable price dynamics; (ii) the price impact $I(Q)$ of a large metaorder $Q$ follows the square-root law, $I(Q)\propto \sqrt{Q}$. Here we theoretically reveal why price dynamics follows Brownian motion despite predictable order flow by unifying these enigmas. We generalize the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model to nonlinear price-impact dynamics, which is mapped to an exactly solvable L\'evy-walk model. Our exact solution shows that the price dynamics remains diffusive under the square-root law, even under persistent order flow. This work illustrates the crucial role of the square-root law in mitigating large price movements by large metaorders, thereby leading to the Brownian price dynamics, consistently with the efficient market hypothesis over long timescales.</description>
