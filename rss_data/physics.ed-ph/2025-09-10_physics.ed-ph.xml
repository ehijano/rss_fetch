      <title>Feedback That Clicks: Introductory Physics Students' Valued Features in AI Feedback Generated From Self-Crafted and Engineered Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the advent of GPT-3.5 in 2022, Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shown tremendous potential in STEM education, particularly in providing real-time, customized feedback to students in large-enrollment courses. A crucial skill that mediates effective use of AI is the systematic structuring of natural language instructions to AI models, commonly referred to as prompt engineering. This study has three objectives: (i) to investigate the sophistication of student-generated prompts when seeking feedback from AI on their arguments, (ii) to examine the features that students value in AI-generated feedback, and (iii) to analyze trends in student preferences for feedback generated from self-crafted prompts versus prompts incorporating prompt engineering techniques and principles of effective feedback. Results indicate that student-generated prompts typically reflect only a subset of foundational prompt engineering techniques. Despite this lack of sophistication, such as incomplete descriptions of task context, AI responses demonstrated contextual intuitiveness by accurately inferring context from the overall content of the prompt. We also identified 12 distinct features that students attribute the usefulness of AI-generated feedback, spanning four broader themes: Evaluation, Content, Presentation, and Depth. Finally, results show that students overwhelmingly prefer feedback generated from structured prompts, particularly those combining prompt engineering techniques with principles of effective feedback. Implications of these results such as integrating the principles of effective feedback in design and delivery of feedback through AI systems, and incorporating prompt engineering in introductory physics courses are discussed.</description>

      <title>Making the quantum world accessible to young learners through Quantum Picturalism: An experimental study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The educational value of a fully diagrammatic approach in a scientific field has never been explored. We present Quantum Picturalism (QPic), an entirely diagrammatic formalism for all of qubit quantum mechanics. This framework is particularly advantageous for young learners as a novel way to teach key concepts such as entanglement, measurement, and mixed-state quantum mechanics in a math-intensive subject. This eliminates traditional obstacles without compromising mathematical correctness - removing the need for matrices, vectors, tensors, complex numbers, and trigonometry as prerequisites to learning. Its significance lies in that a field as complex as Quantum Information Science and Technology (QIST), for which educational opportunities are typically exclusive to the university level and higher, can be introduced at high school level. In this study, we tested this hypothesis, examining whether QPic reduces cognitive load by lowering complex mathematical barriers while enhancing mental computation and conceptual understanding. The data was collected from an experiment conducted in 2023, whereby 54 high school students (aged 16-18) underwent 16 hours of training spread over eight weeks. The post-assessments illustrated promising outcomes in all three specific areas of focus: (1) whether QPic can alleviate technical barriers in learning QIST, (2) ensures that the content and teaching method are age appropriate, (3) increases confidence and motivation in science and STEM fields. There was a notable success rate in terms of teaching outcomes, with 82% of participants successfully passing an end-of-training exam and 48% achieving a distinction, indicating a high level of performance. The unique testing and training regime effectively reduced the technical barriers typically associated with traditional approaches, as hypothesized.</description>
