      <title>Evolutionary Systems Thinking -- From Equilibrium Models to Open-Ended Adaptive Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex change is often described as "evolutionary" in economics, policy, and technology, yet most system dynamics models remain constrained to fixed state spaces and equilibrium-seeking behavior. This paper argues that evolutionary dynamics should be treated as a core system-thinking problem rather than as a biological metaphor. We introduce Stability-Driven Assembly (SDA) as a minimal, non-equilibrium framework in which stochastic interactions combined with differential persistence generate endogenous selection without genes, replication, or predefined fitness functions. In SDA, longer-lived patterns accumulate in the population, biasing future interactions and creating feedback between population composition and system dynamics. This feedback yields fitness-proportional sampling as an emergent property, realizing a natural genetic algorithm driven solely by stability. Using SDA, we demonstrate why equilibrium-constrained models, even when simulated numerically, cannot exhibit open-ended evolution: evolutionary systems require population-dependent, non-stationary dynamics in which structure and dynamics co-evolve. We conclude by discussing implications for system dynamics, economics, and policy modeling, and outline how agent-based and AI-enabled approaches may support evolutionary models capable of sustained novelty and structural emergence.</description>

      <title>Properties of biodiversity indices that model future extinction risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The loss of biodiversity due to the likely widespread extinction of species in the near future is a focus of current concern in conservation biology. One approach to measure the impact of this extinction is based on the predicted loss of phylogenetic diversity. These predictions have become a focus of the Zoological Society of London's 'EDGE2' program for quantifying biodiversity loss and involves considering the HED (heightened evolutionary distinctiveness) and HEDGE (heightened evolutionary distinctiveness and globally endangered) indices. Here, we show how to generalise the HED(GE) indices by expanding their application to more general settings (to phylogenetic networks, to feature diversity on discrete traits, and to arbitrary biodiversity measures). We provide a simple and explicit description of the mean and variance of such measures, and illustrate our results by an application to the phylogeny of all 27 extant Crocodilians. We also derive various equalities for feature diversity, and an inequality if species extinction rates are correlated with feature types.</description>

      <title>Neutral species facilitate coexistence among cyclically competing species under birth and death processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural birth and death are fundamental mechanisms of population dynamics in ecosystems and have played pivotal roles in shaping population dynamics. Nevertheless, in studies of cyclic competition systems governed by the rock-paper-scissors (RPS) game, these mechanisms have often been ignored in analyses of biodiversity. On the other hand, given the prevalence and profound impact on biodiversity, understanding how higher-order interactions (HOIs) can affect biodiversity is one of the most challenging issues, and thus HOIs have been continuously studied for their effects on biodiversity in systems of cyclic competing populations, with a focus on neutral species. However, in real ecosystems, species can evolve and die naturally or be preyed upon by predators, whereas previous studies have considered only classic reaction rules among three species with a neutral, nonparticipant species. To identify how neutral species can affect the biodiversity of the RPS system when species' natural birth and death are assumed, we consider a model of neutral species in higher-order interactions within the spatial RPS system, assuming birth-and-death processes. Extensive simulations show that when neutral species interfere positively, they dominate the available space, thereby reducing the proportion of other species. Conversely, when the interference is harmful, the density of competing species increases. In addition, unlike traditional RPS dynamics, biodiversity can be effectively maintained even in high-mobility regimes. Our study reaffirms the critical role of neutral species in preserving biodiversity.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Advantage of Diversity-Generating Retroelements in Switching Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diversity-Generating Retroelements (DGRs) create rapid, targeted variation within specific genomic regions in phages and bacteria. They operate through stochastic retro-transcription of a template region (TR) into a variable region (VR), which typically encodes ligand-binding proteins. Despite their prevalence, the evolutionary conditions that maintain such hypermutating systems remain unclear. Here we introduce a two-timescale framework separating fast VR diversification from slow TR evolution, allowing the dynamics of DGR-controlled loci to be analytically understood from the TR design point of view. We quantity the fitness gain provided by the diversification mechanism of DGR in the presence of environmental switching with respect to standard mutagenesis. Our framework accounts for observed patterns of DGR activity in human-gut \textit{Bacteroides} and clarifies when constitutive DGR activation is evolutionarily favored.</description>

      <title>Behavioral change models for infectious disease transmission: a systematic review (2020-2025)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Human behavior shapes infectious disease dynamics, yet its integration into transmission models remains fragmented. Recent epidemics, particularly COVID-19, highlight the need for models capturing adaptation to perceived risk, social influence, and policy signals. This review synthesizes post-2020 models incorporating behavioral adaptation, examines their theoretical grounding, and evaluates how behavioral constructs modify transmission, vaccination, and compliance. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched Scopus and PubMed (2020-2025), screening 1,274 records with citation chaining. We extracted data on disease context, country, modeling framework, behavioral mechanisms (prevalence-dependent, policy/media, imitation/social learning), and psychosocial constructs (personal threat, coping appraisal, barriers, social norms, cues to action). A total of 216 studies met inclusion criteria. Results: COVID-19 accounted for 73% of studies. Most used compartmental ODE models (81%) and focused on theoretical or U.S. settings. Behavioral change was mainly reactive: 47% applied prevalence-dependent feedback, 25% included awareness/media dynamics, and 19% relied on exogenous policy triggers. Game-theoretic or social learning approaches were rare (less or equal than 5%). Behavioral effects primarily modified contact or transmission rates (91%). Psychosocial constructs were unevenly represented: cues to action (n=159) and personal threat (n=145) dominated, whereas coping appraisal (n=82), barriers (n=36), and social norms (n=25) were less common. Conclusions: We propose a taxonomy structured by behavioral drivers, social scale, and memory to clarify dominant paradigms and their empirical basis. Mapping models to psychosocial constructs provides guidance for more theory-informed and data grounded-integration of behavioral processes in epidemiological modeling.</description>

      <title>The lingering phenomenon and pattern formation in a nonlocal population model with cognitive map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rates at which individuals memorize and forget environmental information strongly influence their movement paths and long-term space use. To understand how these cognitive time scales shape population-level patterns, we propose and analyze a nonlocal population model with a cognitive map. The population density moves by a Fokker--Planck type diffusion driven by a cognitive map that stores a habitat quality information nonlocally. The map is updated through local presence with learning and forgetting rates, and we consider both truncated and normalized perception kernels.
  We first study the movement-only system without growth. We show that finite perceptual range generates spatial heterogeneity in the cognitive map even in nearly homogeneous habitats, and we prove a lingering phenomenon on unimodal landscapes: for the fixed high learning rate, the peak density near the best location is maximized at an intermediate forgetting rate.
  We then couple cognitive diffusion to logistic growth. We establish local well-posedness and persistence by proving instability of the extinction equilibrium and the existence of a positive steady state, with uniqueness under an explicit condition on the motility function. Numerical simulations show that lingering persists under logistic growth and reveal a trade-off between the lingering and total population size, since near the strongest-lingering regime the total mass can fall below the total resource, in contrast to classical random diffusive--logistic models.</description>

      <title>Functional bottlenecks can emerge from non-epistatic underlying traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein fitness landscapes frequently exhibit epistasis, where the effect of a mutation depends on the genetic context in which it occurs, i.e., the rest of the protein sequence. Epistasis increases landscape complexity, often resulting in multiple fitness peaks. In its simplest form, known as global epistasis, fitness is modeled as a non-linear function of an underlying additive trait. In contrast, more complex epistasis arises from a network of (pairwise or many-body) interactions between residues, which cannot be removed by a single non-linear transformation. Recent studies have explored how global and network epistasis contribute to the emergence of functional bottlenecks - fitness landscape topologies where two broad high-fitness basins, representing distinct phenotypes, are separated by a bottleneck that can only be crossed via one or a few mutational paths. Here, we introduce and analyze a stylized model of global epistasis with an additive underlying trait. We demonstrate that functional bottlenecks arise with high probability if the model is properly calibrated. Furthermore, our results underscore that a proper balance between neutral and non-neutral mutations is needed for the emergence of functional bottlenecks.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-free inference of phylogenetic tree posterior distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phylogenetic inference, the task of reconstructing how related sequences evolved from common ancestors, is a central objective in evolutionary genomics. The current state-of-the-art methods exploit probabilistic models of sequence evolution along phylogenetic trees, by searching for the tree maximizing the likelihood of observed sequences, or by estimating the posterior of the tree given the sequences in a Bayesian framework. Both approaches typically require to compute likelihoods, which is only feasible under simplifying assumptions such as independence of the evolution at the different positions of the sequence, and even then remains a costly operation. Here we present the first likelihood-free inference method for posterior distributions over phylogenies. It exploits a novel expressive encoding for pairs of sequences, and a parameterized probability distribution factorized over a succession of subtree merges. The resulting network provides well-calibrated estimates of the posterior distribution leading to more accurate tree topologies than existing methods, even under models amenable to likelihood computation. We further show that its edge against likelihood-based methods dramatically increases under models of sequence evolution with intractable likelihoods.</description>

      <title>Large-sample analysis of cost functionals for inference under the coalescent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coalescent is a foundational model of latent genealogical trees under neutral evolution, but suffers from intractable sampling probabilities. Methods for approximating these sampling probabilities either introduce bias or fail to scale to large sample sizes. We show that a class of cost functionals of the coalescent with recurrent mutation and a finite number of alleles converge to tractable processes in the infinite-sample limit. A particular choice of costs yields insight about importance sampling methods, which are a classical tool for coalescent sampling probability approximation. These insights reveal that the behaviour of coalescent importance sampling algorithms differs markedly from standard sequential importance samplers, with or without resampling. We conduct a simulation study to verify that our asymptotics are accurate for algorithms with finite (and moderate) sample sizes. Our results constitute the first theoretical description of large-sample importance sampling algorithms for the coalescent, provide heuristics for the a priori optimisation of computational effort, and identify settings where resampling is harmful for algorithm performance. We observe strikingly different behaviour for importance sampling methods under the infinite sites model of mutation, which is regarded as a good and more tractable approximation of finite alleles mutation in most respects.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Theory for Adaptive Systems in Varying Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological organisms are adaptive, able to function in unpredictably changing environments. Drawing on recent nonequilibrium physics, we show that in adaptation, fitness has two components parameterized by observable coordinates: a static Generalism component characterized by state distributions, and a dynamic Tracking component sustained by nonequilibrium fluxes. Our findings: (1) General Theory: We prove that tracking gain scales strictly with environmental variability and switching time-scales; near-static or fast-switching environments are not worth tracking. (2) Optimal Strategies: We explain optimal bet-hedging and phenotypic memory as the interplay between these components. (3) Control: We demonstrate, with an example, how to suppress pathogens by independently attacking their Generalism robustness (via environmental time fractions) and Tracking capabilities (via environmental switching speed). This work provides a physical framework for understanding and controlling adaptivity.</description>
