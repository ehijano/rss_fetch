      <title>Quantum Computing in Industrial Environments: Where Do We Stand and Where Are We Headed?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article explores the current state and future prospects of quantum computing in industrial environments. Firstly, it describes three main paradigms in this field of knowledge: gate-based quantum computers, quantum annealers, and tensor networks. The article also examines specific industrial applications, such as bin packing, job shop scheduling, and route planning for robots and vehicles. These applications demonstrate the potential of quantum computing to solve complex problems in the industry. The article concludes by presenting a vision of the directions the field will take in the coming years, also discussing the current limitations of quantum technology. Despite these limitations, quantum computing is emerging as a powerful tool to address industrial challenges in the future.</description>

      <title>SemSpaceFL: A Collaborative Hierarchical Federated Learning Framework for Semantic Communication in 6G LEO Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, enhanced by artificial intelligence, promises ubiquitous connectivity through Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. These satellites are capable of collecting vast amounts of geographically diverse and real-time data, which can be immensely valuable for training intelligent models. However, limited inter-satellite communication and data privacy constraints hinder data collection on a single server for training. Therefore, we propose SemSpaceFL, a novel hierarchical federated learning (HFL) framework for LEO satellite networks, with integrated semantic communication capabilities. Our framework introduces a two-tier aggregation architecture where satellite models are first aggregated at regional gateways before final consolidation at a cloud server, which explicitly accounts for satellite mobility patterns and energy constraints. The key innovation lies in our novel aggregation approach, which dynamically adjusts the contribution of each satellite based on its trajectory and association with different gateways, which ensures stable model convergence despite the highly dynamic nature of LEO constellations. To further enhance communication efficiency, we incorporate semantic encoding-decoding techniques trained through the proposed HFL framework, which enables intelligent data compression while maintaining signal integrity. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed aggregation strategy achieves superior performance and faster convergence compared to existing benchmarks, while effectively managing the challenges of satellite mobility and energy limitations in dynamic LEO networks.</description>

      <title>Snakes in the Plane: Controllable Gliders in a Nanomagnetic Metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic metamaterials known as Artificial Spin Ice (ASI) are promising candidates for neuromorphic computing, composed of vast numbers of interacting nanomagnets arranged in the plane. Every computing device requires the ability to transform, transmit and store information. While ASI excel at data transformation, reliable transmission and storage has proven difficult to achieve. Here, we take inspiration from the Cellular Automaton (CA), an abstract computing model reminiscent of ASI. In CAs, information transmission and storage can be realised by the ``glider'', a simple structure capable of propagating while maintaining its form. Employing an evolutionary algorithm, we search for gliders in pinwheel ASI and present the simplest glider discovered: the ``snake''. Driven by a global field protocol, the snake moves strictly in one direction, determined by its orientation. We demonstrate the snake, both in simulation and experimentally, and analyse the mechanism behind its motion. The snake provides a means of manipulating a magnetic texture in an ASI with resolution on the order of 100 nm, which could in turn be utilised to precisely control other magnetic phenomena. The integration of data transmission, storage and modification into the same magnetic substrate unlocks the potential for ultra-low power computing devices.</description>

      <title>Emerging Media Use and Acceptance of Digital Immortality: A Cluster Analysis among Chinese Young Generations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid technological advancements made the concept of digital immortality less fantastical and more plausible, sparking academic and industrial interest. Existing literature mainly discusses philosophical and societal aspects, lacking specific empirical observation. To address this gap, we conducted a study among Chinese youth to gauge their acceptance of digital immortality. Using cluster analysis, we classified participants into three groups: "geeks," "video game players," and "laggards" based on their media usage. Those most receptive to digital immortality, termed "geeks" tend to be male, with higher income levels, openness, conscientiousness, extensive engagement with emerging media technology, and surprisingly, more adhering to Buddhism and Daoism. Overall, this study examined media usage patterns and youth perspectives on digital immortality, shedding light on technology's role in shaping views on life and death. It highlights the importance of further research on the profound implications of digital immortality in the context of contemporary society.</description>
