      <title>Reinsurance with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an insurance company which faces financial risk in the form of insurance claims and market-dependent surplus fluctuations. The company aims to simultaneously control its terminal wealth (e.g. at the end of an accounting period) and the ruin probability in a finite time interval by purchasing reinsurance. The target functional is given by the expected utility of terminal wealth perturbed by a modified Gerber-Shiu penalty function. We solve the problem of finding the optimal reinsurance strategy and the corresponding maximal target functional via neural networks. The procedure is illustrated by a numerical example, where the surplus process is given by a Cram\'er-Lundberg model perturbed by a mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</description>

      <title>E-backtesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00991v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the recent Basel Accords, the Expected Shortfall (ES) replaces the Value-at-Risk (VaR) as the standard risk measure for market risk in the banking sector, making it the most important risk measure in financial regulation. One of the most challenging tasks in risk modeling practice is to backtest ES forecasts provided by financial institutions. To design a model-free backtesting procedure for ES, we make use of the recently developed techniques of e-values and e-processes. Backtest e-statistics are introduced to formulate e-processes for risk measure forecasts, and unique forms of backtest e-statistics for VaR and ES are characterized using recent results on identification functions. For a given backtest e-statistic, a few criteria for optimally constructing the e-processes are studied. The proposed method can be naturally applied to many other risk measures and statistical quantities. We conduct extensive simulation studies and data analysis to illustrate the advantages of the model-free backtesting method, and compare it with the ones in the literature.</description>

      <title>A parametric approach to the estimation of convex risk functionals based on Wasserstein distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a static setting for the assessment of risk in the context of mathematical finance and actuarial science that takes into account model uncertainty in the distribution of a possibly infinite-dimensional risk factor. We allow for perturbations around a baseline model, measured via Wasserstein distance, and we investigate to which extent this form of probabilistic imprecision can be parametrized. The aim is to come up with a convex risk functional that incorporates a sefety margin with respect to nonparametric uncertainty and still can be approximated through parametrized models. The particular form of the parametrization allows us to develop a numerical method, based on neural networks, which gives both the value of the risk functional and the optimal perturbation of the reference measure. Moreover, we study the problem under additional constraints on the perturbations, namely, a mean and a martingale constraint. We show that, in both cases, under suitable conditions on the loss function, it is still possible to estimate the risk functional by passing to a parametric family of perturbed models, which again allows for a numerical approximation via neural networks.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking M6 Competitors: An Analysis of Financial Metrics and Discussion of Incentives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The M6 Competition assessed the performance of competitors using a ranked probability score and an information ratio (IR). While these metrics do well at picking the winners in the competition, crucial questions remain for investors with longer-term incentives. To address these questions, we compare the competitors' performance to a number of conventional (long-only) and alternative indices using standard industry metrics. We apply factor models to measure the competitors' value-adds above industry-standard benchmarks and find that competitors with more extreme performance are less dependent on the benchmarks. We also uncover that most competitors could not generate significant out-performance compared to randomly selected long-only and long-short portfolios but did generate out-performance compared to short-only portfolios. We further introduce two new strategies by picking the competitors with the best (Superstars) and worst (Superlosers) recent performance and show that it is challenging to identify skill amongst investment managers. We also discuss the incentives of winning the competition compared to professional investors, where investors wish to maximize fees over an extended period of time.</description>
