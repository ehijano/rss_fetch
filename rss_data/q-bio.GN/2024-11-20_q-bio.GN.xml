      <title>Phenome-wide causal proteomics enhance systemic lupus erythematosus flare prediction: A study in Asian populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by unpredictable flares. This study aimed to develop a novel proteomics-based risk prediction model specifically for Asian SLE populations to enhance personalized disease management and early intervention. Methods: A longitudinal cohort study was conducted over 48 weeks, including 139 SLE patients monitored every 12 weeks. Patients were classified into flare (n = 53) and non-flare (n = 86) groups. Baseline plasma samples underwent data-independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics analysis, and phenome-wide Mendelian randomization (PheWAS) was performed to evaluate causal relationships between proteins and clinical predictors. Logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) models were used to integrate proteomic and clinical data for flare risk prediction. Results: Five proteins (SAA1, B4GALT5, GIT2, NAA15, and RPIA) were significantly associated with SLE Disease Activity Index-2K (SLEDAI-2K) scores and 1-year flare risk, implicating key pathways such as B-cell receptor signaling and platelet degranulation. SAA1 demonstrated causal effects on flare-related clinical markers, including hemoglobin and red blood cell counts. A combined model integrating clinical and proteomic data achieved the highest predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.769), surpassing individual models. SAA1 was highlighted as a priority biomarker for rapid flare discrimination. Conclusion: The integration of proteomic and clinical data significantly improves flare prediction in Asian SLE patients. The identification of key proteins and their causal relationships with flare-related clinical markers provides valuable insights for proactive SLE management and personalized therapeutic approaches.</description>

      <title>Active learning for efficient discovery of optimal gene combinations in the combinatorial perturbation space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of novel combinatorial CRISPR screening technologies enables the identification of synergistic gene combinations on a large scale. This is crucial for developing novel and effective combination therapies, but the combinatorial space makes exhaustive experimentation infeasible. We introduce NAIAD, an active learning framework that efficiently discovers optimal gene pairs capable of driving cells toward desired cellular phenotypes. NAIAD leverages single-gene perturbation effects and adaptive gene embeddings that scale with the training data size, mitigating overfitting in small-sample learning while capturing complex gene interactions as more data is collected. Evaluated on four CRISPR combinatorial perturbation datasets totaling over 350,000 genetic interactions, NAIAD, trained on small datasets, outperforms existing models by up to 40\% relative to the second-best. NAIAD's recommendation system prioritizes gene pairs with the maximum predicted effects, resulting in the highest marginal gain in each AI-experiment round and accelerating discovery with fewer CRISPR experimental iterations. Our NAIAD framework (https://github.com/NeptuneBio/NAIAD) improves the identification of novel, effective gene combinations, enabling more efficient CRISPR library design and offering promising applications in genomics research and therapeutic development.</description>
