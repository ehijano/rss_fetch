      <title>Traffic State Estimation and Uncertainty Quantification at Signalized Intersections with Low Penetration Rate Vehicle Trajectory Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the traffic state estimation problem at signalized intersections with low penetration rate vehicle trajectory data. While many existing studies have proposed different methods to estimate unknown traffic states and parameters (e.g., penetration rate, queue length) with this data, most of them only provide a point estimation without knowing the uncertainty of these estimated values. It is important to quantify the estimation uncertainty caused by limited available data since it can explicitly inform us whether the available data is sufficient to satisfy the desired estimation accuracy. To fill this gap, we formulate the partially observable system as a hidden Markov model (HMM) based on the recently developed probabilistic time-space (PTS) model. The PTS model is a stochastic traffic flow model that is designed for modeling traffic flow dynamics near signalized intersections. Based on the HMM formulation, a single recursive program is developed for the Bayesian estimation of both traffic states and parameters. As a Bayesian approach, the proposed method provides the distributional estimation outcomes and directly quantifies the estimation uncertainty. We validate the proposed method with simulation studies and showcase its applicability to real-world vehicle trajectory data.</description>

      <title>Benefits of V2V communication in connected and autonomous vehicles in the presence of delays in communicated signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effect of signal delay in communicated information in connected and autonomous vehicles. In particular, we relate this delay's effect on the selection of the time headway in predecessor-follower type vehicle platooning with a constant time headway policy (CTHP). We employ a CTHP control law for each vehicle in the platoon by considering two cases: cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) strategy where information from only one predecessor vehicle is employed and CACC+ where information from multiple predecessor vehicles is employed. We investigate how the lower bound on the time headway is affected by signal transmission delay due to wireless communication. We provide a systematic approach to the derivation of the lower bound of the time headway and selection of the appropriate CTHP controller gains for predecessor acceleration, velocity error and spacing error which will ensure robust string stability of the platoon under the presence of signal delay. We corroborate the main result with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Selection of Time Headway in Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Platoons under Noisy V2V Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the selection of time headway to ensure robust string stability in connected and autonomous vehicle platoons in the presence of signal noise in Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication. In particular, we consider the effect of noise in communicated vehicle acceleration from the predecessor vehicle to the follower vehicle on the selection of the time headway in predecessor-follower type vehicle platooning with a Constant Time Headway Policy (CTHP). Employing a CTHP based control law for each vehicle that utilizes on-board sensors for measurement of position and velocity of the predecessor vehicle and wireless communication network for obtaining the acceleration of the predecessor vehicle, we investigate how time headway is affected by communicated signal noise. We derive constraints on the CTHP controller gains for predecessor acceleration, velocity error and spacing error and a lower bound on the time headway which will ensure robust string stability of the platoon against signal noise. We provide comparative numerical simulations on an example to illustrate the main result.</description>

      <title>Consistency analysis of refined instrumental variable methods for continuous-time system identification in closed-loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refined instrumental variable methods have been broadly used for identification of continuous-time systems in both open and closed-loop settings. However, the theoretical properties of these methods are still yet to be fully understood when operating in closed-loop. In this paper, we address the consistency of the simplified refined instrumental variable method for continuous-time systems (SRIVC) and its closed-loop variant CLSRIVC when they are applied on data that is generated from a feedback loop. In particular, we consider feedback loops consisting of continuous-time controllers, as well as the discrete-time control case. This paper proves that the SRIVC and CLSRIVC estimators are not generically consistent when there is a continuous-time controller in the loop, and that generic consistency can be achieved when the controller is implemented in discrete-time. Numerical simulations are presented to support the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Safe Probabilistic Invariance Verification of Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring safety through set invariance has proven to be a valuable method in various robotics and control applications. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for the safe probabilistic invariance verification of both discrete- and continuous-time stochastic dynamical systems over an infinite time horizon. The objective is to ascertain the lower and upper bounds of the liveness probability for a given safe set and set of initial states. This probability signifies the likelihood of the system remaining within the safe set indefinitely, starting from the set of initial states. To address this problem, we propose optimizations for verifying safe probabilistic invariance in discrete-time and continuous-time stochastic dynamical systems. These optimizations adapt classical stochastic barrier certificates, which are based on Doob's non-negative supermartingale inequality, and the equations described in [29],[31], which can precisely define the probability of reaching a target set while avoiding unsafe states. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these optimizations through several examples using semi-definite programming tools.</description>

      <title>Active Learning for Control-Oriented Identification of Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning is an effective approach for controlling an unknown system. It is based on a longstanding pipeline familiar to the control community in which one performs experiments on the environment to collect a dataset, uses the resulting dataset to identify a model of the system, and finally performs control synthesis using the identified model. As interacting with the system may be costly and time consuming, targeted exploration is crucial for developing an effective control-oriented model with minimal experimentation. Motivated by this challenge, recent work has begun to study finite sample data requirements and sample efficient algorithms for the problem of optimal exploration in model-based reinforcement learning. However, existing theory and algorithms are limited to model classes which are linear in the parameters. Our work instead focuses on models with nonlinear parameter dependencies, and presents the first finite sample analysis of an active learning algorithm suitable for a general class of nonlinear dynamics. In certain settings, the excess control cost of our algorithm achieves the optimal rate, up to logarithmic factors. We validate our approach in simulation, showcasing the advantage of active, control-oriented exploration for controlling nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Intention-Aware Control Based on Belief-Space Specifications and Stochastic Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a correct-by-design controller for an autonomous vehicle interacting with opponent vehicles with unknown intentions. We use discrete-valued random variables to model unknown intentions. Based on this, we define an intention-aware control problem for an autonomous vehicle and a collection of opponent agents with epistemic uncertainty. To this end, we focus on a control objective specified in the belief space with temporal logic specifications. From this stochastic control problem, we derive a sound deterministic control problem using stochastic expansion and solve it using shrinking-horizon model predictive control. The solved intention-aware controller allows a vehicle to adjust its behaviors according to its opponents' intentions. It ensures provable safety by restricting the probabilistic risk under a desired level. We show with experimental studies that the proposed method ensures strict limitation of risk probabilities, validating its efficacy in autonomous driving cases. This work provides a novel solution for the risk-aware control of interactive vehicles with formal safety guarantees.</description>

      <title>Statistical Analysis of Block Coordinate Descent Algorithms for Linear Continuous-time System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Block coordinate descent is an optimization technique that is used for estimating multi-input single-output (MISO) continuous-time models, as well as single-input single output (SISO) models in additive form. Despite its widespread use in various optimization contexts, the statistical properties of block coordinate descent in continuous-time system identification have not been covered in the literature. The aim of this paper is to formally analyze the bias properties of the block coordinate descent approach for the identification of MISO and additive SISO systems. We characterize the asymptotic bias at each iteration, and provide sufficient conditions for the consistency of the estimator for each identification setting. The theoretical results are supported by simulation examples.</description>

      <title>Data-driven AC Optimal Power Flow with Physics-informed Learning and Calibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modern power grid is witnessing a shift in operations from traditional control methods to more advanced operational mechanisms. Due to the nonconvex nature of the Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) problem and the need for operations with better granularity in the modern smart grid, system operators require a more efficient and reliable ACOPF solver. While data-driven ACOPF methods excel in directly inferring the optimal solution based on power grid demand, achieving both feasibility and optimality remains a challenge due to the NP-hardness of the problem. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed machine learning model and a feasibility calibration algorithm to produce solutions for the ACOPF problem. Notably, the machine learning model produces solutions with a 0.5\% and 1.4\% optimality gap for IEEE bus 14 and 118 grids, respectively. The feasibility correction algorithm converges for all test scenarios on bus 14 and achieves a 92.2% convergence rate on bus 118.</description>

      <title>Heuristic Solution to Joint Deployment and Beamforming Design for STAR-RIS Aided Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper tackles the deployment challenges of Simultaneous Transmitting and Reflecting Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (STAR-RIS) in communication systems. Unlike existing works that use fixed deployment setups or solely optimize the location, this paper emphasizes the joint optimization of the location and orientation of STAR-RIS. This enables searching across all user grouping possibilities and fully boosting the system's performance. We consider a sum rate maximization problem with joint optimization and hybrid beamforming design. An offline heuristic solution is proposed for the problem, developed based on differential evolution and semi-definite programming methods. In particular, a point-point representation is proposed for characterizing and exploiting the user-grouping. A balanced grouping method is designed to achieve a desired user grouping with low complexity. Numerical results demonstrate the substantial performance gains achievable through optimal deployment design.</description>

      <title>On Joint Convergence of Traffic State and Weight Vector in Learning-Based Dynamic Routing with Value Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based approaches are increasingly popular for traffic control problems. However, these approaches are applied typically as black boxes with limited theoretical guarantees and interpretability. In this paper, we consider the theory of dynamic routing over parallel servers, a representative traffic control task, using semi-gradient on-policy control algorithm, a representative reinforcement learning method. We consider a linear value function approximation on an infinite state space; a Lyapunov function is also derived from the approximator. In particular, the structure of the approximator naturally makes possible idling policies, which is an interesting and useful advantage over existing dynamic routing schemes. We show that the convergence of the approximation weights is coupled with the convergence of the traffic state. We show that if the system is stabilizable, then (i) the weight vector converges to a bounded region, and (ii) the traffic state is bounded in the mean. We also empirically show that the proposed algorithm is computationally efficient with an insignificant optimality gap.</description>

      <title>A Model Predictive Control Scheme for Flight Scheduling and Energy Management of Electric Aviation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme for flight scheduling and energy management of electric aviation networks, where electric aircraft transport passengers between electrified airports equipped with sustainable energy sources and battery storage, with the goal of minimizing grid dependency. Specifically, we first model the aircraft flight and charge scheduling problem jointly with the airport energy management problem, explicitly accounting for local weather forecasts. Second, we frame the minimum-grid-energy operational problem as a mixed-integer linear program and solve it in a receding horizon fashion, where the route assignment and charging decisions of each aircraft can be dynamically reassigned to mitigate disruptions. We showcase the proposed MPC scheme on real-world data taken from conventional flights and weather conditions in the Dutch Leeward Antilles. Our results show that MPC can effectively guarantee operation of the network by efficiently re-assigning flights and rescheduling aircraft charging, whilst maximizing the efficiency of the on-site energy systems.</description>

      <title>Numerical Discretization Methods for the Extended Linear Quadratic Control Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce numerical methods for discretizing continuous-time linear-quadratic optimal control problems (LQ-OCPs). The discretization of continuous-time LQ-OCPs is formulated into differential equation systems, and we can obtain the discrete equivalent by solving these systems. We present the ordinary differential equation (ODE), matrix exponential, and a novel step-doubling method for the discretization of LQ-OCPs. Utilizing Euler-Maruyama discretization with a fine step, we reformulate the costs of continuous-time stochastic LQ-OCPs into a quadratic form, and show that the stochastic cost follows the $\chi^2$ distribution. In the numerical experiment, we test and compare the proposed numerical methods. The results ensure that the discrete-time LQ-OCP derived using the proposed numerical methods is equivalent to the original problem.</description>

      <title>MPC Based Linear Equivalence with Control Barrier Functions for VTOL-UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a cascaded scheme of linear Model prediction Control (MPC) based on Control Barrier Functions (CBF) with Dynamic Feedback Linearization (DFL) for Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). CBF is a tool that allows enforcement of forward invariance of a set using Lyapunov-like functions to ensure safety. The First control synthesis that employed CBF was based on Quadratic Program (QP) that modifies the existing controller to satisfy the safety requirements. However, the CBF-QP-based controllers leading to longer detours and undesirable transient performance. Recent contributions utilize the framework of MPC benefiting from the prediction capabilities and constraints imposed on the state and control inputs. Due to the intrinsic nonlinearities of the dynamics of robotics systems, all the existing MPC-CBF solutions rely on nonlinear MPC formulations or operate on less accurate linear models. In contrast, our novel solution unlocks the benefits of linear MPC-CBF while considering the full underactuated dynamics without any linear approximations. The cascaded scheme converts the problem of safe VTOL-UAV navigation to a Quadratic Constraint Quadratic Programming (QCQP) problem solved efficiently by off-the-shelf solvers. The closed-loop stability and recursive feasibility is proved along with numerical simulations showing the effective and robust solutions.

      <title>Moving horizon estimation for nonlinear systems with time-varying parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a moving horizon estimation scheme for estimating the states and time-varying parameters of nonlinear systems. We consider the case where observability of the parameters depends on the excitation of the system and may be absent during operation, with the parameter dynamics fulfilling a weak incremental bounded-energy bounded-state property to ensure boundedness of the estimation error (with respect to the disturbance energy). The proposed estimation scheme involves a standard quadratic cost function with an adaptive regularization term depending on the current parameter observability. We develop robustness guarantees for the overall estimation error that are valid for all times, and that improve the more often the parameters are detected to be observable during operation. The theoretical results are illustrated by a simulation example.</description>

      <title>A competitive game optimization algorithm for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle path planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To solve the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) path planning problem, a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm called competitive game optimizer (CGO) is proposed. In the CGO model, three phases of exploration and exploitation, and candidate replacement, are established, corresponding to the player's search for supplies and combat, and the movement toward a safe zone. In the algorithm exploration phase, Levy flight is introduced to improve the global convergence of the algorithm. The encounter probability which adaptively changes with the number of iterations is also introduced in the CGO. The balance between exploration and exploitation of solution space of optimization problem is realized, and each step is described and modeled mathematically. The performance of the CGO was evaluated on a set of 41 test functions taken from CEC2017 and CEC2022. It was then compared with eight widely recognized meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm successfully achieves a balanced trade-off between exploration and exploitation, showcasing remarkable advantages when compared to seven classical algorithms. In addition, in order to further verify the effectiveness of the CGO, the CGO is applied to 8 practical engineering design problems and UAV path planning, and the results show that the CGO has strong performance in dealing with these practical optimization problems, and has a good application prospect.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study advanced tele-operations in Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) through the creation of a Vehicle Digital Twin (VDT) system for eVTOL aircraft, tailored to enhance remote control safety and efficiency, especially for Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) operations. By synergizing digital twin technology with immersive Virtual Reality (VR) interfaces, we notably elevate situational awareness and control precision for remote operators. Our VDT framework integrates immersive tele-operation with a high-fidelity aerodynamic database, essential for authentically simulating flight dynamics and control tactics. At the heart of our methodology lies an eVTOL's high-fidelity digital replica, placed within a simulated reality that accurately reflects physical laws, enabling operators to manage the aircraft via a master-slave dynamic, substantially outperforming traditional 2D interfaces. The architecture of the designed system ensures seamless interaction between the operator, the digital twin, and the actual aircraft, facilitating exact, instantaneous feedback. Experimental assessments, involving propulsion data gathering, simulation database fidelity verification, and tele-operation testing, verify the system's capability in precise control command transmission and maintaining the digital-physical eVTOL synchronization. Our findings underscore the VDT system's potential in augmenting AAM efficiency and safety, paving the way for broader digital twin application in autonomous aerial vehicles.</description>

      <title>MPC using mixed-integer programming for aquifer thermal energy storages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aquifer thermal energy storages (ATES) are used to temporally store thermal energy in groundwater saturated aquifers. Typically, two storages are combined, one for heat and one for cold, to support heating and cooling of buildings. This way, the use of classical fossil fuel-based heating, ventilation, and air conditioning can be significantly reduced. Exploiting the benefits of ATES beyond ``seasonal'' heating in winter and cooling in summer as well as meeting legislative restrictions requires sophisticated control. We propose a tailored model predictive control (MPC) scheme for the sustainable operation of ATES systems, which mainly builds on a novel model and objective function. The new approach leads to a mixed-integer quadratic program. Its performance is evaluated on real data from an ATES system in Belgium.</description>

      <title>A Gray-Box Stability Analysis Mechanism for Power Electronic Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a gray-box stability analysis mechanism based on data-driven dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) for commercial grid-tied power electronics converters with limited information on its control parameters and topology. By fusing the underlying physical constraints of the state equations into data snapshots, the system dynamic state matrix and input matrix are simultaneously approximated to identify the dominant system dynamic modes and eigenvalues using the DMD with control (DMDc) algorithm. While retaining the advantages of eliminating the need for intrinsic controller information, the proposed gray-box method establishes higher accuracy and interpretable outcomes over the conventional DMD method. Finally, under experimental conditions of a low-frequency oscillation scenario in electrified railways featuring a single-phase converter, the proposed gray-box DMDc is verified to identify the dominant eigenvalues more accurately.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Fault-Tolerant Coverage Control for an Autonomous Aerial Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant coverage control involves determining a trajectory that enables an autonomous agent to cover specific points of interest, even in the presence of actuation and/or sensing faults. In this work, the agent encounters control inputs that are erroneous; specifically, its nominal controls inputs are perturbed by stochastic disturbances, potentially disrupting its intended operation. Existing techniques have focused on deterministically bounded disturbances or relied on the assumption of Gaussian disturbances, whereas non-Gaussian disturbances have been primarily been tackled via scenario-based stochastic control methods. However, the assumption of Gaussian disturbances is generally limited to linear systems, and scenario-based methods can become computationally prohibitive. To address these limitations, we propose a hierarchical coverage controller that integrates mixed-trigonometric-polynomial moment propagation to propagate non-Gaussian disturbances through the agent's nonlinear dynamics. Specifically, the first stage generates an ideal reference plan by optimising the agent's mobility and camera control inputs. The second-stage fault-tolerant controller then aims to follow this reference plan, even in the presence of erroneous control inputs caused by non-Gaussian disturbances. This is achieved by imposing a set of deterministic constraints on the moments of the system's uncertain states.</description>

      <title>Stable Inversion of Piecewise Affine Systems with Application to Feedforward and Iterative Learning Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model inversion is a fundamental technique in feedforward control. Unstable inverse models present a challenge in that useful feedforward control trajectories cannot be generated by directly propagating them. Stable inversion is a process for generating useful trajectories from unstable inverses by handling their stable and unstable modes separately. Piecewise affine (PWA) systems are a popular framework for modeling complicated dynamics. The primary contributions of this article are closed-form inverse formulas for a general class of PWA models, and stable inversion methods for these models. Both contributions leverage closed-form model representations to prove sufficient conditions for solution existence and uniqueness, and to develop solution computation methods. The result is implementable feedforward control synthesis from PWA models with either stable or unstable inverses. In practice, feedforward control alone may yield substantial tracking errors due to mismatch between the known system model and the unknowable complete system physics. Iterative learning control (ILC) is a technique for achieving robustness to model error in feedforward control. To demonstrate the primary contributions' validity and utility, this article also integrates PWA stable inversion with ILC in simulations based on a physical printhead positioning system.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Reachability on Riemannian Manifolds for Unknown Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the reachable set for a given nonlinear system is critically important for autonomous trajectory planning for reach-avoid applications and safety critical scenarios. Providing the reachable set is generally impossible when the dynamics are unknown, so we calculate underapproximations of such sets using local dynamics at a single point and bounds on the rate of change of the dynamics determined from known physical laws. Motivated by scenarios where an adverse event causes an abrupt change in the dynamics, we attempt to determine a provably reachable set of states without knowledge of the dynamics. This paper considers systems which are known to operate on a manifold. Underapproximations are calculated by utilizing the aforementioned knowledge to derive a guaranteed set of velocities on the tangent bundle of a complete Riemannian manifold that can be reached within a finite time horizon. We then interpret said set as a control system; the trajectories of this control system provide us with a guaranteed set of reachable states the unknown system can reach within a given time. The results are general enough to apply on systems that operate on any complete Riemannian manifold. To illustrate the practical implementation of our results, we apply our algorithm to a model of a pendulum operating on a sphere and a three-dimensional rotational system which lives on the abstract set of special orthogonal matrices.</description>

      <title>Sample-Based Conservative Bias Linear Power Flow Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power flow equations are central to many problems in power system planning, analysis, and control. However, their inherent non-linearity and non-convexity present substantial challenges during problem-solving processes, especially for optimization problems. Accordingly, linear approximations are commonly employed to streamline computations, although this can often entail compromises in accuracy and feasibility. This paper proposes an approach termed Conservative Bias Linear Approximations (CBLA) for addressing these limitations. By minimizing approximation errors across a specified operating range while incorporating conservativeness (over- or under-estimating quantities of interest), CBLA strikes a balance between accuracy and tractability by maintaining linear constraints. By allowing users to design loss functions tailored to the specific approximated function, the bias approximation approach significantly enhances approximation accuracy. We illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach through several test cases.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a robust MPC scheme for linear systems subject to time-varying, uncertain constraints that arise from uncertain environments. The predicted input sequence is parameterized over future environment states to guarantee constraint satisfaction despite an imprecise environment prediction and unknown evolution of the future constraints.

      <title>Priority aware grouping-based multihop routing scheme for RIS-assisted wireless networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) is a novel communication technology that has been recognized and recently presented as a candidate for beyond fifth generation wireless communication technology. In this paper, we propose a priority aware user traffic dependent grouping based multihop routing scheme for a RIS-assisted millimeter wave (mmWave) device-to-device (D2D) communication network with spatially correlated channels. Specifically, the proposed scheme exploits the priority of the users (based on their respective delay constrained applications) and the aspect of spatial correlation in the narrowly spaced reflecting elements of the RISs. In this context, we establish a multihop connection for information transfer from one of the users to its desired receiver based on the other users in the neighbourhood, their respective traffic characteristics, and the already deployed RISs in the surroundings. Moreover, we also take into account the impact of considering practical discrete phase shifts at the RIS patches instead of its ideal continuous counterpart. Furthermore, we claim as well as demonstrate that the existing classic least remaining distance (LRD)-based approach is not always the optimal solution. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed strategy and that it significantly outperforms the existing benchmark schemes in terms of system performance metrics such as data throughput, energy consumption, as well as energy efficiency.</description>

Abstract: Object manipulation has been extensively studied in the context of fixed base and mobile manipulators. However, the overactuated locomotion modality employed by snake robots allows for a unique blend of object manipulation through locomotion, referred to as loco-manipulation. The following work presents an optimization approach to solving the loco-manipulation problem based on non-impulsive implicit contact path planning for our snake robot COBRA. We present the mathematical framework and show high fidelity simulation results for fixed-shape lateral rolling trajectories that demonstrate the object manipulation.</description>

      <title>A Novel State-Centric Necessary Condition for Time-Optimal Control of Controllable Linear Systems Based on Augmented Switching Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most existing necessary conditions for optimal control based on adjoining methods require both state information and costate information, yet the lack of costates for a given feasible trajectory in practice impedes the determination of optimality. This paper establishes a novel theoretical framework for time-optimal control of controllable linear systems, proposing the augmented switching law that represents the input control and the feasibility in a compact form. Given a feasible trajectory, the disturbed trajectory under the constraints of augmented switching law is guaranteed to be feasible, resulting in a novel state-centric necessary condition without dependence on costate information. A first order necessary condition is proposed that the Jacobian matrix of the augmented switching law is not full row rank, which also results in an approach to optimizing a given feasible trajectory further. The proposed necessary condition is applied to the chain-of-integrators systems with full box constraints, contributing to some conclusions challenging to reason by traditional costate-based necessary conditions.</description>

      <title>Queues with resetting: a perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Performance modeling is a key issue in queuing theory and operation research. It is well-known that the length of a queue that awaits service or the time spent by a job in a queue depends not only on the service rate, but also crucially on the fluctuations in service time. The larger the fluctuations, the longer the delay becomes and hence, this is a major hindrance for the queue to operate efficiently. Various strategies have been adapted to prevent this drawback. In this perspective, we investigate the effects of one such novel strategy namely resetting or restart, an emerging concept in statistical physics and stochastic complex process, that was recently introduced to mitigate fluctuations-induced delays in queues. In particular, we show that a service resetting mechanism accompanied with an overhead time can remarkably shorten the average queue lengths and waiting times. We examine various resetting strategies and further shed light on the intricate role of the overhead times to the queuing performance. Our analysis opens up future avenues in operation research where resetting-based strategies can be universally promising.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using UAVs for wildlife observation and motion capture offers manifold advantages for studying animals in the wild, especially grazing herds in open terrain. The aerial perspective allows observation at a scale and depth that is not possible on the ground, offering new insights into group behavior. However, the very nature of wildlife field-studies puts traditional fixed wing and multi-copter systems to their limits: limited flight time, noise and safety aspects affect their efficacy, where lighter than air systems can remain on station for many hours. Nevertheless, airships are challenging from a ground handling perspective as well as from a control point of view, being voluminous and highly affected by wind. In this work, we showcase a system designed to use airship formations to track, follow, and visually record wild horses from multiple angles, including airship design, simulation, control, on board computer vision, autonomous operation and practical aspects of field experiments.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the concept of optimal virtual tube has emerged as a novel solution to the challenging task of navigating obstacle-dense environments for swarm robotics, offering a wide ranging of applications. However, it lacks an efficient homotopic path planning method in obstacle-dense environments. This paper introduces Tube-RRT*, an innovative homotopic path planning method that builds upon and improves the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm. Tube-RRT* is specifically designed to generate homotopic paths for the trajectories in the virtual tube, strategically considering opening volume and tube length to mitigate swarm congestion and ensure agile navigation. Through comprehensive comparative simulations conducted within complex, large-scale obstacle environments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Tube-RRT*.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review explores the application of intelligent optimization algorithms to Multi-Objective Optimal Power Flow (MOPF) in enhancing modern power systems. It delves into the challenges posed by the integration of renewables, smart grids, and increasing energy demands, focusing on evolutionary algorithms, swarm intelligence, and deep reinforcement learning. The effectiveness, scalability, and application of these algorithms are analyzed, with findings suggesting that algorithm selection is contingent on the specific MOPF problem at hand, and hybrid approaches offer significant promise. The importance of standard test systems for verifying solutions and the role of software tools in facilitating analysis are emphasized. Future research is directed towards exploiting machine learning for dynamic optimization, embracing decentralized energy systems, and adapting to evolving policy frameworks to improve power system efficiency and sustainability. This review aims to advance MOPF research by highlighting state-of-the-art methodologies and encouraging the development of innovative solutions for future energy challenges.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear sparse variational Bayesian learning based model predictive control with application to PEMFC temperature control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of the underlying model predictions is crucial for the success of model predictive control (MPC) applications. If the model is unable to accurately analyze the dynamics of the controlled system, the performance and stability guarantees provided by MPC may not be achieved. Learning-based MPC can learn models from data, improving the applicability and reliability of MPC. This study develops a nonlinear sparse variational Bayesian learning based MPC (NSVB-MPC) for nonlinear systems, where the model is learned by the developed NSVB method. Variational inference is used by NSVB-MPC to assess the predictive accuracy and make the necessary corrections to quantify system uncertainty. The suggested approach ensures input-to-state (ISS) and the feasibility of recursive constraints in accordance with the concept of an invariant terminal region. Finally, a PEMFC temperature control model experiment confirms the effectiveness of the NSVB-MPC method.</description>

      <title>Characterization and Mitigation of Insufficiencies in Automated Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated Driving (AD) systems have the potential to increase safety, comfort and energy efficiency. Recently, major automotive companies have started testing and validating AD systems (ADS) on public roads. Nevertheless, the commercial deployment and wide adoption of ADS have been moderate, partially due to system functional insufficiencies (FI) that undermine passenger safety and lead to hazardous situations on the road. FIs are defined in ISO 21448 Safety Of The Intended Functionality (SOTIF). FIs are insufficiencies in sensors, actuators and algorithm implementations, including neural networks and probabilistic calculations. Examples of FIs in ADS include inaccurate ego-vehicle localization on the road, incorrect prediction of a cyclist maneuver, unreliable detection of a pedestrian, etc.
  The main goal of our study is to formulate a generic architectural design pattern, which is compatible with existing methods and ADS, to improve FI mitigation and enable faster commercial deployment of ADS. First, we studied the 2021 autonomous vehicles disengagement reports published by the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). The data clearly show that disengagements are five times more often caused by FIs rather than by system faults. We then made a comprehensive list of insufficiencies and their characteristics by analyzing over 10 hours of publicly available road test videos. In particular, we identified insufficiency types in four major categories: world model, motion plan, traffic rule, and operational design domain. The insufficiency characterization helps making the SOTIF analyses of triggering conditions more systematic and comprehensive.
  Based on our FI characterization, simulation experiments and literature survey, we define a novel generic architectural design pattern Daruma to dynamically select the channel that is least likely to have a FI at the moment.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Stability Assessment of Power Electronic Converters with Multi-Resolution Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harmonic instability occurs frequently in the power electronic converter system. This paper leverages multi-resolution dynamic mode decomposition (MR-DMD) as a data-driven diagnostic tool for the system stability of power electronic converters, not requiring complex modeling and detailed control information. By combining dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) with the multi-resolution analysis used in wavelet theory, dynamic modes and eigenvalues can be identified at different decomposition levels and time scales with the MR-DMD algorithm, thereby allowing for handling datasets with transient time behaviors, which is not achievable using conventional DMD. Further, the selection criteria for important parameters in MR-DMD are clearly defined through derivation, elucidating the reason for enabling it to extract eigenvalues within different frequency ranges. Finally, the analysis results are verified using the dataset collected from the experimental platform of a low-frequency oscillation scenario in electrified railways featuring a single-phase converter.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Lane-Change Reactions to Merging Vehicles for Highway On-Ramp Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing simulation environments to replicate real-world driver behavior is essential for developing Autonomous Vehicle technology. While some previous works have studied the yielding reaction of lag vehicles in response to a merging car at highway on-ramps, the possible lane-change reaction of the lag car has not been widely studied. In this work we aim to improve the simulation of the highway merge scenario by including the lane-change reaction in addition to yielding behavior of main-lane lag vehicles, and we evaluate two different models for their ability to capture this reactive lane-change behavior. To tune the payoff functions of these models, a novel naturalistic dataset was collected on U.S. highways that provided several hours of merge-specific data to learn the lane change behavior of U.S. drivers. To make sure that we are collecting a representative set of different U.S. highway geometries in our data, we surveyed 50,000 U.S. highway on-ramps and then selected eight representative sites. The data were collected using roadside-mounted lidar sensors to capture various merge driver interactions. The models were demonstrated to be configurable for both keep-straight and lane-change behavior. The models were finally integrated into a high-fidelity simulation environment and confirmed to have adequate computation time efficiency for use in large-scale simulations to support autonomous vehicle development.</description>

      <title>Explainable Online Unsupervised Anomaly Detection for Cyber-Physical Systems via Causal Discovery from Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online unsupervised detection of anomalies is crucial to guarantee the correct operation of cyber-physical systems and the safety of humans interacting with them. State-of-the-art approaches based on deep learning via neural networks achieve outstanding performance at anomaly recognition, evaluating the discrepancy between a normal model of the system (with no anomalies) and the real-time stream of sensor time series. However, large training data and time are typically required, and explainability is still a challenge to identify the root of the anomaly and implement predictive maintainance. In this paper, we use causal discovery to learn a normal causal graph of the system, and we evaluate the persistency of causal links during real-time acquisition of sensor data to promptly detect anomalies. On two benchmark anomaly detection datasets, we show that our method has higher training efficiency, outperforms the accuracy of state-of-the-art neural architectures and correctly identifies the sources of $&gt;10$ different anomalies.

      <title>Flow-Based Synthesis of Reactive Tests for Discrete Decision-Making Systems with Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing tests to evaluate if a given autonomous system satisfies complex specifications is challenging due to the complexity of these systems. This work proposes a flow-based approach for reactive test synthesis from temporal logic specifications, enabling the synthesis of test environments consisting of static and reactive obstacles and dynamic test agents. The temporal logic specifications describe desired test behavior, including system requirements as well as a test objective that is not revealed to the system. The synthesized test strategy places restrictions on system actions in reaction to the system state. The tests are minimally restrictive and accomplish the test objective while ensuring realizability of the system's objective without aiding it (semi-cooperative setting). Automata theory and flow networks are leveraged to formulate a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) to synthesize the test strategy. For a dynamic test agent, the agent strategy is synthesized for a GR(1) specification constructed from the solution of the MILP. If the specification is unrealizable by the dynamics of the test agent, a counterexample-guided approach is used to resolve the MILP until a strategy is found. This flow-based, reactive test synthesis is conducted offline and is agnostic to the system controller. Finally, the resulting test strategy is demonstrated in simulation and experimentally on a pair of quadrupedal robots for a variety of specifications.</description>

      <title>Quality of Experience Oriented Cross-layer Optimization for Real-time XR Video Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended reality (XR) is one of the most important applications of beyond 5G and 6G networks. Real-time XR video transmission presents challenges in terms of data rate and delay. In particular, the frame-by-frame transmission mode of XR video makes real-time XR video very sensitive to dynamic network environments. To improve the users' quality of experience (QoE), we design a cross-layer transmission framework for real-time XR video. The proposed framework allows the simple information exchange between the base station (BS) and the XR server, which assists in adaptive bitrate and wireless resource scheduling. We utilize the cross-layer information to formulate the problem of maximizing user QoE by finding the optimal scheduling and bitrate adjustment strategies. To address the issue of mismatched time scales between two strategies, we decouple the original problem and solve them individually using a multi-agent-based approach. Specifically, we propose the multi-step Deep Q-network (MS-DQN) algorithm to obtain a frame-priority-based wireless resource scheduling strategy and then propose the Transformer-based Proximal Policy Optimization (TPPO) algorithm for video bitrate adaptation. The experimental results show that the TPPO+MS-DQN algorithm proposed in this study can improve the QoE by 3.6% to 37.8%. More specifically, the proposed MS-DQN algorithm enhances the transmission quality by 49.9%-80.2%.</description>

      <title>Joint Coverage and Power Control in Highly Dynamic and Massive UAV Networks: An Aggregative Game-theoretic Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.08363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) ad-hoc network is a significant contingency plan for communication after a natural disaster, such as typhoon and earthquake. To achieve efficient and rapid networks deployment, we employ noncooperative game theory and amended binary log-linear algorithm (BLLA) seeking for the Nash equilibrium which achieves the optimal network performance. We not only take channel overlap and power control into account but also consider coverage and the complexity of interference. However, extensive UAV game theoretical models show limitations in post-disaster scenarios which require large-scale UAV network deployments. Besides, the highly dynamic post-disaster scenarios cause strategies updating constraint and strategy-deciding error on UAV ad-hoc networks. To handle these problems, we employ aggregative game which could capture and cover those characteristics. Moreover, we propose a novel synchronous payoff-based binary log-linear learning algorithm (SPBLLA) to lessen information exchange and reduce time consumption. Ultimately, the experiments indicate that, under the same strategy-deciding error rate, SPBLLA's learning rate is manifestly faster than that of the revised BLLA. Hence, the new model and algorithm are more suitable and promising for large-scale highly dynamic scenarios.</description>

      <title>How Many Grid-Forming Converters do We Need? A Perspective From Small Signal Stability and Power Grid Strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10465v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grid-forming (GFM) control has been considered as a promising solution for accommodating large-scale power electronics converters into modern power grids thanks to its grid-friendly dynamics, in particular, voltage source behavior on the AC side. The voltage source behavior of GFM converters can provide voltage support for the power grid, and therefore enhance the power grid (voltage) strength. However, grid-following (GFL) converters can also perform constant AC voltage magnitude control by properly regulating its reactive current, which may also behave like a voltage source. Currently, it still remains unclear what are the essential difference between the voltage source behaviors of GFL and GFM converters, and which type of voltage source behavior can enhance the power grid strength. In this paper, we will demonstrate that only GFM converters can provide effective voltage source behavior and enhance the power grid strength in terms of small signal dynamics. Based on our analysis, we further study the problem of how to configure GFM converters in the grid and how many GFM converters we will need. We investigate how the capacity ratio between GFM and GFL converters affects the equivalent power grid strength and thus the small signal stability of the system. We give guidelines on how to choose this ratio to achieve a desired stability margin. We validate our analysis using high-fidelity simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for the safe control design of systems with parametric uncertainties in both drift terms and control-input matrices. The method combines control barrier functions and adaptive laws to generate a safe controller through a nonlinear program with an explicitly given closed-form solution. The proposed approach verifies the non-emptiness of the admissible control set independently of online parameter estimations, which can ensure the safe controller is singularity-free. A data-driven algorithm is also developed to improve the performance of the proposed controller by tightening the bounds of the unknown parameters. The effectiveness of the control scheme is demonstrated through numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we have focused on identifying a class of continuous- and discrete-time MAS for which a scale-free non-collaborative (i.e., scale-free fully distributed) linear protocol design is developed. We have identified conditions on agent models that enable us to design scalable linear protocols. Moreover, we show that these conditions are necessary if the agents are single input and single output. We also provide a complete design of scalable protocols for this class.</description>

Abstract: We propose using a hierarchical retail market structure to alert and dispatch resources to mitigate cyber-physical attacks on a distribution grid. We simulate attacks where a number of generation nodes in a distribution grid are attacked. We show that the market is able to successfully meet the shortfall between demand and supply by utilizing the flexibility of remaining resources while minimizing any extra power that needs to be imported from the main transmission grid. This includes utilizing upward flexibility or reserves of remaining online generators and some curtailment or shifting of flexible loads, which results in higher costs. Using price signals and market-based coordination, the grid operator can achieve its objectives without direct control over distributed energy resources and is able to accurately compensate prosumers for the grid support they provide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08925v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our paper presents the design of a unique annular ring-shaped planar monopole antenna with octal geometry intended for a broad spectrum of frequency applications. Utilizing FR4 epoxy for the substrate and copper material for the top patch, the antenna measures 39 mm $\times$ 30 mm $\times$ 1.6 mm. It exhibits resonance at 6.8 GHz, with a return loss of -49.01 dB. The antenna demonstrates a broad frequency range from 2.1 GHz - 13.1 GHz, resulting in an overall -10 dB bandwidth of 11 GHz. At the resonating frequency of 6.8 GHz, the antenna accomplished a total gain of 3.01 dBi and a peak gain of 5.87 dBi at 12.4 GHz. Additionally, it attains a high radiation efficiency of 95.26\%. The annular patch of the antenna helps distribute the current uniformly at the boundaries of the patch. This helps achieve better current distribution and wider -10 dB bandwidth. This antenna is a versatile replacement for multiple antennas catering to various frequency bands.</description>

Abstract: Nonline of sight (NLOS) ultraviolet (UV) scattering communication can serve as a good candidate for outdoor optical wireless communication (OWC) in the cases of non-perfect transmitter-receiver alignment and radio silence. We design and demonstrate a NLOS UV scattering communication network system in this paper, where a beacon-enabled time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme is adopted. In our system, LED and PMT are employed for transmitter and receiver devices, repectivey. Furthermore, we design algorithms for beacon transmission, beacon reception, time compensation, and time slot transition for hardware realization in field-programmable gate array (FPGA) board based on master-slave structure, where master node periodically transmits beacon signals to slave nodes. Experimental results are provided to evaluate the time synchronization error and specify the system key parameters for real-time implementation. We perform field tests for real-time communication network with the transmission range over 110 multiplied by 90 square meters, where the system throughput reaches 800kbps.</description>

      <title>Quality-Aware Hydraulic Control in Drinking Water Networks via Controllability Proxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12214v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The operation of water distribution networks is a complex procedure aimed at efficiently delivering consumers with adequate water quantity while ensuring its safe quality. An added challenge is the dependency of the water quality dynamics on the system's hydraulics, which influences the performance of the water quality controller. Prior research has addressed either solving the optimum operational hydraulic setting problem or regulating the water quality dynamics as separate problems. Additionally, there have been efforts to couple these two problems and solve one compact problem resulting in trade-offs between the contradictory objectives. In contrast, this paper takes a novel approach by examining the water quality dependency on the hydraulics from a control-theoretic standpoint. More specifically, we explore the influence of accountability for water quality controllability improvement when addressing the pump scheduling problem. We examine its effects on the cumulative cost of the interconnected systems as well as the subsequent performance of the water quality controller. To achieve this, we develop a framework that incorporates different controllability metrics within the operational hydraulic optimization problem; its aim is attaining an adequate level of water quality control across the system. We assess the aforementioned aspects' performance on various scaled networks with a wide range of numerical scenarios.</description>

      <title>On the Feasibility of Deep Learning Classification from Raw Signal Data in Radiology, Ultrasonography and Electrophysiology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16165v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical imaging is a very useful tool in healthcare, various technologies being employed to non-invasively peek inside the human body. Deep learning with neural networks in radiology was welcome - albeit cautiously - by the radiologist community. Most of the currently deployed or researched deep learning solutions are applied on already generated images of medical scans, use the neural networks to aid in the generation of such images, or use them for identifying specific substance markers in spectrographs. This paper's author posits that if the neural networks were trained directly on the raw signals from the scanning machines, they would gain access to more nuanced information than from the already processed images, hence the training - and later, the inferences - would become more accurate. The paper presents the main current applications of deep learning in radiography, ultrasonography, and electrophysiology, and discusses whether the proposed neural network training directly on raw signals is feasible.</description>

Abstract: This work performs the design, real-time hardware realization, and experimental evaluation of a positioning system by ultra-violet (UV) communication under photon-level signal detection. The positioning is based on time-difference of arrival (TDOA) principle. Time division-based transmission of synchronization sequence from three transmitters with known positions is applied. We investigate the positioning error via decomposing it into two parts, the transmitter-side timing error and the receiver-side synchronization error. The theoretical average error matches well with the simulation results, which indicates that theoretical fitting can provide reliable guidance and prediction for hardware experiments. We also conduct real-time hardware realization of the TDOA-based positioning system using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), which is experimentally evaluated via outdoor experiments. Experimental results match well with the theoretical and simulation results.</description>

The proposed scheme determines feasible and optimally distributed input flows for the various gates located at the periphery of a protected network. A parsimonious model is employed to describe the traffic dynamics of the protected network. To describe traffic dynamics outside of the protected area, the state-space model is augmented with additional state variables to account for vehicle queues at store-and-forward origin links at the periphery. The perimeter flow control problem is formulated as a convex optimisation problem with finite horizon, and constrained control and state variables. It aims to equalise the relative queues at origin links and to maintain the vehicle accumulation in the protected network around a desired set point, while the system's throughput is maximised. For real-time control, the optimal control problem is embedded in a rolling-horizon scheme using the current state of the system as the initial state as well as predicted demand flows at entrance links. Furthermore, practical flow allocation policies for single-region perimeter control without explicitly considering entrance link dynamics are presented. These policies allocate a global perimeter-ordered flow to candidate gates at the periphery of a protected network by taking into account the different geometric characteristics of origin links. The proposed flow allocation policies are then benchmarked against the multi-gated perimeter flow control. A study is carried out for a 2.5 square mile protected network area of San Francisco, CA, including fifteen gates of different geometric characteristics. The results have showed that the proposed scheme is able to manage excessive queues outside of the protected network and to optimally distribute the input flows, which confirms its efficiency and equity properties.</description>

      <title>Conservative Linear Envelopes for Nonlinear, High-Dimensional, Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi reachability (HJR) provides a value function that encodes the set of states from which a system with bounded control inputs can reach or avoid a target despite any bounded disturbance, and the corresponding robust, optimal control policy. Though powerful, traditional methods for HJR rely on dynamic programming (DP) and suffer from exponential computation growth with respect to state dimension. The recently favored Hopf formula mitigates this ``curse of dimensionality'' by providing an efficient and space-parallelizable approach for solving the reachability problem. However, the Hopf formula can only be applied to linear time-varying systems. To overcome this limitation, we show that the error between a nonlinear system and a linear model can be transformed into an adversarial bounded artificial disturbance. One may then solve the dimension-robust generalized Hopf formula for a linear game with this ``antagonistic error" to perform guaranteed conservative reachability analysis and control synthesis of nonlinear systems; this can be done for problem formulations in which no other HJR method is both computationally feasible and guaranteed. In addition, we offer several technical methods for reducing conservativeness in the analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our results through one illustrative example (the controlled Van der Pol system) that can be compared to standard DP, and one higher-dimensional 15D example (a 5-agent pursuit-evasion game with Dubins cars).</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization on Uplink OFDMA and MU-MIMO for IEEE 802.11ax: Deep Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter tackles a joint user scheduling, frequency resource allocation (USRA), multi-input-multi-output mode selection (MIMO MS) between single-user MIMO and multi-user (MU) MIMO, and MU-MIMO user selection problem, integrating uplink orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) in IEEE 802.11ax. Specifically, we focus on \textit{unsaturated traffic conditions} where users' data demands fluctuate. In unsaturated traffic conditions, considering packet volumes per user introduces a combinatorial problem, requiring the simultaneous optimization of MU-MIMO user selection and RA along the time-frequency-space axis. Consequently, dealing with the combinatorial nature of this problem, characterized by a large cardinality of unknown variables, poses a challenge that conventional optimization methods find nearly impossible to address. In response, this letter proposes an approach with deep hierarchical reinforcement learning (DHRL) to solve the joint problem. Rather than simply adopting off-the-shelf DHRL, we \textit{tailor} the DHRL to the joint USRA and MS problem, thereby significantly improving the convergence speed and throughput. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves significantly improved throughput compared to the existing schemes under various unsaturated traffic conditions.</description>

      <title>Joint Design of Self-Tuning UHF RFID Antenna and Microfluidic Channel for Liquid Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microfluidic has been an enabling technology for over a decade, particularly in the field of medical and wearable devices, allowing for the manipulation of small amounts of fluid in confined spaces. Micro-channels can also be used for wireless sensing thanks to the variations in antenna properties when the fluid flows near it. However, up to now, microfluidic channels and sensing antennas have always been designed separately; instead, since the liquid flow and the antenna geometry both contribute to the overall performance, they should be considered simultaneously when optimizing the antenna-microfluidic system. In this paper, the joint design of the antenna and microfluidic channels is investigated for liquid quantification. Self-tuning RFID microchips are exploited to minimize communication degradation due to the increase of lossy liquid amount over the sensing antenna while digitalizing the impedance mismatch itself. To experimentally corroborate the joint design technique, two different geometries are obtained and prototyped starting from a given antenna-microfluidic layout by setting different goals for an optimization function. The two flexible RFID prototypes returned performance in agreement with the simulated ones, achieving a maximum sensitivity of about 20 units of the digital metric per milligram increase of water.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.09318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper improves the performance of RRT$^*$-like sampling-based path planners by combining admissible informed sampling and local sampling (i.e., sampling the neighborhood of the current solution). An adaptive strategy regulates the trade-off between exploration (admissible informed sampling) and exploitation (local sampling) based on online rewards from previous samples. The paper demonstrates that the algorithm is asymptotically optimal and has a better convergence rate than state-of-the-art path planners (e.g., Informed-RRT*) in several simulated and real-world scenarios. An open-source, ROS-compatible implementation of the algorithm is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Learning Decentralized Linear Quadratic Regulator with $\sqrt{T}$ Regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.08886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an online learning algorithm that adaptively designs a decentralized linear quadratic regulator when the system model is unknown a priori and new data samples from a single system trajectory become progressively available. The algorithm uses a disturbance-feedback representation of state-feedback controllers coupled with online convex optimization with memory and delayed feedback. Under the assumption that the system is stable or given a known stabilizing controller, we show that our controller enjoys an expected regret that scales as $\sqrt{T}$ with the time horizon $T$ for the case of partially nested information pattern. For more general information patterns, the optimal controller is unknown even if the system model is known. In this case, the regret of our controller is shown with respect to a linear sub-optimal controller. We validate our theoretical findings using numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: Developing and testing novel control and motion planning algorithms for aerial vehicles can be a challenging task, with the robotics community relying more than ever on 3D simulation technologies to evaluate the performance of new algorithms in a variety of conditions and environments. In this work, we introduce the Pegasus Simulator, a modular framework implemented as an NVIDIA Isaac Sim extension that enables real-time simulation of multiple multirotor vehicles in photo-realistic environments, while providing out-of-the-box integration with the widely adopted PX4-Autopilot and ROS2 through its modular implementation and intuitive graphical user interface. To demonstrate some of its capabilities, a nonlinear controller was implemented and simulation results for two drones performing aggressive flight maneuvers are presented. Code and documentation for this framework are also provided as supplementary material.</description>

      <title>A Passive Variable Impedance Control Strategy with Viscoelastic Parameters Estimation of Soft Tissues for Safe Ultrasonography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of telehealth, robotic approaches have proven a valuable solution to in-person visits in remote areas, with decreased costs for patients and infection risks. In particular, in ultrasonography, robots have the potential to reproduce the skills required to acquire high-quality images while reducing the sonographer's physical efforts. In this paper, we address the control of the interaction of the probe with the patient's body, a critical aspect of ensuring safe and effective ultrasonography. We introduce a novel approach based on variable impedance control, allowing real-time optimisation of a compliant controller parameters during ultrasound procedures. This optimisation is formulated as a quadratic programming problem and incorporates physical constraints derived from viscoelastic parameter estimations. Safety and passivity constraints, including an energy tank, are also integrated to minimise potential risks during human-robot interaction. The proposed method's efficacy is demonstrated through experiments on a patient dummy torso, highlighting its potential for achieving safe behaviour and accurate force control during ultrasound procedures, even in cases of contact loss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we focus on the solution of online problems with time-varying, linear equality and inequality constraints. Our approach is to design a novel online algorithm by leveraging the tools of control theory. In particular, for the case of equality constraints only, using robust control we design an online algorithm with asymptotic convergence to the optimal trajectory, differently from the alternatives that achieve non-zero tracking error. When also inequality constraints are present, we show how to modify the proposed algorithm to account for the wind-up induced by the nonnegativity constraints on the dual variables. We report numerical results that corroborate the theoretical analysis, and show how the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms both with equality and inequality constraints.</description>

      <title>The Role of Federated Learning in a Wireless World with Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) models that have recently enabled multiple brand-new generative AI applications. The rapid advances in FMs serve as an important contextual backdrop for the vision of next-generation wireless networks, where federated learning (FL) is a key enabler of distributed network intelligence. Currently, the exploration of the interplay between FMs and FL is still in its nascent stage. Naturally, FMs are capable of boosting the performance of FL, and FL could also leverage decentralized data and computing resources to assist in the training of FMs. However, the exceptionally high requirements that FMs have for computing resources, storage, and communication overhead would pose critical challenges to FL-enabled wireless networks. In this article, we explore the extent to which FMs are suitable for FL over wireless networks, including a broad overview of research challenges and opportunities. In particular, we discuss multiple new paradigms for realizing future intelligent networks that integrate FMs and FL. We also consolidate several broad research directions associated with these paradigms.</description>

      <title>AV4EV: Open-Source Modular Autonomous Electric Vehicle Platform for Making Mobility Research Accessible</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When academic researchers develop and validate autonomous driving algorithms, there is a challenge in balancing high-performance capabilities with the cost and complexity of the vehicle platform. Much of today's research on autonomous vehicles (AV) is limited to experimentation on expensive commercial vehicles that require large skilled teams to retrofit the vehicles and test them in dedicated facilities. On the other hand, 1/10th-1/16th scaled-down vehicle platforms are more affordable but have limited similitude in performance and drivability. To address this issue, we present the design of a one-third-scale autonomous electric go-kart platform with open-source mechatronics design along with fully functional autonomous driving software. The platform's multi-modal driving system is capable of manual, autonomous, and teleoperation driving modes. It also features a flexible sensing suite for the algorithm deployment across perception, localization, planning, and control. This development serves as a bridge between full-scale vehicles and reduced-scale cars while accelerating cost-effective algorithmic advancements. Our experimental results demonstrate the AV4EV platform's capabilities and ease of use for developing new AV algorithms. All materials are available at AV4EV.org to stimulate collaborative efforts within the AV and electric vehicle (EV) communities.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Analysis of On-Policy Heterogeneous Federated Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated reinforcement learning (FRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for reducing the sample complexity of reinforcement learning tasks by exploiting information from different agents. However, when each agent interacts with a potentially different environment, little to nothing is known theoretically about the non-asymptotic performance of FRL algorithms. The lack of such results can be attributed to various technical challenges and their intricate interplay: Markovian sampling, linear function approximation, multiple local updates to save communication, heterogeneity in the reward functions and transition kernels of the agents' MDPs, and continuous state-action spaces. Moreover, in the on-policy setting, the behavior policies vary with time, further complicating the analysis. In response, we introduce FedSARSA, a novel federated on-policy reinforcement learning scheme, equipped with linear function approximation, to address these challenges and provide a comprehensive finite-time error analysis. Notably, we establish that FedSARSA converges to a policy that is near-optimal for all agents, with the extent of near-optimality proportional to the level of heterogeneity. Furthermore, we prove that FedSARSA leverages agent collaboration to enable linear speedups as the number of agents increases, which holds for both fixed and adaptive step-size configurations.</description>

      <title>Wireless Resource Optimization in Hybrid Semantic/Bit Communication Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, semantic communication (SemCom) has shown great potential in significant resource savings and efficient information exchanges, thus naturally introducing a novel and practical cellular network paradigm where two modes of SemCom and conventional bit communication (BitCom) coexist. Nevertheless, the involved wireless resource management becomes rather complicated and challenging, given the unique background knowledge matching and time-consuming semantic coding requirements in SemCom. To this end, this paper jointly investigates user association (UA), mode selection (MS), and bandwidth allocation (BA) problems in a hybrid semantic/bit communication network (HSB-Net). Concretely, we first identify a unified performance metric of message throughput for both SemCom and BitCom links. Next, we specially develop a knowledge matching-aware two-stage tandem packet queuing model and theoretically derive the average packet loss ratio and queuing latency. Combined with practical constraints, we then formulate a joint optimization problem for UA, MS, and BA to maximize the overall message throughput of HSB-Net. Afterward, we propose an optimal resource management strategy by utilizing a Lagrange primal-dual transformation method and a preference list-based heuristic algorithm with polynomial-time complexity. Numerical results not only demonstrate the accuracy of our analytical queuing model, but also validate the performance superiority of our proposed strategy compared with different benchmarks.</description>

      <title>A Novel Optimization-Based Collision Avoidance For Autonomous On-Orbit Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The collision avoidance constraints are prominent as non-convex, non-differentiable, and challenging when defined in optimization-based motion planning problems. To overcome these issues, this paper presents a novel non-conservative collision avoidance technique using the notion of convex optimization to establish the distance between robotic spacecraft and space structures for autonomous on-orbit assembly operations. The proposed technique defines each ellipsoidal- and polyhedral-shaped object as the union of convex compact sets, each represented non-conservatively by a real-valued convex function. Then, the functions are introduced as a set of constraints to a convex optimization problem to produce a new set of differentiable constraints resulting from the optimality conditions. These new constraints are later fed into an optimal control problem to enforce collision avoidance where the motion planning for the autonomous on-orbit assembly takes place. Numerical experiments for two assembly scenarios in tight environments are presented to demonstrate the capability and effectiveness of the proposed technique. The results show that this framework leads to optimal non-conservative trajectories for robotic spacecraft in tight environments. Although developed for autonomous on-orbit assembly, this technique could be used for any generic motion planning problem where collision avoidance is crucial.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Neural Network Robustness Assessment in Image Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant attention given to the robustness assessment of neural networks. Robustness plays a critical role in ensuring reliable operation of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in complex and uncertain environments. Deep learning's robustness problem is particularly significant, highlighted by the discovery of adversarial attacks on image classification models. Researchers have dedicated efforts to evaluate robustness in diverse perturbation conditions for image recognition tasks. Robustness assessment encompasses two main techniques: robustness verification/ certification for deliberate adversarial attacks and robustness testing for random data corruptions. In this survey, we present a detailed examination of both adversarial robustness (AR) and corruption robustness (CR) in neural network assessment. Analyzing current research papers and standards, we provide an extensive overview of robustness assessment in image recognition. Three essential aspects are analyzed: concepts, metrics, and assessment methods. We investigate the perturbation metrics and range representations used to measure the degree of perturbations on images, as well as the robustness metrics specifically for the robustness conditions of classification models. The strengths and limitations of the existing methods are also discussed, and some potential directions for future research are provided.</description>
