      <title>Duality and Policy Evaluation in Distributionally Robust Bayesian Diffusion Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a Bayesian diffusion control problem of expected terminal utility maximization. The controller imposes a prior distribution on the unknown drift of an underlying diffusion. The Bayesian optimal control, tracking the posterior distribution of the unknown drift, can be characterized explicitly. However, in practice, the prior will generally be incorrectly specified, and the degree of model misspecification can have a significant impact on policy performance. To mitigate this and reduce overpessimism, we introduce a distributionally robust Bayesian control (DRBC) formulation in which the controller plays a game against an adversary who selects a prior in divergence neighborhood of a baseline prior. The adversarial approach has been studied in economics and efficient algorithms have been proposed in static optimization settings. We develop a strong duality result for our DRBC formulation. Combining these results together with tools from stochastic analysis, we are able to derive a loss that can be efficiently trained (as we demonstrate in our numerical experiments) using a suitable neural network architecture. As a result, we obtain an effective algorithm for computing the DRBC optimal strategy. The methodology for computing the DRBC optimal strategy is greatly simplified, as we show, in the important case in which the adversary chooses a prior from a Kullback-Leibler distributional uncertainty set.</description>

      <title>Neural Functionally Generated Portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel neural-network-based approach to learning the generating function $G(\cdot)$ of a functionally generated portfolio (FGP) from synthetic or real market data. In the neural network setting, the generating function is represented as $G_{\theta}(\cdot)$, where $\theta$ is an iterable neural network parameter vector, and $G_{\theta}(\cdot)$ is trained to maximise investment return relative to the market portfolio. We compare the performance of the Neural FGP approach against classical FGP benchmarks. FGPs provide a robust alternative to classical portfolio optimisation by bypassing the need to estimate drifts or covariances. The neural FGP framework extends this by introducing flexibility in the design of the generating function, enabling it to learn from market dynamics while preserving self-financing and pathwise decomposition properties.</description>
