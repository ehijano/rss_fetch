      <title>Shape-morphing membranes augment the performance of oscillating foil energy harvesting turbines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oscillating foil turbines (OFTs) can be used to produce power from rivers and tides by synchronizing their heaving motion with the strong lift force of vortices shed at their leading edge. Prior work has shown that compliant membrane OFTs, which passively camber, exhibit enhanced leading edge vortex (LEV) stability and improved lift and power compared with rigid foil OFTs for specific kinematics. This work seeks to understand a) the performance of compliant membrane OFTs over their full kinematic parameter space and b) separate the roles of membrane camber and extensibility in LEV stabilization. We characterize the performance of a compliant membrane OFT over a wide range of kinematic parameters through prescribed motion experiments in a free-surface water flume. The optimal frequency of the compliant membrane OFT is found to be lower than that of a rigid foil OFT due to the enhanced LEV stability of the membrane. The lift and power of compliant and inextensible membrane foils are then compared to determine whether camber alone is effective for LEV stabilization or if extensibility plays an important stabilizing role. The deformation of the compliant membrane OFT is measured using laser imaging. We observe that the role of extensibility changes for different angles of attack. At low angles of attack, membrane deformation is consistent through the half cycle coinciding with similar performance to the inextensible foil. At higher angles of attack, the compliant foil has a larger deformation and dynamically decambers corresponding with delayed stall and enhanced lift and power.</description>

      <title>Empirical large-scale extension of Yakhot's model of strong turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an empirical extension of Yakhot's model of strong turbulence [V. Yakhot, Phys. Rev. E 57(2) (1998)] that correctly describes the statistics of longitudinal velocity increments not only in the inertial range but also for larger scales up to the system length scale L. Two additional parameters are introduced to the original equation for the probability density function of velocity increments. These parameters can be motivated by physical arguments and their values are fixed by large scale boundary conditions. The resultant model ensures correct convergence of structure functions at the system length scale, including vanishing slopes at L, and shows good agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <title>A difference-free conservative phase-field lattice Boltzmann method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an innovative difference-free scheme that combines the one-fluid lattice Boltzmann method (lBM) with the conservative phase-field (CPF) lBM to effectively solve large-scale two-phase fluid flow problems. The difference-free scheme enables the derivation of the derivative of the order parameter and the normal vector through the moments of the particle distribution function (PDF). We further incorporate the surface tension force in a continuous surface stress form into the momentum equations by modifying the equilibrium PDF to eliminate the divergence operator. Consequently, the entire computation process, executed without any inter-grid finite difference formulation, demonstrates improved efficiency, making it an ideal choice for high-performance computing applications. We conduct simulations of a single static droplet to evaluate the intensity of spurious currents and assess the accuracy of the scheme. We then introduce the density or viscosity ratio and apply an external body force to model the Rayleigh-Taylor instability and the behavior of a single rising bubble, respectively. Finally, we employ our method to study the phenomenon of a single bubble breaking up in a Taylor-Green vortex. The comparison between the difference-free scheme and the finite difference method demonstrates the scheme's capability to yield accurate results. Furthermore, based on the performance evaluation, the current scheme exhibits an impressive $47\% $ increase in efficiency compared to the previous method.</description>

      <title>Thermocapillary migration of a self-rewetting droplet on an inclined surface: A phase-field simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigated the thermocapillary migration of a self-rewetting droplet on an inclined surface using a phase field based lattice Boltzmann method. Unlike the normal fluid whose surface tension decreases linearly with temperature, the self-rewetting fluid consider in the current work has a quadratic temperature dependence of surface tension with a well-defined minimum. we first explored the influence of the Marangoni number on droplet migration, and found that the droplet hardly deforms and migrates slowly when the Marangoni number is small. However, as the Marangoni number increases, the droplet begins to deform and elongate, and its migration speed increases. Subsequently, we studied the effect of surface wettability on droplet migration. The results show that the droplet migrate towards regions of higher surface energy on hydrophilic surfaces and in the opposite direction on hydrophobic surfaces. Furthermore, by varying the viscosity ratio and the inclination angle of the plate, we found that the droplet's migration speed decreases with an increase in the viscosity ratio. In particular, two vortices appear inside the droplet at a high viscosity ratio, whereas only one vortex is present at a low viscosity ratio.</description>

      <title>Particle transport and deposition in wall-sheared thermal turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the transport and deposition behavior of point particles in Rayleigh-B\'enard convection cells subjected to Couette-type wall shear. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) are performed for Rayleigh number (Ra) in the range \(10^7 \leq Ra \leq 10^9\) with a fixed Prandtl number \(Pr = 0.71\), while the wall-shear Reynolds number (\(Re_w\)) is in the range \(0 \leq Re_w \leq 12000\). With the increase of \(Re_w\), the large-scale rolls expanded horizontally, evolving into zonal flow in two-dimensional simulations or streamwise-oriented rolls in three-dimensional simulations. We observed that for particles with a small Stokes number St, they either circulated within the large-scale rolls when buoyancy dominated or drifted near the walls when shear dominated. For medium St particles, pronounced spatial inhomogeneity and preferential concentration were observed regardless of the prevailing flow state. For large St particles, the turbulent flow structure had a minor influence on particles' motion; although clustering still occurred, wall shear had a negligible influence compared to that for medium St particles. We then presented the settling curves to quantify the particle deposition ratio on the walls. Our DNS results aligned well with previous theoretical predictions, which state that small St particles settle with an exponential deposition ratio and large St particles settle with a linear deposition ratio. For medium St particles, where complex particles-turbulence interaction emerges, we developed a new model describing the settling process with an initial linear stage followed by a non-linear stage. Unknown parameters in our model can be determined either by fitting the settling curves or using empirical relations. Compared with DNS results, our model also accurately predicts the average residence time across a wide range of St for various \(Re_w\).</description>

      <title>Generalized Scaling of the Turbulence Structure in Wall-Bounded Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling of the Reynolds stresses has been sought by many researchers, since it provides a template of universal dynamical patterns across a range of Reynolds numbers. Various statistical and normalization schemes have been attempted, but without complete or convincing similarity properties. Our prior work on the transport processes in wall-bounded flows point toward self-similarity in the gradient space, where the first and second derivatives of the Reynolds stress components exhibit universal scaling across the entire boundary layer. This scaling is extendable to compressible flows. Finally, a universal, integral scaling for the mean velocity profiles is discovered and presented.</description>

      <title>Efficient condensation on spiked surfaces with superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Steam condensation on the surface of a solid is a widely observed mode of energy transfer in nature and various industrial applications. The condensation efficiency is closely related to the material properties and geometric morphology of the solid surface, as well as the method of liquid removal. Despite many surface modification strategies at the micro and nano levels having been employed to enhance steam condensation, understanding how to regulate steam condensation and liquid removal on complex surface morphologies remains incomplete. Here, we report a method that uses superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic coatings as well as spiked surfaces to achieve efficient steam condensation and rapid removal of the liquid. We reveal that on a copper plate with millimeter-scale spikes, hydrophobic spiked surfaces facilitate the dropwise condensation, while hydrophilic bottom grooves promote liquid spreading, and the suction in capillary gaps can promptly remove the condensate liquid. This method achieves a high condensation efficiency without relying on gravity. Additionally, we demonstrate that the condensation on spiked surfaces has a significant suction effect, as it continuously attracts the steam flow, thereby altering the flow direction. This finding provides a new approach for efficient steam condensation technology and opens up a promising pathway for providing circulation power and improving condensation efficiency in phase-change heat transfer devices such as heat pipes.</description>

      <title>Generalisation of the Navier-slip boundary condition to arbitrary directions: Application to 3D oblique geodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although boundary conditions are mandatory to solve partial differential equations, they also represent a transfer of information between the domain being modelled and its surroundings. In the case of isolated or closed systems, these can be formulated using free- or no-slip conditions. However, for open systems, the information transferred through the boundaries is essential to the dynamics of the system and can have a first order impact on its evolution. This work addresses regional geodynamic modelling simulating the evolution of an Earth's piece over millions of years by solving non-linear Stokes flow. In this open system, we introduce a new approach to impose oblique boundary conditions generalising the Navier-slip boundary conditions to arbitrary directions in 3D. The method requires defining both slip and stress constraints. The stress constraint is imposed utilising a coordinate transformation to redefine the stress tensor along the boundaries according to the arbitrary direction chosen while for the slip constraint we utilise Nitsche's method in the context of the finite element method, resulting in a symmetrised and penalised weak form. We validate our approach through a series of numerical experiments of increasing complexity, starting with 2D and 3D linear models. Then, we apply those boundary conditions to a 3D non-linear geodynamic model of oblique extension that we compare with a standard model utilising Dirichlet boundary conditions. Our results show that using Dirichlet boundary conditions strongly influences the evolution of the system and generates artefacts near and along the boundaries. In comparison, the model using the generalised Navier-slip boundary conditions behaves closely to a model with an unbounded domain, providing a physically interpretable solution near and along the boundaries.</description>

      <title>Composite solutions to a liquid bilayer model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12477v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article continues the research initiated in [17]. We derive explicit formulae for the leading order profiles of eleven types of stationary solutions to a one-dimensional two-layer thin-film liquid model considered with an intermolecular potential depending on both layer heights. The found solutions are composed of the repeated elementary blocks (bulk, contact line and ultra-thin film ones) being consistently asymptotically matched together. We show that once considered on a finite interval with Neumann boundary conditions these stationary solutions are either dynamically stable or weakly translationally unstable. Other composite solutions are found to be numerically unstable and rather exhibit complex coarsening dynamics.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Stable Model Reduction of One-Dimensional Hyperbolic Systems using Rational Quadratic Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we propose a novel method to ensure important entropy inequalities are satisfied semi-discretely when constructing reduced order models (ROMs) on nonlinear reduced manifolds. We are in particular interested in ROMs of systems of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws. The so-called entropy stability property endows the semi-discrete ROMs with physically admissible behaviour. The method generalizes earlier results on entropy-stable ROMs constructed on linear spaces. The ROM works by evaluating the projected system on a well-chosen approximation of the state that ensures entropy stability. To ensure accuracy of the ROM after this approximation we locally enrich the tangent space of the reduced manifold with important quantities. Using numerical experiments on some well-known equations (the inviscid Burgers equation, shallow water equations and compressible Euler equations) we show the improved structure-preserving properties of our ROM compared to standard approaches and that our approximations have minimal impact on the accuracy of the ROM. We additionally generalize the recently proposed polynomial reduced manifolds to rational polynomial manifolds and show that this leads to an increase in accuracy for our experiments.</description>

      <title>"Halfway to Rayleigh" and other Insights to the Rossby Wave Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rossby wave instability (RWI) is the fundamental non-axisymmetric radial shear instability in disks. The RWI can facilitate disk accretion, set the shape of planetary gaps and produce large vortices. It arises from density and/or temperature features, such as radial gaps, bumps or steps. A general, sufficient condition to trigger the RWI is lacking, which we address by studying the linear RWI in a suite of simplified models, including incompressible and compressible shearing sheets and global, cylindrical disks. We focus on enthalpy amplitude and width as the fundamental properties of disk features with various shapes. We find analytic results for the RWI boundary and growth rates across a wide parameter space, in some cases with exact derivations and in others as a description of numerical results. Features wider than a scale-height generally become unstable about halfway to Rayleigh instability, i.e.\ when the squared epicyclic frequency is about half the Keplerian value, reinforcing our previous finding. RWI growth rates approximately scale as enthalpy amplitude to the 1/3 power, with a weak dependence on width, across much of parameter space. Global disk curvature affects wide planetary gaps, making the outer gap edge more susceptible to the RWI. Our simplified models are barotropic and height-integrated, but the main results should carry over to more complex and realistic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Circulation Statistics in Homogeneous and Isotropic Turbulence</title>

Abstract: This is the final version of a Thesis presented to the PostGrad Program in Physics of the Physics Institute of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), as a necessary requirement for the title of Ph.D. in Science (Physics). The development of the Vortex Gas Model (VGM) introduces a novel statistical framework for describing the characteristics of velocity circulation. In this model, the underlying foundations rely on the statistical attributes of two fundamental constituents. The first is a GMC field that governs intermittent behavior and the second constituent is a Gaussian Free field responsible for the partial polarization of the vortices in the gas. The model is revisited in a more sophisticated language, where volume exclusion among vortices is addressed. These additions were subsequently validated through numerical simulations of turbulent Navier-Stokes equations. This revised approach harmonizes with the multifractal characteristics exhibited by circulation statistics, offering a compelling elucidation for the phenomenon of linearization of the statistical circulation moments, observed in recent numerical simulation.
  In the end, a field theoretical approach, known as Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-de Dominicis (MSRJD) functional method is carried out in the context of circulation probability density function. This approach delves into the realm of extreme circulation events, often referred to as Instantons, through two distinct methodologies: The First investigates the linear solutions and, by a renormalization group argument a time-rescaling symmetry is discussed. Secondly, a numerical strategy is implemented to tackle the nonlinear instanton equations in the axisymmetric approximation. This approach addresses the typical topology exhibited by the velocity field associated with extreme circulation events.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing tracer transport in convective penetration of a stably stratified layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use large-eddy simulations to study the penetration of a buoyant plume carrying a passive tracer into a stably stratified layer with constant buoyancy frequency. Using a buoyancy-tracer volume distribution, we develop a method for objectively partitioning plume fluid in buoyancy-tracer space into three regions, each of which corresponds to a coherent region in physical space. Specifically, we identify a source region where undiluted plume fluid enters the stratified layer, a transport region where much of the transition from undiluted to mixed fluid occurs in the plume cap, and an accumulation region corresponding to a radially spreading intrusion. This method enables quantification of different measures of turbulence and mixing within each of the three regions, including potential energy and turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates, an activity parameter, and the instantaneous mixing efficiency. We find that the most intense buoyancy gradients lie in a thin layer at the cap of the penetrating plume. This provides the primary stage of mixing between plume and environment and exhibits a mixing efficiency around 50%. Newly generated mixtures of environmental and plume fluid join the intrusion and experience relatively weak turbulence and buoyancy gradients. As the intrusion spreads radially, environmental fluid surrounding the intrusion is mixed into the intrusion with moderate mixing efficiency. This dominates the volume of environmental fluid entrained into the region containing plume fluid. However, the 'strongest' entrainment, as measured by the specific entrainment rate, is largest in the plume cap where the most buoyant environmental fluid is entrained.</description>

      <title>Reynolds number effect on drag reduction in pipe flows by a transverse wall oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03232v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulations of turbulent pipe flow with transverse wall oscillation (WWO) and with no transverse wall oscillation (NWO) are carried out at friction Reynolds numbers Re{\tau} = 170, 360, and 720. The period and amplitude of the oscillation are selected to achieve high drag reduction in this Reynolds number range, and the effect of increasing Reynolds number on the amount of drag reduction achievable is analyzed. Of a particular interest in this study is the identification of the scales of motion most affected by drag reduction at different Reynolds numbers. To answer this question, both one-dimensional and two-dimensional spectra of different statistical quantities are analyzed with and without transverse wall oscillation. The effect of wall oscillation is found to suppress the intermediate- and large-scale motions in the buffer layer of the flow, while large-scale and very-large-scale motions in the log layer and the wake region are enhanced. While suppression of the near-wall turbulence promotes drag reduction, enhancement of the large-scale motions in the log and the wake region is found to oppose drag reduction. Since higher Reynolds number flows support development of a growing range of large-scale structures, it is suggested that their prevalence in the energy spectra combined with their negative effect on drag reduction account for a reduced effectiveness of wall oscillation as a drag reduction mechanism with increasing Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>Does rare, noise-induced, bypass transition in plane Couette flow bypass instantons ?</title>

Abstract: We study rare noise induced paths that go all the way from stable laminar to transitional turbulent plane Couette flow and investigate whether these paths share the properties of classical noise induced transitions. The rare paths from laminar to turbulent flow are computed using Adaptive Multilevel Splitting, a rare event simulation method, and are validated against Direct Numerical Simulations at moderately small energy injection rate. The flow is forced outside its natural scales and redistribute energy to the unforced large scales so that the reactive trajectories display forced streamwise velocity tubes at the natural scale of velocity streaks. As the trajectory proceeds, these tubes gradually grow in amplitude until they cross the separatrix between laminar and turbulent flow. Streamwise vortices are visible after velocity tubes have reached near turbulent amplitude. As the domain size is increased from Lx * Lz=6 *4 to 36*24, spatial localisation then extension of the generated coherent streaks and vortices in the spanwise direction is observed. The paths computed in MFU display many of the characteristics of instantons, that often structure noise induced transitions: concentration of trajectories, exponentially increasing waiting times before transition, and Gumbel distribution of trajectory durations. However, bisections started on the reactive trajectories indicate that the trajectory lack two key ingredients of instantons. They do not visit the neighbourhood of the nearest saddle point and do not display the natural relaxation path from that saddle to transitional wall turbulence. The reactive paths do not concentrate more and more around the same trajectory as energy injection rate is decreased, but instead gradually move in phase space. They might reconnect with instantons at very small energy injection rate and exceedingly long waiting times.</description>

      <title>An Edge-based Interface Tracking (EBIT) Method for Multiphase Flows with Phase Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel Front-Tracking method, the Edge-Based Interface Tracking (EBIT) method for multiphase flow simulations. In the EBIT method, the markers are located on the grid edges and the interface can be reconstructed without storing the connectivity of the markers. This feature makes the process of marker addition or removal easier than in the traditional Front-Tracking method. The EBIT method also allows almost automatic parallelization due to the lack of explicit connectivity.
  In a previous journal article we have presented the kinematic part of the EBIT method, that includes the algorithms for piecewise linear reconstruction and advection of the interface. Here, we complete the presentation of the EBIT method and combine the kinematic algorithm with a Navier--Stokes solver. A circle fit is now implemented to improve the accuracy of mass conservation in the reconstruction phase. Furthermore, to identify the reference phase and to distinguish ambiguous topological configurations, we introduce a new feature: the Color Vertex. For the coupling with the Navier--Stokes equations, we first calculate volume fractions from the position of the markers and the Color Vertex, then viscosity and density fields from the computed volume fractions and finally surface tension stresses with the Height-Function method. In addition, an automatic topology change algorithm is implemented into the EBIT method, making it possible the simulation of more complex flows. The two-dimensional version of the EBIT method has been implemented in the free Basilisk platform, and validated with seven standard test cases: stagnation flow, translation with uniform velocity, single vortex, Zalesak's disk, capillary wave, Rayleigh-Taylor instability and rising bubble. The results are compared with those obtained with the Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method already implemented in Basilisk.</description>

      <title>Prediction of turbulent channel flow using Fourier neural operator-based machine-learning strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03051v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast and accurate predictions of turbulent flows are of great importance in the science and engineering field. In this paper, we investigate the implicit U-Net enhanced Fourier neural operator (IUFNO) in the stable prediction of long-time dynamics of three-dimensional (3D) turbulent channel flows. The trained IUFNO models are tested in the large-eddy simulations (LES) at coarse grids for three friction Reynolds numbers: $Re_{\tau}\approx180$, $395$ and $590$. The adopted near-wall mesh grids are tangibly coarser than the general requirements for wall-resolved LES. Compared to the original Fourier neural operator (FNO), the implicit FNO (IFNO) and U-Net enhanced FNO (UFNO), the IUFNO model has a much better long-term predictive ability. The numerical experiments show that the IUFNO framework outperforms the traditional dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM) and the wall-adapted local eddy-viscosity (WALE) model in the predictions of a variety of flow statistics and structures, including the mean and fluctuating velocities, the probability density functions (PDFs) and joint PDF of velocity fluctuations, the Reynolds stress profile, the kinetic energy spectrum, and the Q-criterion (vortex structures). Meanwhile, the trained IUFNO models are computationally much faster than the traditional LES models. Thus, the IUFNO model is a promising approach for the fast prediction of wall-bounded turbulent flow.</description>

      <title>An implicit DG solver for incompressible two-phase flows with an artificial compressibility formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04580v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an implicit Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization for incompressible two-phase flows using an artificial compressibility formulation. The conservative level set (CLS) method is employed in combination with a reinitialization procedure to capture the moving interface. A projection method based on the L-stable TR-BDF2 method is adopted for the time discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations and of the level set method. Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) is employed to enhance the resolution in correspondence of the interface between the two fluids. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown in a number of classical benchmarks. A specific analysis on the influence of different choices of the mixture viscosity is also carried out.</description>

      <title>Dissipative effects in odd viscous Stokes flow around a single sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09574v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Odd viscosity (OV) is a transport coefficient in, for example, fluids of self-spinning (active) particles or electrons in an external magnetic field. The key feature of OV is that it does not contribute to dissipation in two spatial dimensions. In contrast, we explicitly show that in the three-dimensional case, OV can contribute indirectly to dissipation by modifying the fluid flow. We quantify the dissipation rate of a single spherical particle moving through a fluid with OV via an exact analytical solution of the generalised stationary creeping flow equations. Our results provide a novel way to quantify the effects of OV by measuring the solid-body motion of a single spherical particle. Moreover, we explicitly demonstrate how complex fluids can be designed in terms of their rheological properties by mixing passive particles with self-spinning active particles.</description>

      <title>Dissociation of red blood cell aggregates in extensional flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blood rheology and microcirculation are strongly influenced by red blood cell aggregation. We investigate the dissociation rates of red cell aggregates in extensional flow using hyperbolic microfluidic constrictions and image analysis by a convolutional neural network (CNN). Our findings reveal that aggregate dissociation increases sharply when a critical extension rate is reached which falls within the range of microcirculatory conditions, suggesting that large variations of aggregate sizes should be expected in-vivo. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the behavior of red blood cell aggregates in response to extensional stress in microcirculatory networks, provides crucial experimental data to validate theoretical and numerical models, and constitutes the basis for improved evaluation of blood aggregability in clinical contexts.</description>
