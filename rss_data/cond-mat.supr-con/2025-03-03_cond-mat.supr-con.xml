      <title>Universal electronic structure of layered nickelates via oxygen-centered planar orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity has recently been demonstrated in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ up to 91K under moderate pressure in bulk crystals, and up to 48K at ambient pressure in thin films grown under compressive strain. Key questions remain open regarding the crystal structure and low-energy electronic states that support superconductivity in these compounds. Here we take advantage of the natural polymorphism between bilayer (2222) or alternating monolayer-trilayer (1313) stacking sequences that arises in bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ crystals to identify universal features in this family of materials. Employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) we observe the fingerprint of a spin-density wave (SDW) instability, strong and coherent enough to modify the electronic structure. We demonstrate that this feature is a `translated' $\beta$ Fermi surface associated with a scattering vector $Q_{t\beta}$ which matches the $Q_{SDW}$ detected by neutron and x-ray scattering experiments. This observation provides an important link between surface and bulk probes, and demonstrates a universal connection between magnetism and fermiology in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ as well as La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. We simulate the spectral weight distribution observed in our ARPES dichroism experiments and establish that the low-energy electronic phenomenology is dominated by oxygen-centered planar orbitals, which -- upon moving along the Fermi surface away from the Ni-O-Ni bond directions -- evolve from the $d_{3x^2-r^2}$ and $d_{3y^2-r^2}$ symmetry characteristic of 3-spin polarons to the familiar $d_{x^2-y^2}$ Zhang-Rice singlets that support high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Despite the multiorbital nature of the nickelates, our work establishes an empirical correspondence between the low-energy electronic structure of cuprates and nickelates, thus suggesting a common origin for their unconventional superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Broken Kondo Screening and Zero-Energy Mode in the Kagome Superconductor CsV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum states of matter reorganize themselves in response to defects, giving rise to emergent local excitations that imprint unique characteristics of the host states. While magnetic impurities are known to generate Kondo screening in a Fermi liquid and Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states in a conventional superconductor, it remains unclear whether they can evoke distinct phenomena in the kagome superconductor AV3Sb5 (where A is K, Rb or Cs), which may host an orbital-antiferromagnetic charge density wave (CDW) state and an unconventional superconducting state driven by the convergence of topology, geometric frustration and electron correlations. In this work, we visualize the local density of states induced near various types of impurities in both the CDW and superconducting phases of CsV3-xMxSb5 (M = Ta, Cr) using scanning tunneling microscopy. We observe Kondo resonance states near magnetic Cr dopants. Notably, unlike in any known metal or CDW compound, the spatial pattern of Kondo screening breaks all in-plane mirror symmetries of the kagome lattice, suggesting an electronic chirality due to putative orbital loop currents. While Cooper pairs show relative insensitivity to nonmagnetic impurities, native V vacancies with weak magnetic moments induce a pronounced zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP). This ZBCP coexists with trivial YSR states within the superconducting gap and does not split in energy with increasing tunneling transmission, tending instead to saturate. This behavior is reminiscent of signature of Majorana zero modes, which could be trapped by a sign-change boundary in the superconducting order parameter near a V vacancy, consistent with a surface topological superconducting state. Our findings provide a new approach to exploring novel quantum states on kagome lattices.</description>

      <title>Spatially anisotropic Kondo resonance intertwined with superconducting gap in kagome metal CsV3-xCrxSb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The newly-discovered chromium-based kagome metal CsCr3Sb5 has garnered significant interest due to its strong electron correlations, intertwined orders and potential for unconventional superconductivity under high pressure. However, the nature of superconducting and magnetic interactions during the transition from the parent compound CsV3Sb5 to CsCr3Sb5 remains elusive. Here, we report the discovery of spatially anisotropic Kondo resonance which intertwines with the superconducting gap, facilitated by the introduction of magnetic Cr impurities into the kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. In addition to the gradual suppression of long-ranged charge-density-wave orders, dilute Cr dopants induce local magnetic moments, giving rise to the emergence of Kondo resonances. In addition, the Kondo resonance forms spatially anisotropic ripple-like structures around the Cr dopants, breaking all local mirror symmetries. This anisotropy arises from the antiferromagnetic coupling between itinerant electrons and the Cr-induced spin-up electrons. Remarkably, as the Kondo screening develops, the coherence peak and depth of superconducting gap with finite zero-energy conductance significantly enhances. It indicates that non-superconducting pairs at the Fermi surface in the parent compound participate in the Kondo effect, effectively screening the magnetic moments of Cr dopants while simultaneously enhancing the superfluid density. Our findings pave a unique pathway for exploring the interplay between superconductivity and local magnetic moments in kagome systems.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and pair density waves from nearest-neighbor interactions in frustrated lattice geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider superconductivity and pair density waves (PDWs) arising from off-site pairing in frustrated lattice geometries. We express the pair susceptibility in a generic form that highlights the importance of both the density of states, and the quantum geometry of the eigenstates and calculate the superfluid weight (stiffness) as well as the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) temperature. Paradigmatic bipartite (Lieb) and non-bipartite (kagome) lattices are studied as examples. For bipartite lattices, nearest-neighbor pairing vanishes in a flat band. In the Lieb lattice flat band, we find a PDW at a finite interaction and show that its pair wave vector is determined by the quantum geometry of the band. In the kagome flat band, nearest-neighbor pairing is possible for infinitesimal interactions. At the kagome van Hove singularity, the pair susceptibility predicts a PDW due to sublattice interference, however, we find that its stiffness is zero due to the shape of the Fermi surface. Our results indicate that nearest-neighbor pairing at flat band and van Hove singularities is strongly influenced by the geometric properties of the eigenfunctions, and it is crucial to determine the superfluid weight of the superconducting and PDW orders as it may contradict the predictions by pairing susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Noise-to-current ratio divergence as a fingerprint of dispersing Majorana edge modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The definitive detection of Majorana modes in topological superconductors is a key issue in condensed matter physics. Here we propose a smoking-gun experiment for the detection of one-dimensional dispersing Majorana edge modes, based on theoretical results for multi-terminal transport in a setup consisting of two normal metal leads and a topological superconductor. In the proposed device, the unpaired nature of the Majorana edge modes inherently leads to the absence of the charge current in the linear response regime, while the current fluctuation remains significant. Therefore, the divergence in the noise-to-current ratio serves as unambiguous evidence for the presence of the dispersing Majorana edge modes. We reach this conclusion analytically, without relying on any specific model of topological superconductors. In addition, using tight-binding models of topological-insulator-based topological superconductors, we numerically verify the predicted divergent noise-to-current ratio. We also discuss the application of our proposal to the CoSi$_2$/TiSi$_2$ heterostructure and the iron-based superconductor FeTe$_{1-x}$Se$_x$.</description>

      <title>The $s\pm$ pairing symmetry in the pressured La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ from electron-phonon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently discovered bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ exhibits superconductivity with a remarkable transition temperature $T_c\approx 80 $ K under applied pressures above 14.0 GPa. This discovery of new family of high-temperature superconductors has garnered significant attention in the condensed matter physics community. In this work, we assume the this high-temperature superconductor is mediated by phonons and investigate the pairing symmetry in two distinct models: (i) the full-coupling case, where the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals are treated equally in both interlayer and intralayer coupling interactions, and (ii) the half-coupling case, where the intralayer coupling involves only the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, while the interlayer coupling is restricted to the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital. Our calculations reveal that the interlayer coupling favors an $s\pm$-wave superconducting state, whereas the intralayer coupling promotes an $s++$-wave symmetry. Additionally, we discuss the implications of pair-hopping interactions on the superconducting properties. These findings provide valuable insights into the pairing mechanisms and symmetry of this newly discovered high-temperature superconductor.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and characterizations of arsenic doped FeSe bulks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FeSe(11) family has a simple crystal structure belonging to iron-based superconductors (FBS) and has many stable phases including hexagonal and tetragonal structures, but only the tetragonal phase exhibits the superconductivity. In this study, we have investigated the effects of chemical pressure induced by As-doping at Se-sites in the FeSe system by preparing a series of FeSe1-xAsx (x = 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2) bulks. A broad characterization has been performed on these samples using structural, microstructural, transport, and magnetic measurements. The obtained lattice parameters are increased by As-doping, which suggests the successful insertion of As at Se-sites into the tetragonal lattice for low doping contents up to 5%, whereas the higher As-substitution appears in the form of the FeAs impurity phase. The temperature dependence of the resistivity of all samples has similar behaviour and depicts the highest onset transition temperature of around 11.5 K, but the zero resistivity is not reached until the measured temperature of 7 K, which could be due to the presence of the impurity phases. Our study suggests that a dopant with a large ionic radius, i.e., Arsenic, promotes the formation of the hexagonal phase of the 11 family and is effective for a small amount of doping level for the superconducting properties, whereas higher As-doping levels reduce the superconducting properties.</description>

      <title>Melting Points and Formation Free Energies of Carbon Compounds with Sodalite Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the melting temperatures $T_{\rm m}$ and formation free energy of carbon compounds with sodalite structures, $X$C$ _6$, $X$C$ _{10}$, and $X$C$ _{12}$, where $X$ is F, Na, Cl, and so on. These compounds are expected to be phonon-mediated superconductors exhibiting high transition temperatures $T_{\rm c}$ of up to about 100 K. We estimate $T_{\rm m}$ as a function of pressure $P$ by using the first-principles molecular dynamics method and show the results as phase diagrams on the $P$-$T$ plane together with the results of $T_{\rm c}$. It indicates that the $T_{\rm m}$ of NaC$_{\rm 6}$, which has a $T_{\rm c}$ up to about 100 K, is about $1300$ K or more at $P=30$ GPa. Furthermore, the $T_{\rm m}$ of FC$_{\rm 6}$ is about 2200 K even at $P=0$ GPa, where its $T_{\rm c}$ is about 80 K. Similar results are obtained for FC$_{\rm 10}$ and ClC$_{\rm 10}$ systems. These results suggest that some compounds can stably exist as high-temperature superconductors even at room temperature and pressure. To examine the feasibility of synthesizing these compounds, we estimate the formation enthalpies and formation free energies. These results suggest that NaC$_6$ could be formed under a sufficiently high pressure of about 300 GPa and a high temperature of about 6500 K.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the origin of Kondo-like behavior in the 3$d$-electron heavy-fermion compound YFe$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The heavy fermion (HF) state of $d$-electron systems is of great current interest since it exhibits various exotic phases and phenomena that are reminiscent of the Kondo effect in $f$-electron HF systems. Here, we present a combined infrared spectroscopy and first-principles band structure calculation study of the $3d$-electron HF compound YFe$_2$Ge$_2$. The infrared response exhibits several charge-dynamical hallmarks of HF and a corresponding scaling behavior that resemble those of the $f$-electron HF systems. In particular, the low-temperature spectra reveal a dramatic narrowing of the Drude response along with the appearance of a hybridization gap ($\Delta \sim$ 50 meV) and a strongly enhanced quasiparticle effective mass. Moreover, the temperature dependence of the infrared response indicates a crossover around $T^{\ast} \sim$ 100 K from a coherent state at low temperature to a quasi-incoherent one at high temperature. Despite of these striking similarities, our band structure calculations suggest that the mechanism underlying the HF behavior in YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ is distinct from the Kondo scenario of the $f$-electron HF compounds and even from that of the $d$-electron iron-arsenide superconductor KFe$_2$As$_2$. For the latter, the HF state is driven by orbital-selective correlations due to a strong Hund's coupling. Instead, for YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ the HF behavior originates from the band flatness near the Fermi level induced by the combined effects of kinetic frustration from a destructive interference between the direct Fe-Fe and indirect Fe-Ge-Fe hoppings, band hybridization involving Fe $3d$ and Y $4d$ electrons, and electron correlations. This highlights that rather different mechanisms can be at the heart of the HF state in $d$-electron systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin and integer quantum Hall effects are two cousins of topological phase transitions in two-dimensional electronic systems. Their close relationship makes it possible to transform spin to integer quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional topological superconductors by continuous increase in a symmetry breaking Zeeman magnetic field. We study peculiarities of bulk-edge correspondence and a fate of massless edge and bulk topological (instantons) excitations at such the crossover.</description>

      <title>Global Phase Diagram of D-wave Superconductivity in the Square-Lattice $t\text{-}J$ Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15092v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hubbard and closely related $t\text-J$ models are exciting platforms for unconventional superconductivity (SC). Through state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculations using the grand canonical ensemble, we address open issues regarding the ground-state phase diagram of the extended $t\text{-}J$ model on a square lattice in the parameter regime relevant to cuprate superconductors. On large 8-leg cylinders, we demonstrate that the pure $t\text{-}J$ model with only nearest-neighbor hoppings and superexchange interactions, for a wide range of doping ($\delta=0.1-0.2$), hosts robust d-wave superconductivity possibly coexisting with weak unidirectional pair density wave. Furthermore, a small next nearest neighbor hopping $t_2$ suppresses pair and charge density waves, resulting in a uniform d-wave SC phase in both electron- and hole-doped cuprate model systems. Our work validates the $t\text-J$ model as a proper minimum model for the emergence of superconductivity in cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Vortex lattices and critical fields in anisotropic superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A method is developed to compute minimal energy vortex lattices in a general Ginzburg-Landau model of a superconductor subjected to an applied magnetic field. The model may have any number of components and may be spatially anisotropic. The novelty of this method is that it makes no assumptions about the orientation of the vortex lines or the period vectors of the lattice's unit cell: these are all determined dynamically. Methods to compute the first and second critical magnetic fields, $H_{c_1}$ and $H_{c_2}$, in this class of models are also developed.
  These methods are applied to a simple anisotropic single-component model, and to an anisotropic two-component model of strong current theoretical interest (a so-called $s+id$ model). It is found, in both cases, that at low applied field the vortex lines can tilt very significantly away from the direction of the applied field (by as much as $40^\circ$ for the single-component and $30^\circ$ for the $s+id$ model). The optimal lattice in the $s+id$ model is qualitatively very different from the conventional triangular Abrikosov lattice, exhibiting a phase transition from a system of Skyrmion chains when the external field is orthogonal to the basal plane to a deformed Abrikosov lattice when applied in the basal plane.</description>

Abstract: Characterizing the low-energy dynamics of quantum materials is crucial to our understanding of strongly correlated electronic states. Yet, it remains experimentally challenging to investigate such dynamics with high spectroscopic resolution in both frequency and momentum space, particularly in two-dimensional correlated systems. Here, we leverage Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a powerful and non-invasive tool to study thin-film Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (BSCCO), revealing several distinct dynamical phenomena across the superconducting phase diagram. At zero magnetic field and low temperatures, NV depolarization ($T_1$) noise spectroscopy captures the low-frequency (GHz-scale) magnetic noise generated by nodal superconducting quasiparticle excitations, in agreement with Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) mean-field theory. Near the critical temperature $T_c \approx 90$ K, supercurrent-fluctuation-induced noise leads to a sharp reduction of the NV $T_1$. By carefully analyzing the temperature-scaling of $T_1$, we observe clear deviations from the BCS prediction, reflecting the importance of order parameter fluctuations and enabling the determination of both static and dynamical critical exponents. When a small field is applied, we detect a broad and asymmetric reduction of NV $T_1$ near $T_c$; the field-induced smearing of the transition unveils the presence of a vortex liquid phase. Finally, NV decoherence ($T_2$) noise spectroscopy allows us to characterize magnetic noise at even lower MHz-scale frequencies and obtain evidence for complex vortex-solid fluctuations well below $T_c$. Our results establish quantum noise spectroscopy as a versatile platform for probing dynamical phenomena in superconductors, with frequency and length scales complementary to existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Engineering flux-controlled flat bands and topological states in a Stagome lattice</title>

Abstract: We present the Stagome lattice, a variant of the Kagome lattice, where one can make any of the bands completely flat by tuning an externally controllable magnetic flux. This systematically allows the energy of the flat band to coincide with the Fermi level. We have analytically calculated the compact localized states associated to each of these flat bands appearing at different values of the magnetic flux. We also show that, this model features nontrivial topological properties with distinct integer values of the Chern numbers as a function of the magnetic flux. We argue that this mechanism for making any of the bands exactly flat could be of interest to address the flat-band superconductivity in such a system. Additionally, we show that our results are robust even in the presence of a small amount of disorder. Furthermore, we believe that the phenomenon of photonic flat band localization could be studied in the Stagome lattice structure, designed for instance using femtosecond laser induced single-mode waveguide arrays.</description>

      <title>Diabatic error and propagation of Majorana zero modes in interacting quantum dots systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06288</link>

Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental progress in realizing Majorana zero modes (MZMs) using quantum dot systems, we investigate the diabatic errors associated with the movement of those MZMs. The movement is achieved by tuning time-dependent gate potentials applied to individual quantum dots, effectively creating a moving potential wall. To probe the optimized movement of MZMs, we calculate the experimentally accessible local density-of-states and time-dependent fidelity using many-body time-dependent numerical methods. Our analysis reveals that an optimal potential wall height is crucial to preserve the well-localized nature of the MZM during its movement. Moreover, for the first time, we analyze diabatic errors in realistic quantum-dot systems, incorporating the effects of repulsive Coulomb interactions and disorder in both hopping and pairing terms. Additionally, we provide a comparative study of diabatic errors arising from the simultaneous versus sequential tuning of multiple gates during the MZMs movement. Finally, we estimate the time scale required for MZM transfer in a six-quantum-dot system, demonstrating that MZM movement is feasible and can be completed well within the qubit's operational lifetime in practical quantum-dot setups.</description>
