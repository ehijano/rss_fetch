      <title>Evolution of Voices in French Audiovisual Media Across Genders and Age in a Diachronic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a diachronic acoustic analysis of the voice of 1023 speakers from French media archives. The speakers are spread across 32 categories based on four periods (years 1955/56, 1975/76, 1995/96, 2015/16), four age groups (20-35; 36-50; 51-65, &gt;65), and two genders. The fundamental frequency ($F_0$) and the first four formants (F1-4) were estimated. Procedures used to ensure the quality of these estimations on heterogeneous data are described. From each speaker's $F_0$ distribution, the base-$F_0$ value was calculated to estimate the register. Average vocal tract length was estimated from formant frequencies. Base-$F_0$ and vocal tract length were fit by linear mixed models to evaluate how they may have changed across time periods and genders, corrected for age effects. Results show an effect of the period with a tendency to lower voices, independently of gender. A lowering of pitch is observed with age for female but not male speakers.</description>

      <title>Developing Acoustic Models for Automatic Speech Recognition in Swedish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with automatic continuous speech recognition using trainable systems. The aim of this work is to build acoustic models for spoken Swedish. This is done employing hidden Markov models and using the SpeechDat database to train their parameters. Acoustic modeling has been worked out at a phonetic level, allowing general speech recognition applications, even though a simplified task (digits and natural number recognition) has been considered for model evaluation. Different kinds of phone models have been tested, including context independent models and two variations of context dependent models. Furthermore many experiments have been done with bigram language models to tune some of the system parameters. System performance over various speaker subsets with different sex, age and dialect has also been examined. Results are compared to previous similar studies showing a remarkable improvement.</description>

      <title>ActiveRIR: Active Audio-Visual Exploration for Acoustic Environment Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An environment acoustic model represents how sound is transformed by the physical characteristics of an indoor environment, for any given source/receiver location. Traditional methods for constructing acoustic models involve expensive and time-consuming collection of large quantities of acoustic data at dense spatial locations in the space, or rely on privileged knowledge of scene geometry to intelligently select acoustic data sampling locations. We propose active acoustic sampling, a new task for efficiently building an environment acoustic model of an unmapped environment in which a mobile agent equipped with visual and acoustic sensors jointly constructs the environment acoustic model and the occupancy map on-the-fly. We introduce ActiveRIR, a reinforcement learning (RL) policy that leverages information from audio-visual sensor streams to guide agent navigation and determine optimal acoustic data sampling positions, yielding a high quality acoustic model of the environment from a minimal set of acoustic samples. We train our policy with a novel RL reward based on information gain in the environment acoustic model. Evaluating on diverse unseen indoor environments from a state-of-the-art acoustic simulation platform, ActiveRIR outperforms an array of methods--both traditional navigation agents based on spatial novelty and visual exploration as well as existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>An Experiment with Electric Guitar Signals for Exploring the Virtuosity based on the Entropy of Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the concept of virtuosity as a collective attribute in music and its relationship with the entropy based on an experiment that compares two sets of digital signals played by composer-performer electric guitarists. Based on an interdisciplinary approach related to the complex systems, we computed the spectrum of signals, identified statistical distributions that best describe them, and measured the Shannon entropy to establish their diversity. Findings suggested that virtuosity might be related to a range of entropy values that identify levels of diversity of the frequency components of audio signals. Despite the presence of different values of entropy in the two sets of signals, they are statistically similar. Therefore, entropy values can be interpreted as levels of virtuosity in music.</description>

      <title>Semantically consistent Video-to-Audio Generation using Multimodal Language Large Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing works have made strides in video generation, but the lack of sound effects (SFX) and background music (BGM) hinders a complete and immersive viewer experience. We introduce a novel semantically consistent v ideo-to-audio generation framework, namely SVA, which automatically generates audio semantically consistent with the given video content. The framework harnesses the power of multimodal large language model (MLLM) to understand video semantics from a key frame and generate creative audio schemes, which are then utilized as prompts for text-to-audio models, resulting in video-to-audio generation with natural language as an interface. We show the satisfactory performance of SVA through case study and discuss the limitations along with the future research direction.

      <title>U2++ MoE: Scaling 4.7x parameters with minimal impact on RTF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scale has opened new frontiers in natural language processing, but at a high cost. In response, by learning to only activate a subset of parameters in training and inference, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) have been proposed as an energy efficient path to even larger and more capable language models and this shift towards a new generation of foundation models is gaining momentum, particularly within the field of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Recent works that incorporating MoE into ASR models have complex designs such as routing frames via supplementary embedding network, improving multilingual ability for the experts, and utilizing dedicated auxiliary losses for either expert load balancing or specific language handling. We found that delicate designs are not necessary, while an embarrassingly simple substitution of MoE layers for all Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers is competent for the ASR task. To be more specific, we benchmark our proposed model on a large scale inner-source dataset (160k hours), the results show that we can scale our baseline Conformer (Dense-225M) to its MoE counterparts (MoE-1B) and achieve Dense-1B level Word Error Rate (WER) while maintaining a Dense-225M level Real Time Factor (RTF). Furthermore, by applying Unified 2-pass framework with bidirectional attention decoders (U2++), we achieve the streaming and non-streaming decoding modes in a single MoE based model, which we call U2++ MoE. We hope that our study can facilitate the research on scaling speech foundation models without sacrificing deployment efficiency.</description>

      <title>Leveraging tropical reef, bird and unrelated sounds for superior transfer learning in marine bioacoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has the potential to revolutionize passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) for ecological assessments. However, high annotation and compute costs limit the field's efficacy. Generalizable pretrained networks can overcome these costs, but high-quality pretraining requires vast annotated libraries, limiting its current applicability primarily to bird taxa. Here, we identify the optimum pretraining strategy for a data-deficient domain using coral reef bioacoustics. We assemble ReefSet, a large annotated library of reef sounds, though modest compared to bird libraries at 2% of the sample count. Through testing few-shot transfer learning performance, we observe that pretraining on bird audio provides notably superior generalizability compared to pretraining on ReefSet or unrelated audio alone. However, our key findings show that cross-domain mixing which leverages bird, reef and unrelated audio during pretraining maximizes reef generalizability. SurfPerch, our pretrained network, provides a strong foundation for automated analysis of marine PAM data with minimal annotation and compute costs.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents the multi-speaker multi-lingual few-shot voice cloning system developed by THU-HCSI team for LIMMITS'24 Challenge. To achieve high speaker similarity and naturalness in both mono-lingual and cross-lingual scenarios, we build the system upon YourTTS and add several enhancements. For further improving speaker similarity and speech quality, we introduce speaker-aware text encoder and flow-based decoder with Transformer blocks. In addition, we denoise the few-shot data, mix up them with pre-training data, and adopt a speaker-balanced sampling strategy to guarantee effective fine-tuning for target speakers. The official evaluations in track 1 show that our system achieves the best speaker similarity MOS of 4.25 and obtains considerable naturalness MOS of 3.97.</description>

      <title>Automatic Speech Recognition System-Independent Word Error Rate Estimatio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Word error rate (WER) is a metric used to evaluate the quality of transcriptions produced by Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. In many applications, it is of interest to estimate WER given a pair of a speech utterance and a transcript. Previous work on WER estimation focused on building models that are trained with a specific ASR system in mind (referred to as ASR system-dependent). These are also domain-dependent and inflexible in real-world applications. In this paper, a hypothesis generation method for ASR System-Independent WER estimation (SIWE) is proposed. In contrast to prior work, the WER estimators are trained using data that simulates ASR system output. Hypotheses are generated using phonetically similar or linguistically more likely alternative words. In WER estimation experiments, the proposed method reaches a similar performance to ASR system-dependent WER estimators on in-domain data and achieves state-of-the-art performance on out-of-domain data. On the out-of-domain data, the SIWE model outperformed the baseline estimators in root mean square error and Pearson correlation coefficient by relative 17.58% and 18.21%, respectively, on Switchboard and CALLHOME. The performance was further improved when the WER of the training set was close to the WER of the evaluation dataset.</description>

      <title>Boosting Multi-Speaker Expressive Speech Synthesis with Semi-supervised Contrastive Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to build a multi-speaker expressive TTS system, synthesizing a target speaker's speech with multiple styles and emotions. To this end, we propose a novel contrastive learning-based TTS approach to transfer style and emotion across speakers. Specifically, contrastive learning from different levels, i.e. utterance and category level, is leveraged to extract the disentangled style, emotion, and speaker representations from speech for style and emotion transfer. Furthermore, a semi-supervised training strategy is introduced to improve the data utilization efficiency by involving multi-domain data, including style-labeled data, emotion-labeled data, and abundant unlabeled data. To achieve expressive speech with diverse styles and emotions for a target speaker, the learned disentangled representations are integrated into an improved VITS model. Experiments on multi-domain data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Power of Pure Attention Mechanisms in Blind Room Parameter Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic parameterization of acoustic environments has drawn widespread attention in the field of audio processing. Precise representation of local room acoustic characteristics is crucial when designing audio filters for various audio rendering applications. Key parameters in this context include reverberation time (RT60) and geometric room volume. In recent years, neural networks have been extensively applied in the task of blind room parameter estimation. However, there remains a question of whether pure attention mechanisms can achieve superior performance in this task. To address this issue, this study employs blind room parameter estimation based on monaural noisy speech signals. Various model architectures are investigated, including a proposed attention-based model. This model is a convolution-free Audio Spectrogram Transformer, utilizing patch splitting, attention mechanisms, and cross-modality transfer learning from a pretrained Vision Transformer. Experimental results suggest that the proposed attention mechanism-based model, relying purely on attention mechanisms without using convolution, exhibits significantly improved performance across various room parameter estimation tasks, especially with the help of dedicated pretraining and data augmentation schemes. Additionally, the model demonstrates more advantageous adaptability and robustness when handling variable-length audio inputs compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Robust Semantic Communications for Speech Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a robust semantic communication system for speech transmission, named Ross-S2T, by delivering the essential semantic information. Particularly, we consider the speech-to-text translation (S2TT) as the transmission goal. First, a deep semantic encoder is developed to directly convert speech in the source language to textual features associated with the target language, facilitating the end-to-end (E2E) semantic exchange to perform the S2TT task and reducing the transmission data without performance degradation. To mitigate semantic impairments inherent in the corrupted speech, a novel generative adversarial network (GAN)-enabled deep semantic compensator is established to estimate the lost semantic information within the speech and extract deep semantic features simultaneously, which enables robust semantic transmission for corrupted speech. Furthermore, a semantic probe-aided compensator is devised to enhance the semantic fidelity of recovered semantic features and improve the understandability of the target text. According to simulation results, the proposed Ross-S2T exhibits superior S2TT performance compared to conventional approaches and high robustness against semantic impairments.</description>

      <title>FlashSpeech: Efficient Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale zero-shot speech synthesis has been significantly advanced by language models and diffusion models. However, the generation process of both methods is slow and computationally intensive. Efficient speech synthesis using a lower computing budget to achieve quality on par with previous work remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present FlashSpeech, a large-scale zero-shot speech synthesis system with approximately 5\% of the inference time compared with previous work. FlashSpeech is built on the latent consistency model and applies a novel adversarial consistency training approach that can train from scratch without the need for a pre-trained diffusion model as the teacher. Furthermore, a new prosody generator module enhances the diversity of prosody, making the rhythm of the speech sound more natural. The generation processes of FlashSpeech can be achieved efficiently with one or two sampling steps while maintaining high audio quality and high similarity to the audio prompt for zero-shot speech generation. Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of FlashSpeech. Notably, FlashSpeech can be about 20 times faster than other zero-shot speech synthesis systems while maintaining comparable performance in terms of voice quality and similarity. Furthermore, FlashSpeech demonstrates its versatility by efficiently performing tasks like voice conversion, speech editing, and diverse speech sampling. Audio samples can be found in https://flashspeech.github.io/.</description>

      <title>LuViRA Dataset Validation and Discussion: Comparing Vision, Radio, and Audio Sensors for Indoor Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unique comparative analysis, and evaluation of vision, radio, and audio based localization algorithms. We create the first baseline for the aforementioned sensors using the recently published Lund University Vision, Radio, and Audio (LuViRA) dataset, where all the sensors are synchronized and measured in the same environment. Some of the challenges of using each specific sensor for indoor localization tasks are highlighted. Each sensor is paired with a current state-of-the-art localization algorithm and evaluated for different aspects: localization accuracy, reliability and sensitivity to environment changes, calibration requirements, and potential system complexity. Specifically, the evaluation covers the ORB-SLAM3 algorithm for vision-based localization with an RGB-D camera, a machine-learning algorithm for radio-based localization with massive MIMO technology, and the SFS2 algorithm for audio-based localization with distributed microphones. The results can serve as a guideline and basis for further development of robust and high-precision multi-sensory localization systems, e.g., through sensor fusion, context, and environment-aware adaptation.</description>

      <title>STaR: Distilling Speech Temporal Relation for Lightweight Speech Self-Supervised Learning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Albeit great performance of Transformer-based speech selfsupervised learning (SSL) models, their large parameter size and computational cost make them unfavorable to utilize. In this study, we propose to compress the speech SSL models by distilling speech temporal relation (STaR). Unlike previous works that directly match the representation for each speech frame, STaR distillation transfers temporal relation between speech frames, which is more suitable for lightweight student with limited capacity. We explore three STaR distillation objectives and select the best combination as the final STaR loss. Our model distilled from HuBERT BASE achieves an overall score of 79.8 on SUPERB benchmark, the best performance among models with up to 27 million parameters. We show that our method is applicable across different speech SSL models and maintains robust performance with further reduced parameters.</description>
