      <title>A Review of Graph Neural Networks in Epidemic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a growing interest in studying epidemiological models. Traditional mechanistic models mathematically describe the transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases. However, they often fall short when confronted with the growing challenges of today. Consequently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a progressively popular tool in epidemic research. In this paper, we endeavor to furnish a comprehensive review of GNNs in epidemic tasks and highlight potential future directions. To accomplish this objective, we introduce hierarchical taxonomies for both epidemic tasks and methodologies, offering a trajectory of development within this domain. For epidemic tasks, we establish a taxonomy akin to those typically employed within the epidemic domain. For methodology, we categorize existing work into \textit{Neural Models} and \textit{Hybrid Models}. Following this, we perform an exhaustive and systematic examination of the methodologies, encompassing both the tasks and their technical details. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of existing methods from diverse perspectives and systematically propose future research directions. This survey aims to bridge literature gaps and promote the progression of this promising field. We hope that it will facilitate synergies between the communities of GNNs and epidemiology, and contribute to their collective progress.</description>

      <title>Anomaly zones for uniformly sampled gene trees under the gene duplication and loss model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01663v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, there has been interest in extending long-known results about the multispecies coalescent tree to other models of gene trees. Results about the gene duplication and loss (GDL) tree have mathematical proofs, including species tree identifiability, estimability, and sample complexity of popular algorithms like ASTRAL. Here, this work is continued by characterizing the anomaly zones of uniformly sampled gene trees. The anomaly zone for species trees is the set of parameters where some discordant gene tree occurs with the maximal probability. The detection of anomalous gene trees is an important problem in phylogenomics, as their presence renders effective estimation methods to being positively misleading. Under the multispecies coalescent, anomaly zones are known to exist for rooted species trees with as few as four species.
  The gene duplication and loss process is a generalization of the generalized linear-birth death process to the rooted species tree, where each edge is treated as a single timeline with exponential-rate duplication and loss. The methods and results come from a detailed probabilistic analysis of trajectories observed from this stochastic process. It is shown that anomaly zones do not exist for rooted GDL balanced trees on four species, but do exist for rooted caterpillar trees, as with the multispecies coalescent.</description>

      <title>Pursuing equitable access to vaccines for the next epidemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To mitigate the pandemic stemming from COVID-19, numerous nations have initiated extensive vaccination campaigns for their citizens since late 2020. While affluent countries have predominantly received vaccine allocations, fewer doses have been dispatched to nations with lower average incomes. This unequal distribution not only widens the disparity between wealthy and impoverished regions but also prolongs the pandemic, evident in the emergence of new viral variants. Our research delves into the correlation between the duration of the pandemic and the timing of vaccine distribution between two countries with migratory ties. By using a pair of coupled Susceptible- Infected-Recovered-Deceased (SIRD) models incorporating vaccination data, we demonstrate that timely sharing of vaccines benefits both nations, regardless of the presence of viral variants. This underscores that in the realm of vaccine distribution, self-interest and altruism are not mutually exclusive.</description>
