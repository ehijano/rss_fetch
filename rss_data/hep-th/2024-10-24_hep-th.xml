      <title>Holography of Information in a Ball of Finite Radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The principle of holography of information states that all information available in the bulk of asymptotically flat spacetime is also available near its boundary at spatial infinity. However, physical observers never have access to spatial infinity. Therefore, we ask the question: ``Is information contained in a ball of finite radius also holographic in nature?". Phrased differently, we ask whether correlation functions on the boundary of the ball capture all the information of all correlators in the bulk of the ball. In this work, we answer this question in the affirmative within the confines of linearised quantum gravity for generic low-energy (free Klein-Gordon) states in flat space created by the action of unitaries on the vacuum to leading order in a certain perturbative parameter. For an infinite sub-class of these states, our results are perturbatively exact and valid to all orders in this same parameter. Unlike at infinity, massive and massless fields can be captured within the same framework.</description>

      <title>Integrated correlators with a Wilson line in a $\mathcal{N}=2$ quiver gauge theory at strong coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ quiver gauge theory arising from a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills with gauge group $SU(2N)$. We study the integrated correlator between a half-BPS Wilson line and two Higgs branch operators of conformal dimension 2. Using supersymmetric localization, we resum the perturbative series for this observable and obtain exact expressions for both the planar and next-to-planar terms of its large $N$ expansion, valid for arbitrary values of the 't Hooft coupling. Finally, through a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we determine the leading terms of the corresponding strong-coupling expansions.</description>

      <title>Lorentz-violating Yukawa theory at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses Yukawa theory, focusing on the scattering between two identical fermions mediated by an intermediate scalar boson, considering the effects of thermal contributions and Lorentz symmetry breaking. Temperature is introduced into the theory through the TFD formalism, while Lorentz violation arises from a background tensor coupled to the kinetic part of the Klein-Gordon Lagrangian. Two important quantities are calculated: the cross-section for the scattering process and the modified Yukawa potential. The main results obtained in this work demonstrate that considering Lorentz symmetry breaking has several implications for changes in symmetries and physical states, while the presence of temperature is strongly related to the strength of the interaction. This interplay between symmetry breaking and temperature effects provides deeper insights into the behavior of the Yukawa theory under different conditions.</description>

      <title>Fermion Masses and Mixing in String-Inspired Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of supersymmetric Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) models with multiple $U(1)$ symmetries and Standard Model (SM) singlets inspired by heterotic string compactifications on Calabi-Yau threefolds. The string-theoretic origin imposes a particular charge pattern on the SM fields and FN singlets, dividing the latter into perturbative and non-perturbative types. Employing systematic and heuristic search strategies, such as genetic algorithms, we identify charge assignments and singlet VEVs that replicate the observed mass and mixing hierarchies in the quark sector, and subsequently refine the Yukawa matrix coefficients to accurately match the observed values for the Higgs VEV, the quark and charged lepton masses and the CKM matrix. This bottom-up approach complements top-down string constructions and our results demonstrate that string FN models possess a sufficiently rich structure to account for flavour physics. On the other hand, the limited number of distinct viable charge patterns identified here indicates that flavour physics imposes tight constraints on string theory models, adding new constraints on particle spectra that are essential for achieving a realistic phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Surface observables in gauge theories, modular Painlev\'e tau functions and non-perturbative topological strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study BPS surface observables of $\mathcal{N}=2$ four dimensional $SU(2)$ gauge theory in gravitational $\Omega$-background at perturbative and at Argyres-Douglas superconformal fixed points. This is done by formulating the equivariant gauge theory on the blow-up of $\mathbb{C}^2$ and considering the decoupling Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit. We show that in this limit the blow-up equations are solved by corresponding Painlev\'e $\mathcal{T}$-functions and exploit operator/state correspondence to compute their expansion in an integer basis, given in terms of the moduli of the quantum Seiberg-Witten curve. We study the modular properties of these solutions and show that they do directly lead to BCOV holomorphic anomaly equations for the corresponding topological string partition function. The resulting $\mathcal{T}$-functions are holomorphic and modular and as such they provide a natural non-perturbative completion of topological strings partition functions.</description>

      <title>Quantizable Ghost-ridden theories using Kinetic Positivity Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel way to constrain the ghost field with respect to other physical fields present in a given theory such that the theory becomes quantizable. This is achieved by imposing positivity of the total kinetic energy of the system and performing Lorentz transformations in the field space manifold to arrive at an effective Lagrangian containing only physical degrees of freedom. Since models containing ghost fields such as quintom models are relevant in the cosmological context, this method can help ensure that such theories don't violate unitarity and can be treated as realistic candidates without the need to completely eliminate ghost(s).</description>

      <title>Kinematic Flow for Cosmological Loop Integrands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, an interesting pattern was found in the differential equations satisfied by the Feynman integrals describing tree-level correlators of conformally coupled scalars in a power-law FRW cosmology [1,2]. It was proven that simple and universal graphical rules predict the equations for arbitrary graphs as a flow in kinematic space. In this note, we show that the same rules$\unicode{x2013}$with one small addition$\unicode{x2013}$also determine the differential equations for loop integrands. We explain that both the basis of master integrals and the singularities of the differential equations can be represented by tubings of marked graphs. An important novelty in the case of loops is that some basis functions can vanish, and we present a graphical rule to identify these vanishing functions. Taking this into account, we then demonstrate that the kinematic flow correctly predicts the differential equations for all loop integrands.</description>

      <title>Finite Integrals from Feynman Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a geometric approach to determining the complete set of numerators giving rise to finite Feynman integrals. Our approach proceeds graph by graph, and makes use of the Newton polytope associated to the integral's Symanzik polynomials. It relies on a theorem by Berkesch, Forsg{\aa}rd, and Passare on the convergence of Euler--Mellin integrals, which include Feynman integrals. We conjecture that a necessary in addition to a sufficient condition is that all parameter-space monomials lie in the interior of the polytope. We present an algorithm for finding all finite numerators based on this conjecture. In a variety of examples, we find agreement between the results obtained using the geometric approach, and a Landau-analysis approach developed by Gambuti, Tancredi, and two of the authors.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of perturbed (3, 10) minimal model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study RG flows between non-unitary minimal models and massive quantum theories using Truncated Conformal Space Approach (TCSA). We consider the integrable non-unitary Yang-Lee model perturbed by $i\phi$ and the $D$-series version of $M(3,10)$ which is a product of two Yang-Lee models, perturbing the latter by relevant operators $\phi_{1,3}$ and $i\phi^+_{1,5}$. Utilizing the quasi-primary fields we find, TCSA is performed up to the level $N=15$ for $M(2,5)+i\phi$. The conjecture about the $M(3,10)$ perturbed by $\phi_{1,3}$ is stated: this theory flows to a massive phase; its spectrum contains a kink and two breathers, whose masses we find. Our TCSA results support the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Duality defect in a deformed transverse-field Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical quantities with long lifetimes have both theoretical significance in the study of quantum many-body systems and practical implications for quantum technologies. In this manuscript, we investigate the roles played by topological defects in the construction of quasi-conserved quantities, using as a prototypical example the Kramers-Wannier duality defect in a deformed 1d quantum transverse field Ising model. We construct the duality defect Hamiltonian in three different ways: half-chain Kramers-Wannier transformation, utilization of techniques in the Ising fusion category, and defect-modified weak integrability breaking deformation. The third method is also applicable for the study of generic integrable defects under weak integrability breaking deformations. We also work out the deformation of defect-modified higher charges in the model and study their slower decay behavior. Furthermore, we consider the corresponding duality defect twisted deformed Floquet transverse field Ising model, and investigate the stability of the isolated zero mode associated with the duality defect in the integrable Floquet Ising model, under such weak integrability breaking deformation.</description>

      <title>Linking Edge Modes and Geometrical Clocks in Linearized Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reference frames are crucial for describing local observers in general relativity. In quantum gravity, different proposals exist for how to treat reference frames. There are models with either classical or quantum reference frames. Recently, different choices appeared for investigating these possibilities at the level of the classical and quantum algebra of observables. One choice is based on the covariant phase space approach, using gravitational edge modes. In the canonical approach, there is another choice, relational clocks, built from matter or geometry itself. In this work, we extend existing results and show how to relate edge modes and geometrical clocks in linearized gravity. We proceed in three steps. First, we introduce an extension of the ADM (Arnowitt-Deser-Misner) phase space to account for covariant gauge fixing conditions and the explicit time dependence they add to Hamilton's equations. Second, we show how these gauge fixing conditions recover a specific choice of geometrical clocks in terms of Ashtekar-Barbero connection variables. Third, we study the effect of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter on the generators of asymptotic symmetries and the corresponding charges. This parameter, which disappears from metric gravity, affects the generators for angle-dependent asymptotic symmetries and the corresponding super-translation charges, while it has no effect on the global charges.</description>

      <title>Exploring Particle Production and Thermal-Like Behavior through Quantum Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown a potential correlation between the entanglement of initial state partons in elementary particle collisions, as conceptualized by contemporary quantum and particle theory, and the final state multiplicity distribution of hadrons produced in experiments like those at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It has been proposed that this relation between states can be demonstrated in a measurement of entropy. By showing equality between entanglement entropy in the initial state and thermodynamic entropy in the final state, we hope to demonstrate that not only is entanglement the driving mechanism behind matter generation, but also the thermal-like behavior seen in high energy particle collisions.</description>

      <title>Bound-state solutions for the charged Dirac oscillator in a rotating frame in the Bonnor-Melvin-Lambda spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we determine the relativistic bound-state solutions for the charged (DO) Dirac oscillator in a rotating frame in the Bonnor-Melvin-Lambda spacetime in $(2+1)$-dimensions, where such solutions are given by the two-component Dirac spinor and by the relativistic energy spectrum. In this way, we work with the curved DO with minimal coupling in polar coordinates, where we use the tetrad formalism. To analytically solve our problem, we consider two approximations, where the first is that the cosmological constant is very small (conical approximation), and the second is that the linear velocity of the rotating frame is much less than the speed of light (slow rotation regime). So, after solving a second-order differential equation, we obtain a generalized Laguerre equation, whose solutions are the generalized Laguerre polynomials. Consequently, we obtain the energy spectrum, which is quantized in terms of the radial and total magnetic quantum numbers $n$ and $m_j$, and explicitly depends on the angular frequency $\omega$ (describes the DO), cyclotron frequency $\omega_c$ (describes the external magnetic field), angular velocity $\Omega$ (describes the rotating frame), spin parameter $s$ (describes the ``spin''), spinorial parameter $u$ (describes the components of the spinor), effective rest mass $m_{eff}$ (describes the rest mass modified by the spin-rotation coupling), and on a real parameter $\sigma$ and cosmological constant $\Lambda$ (describes the Bonnor-Melvin-Lambda spacetime). In particular, we note that this spectrum is asymmetrical (due to the presence of $\Omega$) and has its degeneracy broken (due to the presence of $\sigma$ and $\Lambda$) for $m_js&lt;0$. Besides, we also graphically analyze the behavior of the spectrum and of the probability density as a function of the parameters of the system for different values of $n$ and $m_j$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from burdened primordial black holes dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are the natural candidate of dark matter (DM) as they only interact gravitationally and can evade any experiments on earth. In the standard semiclassical calculation of Hawking radiation, PBHs with mass below $10^{15}\rm g$ evaporated by now and therefore cannot be DM. However, the recently-discovered quantum memory burden effect can significantly suppress the evaporation of PBHs after the half-decay time. This quantum effect could open up a new mass window below $10^{10} \rm g$ where PBHs can still exist today and be DM. In this paper, we compute the gravitational wave (GW) signals associated with the formation of PBHs in this new mass window. We consider two formation scenarios: PBHs formed from inflationary perturbation and PBHs formed from collapse of Fermi-balls in a first-order phase transition (FOPT). GWs produced from these two scenarios have distinct features and, while the GW from inflation peaks at high frequency, the GW from FOPT peaks at lower frequency that can be within the reach of future experiments.</description>

      <title>Light escape cones in the locally non-rotating reference frames of the Kerr-de Sitter superspinars and related superspinar shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The construction of local escape cones and their complementary cones, related to the locally non-rotating frames (LNRFs) orbiting superspinars with the external field described by the Kerr-de Sitter (KdS) naked singularity (NS) spacetimes, is described for all possible classes of the KdS NS spacetimes and all possible positions of the photon emitter. The notion of the local escape cones is then applied to construct the shadow of the KdS superspinars related to the distant static observers represented by the LNRFs located near the so-called static radius where the spacetime is close to the asymptotically flat region of the Kerr spacetimes. The shadow construction is focused on the KdS superpsinars limited by the cosmological and astrophysical restrictions on the spacetime parameters, namely the superspinar dimensionless spin and the dimensionless cosmological parameter relating the cosmological constant and the superspinar's mass.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a systematic perturbative expansion for the finite-volume energy spectrum of the non-linear $O(N)$ $\sigma$-model in the $\delta$-regime. The violation of the power-counting rules that emerges after the separation of the fast and slow modes is dealt with to all orders by use of the threshold expansion. The known result for the rest-frame energy spectrum up-to-and-including next-to-next-to-leading order is reproduced.</description>

      <title>Vortical effects and the critical end point in the Linear Sigma Model coupled to quark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the effects of vorticity on the QCD phase transition using the Linear Sigma Model coupled to quarks. By going beyond the mean-field approximation and incorporating screening effects via ring diagrams, we explore the chiral symmetry restoration in extreme conditions, such as high temperatures, high densities, and large angular velocities. Our analysis reveals how the critical temperature decreases as the angular velocity increases, suggesting that vorticity catalyzes the symmetry restoration. Additionally, we observe a shift in the Critical End Point (CEP) in the effective QCD phase diagram, where higher angular velocities move the CEP to lower quark chemical potentials and higher temperatures. Moreover, we analyze the baryon number fluctuations through the normalized fourth moment $\kappa \sigma^2 = c_4/c_2$ as a function of the collision energy in heavy-ion reactions $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, which serves as a key observable to identify the CEP. Our study reveals that for high collision energies, $\kappa \sigma^2$ remains nearly constant; however, as the system approaches the CEP, the ratio increases sharply, indicating the proximity of the critical region. This rise is influenced by the presence of vorticity, which causes the CEP to shift to higher collision energies. These findings provide insight into the role of vorticity in heavy-ion collisions</description>

      <title>Towards a unitary formulation of quantum field theory in curved space-time: the case of Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that the origin of unitarity violation and information loss paradox in our understanding of black holes (BH) lies in the standard way of doing quantum field theory in curved space-time (QFTCS), which is heavily biased on intuition borrowed from classical General Relativity. In this paper, with the quantum first approach, we formulate a so-called direct-sum QFT (DQFT) in BH space-time based on a novel formulation of discrete space-time transformations in gravity that potentially restores unitarity. By invoking the quantum effects associated with the gravitational backreaction, we show that the Hawking quanta emerging outside of the Schwarzschild radius ($r_S=2GM$) cannot be independent of the quanta that continue to be inside $r_S$. This enables the information to be carried by Hawking quanta, but in the BH DQFT formalism, we do not get any firewalls. Furthermore, DQFT leads to the BH evaporation involving only pure states. This means the quantum mechanical effects at the BH horizon produce two components of a maximally entangled pure state in geometric superselection sector Hilbert spaces. This construction enables pure states to evolve into pure states, restoring unitarity and observer complementarity. Finally, we discuss how our framework leaves important clues for formulating a scattering matrix and probing the nature of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>From Chaos to Integrability in Double Scaled SYK via a Chord Path Integral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01950v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study thermodynamic phase transitions between integrable and chaotic dynamics. We do so by analyzing models that interpolate between the chaotic double scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) and the integrable $p$-spin systems, in a limit where they are described by chord diagrams. We develop a path integral formalism by coarse graining over the diagrams, which we use to argue that the system has two distinct phases: one is continuously connected to the chaotic system, and the other to the integrable. They are separated by a line of first order transition that ends at some finite temperature.</description>

      <title>A Path Integral for Chord Diagrams and Chaotic-Integrable Transitions in Double Scaled SYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study transitions from chaotic to integrable Hamiltonians in the double scaled SYK and $p$-spin systems. The dynamics of our models is described by chord diagrams with two species. We begin by developing a path integral formalism of coarse graining chord diagrams with a single species of chords, which has the same equations of motion as the bi-local ($G\Sigma$) Liouville action, yet appears otherwise to be different and in particular well defined. We then develop a similar formalism for two types of chords, allowing us to study different types of deformations of double scaled SYK and in particular a deformation by an integrable Hamiltonian. The system has two distinct thermodynamic phases: one is continuously connected to the chaotic SYK Hamiltonian, the other is continuously connected to the integrable Hamiltonian, separated at low temperature by a first order phase transition. We also analyze the phase diagram for generic deformations, which in some cases includes a zero-temperature phase transition.</description>

      <title>Holographic Dual of Crosscap Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a holographic dual for 2D CFT defined on closed non-orientable manifolds, such as the real projective plane $\mathbb{RP}^2$ and the Klein bottle $\mathbb{K}^2$. Such CFT can be constructed by introducing antipodally identified cuttings, i.e. crosscaps, to a sphere and hence called crosscap CFT (XCFT). The gravity dual is AdS$_3$ spacetime with dS$_2$ end-of-the-world branes. In particular, the Lorentzian spacetime with a global dS$_2$ brane is dual to the unitary time evolution of a crosscap state in CFT, post-selected on the CFT ground state. We compute the holographic $\mathbb{RP}^2$ partition function (or the $p$-function), one-point function, and $\mathbb{K}^2$ partition function, and see that they successfully reproduce the XCFT results. We also show a holographic $p$-theorem as an application.</description>

      <title>The metamorphosis of semi-classical mechanisms of confinement: From monopoles on ${\mathbb R}^3 \times S^1$ to center-vortices on ${\mathbb R}^2 \times T^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are two distinct regimes of Yang-Mills theory where we can demonstrate confinement, the existence of a mass gap, and fractional theta angle dependence using a reliable semi-classical calculation. The two regimes are Yang-Mills theory on $S^1 \times {\mathbb R}^3$ with a small circle and a double-trace deformation, and Yang-Mills theory on $T^2 \times {\mathbb R}^2$ where the torus $T^2$ is small and threaded by a 't Hooft flux. In the first case the confinement mechanism is related to self-dual monopoles, whereas in the second case self-dual center-vortices play a crucial role. These two topological objects are distinct. In particular, they have different mutual statistics with Wilson loops. On the other hand, they carry the same topological charge and action. On ${\mathbb R \times T^2 \times S^1}$, we are able to extrapolate both monopole regime and vortex regime to a quantum mechanical domain, where a cross-over takes place. Both sides of the cross-over are described by a deformed $\mathbb Z_N$ TQFT. On ${\mathbb R^2 \times S^1 \times S^1}$, we derive the effective field theory of vortices from the effective theory of monopoles in the presence of a 't Hooft flux. This results from a two-stage adjoint Higgs mechanism, to $U(1)^{N-1}$ in 3d first and a $\mathbb Z_N$ EFT in 2d second. This proves adiabatic continuity of the two confinement mechanisms across dimensions and shows how monopoles and their magnetic flux transmute into center-vortices. This basic mechanism is flux fractionalization: The magnetic flux of the monopoles fractionalizes and collimates in such a way that 2d Wilson loops detect it as a center vortex.</description>

      <title>Klein-Gordon oscillators and Bergman spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider classical and quantum dynamics of relativistic oscillator in Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{3,1}$. It is shown that for a non-zero frequency parameter $\omega$ the covariant phase space of the classical Klein-Gordon oscillator is a homogeneous K\"ahler-Einstein manifold $Z_6=\mathrm{Ad}S_7/\mathrm{U}(1)=\mathrm{U}(3,1)/\mathrm{U}(3)\times \mathrm{U}(1)$. In the limit $\omega\to 0$, this manifold is deformed into the covariant phase space $T^*H^3$ of a free relativistic particle, where $H^3=H^3_+\cup H_-^3$ is a two-sheeted hyperboloid in momentum space. Quantization of this model with $\omega\ne 0$ leads to the Klein-Gordon oscillator equation which we consider in the Segal-Bargmann representation. It is shown that the general solution of this model is given by functions from the weighted Bergman space of square-integrable holomorphic (for particles) and antiholomorphic (for antiparticles) functions on the K\"ahler-Einstein manifold $Z_6$. This relativistic model is Lorentz covariant, unitary and does not contain non-physical states.</description>

      <title>Generalized Extended Uncertainty Principles, Liouville theorem and density of states: Snyder-de Sitter and Yang models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modifications in quantum mechanical phase space lead to changes in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which can result in the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) or the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP), introducing quantum gravitational effects at small and large distances, respectively. A combination of GUP and EUP, the Generalized Extended Uncertainty Principle (GEUP or EGUP), further generalizes these modifications by incorporating noncommutativity in both coordinates and momenta. This paper examines the impact of GEUP on the Liouville theorem in statistical physics and density of states within non-relativistic quantum mechanics framework. We find a weighted phase space volume element, invariant under the infinitesimal time evolution, in the cases of Snyder-de Sitter and Yang models, presenting how GEUP alters the density of states, potentially affecting physical (thermodynamical) properties. Special cases, obtained in certain limits from the above models are also discussed. New higher order types of GEUP and EUP are also proposed.</description>

      <title>End of the World Brane Dynamics in Holographic 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ SU(N) with 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ $SU(N)$ super Yang-Mills on half-space with boundary conditions defined by configurations of Gaiotto-Witten NS5- and D5-branes modded out by a rotated orientifold 5-plane breaking an extra half of the supersymmetries. We focus on configurations in which this O5'-brane is split by an NS5-brane into two oppositely charged halves, leading to a breaking of supersymmetry down to 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ at the local level. The 5-brane configurations turn into non-trivial $(p,q)$ webs and lead to non-trivial brane and gauge theory phenomena, including a 5d $\mathbf{Z}_2$ global gauge anomaly cancelled by a novel 6d global anomaly inflow, and the appearance of localized 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons couplings and the 3d parity anomaly at the boundary of the 4d theory. The systems have explicit gravity duals, given by orientifolds of the AdS$_4\times\mathbf{S}^2\times\mathbf{S}^2$ fibrations over a Riemann surface dual to the Gaiotto-Witten setups. They describe solutions with an asymptotic AdS$_5\times\mathbf{S}^5$ terminating at AdS$_4$ End of the World boundary configurations, whose rich dynamics reproduces the above physical properties. They also provide the SymTFT of the 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ on half-space with a new class of boundary conditions. We explore the interplay of bulk and boundary topological couplings and draw general lessons for the classification of cobordism defects of bulk quantum gravity theories in the swampland program.</description>

Abstract: We consider a twice anisotropic five-dimensional holographic model supported by Einstein-dilaton-three-Maxwell action that was constructed in the paper [arXiv:2011.07023]. Although, that model reproduced some essential features of the ``heavy quarks'', but did not describe the magnetic catalysis (MC) phenomenon expected from lattice results for the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) with heavy quarks. We study MC phenomenon as well as typical properties of the heavy quarks phase diagram contains magnetic field as a new parameter by improving the holographic model, i.e. modifying the ``heavy quarks'' warp factor and the coupling function for the Maxwell field. Considering spatial anisotropy decreases the transition temperature for all values of the magnetic field for heavy quarks model.</description>

      <title>Six-dimensional supermultiplets from bundles on projective spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.08388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The projective variety of square-zero elements in the six-dimensional minimal supersymmetry algebra is isomorphic to $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^3$. We use this fact, together with the pure spinor superfield formalism, to study supermultiplets in six dimensions, starting from vector bundles on projective spaces. We classify all multiplets whose derived invariants for the supertranslation algebra form a line bundle over the nilpotence variety; one can think of such multiplets as being those whose holomorphic twists have rank one over Dolbeault forms on spacetime. In addition, we explicitly construct multiplets associated to natural higher-rank equivariant vector bundles, including the tangent and normal bundles as well as their duals. Among the multiplets constructed are the vector multiplet and hypermultiplet, the family of $\mathcal{O}(n)$-multiplets, and the supergravity and gravitino multiplets. Along the way, we tackle various theoretical problems within the pure spinor superfield formalism. In particular, we give some general discussion about the relation of the projective nilpotence variety to multiplets and prove general results on short exact sequences and dualities of sheaves in the context of the pure spinor superfield formalism.</description>

      <title>On the effect of the maximal proper acceleration in the inertia</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effect of a hypothetical maximal proper acceleration on the mass of a charged particles is investigated in the context of particle accelerators. In particular, it is shown that maximal proper acceleration implies an increase in the kinetic energy of the particle being accelerated with respect to the relativistic energy. Such an increase in kinetic energy leads to a reduction of the luminosity of the bunches with respect to the expected luminosity in the relativistic models of the bunches. This relative loss in luminosity is of the order $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-5}$ for the LHC bunches and can be of order up to $10^{-3}$ for certain laser plasma accelerator facilities. Although the effect is small, it increases with the square of the bunch population.</description>

      <title>Non-Clifford and parallelizable fault-tolerant logical gates on constant and almost-constant rate homological quantum LDPC codes via higher symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study parallel fault-tolerant quantum computing for families of homological quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes defined on 3-manifolds with constant or almost-constant encoding rate. We derive generic formula for a transversal $T$ gate of color codes on general 3-manifolds, which acts as collective non-Clifford logical CCZ gates on any triplet of logical qubits with their logical-$X$ membranes having a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ triple intersection at a single point. The triple intersection number is a topological invariant, which also arises in the path integral of the emergent higher symmetry operator in a topological quantum field theory: the $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory. Moreover, the transversal $S$ gate of the color code corresponds to a higher-form symmetry supported on a codimension-1 submanifold, giving rise to exponentially many addressable and parallelizable logical CZ gates. We have developed a generic formalism to compute the triple intersection invariants for 3-manifolds and also study the scaling of the Betti number and systoles with volume for various 3-manifolds, which translates to the encoding rate and distance. We further develop three types of LDPC codes supporting such logical gates: (1) A quasi-hyperbolic code from the product of 2D hyperbolic surface and a circle, with almost-constant rate $k/n=O(1/\log(n))$ and $O(\log(n))$ distance; (2) A homological fibre bundle code with $O(1/\log^{\frac{1}{2}}(n))$ rate and $O(\log^{\frac{1}{2}}(n))$ distance; (3) A specific family of 3D hyperbolic codes: the Torelli mapping torus code, constructed from mapping tori of a pseudo-Anosov element in the Torelli subgroup, which has constant rate while the distance scaling is currently unknown. We then show a generic constant-overhead scheme for applying a parallelizable universal gate set with the aid of logical-$X$ measurements.</description>

Abstract: In this work we will answer the following question: What remains of Quantum Mechanics when we transform the background space-time into a space modularized by observation or measurement regions ? This new moduli space is constructed by identifying regions of space-time where quantum phase comparison (observation, measurement) is implied. We call it Observation Modular space (OM-space). In addition we replace in QM statements the Plank constant (h) by the quantity $\zeta_0 4 \pi^2$ (where $\zeta_0$ is the Plank Length) or otherwise, replacing $P_0$ (the Planck Momentum) by $4 \pi^2$. This maps Quantum Mechanics into a very rich dual Number Theory which we call Observation Modular Quantum Mechanics (OM-QM). We find the OM-dual to the Dirac Equation, the quantum Wave Function and a free particle's mass. The OM-QM counterparts of the Energy turns out to be a simple function of the zeroes of the Riemann zeta function. We also find the OM-QM correspondents to the electron spin, the electron charge, the Electric Field and the Fine Structure Constant. We also find the OM-QM correspondents of the Heisemberg uncertainty relation and Einstein's General Relativity Field equation emerging as certain limits of a unique OM-QM equation. We also get the OM-QM correspondents of the Gravitational Constant and the Cosmological Constant. We find the analog of holography in the OM-QM side and we get an interpretation of spin as a high dimensional curvature. An interpretation of the OM-QM correspondence is proposed as giving the part of QM information which is not measurement or observation dependent. Some potential future applications of this correspondence are discussed.</description>

      <title>Embezzling entanglement from quantum fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07292v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embezzlement of entanglement refers to the counterintuitive possibility of extracting entangled quantum states from a reference state of an auxiliary system (the "embezzler") via local quantum operations while hardly perturbing the latter. We uncover a deep connection between the operational task of embezzling entanglement and the mathematical classification of von Neumann algebras. Our result implies that relativistic quantum fields are universal embezzlers: Any entangled state of any dimension can be embezzled from them with arbitrary precision. This provides an operational characterization of the infinite amount of entanglement present in the vacuum state of relativistic quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Cosmological inhomogeneities, primordial black holes, and a hypothesis on the death of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of the expansion of the universe on a broad class of objects, including black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs, and others. Using metrics that incorporate primordial inhomogeneities, the effects of a hypothetical "center of the universe" on inflation are calculated. Dynamic coordinates for black holes that account for expansions or contractions with arbitrary rates are provided. We consider the possibility that the universe may be bound to evolve into an ultimate state of "total dilution", wherein stable particles are so widely separated that physical communication among them will be impossible for eternity. This is also a scenario of "cosmic virtuality", as no wave-function collapse would occur again. We provide classical models evolving this way, based on the Majumdar-Papapetrou geometries. More realistic configurations, instead, indicate that gravitational forces locally counteract expansion, except in the universe's early stages. We comment on whether quantum phenomena may dictate that total dilution is indeed the cosmos' ultimate destiny.</description>

      <title>How Viable Is a QCD Axion near 10 MeV?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been an attempt to revive the visible QCD axion at the 10 MeV scale assuming that it exclusively couples to the first-generation quarks and the electron. This variant of the QCD axion is claimed to remain phenomenologically viable, partly due to a clever model construction that induces tree-level pion-phobia and exploits uncertainties inherent in the chiral perturbation theory. We confront this model with the cosmological domain wall problem, the quality issue and constraints arising from the electron electric dipole moment. It is also pointed out that the gluon loop-generated axion-top coupling can provide a very large contribution to rare $B$-meson decays, such that the present LHCb data for $B^0 \to K^{*0} e^+ e^-$ rule out the model for the axion mass larger than 30 MeV. There is a strong motivation for pushing the experimental analysis of $B \to K^{(*)} e^+ e^-$ to a lower $e^+ e^-$ invariant mass window, which will conclusively determine the fate of the model, as its contribution to this branching ratio significantly exceeds the Standard Model prediction.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter and General Relativistic Instability in Supermassive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the extent to which collisionless dark matter impacts the stability of supermassive stars $(M\gtrsim10^4\,M_\odot)$. We find that, depending on the star's mass, a dark matter content in excess of ${\sim}1\%$ by mass throughout the entire star can raise the critical central density for the onset general relativistic instability, in some cases by orders of magnitude. We consider implications of this effect for the onset of nuclear burning and significant neutrino energy losses.</description>

      <title>Spikes and spines in 4D Lorentzian simplicial quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simplicial approaches to quantum gravity such as quantum Regge calculus and spin foams include configurations where bulk edges can become arbitrarily large while the boundary edges are kept small. Spikes and spines are prime examples for such configurations. They pose a significant challenge for a desired continuum limit, for which the average lengths of edges ought to become very small. Here we investigate spike and spine configurations in four-dimensional Lorentzian quantum Regge calculus. We find that the expectation values of arbitrary powers of the bulk length are finite. To that end, we explore new types of asymptotic regimes for the Regge amplitudes, in which some of the edges are much larger than the remaining ones. The amplitudes simplify considerably in such asymptotic regimes and the geometric interpretation of the resulting expressions involves a dimensional reduction, which might have applications to holography.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Normal Modes of Loop Quantum Black Holes Formed from Gravitational Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19654v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of a scalar field in the background of a large class of quantum black holes that can be formed from gravitational collapse of a dust fluid in the framework of effective loop quantum gravity. The loop quantum black holes (LQBHs) are characterized by three free parameters, one of which is the mass parameter, while the other two are purely due to quantum geometric effects. Among these two quantum parameters, one is completely fixed by black hole thermodynamics and its effects are negligible for macroscopic black holes, while the second parameter is completely free (in principle). In the studies of the QNMs of such LQBHs, we pay particular attention to the difference of the QNMs between LQBHs and classical ones, so that they can be observed for the current and forthcoming gravitational wave observations, whereby place the LQBH theory directly under the test of observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive self-consistent constraint conditions for collision terms in quantum kinetic theory using the Wigner function formalism. We present specific solutions for these collision terms that align with the constraints. we develop quantum kinetic theory at relaxation-time approximation. With this framework, we discuss spin polarization and electric charge separation effects in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Matching current observational constraints with nonminimally coupled dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a universe with a nonminimally coupled scalar field can fit current measurements of the expansion rate of the Universe better than the standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter model or other minimally coupled dark energy models. While we find a clear improvement in the goodness of fit for this dark energy model with respect to others that have been considered in the recent literature, using various information theoretic criteria, we show that the evidence for it is still inconclusive.</description>
