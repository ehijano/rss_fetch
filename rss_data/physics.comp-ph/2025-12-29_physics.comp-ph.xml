      <title>GaDE -- GPU-acceleration of time-dependent Dirac Equation for exascale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern heterogeneous high-performance computing (HPC) systems powered by advanced graphics processing unit (GPU) architectures enable accelerating computing with unprecedented performance and scalability. Here, we present a GPU-accelerated solver for the three-dimensional (3D) time-dependent Dirac equation optimized for distributed HPC systems. The solver named GaDE is designed to simulate the electron dynamics in atoms induced by electromagnetic fields in the relativistic regime. It combines MPI with CUDA/HIP to target both NVIDIA and AMD GPU architectures. We discuss our implementation strategies in which most of the computations are carried out on GPUs, taking advantage of the GPU-aware MPI feature to optimize communication performance. We evaluate GaDE on the pre-exascale supercomputer LUMI, powered by AMD MI250X GPUs and HPE's Slingshot interconnect. Single-GPU performance on NVIDIA A100, GH200, and AMD MI250X shows comparable performance between A100 and MI250X in compute and memory bandwidth, with GH200 delivering higher performance. Weak scaling on LUMI demonstrates exceptional scalability, achieving 85% parallel efficiency across 2048 GPUs, while strong scaling delivers a 16x speedup on 32 GPUs - 50% efficiency for a communication-intensive, time-dependent Dirac equation solver. These results demonstrate GaDE's high scalability, making it suitable for exascale systems and enabling predictive simulations for ultra-intense laser experiments probing relativistic quantum effects.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Solvers for Periodic Quantum Eigenproblems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis presents a physics-informed machine learning framework for solving the Floquet-Bloch eigenvalue problem associated with particles in two-dimensional periodic potentials, with a focus on honeycomb lattice geometry, due to its distinctive band topology featuring Dirac points and its relevance to materials such as graphene. By leveraging neural networks to learn complex Bloch functions and their associated eigenvalues (energies) simultaneously, we develop a mesh-free solver enforcing the governing Schr\"odinger equation, Bloch periodicity, and normalization constraints through a composite loss function without supervision. The model is trained over the Brillouin zone to recover band structures and Bloch modes, with numerical validation against traditional plane-wave expansion methods. We further explore transfer learning techniques to adapt the solver from nearly-free electron potentials to strongly varying potentials, demonstrating its ability to capture changes in band structure topology. This work contributes to the growing field of physics-informed machine learning for quantum eigenproblems, providing insights into the interplay between symmetry, band structure, and neural architectures.</description>

      <title>A Velocity Coupled Radial Acceleration Ansatz for Disk-Galaxy Rotation Curves: Fits to SPARC, Bayesian Inference, and Parameter Identifiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observed rotation curves of disk galaxies remain a sharp empirical probe of the relationship between baryons and dynamics. We study a minimal, explicitly \emph{phenomenological} alternative to standard halo parameterizations: an additional inward \emph{radial} acceleration proportional to the local \emph{tangential} speed, $a_{\vca}(r)=\gamma(r)\,v(r)$, with a saturating coupling $\gamma(r)=\vinf/(r+\rzero)$. Combining this ansatz with the circular-motion condition yields a quadratic equation for $v(r)$ with a closed-form physical branch.We fit this ``velocity-coupled acceleration'' (\vca) model to $N_\mathrm{gal}=171$ rotation curves from the SPARC sample using the published baryonic decompositions (gas, disk, bulge), and we compare to two commonly used two-parameter halo models (NFW and Burkert) using an identical optimization pipeline and error model.For a fiducial systematic error floor $\sigma_0=5~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, the \vca model is typically competitive with an NFW halo and performs comparably (though not uniformly better) than a Burkert halo in information-criterion comparisons.We further perform MCMC inference for \vca parameters, quantify posterior predictive coverage, and show that parameter posteriors exhibit a strong $\vinf$--$\rzero$ degeneracy for many galaxies; only $47/171$ galaxies yield well-identified posteriors under simple width-based criteria. We also perform a simple radial holdout cross-validation (outer 30\% of radii) and find predictive RMSE comparable to NFW and Burkert under this protocol.Finally..</description>

      <title>Enhanced numerical models for two-component fluid flow in multiscale porous structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-component fluid flow simulations in multi-scale porous structures often involve regions that are under-resolved at practical computational resolutions. Accurately capturing the contributions from these unresolved regions is critical. Previous studies proposed a model to account for viscous and capillary forces in under-resolved regions, showing permeability, capillary pressure, and relative permeability comparable to fully resolved high-resolution cases. In this study, we extend the model to handle diverse structures and capture detailed fluid behavior. We introduce controllable surface tension in a pseudo-potential lattice Boltzmann model while keeping interface thickness and spurious currents constant, improving interface dynamics resolution. A method is developed to capture residual fluid components smaller than cell size using local constitutive relations, including absolute and relative permeability and capillary pressure curves. Additionally, a tensorial resistivity model is implemented for heterogeneous structures such as fiber bundles, aligning resistivity along principal axes determined from the Hessian and gradient of local porosity fields. Benchmark tests, including practical rock geometries, validate these enhancements, demonstrating improved transient interface dynamics, accurate capture of irreducible fluid components, and correct directional effects in under-resolved structures.</description>

      <title>On Critical Temperature and Finite Size Scaling of Continuous Spin $2d$ Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we have studied the critical temperature $T_c$ of continuous spin $2d$ square-lattice Ising model using Monte-Carlo simulation. We have considered spins $s$ in a bounded interval, where $s \in [-1,+1]$ in square-lattice configuration with periodic boundary condition. We have observed that the critical temperature $T_c$ is approximately $0.925$, showing a clear second order phase transition. Considering finite size scaling, we have also obtained the critical exponents associated with susceptibility, specific heat, magnetization and we find that these values are in good agreement with the corresponding values obtained for the standard $2d$ Ising universality class.</description>

      <title>Programmable Photonic Circuits with Embedded Feedback for Parallel Multi-Wavelength Operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear transformations are cornerstone operations utilized in modern computing, but are computationally expensive on current electronic platforms. Optical computing has been positioned as a new computing solution, promising high speed and energy efficiency by exploiting the available degrees of freedom of light. Although solutions exist in the optical domain, there is a continuous search for compact solutions that properly utilize the limited chip space and exploit various degrees of freedom of light. Here, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a compact, programmable photonic integrated circuit (PIC) architecture that operates on both spatial and frequency degrees of freedom by leveraging embedded optical feedback loops. This architecture enables universal linear unitary transforms by combining resonators with passive linear mixing layers and tunable active phase layers. The strong dispersion achieved from the resonant loops enables multi-frequency operation and reduces the number of required active layers to achieve universality. This solution reduces the optical port requirements, minimizes power losses, and leverages resonances to enable massive parallel computing in the frequency domain. The fabricated samples are compatible with silicon-on-insulator platforms and operate at single- and dual-frequency modes. The experimental setup demonstrates the ability to perform in situ training in both cases, validating the parallel-computing capabilities of the PICs. This work highlights the potential of feedback-loop PICs for scalable, compact, and energy-efficient linear optical computing.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification and stability of neural operators for prediction of three-dimensional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulence poses challenges for numerical simulation due to its chaotic, multiscale nature and high computational cost. Traditional turbulence modeling often struggles with accuracy and long-term stability. Recent scientific machine learning (SciML) models, such as Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), show promise in solving PDEs, but are typically limited to one-step-ahead predictions and often fail over long time horizons, especially in 3D turbulence. This study proposes a framework to assess the reliability of neural operator models in turbulent flows. Using three-dimensional forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) as a benchmark, we evaluate models in terms of uncertainty quantification (UQ), error propagation, and sensitivity to initial perturbations. Statistical tools such as error distribution analysis and autocorrelation functions (ACF) are used to assess predictive robustness and temporal coherence. Our proposed model, the factorized-implicit FNO (F-IFNO), improves long-term stability and accuracy by incorporating implicit factorization into the prediction process. It outperforms conventional LES and other FNO-based models in balancing accuracy, stability, and efficiency. The results highlight the importance of prediction constraints, time interval selection, and UQ in developing robust neural operator frameworks for turbulent systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum metric-based optical selection rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optical selection rules dictate symmetry-allowed/forbidden transitions, playing a decisive role in engineering exciton quantum states and designing optoelectronic devices. While both the real (quantum metric) and imaginary (Berry curvature) parts of quantum geometry contribute to optical transitions, the conventional theory of optical selection rules in solids incorporates only Berry curvature. Here, we propose quantum metric-based optical selection rules. We unveil a universal quantum metric-oscillator strength correspondence for linear polarization of light and establish valley-contrasted optical selection rules that lock orthogonal linear polarizations to distinct valleys. Tight-binding and first-principles calculations confirm our theory in two models (altermagnet and Kane-Mele) and monolayer $d$-wave altermagnet $\mathrm{V_2SeSO}$. This work provides a quantum metric paradigm for valley-based spintronic and optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Kinetic closure of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter presents a kinetic closure of the filtered Boltzmann--BGK equation, paving the way towards an alternative description of turbulence. The closure naturally incorporates the turbulent subfilter stress tensor without the need for explicit modeling, unlike in classical filtered Navier--Stokes closures. In contrast, it accounts for the subfilter turbulent diffusion in the nonconserved moments by generalizing the BGK collision operator. The model requires neither scale separation between resolved and unresolved scales nor a Smagorinsky-type ansatz for the subfilter stress tensor structure. The Chapman--Enskog analysis shows that its hydrodynamic limit converges exactly to the filtered Navier--Stokes equations, with velocity gradients isolating subfilter contributions. Validations through lattice Boltzmann simulations of the Taylor--Green vortex and the turbulent mixing layer demonstrate improved stability and reduced dissipation, benchmarked against the Smagorinsky model.</description>

      <title>Jacobi's solution for geodesics on a triaxial ellipsoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On Boxing Day, 1838, Jacobi found a solution to the problem of geodesics on a triaxial ellipsoid, with the course of the geodesic and the distance along it given in terms of one-dimensional integrals. Here, a numerical implementation of this solution is described. This entails accurately evaluating the integrals and solving the resulting coupled system of equations. The inverse problem, finding the shortest path between two points on the ellipsoid, can then be solved using a similar method as for biaxial ellipsoids.</description>
