      <title>Resource-Bounded Martin-L\"of Type Theory: Compositional Cost Analysis for Dependent Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend resource-bounded type theory to Martin-Lof type theory (MLTT) with dependent types, enabling size-indexed cost bounds for programs over inductive families.
  We introduce a resource-indexed universe hierarchy U_r where r is an element of L and tracks the cost of type formation, and a graded modality Box_r for feasibility certification. Our main results are: (1) a cost soundness theorem showing that synthesized bounds over-approximate operational costs, with bounds expressed as functions of size indices; (2) a semantic model in the presheaf topos over L, extended with dependent presheaves and a comprehension structure; (3) canonicity for the intensional fragment; and (4) initiality of the syntactic model. We demonstrate the framework with case studies including length-indexed vector operations with linear bounds and binary search with logarithmic bounds, both expressed in the type.
  This work bridges the gap between dependent type theory and quantitative resource analysis, enabling certified cost bounds for size-dependent algorithms.</description>

      <title>GenDA: Generative Data Assimilation on Complex Urban Areas via Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban wind flow reconstruction is essential for assessing air quality, heat dispersion, and pedestrian comfort, yet remains challenging when only sparse sensor data are available. We propose GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution wind fields on unstructured meshes from limited observations. The model employs a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and interprets classifier-free guidance as a learned posterior reconstruction mechanism: the unconditional branch learns a geometry-aware flow prior, while the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. This formulation enables obstacle-aware reconstruction and generalization across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining. We consider both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations using the same reconstruction procedure. When evaluated against supervised graph neural network (GNN) baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods, GenDA reduces the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% across the tested meshes. Experiments are conducted on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of a real urban neighbourhood in Bristol, United Kingdom, at a characteristic Reynolds number of $\mathrm{Re}\approx2\times10^{7}$, featuring complex building geometry and irregular terrain. The proposed framework provides a scalable path toward generative, geometry-aware data assimilation for environmental monitoring in complex domains.</description>

      <title>Smooth SCAD: A Raised Cosine SCAD Type Thresholding Rule for Wavelet Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a smooth variant of the SCAD thresholding rule for wavelet denoising by replacing its piecewise linear transition with a raised cosine. The resulting shrinkage function is odd, continuous on R, and continuously differentiable away from the main threshold, yet retains the hallmark SCAD properties of sparsity for small coefficients and near unbiasedness for large ones. This smoothness places the rule within the continuous thresholding class for which Stein's unbiased risk estimate is valid. As a result, unbiased risk computation, stable data-driven threshold selection, and the asymptotic theory of Kudryavtsev and Shestakov apply.
  A corresponding nonconvex prior is obtained whose posterior mode coincides with the estimator, yielding a transparent Bayesian interpretation. We give an explicit SURE risk expression, discuss the oracle scale of the optimal threshold, and describe both global and level-dependent adaptive versions. The smooth SCAD rule therefore offers a tractable refinement of SCAD, combining low bias, exact sparsity, and analytical convenience in a single wavelet shrinkage procedure.</description>

      <title>Hetero-EUCLID: Interpretable model discovery for heterogeneous hyperelastic materials using stress-unsupervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a computational framework, Hetero-EUCLID, for segmentation and parameter identification to characterize the full hyperelastic behavior of all constituents of a heterogeneous material. In this work, we leverage the Bayesian-EUCLID (Efficient Unsupervised Constitutive Law Identification and Discovery) framework to efficiently solve the heterogenized formulation through parsimonious model selection using sparsity-promoting priors and Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling. We utilize experimentally observable 3D surface displacement and boundary-averaged force data generated from Finite Element simulations of non-equi-biaxial tension tests on heterogeneous specimens. The framework broadly consists of two steps -- residual force-based segmentation, and constitutive parameter identification. We validate and demonstrate the ability of the proposed framework to segment the domain, and characterize the constituent materials on various types of thin square heterogeneous domains. We validate of the framework's ability to segment and characterize materials with various levels of displacement noises and non-native mesh discretizations, i.e, using different meshes for the forward FE simulations and the inverse EUCLID problem. This demonstrates Hetero-EUCLID framework's applicability in Digital Image/Volume Correlation-based experimental scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed framework performs successful segmentation and material characterizations based on data from a single experiment, thereby making it viable for rapid, interpretable model discovery in domains such as aerospace and defense composites and for characterization of selective tissue stiffening in medical conditions such as fibroatheroma, atherosclerosis, or cancer.</description>

      <title>Beyond Isolated Investor: Predicting Startup Success via Roleplay-Based Collective Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the high value and high failure rate of startups, predicting their success has become a critical challenge across interdisciplinary research. Existing approaches typically model success prediction from the perspective of a single decision-maker, overlooking the collective dynamics of investor groups that dominate real-world venture capital (VC) decisions. In this paper, we propose SimVC-CAS, a novel collective agent system that simulates VC decision-making as a multi-agent interaction process. By designing role-playing agents and a GNN-based supervised interaction module, we reformulate startup financing prediction as a group decision-making task, capturing both enterprise fundamentals and the behavioral dynamics of potential investor networks. Each agent embodies an investor with unique traits and preferences, enabling heterogeneous evaluation and realistic information exchange through a graph-structured co-investment network. Using real-world data from PitchBook and under strict data leakage controls, we show that SimVC-CAS significantly improves predictive accuracy while providing interpretable, multiperspective reasoning, for example, approximately 25% relative improvement with respect to average precision@10. SimVC-CAS also sheds light on other complex group decision scenarios.</description>

      <title>SPIKE: Sparse Koopman Regularization for Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a mesh-free approach for solving differential equations by embedding physical constraints into neural network training. However, PINNs tend to overfit within the training domain, leading to poor generalization when extrapolating beyond trained spatiotemporal regions. This work presents SPIKE (Sparse Physics-Informed Koopman-Enhanced), a framework that regularizes PINNs with continuous-time Koopman operators to learn parsimonious dynamics representations. By enforcing linear dynamics $dz/dt = Az$ in a learned observable space, both PIKE (without explicit sparsity) and SPIKE (with L1 regularization on $A$) learn sparse generator matrices, embodying the parsimony principle that complex dynamics admit low-dimensional structure. Experiments across parabolic, hyperbolic, dispersive, and stiff PDEs, including fluid dynamics (Navier-Stokes) and chaotic ODEs (Lorenz), demonstrate consistent improvements in temporal extrapolation, spatial generalization, and long-term prediction accuracy. The continuous-time formulation with matrix exponential integration provides unconditional stability for stiff systems while avoiding diagonal dominance issues inherent in discrete-time Koopman operators.</description>
