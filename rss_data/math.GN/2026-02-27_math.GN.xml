      <title>Structure Theorems for locally compact modules over localizations of the integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a multiplicatively closed subset $S$ of the integers, there exist Structure Theorems for $LC$ modules over the localization $\mathbb{Z}S^{-1}$ that are "similar" to those of $LCA$ groups. The most notable one is the 1st Theorem: Given such a module $M$, there exists a unique set of prime numbers $\Sigma$ (purely dependent on $S$) for which $M \cong \mathbb{R}^n \times \sideset{}{'}\prod_{q \in \Sigma} \mathbb{Q}_p^{n_p} \times N$, where $(n, (n_p)_{p \in \Sigma})$ is a sequence of nonnegative integers and $N$ contains a compact open submodule $K$ such that $K/K_0$ is a topological module over $\prod_{ q \in \mathbb{P}\setminus{\Sigma}} \mathbb{Z}_q$. Just like for $LCA$ groups, it is also possible to characterize the locally compact, compactly generated modules over $\mathbb{Z}S^{-1}$, as well as their Pontryagin Duals (which then allows to conclude that any locally compact $\mathbb{Z}S^{-1}$-module is an inverse limit of modules within a specific family). These characterizations are given in the 2nd and 3rd Structure Theorems respectively. Furthermore, as an elementary consequence of the 1st Structure Theorem, one can obtain a full classification of locally compact vector spaces over $\mathbb{Q}$.</description>

      <title>On the Collatz Conjecture: Topological and Ergodic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Collatz function famously related to the Collatz Conjecture under the topological and ergodic perpectives, including an approach with thermodynamic formalism. By introducing a key topology and its Borel sigma-algebra we show that recurrence implies periodicity. Moreover, we establish that the set of periodic orbits is finite if, and only if, every continuous potential possesses some equilibrium state. The uniqueness of periodic orbits is equivalent to the uniqueness of equilibrium state for every bounded and continuous potential. Additionaly, by using the Alexandroff compactification of the established topology, we prove finiteness of cycles, which is a significant advance to the conjecture itself. Finally, we apply our technique to the Baker and Syracuse maps, obtaining a similar result for a general class of important maps.</description>

      <title>Edge-ends versus topological ends of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diestel and K\"uhn proved that the topological ends of an infinite graph are precisely its undominated graph ends, yielding a canonical embedding of the space of topological ends into the space of graph ends. For edge-ends, introduced by Hahn, Laviolette and \v{S}ir\'a\v{n}, such an embedding does not exist in general.
  In this note, we characterize the class of infinite graphs for which the topological ends admit a natural injective map into the space of edge-ends that is compatible with the canonical maps between end spaces. Our characterization is purely combinatorial and is expressed in terms of edge-equivalence classes of vertices.
  Moreover, when such an embedding exists, we identify precisely which edge-ends arise from topological ends, showing that they are exactly the edge-ends containing a non-dominated ray. This establishes a parallel result to the theorem of Diestel and K\"uhn for edge-end spaces.</description>
