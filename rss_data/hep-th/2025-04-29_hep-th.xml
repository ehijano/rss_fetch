      <title>The Non-SUSY Orbifolder: a tool to build promising non-supersymmetric string models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the non-SUSY orbifolder, which is a program developed in C++ that computes the low-energy effective theory of non-supersymmetric heterotic orbifold compactifications. The program includes routines to compute the massless spectrum, to automatically generate large sets of orbifold models, to identify phenomenologically interesting models (e.g. models sharing features of the Standard Model (SM) or Grand Unified Theories (GUT)) and to analyze their vacuum configurations.</description>

      <title>Duality-Symmetry Enhancement in Maxwell Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free Maxwell theory on general four-manifolds may, under certain conditions on the background geometry, exhibit holomorphic factorization in its partition function. We show that when this occurs, new discrete symmetries emerge at orbifold points of the conformal manifold. These symmetries, which act only on a sublattice of flux configurations, are not associated with standard dualities, yet they may carry 't Hooft anomalies, potentially causing the partition function to vanish even in the absence of apparent pathologies. We further explore their non-invertible extensions and argue that their anomalies can account for zeros of the partition function at smooth points in the moduli space.</description>

      <title>Can black holes preserve $N &gt; 4$ supersymmetry?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of near-BPS black holes are governed by the breaking of the conformal symmetry that emerges near their horizons. Using the classification of superconformal symmetries, we systematically classify and quantize all effective theories that can arise in the near-BPS limit of black holes. Using these results, we argue, under certain physical assumptions, that BPS black holes cannot preserve more than four supercharges. This conclusion is consistent with existing constructions in string theory.</description>

      <title>$N$-ality symmetry and SPT phases in (1+1)d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Duality symmetries have been extensively investigated in various contexts, playing a crucial role in understanding quantum field theory and condensed matter theory. In this paper, we extend this framework by studying $N$-ality symmetries, which are a generalization of duality symmetries and are mathematically described by $\mathbb{Z}_N$-graded fusion categories. In particular, we focus on an $N$-ality symmetry obtained by gauging a non-anomalous subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry with a type III anomaly. We determine the corresponding fusion rules via two complementary approaches: a direct calculation and a representation-theoretic method. As an application, we study the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases associated with the $N$-ality symmetry. We classify all such SPT phases using the SymTFT framework and explicitly construct lattice Hamiltonians for some of them.</description>

      <title>High Precision Black Hole Scattering: Tutti Frutti vs Worldline Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider black hole scattering up to the fifth Post Minkowskian ($G^5$) order and compare the predictions of the Tutti Frutti formalism to the results obtained within two different versions of Worldline Effective Field Theory. At the $G^4$ order we highlight the complete agreement between Tutti Frutti results and the results of [C. Dlapa et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{130}, no.10, 101401 (2023)], and show how the Tutti Frutti approach allows one to extract the $O(G^3)$ angular momentum loss from the $O(G^4)$ impulse. We compare the sixth Post-Newtonian (6PN) accurate Tutti Frutti predictions to the recent results of [M. Driesse et al., arXiv:2411.11846 [hep-th]], which are at the $G^5$ order, and at the leading order in the two mass ratios, finding complete agreement. We highlight that this agreement involves the presence at the 5.5PN level of a nonlocal tail-of-tail contribution to the scattering (first computed in [D. Bini et al., Phys. Rev. D \textbf{102}, no.8, 084047 (2020)]), and involves, at the 6PN level, the presence of a $O(G^4)$ contribution to the angular momentum loss [C. Heissenberg, arXiv:2501.02904 [hep-th]]. At the second order in the mass ratios of the $O(G^5)$ order we predict two independent gauge-invariant observables to high-PN accuracy.</description>

      <title>On the CFT dual of superstring on AdS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the proposed duality between superstring on AdS$_3\times$S$^3\times\mathbb{T}^4$ with pure NS-NS flux and a deformed symmetric orbifold CFT. We extract the residues of 3-point string correlators at their next-to-leading poles, which can be written as some integrals. Because of picture changing, the integrand is not unique. We make an ansatz for its proper form which linearly combines three different picture choices. On the CFT side, we obtain the corresponding residues by doing a conformal perturbation computation at the second order. The result can also be written as some integrals, with the integrand being a five point function in the symmetric orbifold theory, which is calculated using covering maps. After unifying the integration variables of the two sides, we find that the two integrands match precisely, due to some novel mathematical identities of covering maps. Our calculation verifies the proposed marginal operator in the dual CFT of superstring on AdS$_3\times$S$^3\times\mathbb{T}^4$ and could be generalized to the CFT duals of superstrings on general backgrounds AdS$_3\times X$ with few modifications.</description>

      <title>On the space of U(N) scattering amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the space of massive two-dimensional theories with a global U(N) symmetry and no bound states. Following S-matrix bootstrap principles, we establish rigorous bounds on the space of consistent $2 \rightarrow 2$ scattering amplitudes. The allowed regions exhibit rich geometric features with integrable models appearing at special points along the boundary. Generic extremal amplitudes display an infinite number of resonances and periodic behavior in energy, similar to previous studies with other group-like symmetries. Within the allowed space, we identify a subregion where the symmetry is enhanced to O(2N), establishing a connection with earlier studies. We also revisit the classification of integrable solutions, identifying one that was previously overlooked in the literature. Finally, we examine the walking behavior of the central charge associated with several of these periodic amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic Strings: Classical solutions and exactly solvable models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss classical closed string solutions in non-relativistic two-sphere target spaces. These classes of solutions closely relate to the GKP-type, spinning and pulsating strings for the relativistic case. We derive the string dynamics in each case and construct relevant dispersion relations, both from the string Newton-Cartan intrinsic sigma model and using a large speed of light expansion of relativistic Polyakov action. We further discuss construction and characteristics of exactly solvable Neumann-Rosochatius-like dynamical systems corresponding to strings in leading and subleading orders of the expanded Polyakov theory.</description>

      <title>Integrable black hole dynamics in the asymptotic structure of AdS$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work deepens the study of integrable asymptotic symmetries for AdS$_{3}$. They are given by an infinite set of integrable nonlinear equations known as the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) hierarchy, characterized by an also infinite set of abelian conserved charges. We present their field-dependent Killing vectors and the computation of the canonical charges associated to the asymptotic metric, together with their corresponding charge algebra. We study black hole thermodynamics and show that the temperature for stationary black holes falling in the AKNS asymptotics is always constant, even in the case where the solutions are not axisymmetric. This is related to the existence of a hyperelliptic curve, which appears as a fundamental object in many integrable systems. We also present a special solution associated with the Korteweg-de Vries equation, that is a particular case of the AKNS integrable hierarchy. It is presented in the form of a periodic soliton leading to a cnoidal KdV black hole, whose temperature is characterized by two copies of hyperelliptic curves.</description>

      <title>T-duality, Loop Hori Formulae and the Twisted Bismut-Chern Character</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to establish the loop space formulation of T-duality in the presence of background flux. In particular, we construct a loop space analogue of the Hori formula, termed \textbf{the loop Hori map}, and demonstrate that it induces a quasi-isomorphism between the exotic twisted equivariant cohomologies on the free loop spaces of the T-dual sides. This significantly refines the earlier work of the authors in 2015 where T-duality was established after localisation to the base space. The construction of the loop Hori map is an application of our generalization of the Bismut--Chern character in 2015, originally introduced in the loop space interpretation of the Atiyah--Singer index theorem by Atiyah--Witten and Bismut.</description>

      <title>Criticality of charged AdS black holes with string clouds in boundary conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this letter is to study the universal thermodynamics and criticality of charged AdS black holes with string clouds in the bulk and in the boundary conformal field theory (CFT). For this system, we determined the critical quantities and noticed that the free energy in the bulk exhibits swallow tail behavior. In the boundary CFT, the presence of second order phase transition is observed. At constant charge, the heat capacity is finite in the bulk but diverges at critical points in the boundary CFT. Furthermore, we tried to determine the nature of interactions between black hole molecules in the boundary CFT and in the bulk, which is novel for charged AdS black holes with string clouds.</description>

      <title>Horizon Thermodynamics on Nice Slices of the Causal Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a deep link between gravity and thermodynamics; in a precise way gravity can be derived from entanglement entropy in conformal field theories. However, this depends crucially on properties of horizons, and asymptotic symmetries of phase space. To explore how this relation behaves under dynamical processes, we consider covariant gravitational phase space enhanced with bulk conformal symmetry. As is well known, the Noether-Wald entropy has an explicit form in terms of the Abbott-Deser-Tekin conserved surface charges of gauge theories. We find a new vector contribution to the Abbott-Deser-Tekin charges that arises for conformal symmetries. In applying this to the causal diamond, we derive a general relation for surface gravity, based on the conformal invariance of horizons, that allows us to find slices where the zeroth law holds, as well as the degree to which a first law arises on the phase space.</description>

      <title>Dressed fields for Quantum Chromodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: String-localized QFT allows to explain Standard Model interactions in an autonomous way, committed to quantum principles rather than a "gauge principle", thus avoiding an indefinite state space and compensating ghosts. The resulting perturbative scattering matrix is known (at tree-level) to be insensitive to the non-locality of the auxiliary "string-localized fields" used in the construction. For the examples of Yang-Mills and QCD, we prove that it is actually equivalent to the perturbative S-matrix of gauge theory, restricted to physical particle states. The role of classical gauge invariance is revealed along the way. The main tool are "dressed fields", that are intermediate between free fields and interacting fields, and for which we give explicit formulas at all orders. The renormalization of loops, as well as non-perturbative issues are not adressed, but we hint at the possibility, enabled by our approach, that qualitative traces of confinement may be visible already at the level of the dressed fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A technique to build perturbative series for the spectator field's correlation functions in de Sitter space through the Fokker-Planck equation is proposed. We derive from the first-order differential equation the iterative integral relation for equal- and multi-time correlation functions. With an appropriate integration, the obtained two-point and four-point correlation functions are in agreement with quantum field theory's ones in the leading-logarithm approximation.</description>

      <title>On three-dimensional ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetry: maximally supersymmetric backgrounds and massive deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the $SO ({\cal N})$ superspace formulation for $\cal N$-extended conformal supergravity in three dimensions, we derive all maximally supersymmetric backgrounds in the ${\cal N} =4$ case. The specific feature of this choice is that the so-called super Cotton tensor $X^{IJKL} = X^{[IJKL]}$, which exists for ${\cal N} \geq 4$, is equivalent to the scalar $X$ defined by $X^{IJKL} = \varepsilon^{IJKL} X$. This scalar may be used as a deformation parameter. In the family of $(p,q)$ anti-de Sitter (AdS) superspaces with $p+q=4$, it is known that $X\neq 0$ exists only if $p=4$ and $q=0$. In general, the $(4,0)$ AdS superspaces are characterised by the structure group $SL(2,{\mathbb R}) \times SO (4)$ and their geometry is determined by two constant parameters, $S$ and $X$, of which the former determines the AdS curvature, while the $R$-symmetry curvature is determined by the parameters $(X+2S)$ and $(X-2S)$ in the left and right sectors of $SU(2)_{\rm L} \times SU(2)_{\rm R}$, respectively. Setting $S=0$ leads to the so-called deformed ${\cal N}=4$ Minkowski superspace ${\mathbb M}^{3|8}_X$ introduced thirteen years ago. We construct general interacting supersymmetric field theories in ${\mathbb M}^{3|8}_X$ and demonstrate that they originate as massive deformations of the following two families of ${\cal N} =4$ theories in standard Minkowski superspace ${\mathbb M}^{3|8}$: (i) ${\cal N}=4$ superconformal field theories; and (ii) ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric gauge theories in ${\mathbb M}^{3|8}$ which are not superconformal but possess the $R$-symmetry group $SU(2)_{\rm L} \times SU(2)_{\rm R}$. Extensions of the theories in (ii) to ${\mathbb M}^{3|8}_X$ necessarily contain Chern-Simons terms at the component level. We also demonstrate the generation of topologically massive ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric gauge theories from radiative corrections in the hypermultiplet sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a new class of AdS$_3$ solutions in massive type IIA supergravity preserving $\mathcal{N} = (0,6)$ supersymmetry and realising an $\mathfrak{osp}(6|2)$ superconformal algebra. These solutions exhibit an SO(6)-symmetric internal space constructed from a $\mathbb{CP}^3$, and are fully specified by a single cubic function controlling the fluxes and warping. We propose a brane box configuration underlying the solutions from which we construct a two-dimensional quiver gauge theory whose anomaly structure and central charge we analyse, and from which we can realise Seiberg-like dualities as large gauge transformations. The brane box configuration suggests an interpretation of the solutions as dual to surface defects within the ABJ(M) theory. Our findings provide a concrete setting for exploring holography beyond the ABJM vacuum. Remarkably, no explicit field theories are currently known to realise $\mathcal{N} = (0,6)$ supersymmetry in two dimensions, making our setup a promising and largely unexplored direction for field-theoretic investigations.</description>

Abstract: I review the construction of actions for extended geometry from the grading of an underlying tensor hierarchy algebra, which provides the full set of Batalin-Vilkovisky fields. The dynamics is neatly encoded in a complex. This talk, presented at the Corfu Summer Institute 2024, is mainly based on joint work with J. Palmkvist, in particular ref. [1].</description>

      <title>Elliptic leading singularities and canonical integrands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of $\mathrm{dlog}$ integrands with unit leading singularities to the case covering integration of differential forms on elliptic curves. We first construct a special algebraic basis of integrands, including a differential one-form of the second kind, and match it to a Feynman integral ansatz in a suitable parametrization. Integration over a preferred basis cycle reveals their (elliptic) leading singularities. A simple transformation that sets all but one of the elliptic leading singularities to zero and normalizes the remaining one to unity then defines the canonical integrands. In several examples, we observe that the corresponding Feynman integrals satisfy a special form of differential equation that has so far remained unnoticed. It factorizes component-wise either $\epsilon$ or $1 - n\,\epsilon$ with integer $n$, and evaluates order-by-order in $\epsilon$ to pure functions. We conjecture that our integrand-level construction universally leads to such differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove (Theorem 1.1.) that a class of quasi-Einstein structures on closed manifolds must admit a Killing vector field. This extends the rigidity theorem obtained in \cite{DL23} for the extremal black hole horizons and completes the classification of compact quasi-Einstein surfaces in this class. We also explore special cases of the quasi-Einstein equations related to integrability and the Hitchin equations, as well as to Einstein-Weyl structures and Kazdan-Warner type PDEs. This leads to novel explicit examples of quasi-Einstein structures on (non-compact) surfaces and on $S^2 \times S^1$.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Hermitian topology from non-Hermitian knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermiticity of the system gives rise to a distinct knot topology in the complex eigenvalue spectrum, which has no counterpart in Hermitian systems. In contrast, the singular values of a non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian are always real by definition, meaning they can also be interpreted as the eigenvalues of some underlying Hermitian Hamiltonian. In this work, we demonstrate that if the singular values of a NH Hamiltonian are treated as eigenvalues of prototype translational-invariant Hermitian models that undergo a topological phase transition between two distinct phases, the complex eigenvalues of the NH Hamiltonian will also undergo a transition between different knot structures. We emphasize that the choice of a NH Hamiltonian whose singular values match the eigenvalues of a Hermitian model is not unique. However, our study suggests that this connection between the NH and Hermitian models remains robust as long as the periodicity in lattice momentum is same for both. Furthermore, we provide an example showing that a change in the topology of the Hermitian model implies a transition in the underlying NH knot topology, but a change in knot topology does not necessarily signal a topological transition in the Hermitian system.</description>

      <title>Phase-locking in dynamical systems and quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we discuss the Prufer transform that connects the dynamical system on the torus and the Hill equation, which is interpreted as either the equation of motion for the parametric oscillator or the Schrodinger equation with periodic potential. The structure of phase-locking domains in the dynamical system on torus is mapped into the band-gap structure of the Hill equation. For the parametric oscillator, we provide the relation between the non-adiabatic Hannay angle and the Poincare rotation number of the corresponding dynamical system. In terms of quantum mechanics, the integer rotation number is connected to the quantization number via the Milne quantization approach and exact WKB. Using recent results concerning the exact WKB approach in quantum mechanics, we discuss the possible non-perturbative effects in the dynamical systems on the torus and for parametric oscillator. The semiclassical WKB is interpreted in the framework of a slow-fast dynamical system. The link between the classification of the coadjoint Virasoro orbits and the Hill equation yields a classification of the phase-locking domains in the parameter space in terms of the classification of Virasoro orbits. Our picture is supported by numerical simulations for the model of the Josephson junction and Mathieu equation.</description>

      <title>Application of the Holographic Equation of State for Numerical Modeling of the Evolution of Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for numerical modeling of the nuclear matter properties within the framework of relativistic heavy-ion collisions using a holographic equation of state. Model's free parameters are calibrated using lattice results for quark masses approximating physical values and adjusted to match the Regge spectra of $\rho$ mesons. Numerical simulations are performed using the iEBE-MUSIC framework, which incorporates the MUSIC relativistic hydrodynamics solver. We modify the code by implementing a tabulated holographic equation of state, enabling simulations of quark-gluon plasma evolution with dynamically generated initial conditions via the 3D Monte Carlo Glauber Model. Finally, the spectra of produced hadrons are computed using a hybrid iSS+UrQMD approach at the freeze-out stage.</description>

      <title>Probing the Quantum Speed Limit and Entanglement in Flavor Oscillations of Neutrino-Antineutrino System in Curved Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a spinning primordial black hole (PBH) described by the Kerr metric in Kerr-Schild polar coordinates (KSP). We derive an analytical expression for the four-vector gravitational potential in the underlying Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian using these coordinates. This gravitational potential introduces an axial vector term in the Dirac equation in curved spacetime. We find that the magnitudes of the temporal and spatial components of the four-vector gravitational potential are significantly affected by the angle of the position vector of the spinor with respect to the spin axis of the PBH, its radial distance from the PBH, and the strength of the specific angular momentum of the PBH. These potentials modify the effective mass matrix of the neutrino-antineutrino system and significantly affect the transition probabilities during the flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system. We then use the transition probability to investigate the quantum speed limit time (QSLT) bound ratio for the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system in curved spacetime. This helps us estimate how quickly the initial neutrino flavor state evolves over time under the influence of the gravitational field. Finally, we discuss quantum correlations such as entanglement entropy during the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system near a spinning PBH.</description>

      <title>F-Term Hybrid Inflation, Metastable Cosmic Strings and Low Reheating in View of ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the formation of metastable cosmic strings in a left-right unified theory. The produced monopoles are diluted by a stage of F-term hybrid inflation (FHI) which is realized consistently with the SUSY breaking and a global $U(1)$ $R$ symmetry in the context of a $U(1)_{\rm R}\times U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of MSSM. The hidden-sector Kaehler manifold enjoys an enhanced $SU(1,1)/U(1)$ symmetry with the scalar curvature determined by the achievement of a SUSY-breaking de Sitter vacuum without ugly tuning. FHI turns out to be compatible with data -- including the recent ACT results --, provided that the magnitude of the emergent soft tadpole term is confined in the range $(0.1-70)$ TeV, and it is accompanied with the production of cosmic strings. Their dimensionless tension $G\mu_{\rm cs}\simeq(1-11)\cdot10^{-8}$ interprets the present observations from PTA experiments on the stochastic background of gravitational waves. The $\mu$ parameter of MSSM arises by appropriately adapting the Giudice-Masiero mechanism and facilitates the out-of-equilibrium decay of the $R$ saxion at a reheat temperature lower than about $34$ GeV. The SUSY mass scale turns out to lie in the PeV region.</description>

      <title>Horizon-Driven Expansion from Hawking-Like Radiation: A Curvature-Coupled Cosmological Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a cosmological model in which the expansion of the universe is driven by a Hawking-like influx of energy across the cosmological horizon, rather than from a fixed cosmological constant. In place of a cosmological constant, we introduce source terms in the Friedmann and continuity equations that couple horizon curvature to matter and radiation densities. At high curvature (large Hubble parameter $H$), this influx strongly replenishes matter and radiation, slowing their adiabatic dilution. As curvature diminishes, the influx weakens, smoothly transitioning into standard radiation- or matter-dominated eras. This mechanism naturally suppresses spatial curvature without requiring an inflationary phase. It may also produce near-scale-invariant fluctuations via slowly varying horizon thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the emergence of dark phases (dark energy imprints) in the radial wave function of scalar particles. We achieve this by presenting novel solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation in a spherically symmetric spacetime, encompassing a black hole, a quintessential fluid, and a cloud of strings. We determine the exact solution for the spacetime metric, analyze the admissible ranges for its physical parameters, and discuss the event horizon formation. Subsequently, we detail the solution of the Klein-Gordon equation and explore three distinct cases of dark phases, corresponding to the quintessence state parameter $\alpha_{Q}$ taking the values $0$, $1/2$, and $1$. Notably, the case where $\alpha_{Q} = 1$ holds particular significance due to current observational constraints on dark energy.</description>

      <title>Hydrostatic equilibrium in multi-Weyl semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the hydrostatic equilibrium of multi-Weyl semimetals, a class of systems with Weyl-like quasi-particles but anisotropic dispersion relation $\omega^2 \sim k_\parallel^2 + k_\perp^{2n}$, with $n$ a possitive integer. A characteristic feature of multi-Weyl systems is the lack of Lorentz invariance, instead, they possess the reduced spacetime symmetry $(SO(1,1)\times SO(2))\ltimes \mathbb R^4$. In this work we propose a covariant formulation for the low energy theory, allowing for a minimal coupling of the fermion field to external geometric background and $U(1)$ gauge field. The non-Lorentzian structure of the field theory demands introducing an Aristotelian spacetime analogous to the so-called stringy Newton-Cartan geometry \cite{Andringa:2012uz}. Our proposal allows for a systematic study of the hydrostatic properties via the derivation of the partition function of the system. In addition to multi-Weyl models, our formulation can be applied to systems with similar spacetime symmetry groups, such as Bjorken flow.</description>

      <title>Beyond Robertson-Schr\"odinger: A General Uncertainty Relation Unveiling Hidden Noncommutative Trade-offs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a universal strengthening of the Robertson-Schr\''odinger uncertainty relation, revealing a previously overlooked trade-off of genuinely quantum origin, particularly as the state becomes more mixed. Remarkably, this generalized bound supplements the standard commutator term and the covariance term with an additional positive contribution that depends on the commutator of observables. The relation also rigorously proves and extends a conjectured uncertainty relation previously proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 062215 (2024)]. For two-level quantum systems, the inequality becomes an exact equality for any state and any pair of observables, establishing that the bound is tight in the strongest possible sense.</description>

      <title>Static black hole horizons in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite previous results that rule out the possibility of a static black hole horizon in cosmology we present a black hole metric that has a static horizon whilst mimicking the cosmological behavior at large scales away from the black hole horizon. By a suitable choice of coordinates, we show that it is possible to have a static black hole horizon in cosmology that does not suffer from issues like singularities in curvature invariants at the horizon. The resulting metric is consistent with the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric for constant Hubble parameter. It should be noted that this metric does not lead to isotropic pressure, i.e. $p_\perp\neq p_r$ for radial distances comparable to Schwarzschild radius, but for large $r$ the stress tensor (assuming general relativity) tends to the cosmological value. Turning to a more realistic framework, we study the cases of black hole$+$cosmological matter and black hole$+$matter$+$cosmological constant where we assume the pressure component takes its cosmological value and show that although the resulting metric does not have a static horizon, the physical radius of the apparent horizon can tend to a constant value for large cosmological time. This metric does not suffer from issues like a singular horizon for asymptotically vanishing Hubble parameter.</description>

      <title>Effective Metric Description of Charged Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charged black holes arise as solutions of General Relativity (GR) coupled to Maxwell theory. As functions of the mass and charge, they can exhibit extremal behavior, in which case they are stable against thermal decay. (Quantum) corrections to GR are expected to alter the classical features of these objects, especially near extremality. To capture such effects in a model-independent way, we extend the Effective Metric Description (EMD) previously introduced in [Phys.Rev.D 109 (2024) 2, 024045, Eur.Phys.J.C 84 (2024) 12, 1273] for spherically symmetric and static black holes. The EMD parametrizes deformations of the metric in terms of physical quantities, such as the radial spatial distance to the event horizon. While the latter is still viable for non-extremal charged black holes, we argue that the proper time of a free-falling observer is better suited in the extremal case: we derive the necessary conditions for the parameters of such an EMD for constructing a consistent space-time in the vicinity of the (extremal) horizon. Finally, we illustrate our framework through a concrete example, and mention implications of the Weak Gravity Conjecture on the effective metric parameters.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the conformal Einstein equation with a positive cosmological constant to extract fall-off conditions of the gravitational fields. The fall-off conditions are consistent with a finite, non-trivial presymplectic current on the future boundary of de Sitter. Hence our result allows a non-zero gravitational flux across the boundary of the de Sitter. We present an explicit gauge-free computation to show that the Gibbons-Hawking boundary term, counterterm in the action, and fall-off condition of gravitational field in conformal Einstein equation are crucial to reproduce the finite symplectic flux.</description>

      <title>Chaos Around the Kerr Black Hole: its Effects on Entropy and the Shadow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massless or massive particles in unstable orbits around a Kerr black hole exhibit chaotic motion when perturbed. They either plunge into the black hole or escape to infinity after making some oscillations around the equatorial plane. In both of these cases, chaotic motion causes information production. In the case of the photons that escape to infinity, it was recently suggested that this information can be used to resolve the subring structure of the shadow image and obtain more precise data about the black hole mass and spin. Here, we extend this method to obtain more precise results by including the non-equatorial contributions to the Lyapunov exponents. In the other case of massive particles that plunge into the Kerr black hole, we show that the associated Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy derived from the Lyapunov exponents can be interpreted in the context of black hole thermodynamics and that it obeys Bekenstein's bound on the entropy of a physical material system. Thus, the perturbed unstable orbits, either ending inside the black hole or at the observer's screen, have physical consequences.</description>

      <title>Viability of warm inflation with standard model interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimal warm inflation scenario proposed in Ref. [1] -- featuring an axion-like inflaton coupled to Standard Model (SM) gluons via the standard interaction $\phi G \tilde G$ -- offers a compelling bridge between inflationary dynamics and SM particle content. While the model retains only the inflaton as a beyond-SM field, its original analysis relied on some approximate treatments of warm inflation's (WI) dynamics. Here, we revisit this scenario using WI2easy, a precision computational tool for WI dynamics [2], to rigorously evaluate the model's viability and full range of model's parameters compatible with the observational parameters. Overall, we find that the results of Ref. [1] hold, but with significant differences in the weak and strong dissipative regimes of WI.</description>

      <title>There is no boundary problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In General Relativity and gauge field theory, one often encounters a claim, which may be called the boundary problem, according to which "boundaries break diffeomorphism and gauge symmetries". We argue that this statement has the same conceptual structure as the hole argument, and is thus likewise defused by the point-coincidence argument: We show that the boundary problem dissolves once it is understood that a physical region, thus its boundary, is relationally and invariantly defined. This insight can be technically implemented via the Dressing Field Method, a systematic tool to exhibit the gauge-invariant content of general-relativistic gauge field theories, whereby physical field-theoretical degrees of freedoms co-define each other and define, coordinatize, the physical spacetime. We illustrate our claim with a simple application to the case of General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Cosmic superstrings in large volume compactifications: PTAs, LISA and time-varying tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) from cosmic superstrings offers one of the few known possibilities to test String Theory within current experimental reach. However, in order to be compatible with the existing constraints, the tension of a cosmic superstring network is required to lie several orders of magnitude below the Planck scale. This is naturally realized in string compactifications where the volume of the extra dimensions is parametrically large (in string units). We estimate the GW spectrum arising from cosmic superstrings in such scenarios, providing analytical formulae as well as numerical results. Crucially, we do so within a fully-fledged string cosmology, taking into account various modified cosmological epochs (such as kination or early matter domination) induced by the presence of moduli and a time-dependent string tension. We show that part of the spectrum generically lies within reach of LISA and ET, with a large class of models predicting a characteristic drop in the amplitude which may be robustly probed by LISA. The corresponding signal would encode information on the dynamics of moduli and reheating. On the other hand, the ultra-high frequency part of the spectrum can be significantly enhanced by a long, early phase of kination with time-varying tension, yielding a spectral index unique to this set-up.</description>

Abstract: We compute the one-loop $2 \rightarrow 2$ scattering amplitude of massless scalars on the world volume of an infinite $D = 11$ supermembrane quantized in the static gauge. The resulting expression is manifestly finite and turns out to be much simpler than in the bosonic membrane case in arXiv:2308.12189 being simply proportional to the tree-level scattering amplitude. We also consider the case of $\mathbb{R}^{1,1} \times S^1$ membrane with one dimension compactified on a circle of radius R and demonstrate how the supermembrane scattering amplitude reduces to the one on an infinite $D = 10$ Green-Schwarz superstring in the limit of R $\rightarrow 0$.</description>

Abstract: This is an elementary set of lectures on generalized global symmetries originally given at the Jena TPI School on QFT and Holography, designed to be accessible to the reader with a basic knowledge of quantum field theory. Topics covered include an introduction to higher-form symmetries with selected applications: Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories in the continuum and on the lattice, statistical mechanical systems, the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly from the point of view of non-invertible symmetry, and magnetohydrodynamics. Mathematical formalism is kept to a minimum and an emphasis is placed on understanding the global symmetry structure present in well-known models.</description>

      <title>An Infrared On-Shell Action and its Implications for Soft Charge Fluctuations in Asymptotically Flat Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the infrared on-shell action of Einstein gravity in asymptotically flat spacetimes, obtaining an effective, gauge-invariant boundary action for memory and shockwave spacetimes. We show that the phase space is in both cases parameterized by the leading soft variables in asymptotically flat spacetimes, thereby extending the equivalence between shockwave and soft commutators to spacetimes with non-vanishing Bondi mass. We then demonstrate that our on-shell action is equal to three quantities studied separately in the literature: $(i)$ the soft supertranslation charge; $(ii)$ the shockwave effective action, or equivalently the modular Hamiltonian; and $(iii)$ the soft effective action. Finally, we compute the quantum fluctuations in the soft supertranslation charge and, assuming the supertranslation parameter may be promoted to an operator, we obtain an area law, consistent with earlier results showing that the modular Hamiltonian has such fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the flat limit of AdS/CFT from the point of view of geodesics in AdS. We show that the flat space scattering amplitudes can be constructed from operator insertions where the geodesics of the particles corresponding to the operators hit the conformal boundary of AdS. Further, we compute the Li\'enard-Wiechert solutions in AdS by boosting a static charge using AdS isometries and show that the solutions are antipodally matched between two regions, separated by a global time difference of $\Delta\tau=\pi$. Going to the boundary of AdS along null geodesics, in the flat limit, this antipodal matching leads to the flat space antipodal matching near spatial infinity.</description>

      <title>On-shell approach to scalar hair in spinning binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12909v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an on-shell description of spinning binary systems in gravitational theories where compact objects display scalar hair. The framework involves matter particles of arbitrary spin which, in addition to the minimal coupling to gravitons, are conformally coupled to a massless scalar mediating non-standard interactions. We use the unitary factorization techniques to derive the on-shell amplitudes relevant for emission of scalars and gravitons in matter scattering, paying attention to parametrize the freedom due to contact terms. Using the KMOC formalism, these amplitudes allow one to derive succinct expressions for the radiation waveforms at the leading post-Minkowskian order, together with the associated memory effects. Furthermore, we compute the power emitted via gravitational and scalar radiation in hyperbolic encounters of compact objects. After a continuation to bound orbits, these are compared with results obtained in specific scalar-tensor theories where black holes exhibit scalar hair, such as the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet or dynamical Chern-Simons theories. Finally, we identify possible deformations from the conformal coupling that can contribute to radiation observables at the same post-Newtonian order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate how the marginal beta deformation of the ${N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory manifests within the context of the topological B-model in the twistor space $\mathbb{CP}^{3|4}$. We begin by identifying the beta deformation as states living in a specific irreducible representation of the superconformal algebra. Then, we compute the ghost number two elements of the BRST cohomology of the topological model. A gauge-fixing procedure is applied to these states, allowing us to identify the elements living in the irreducible representation that characterizes the beta deformation. Based on this identification, we proceed to write the deformed topological action, and the corresponding deformed BRST operator.</description>

Based on this, we propose topological vertex formalism with an O7$^+$-plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near the horizon of extremal charged black holes, an accidental symmetry is known to act on zero-temperature perturbations, transforming them into finite-temperature ones. In this paper, we uncover the corresponding accidental symmetry of the vacuum Einstein equation near the horizon of extremal spinning black holes. To do so, we first devise a new method of deriving the symmetry near the ${\rm AdS}_2 \times S^2$ near-horizon geometry of extreme Reissner-Nordstr\"om, using a new scaling coordinate transformation that unifies the near-horizon limits of extremal and near-extremal black holes in a way that is regular at zero temperature. We use our new method to obtain the accidental symmetry in the near-horizon of extreme Kerr (NHEK). We show that accidental symmetries combine neatly with the near-horizon isometries inside a Virasoro algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extract the complex frequency of the lowest quasi-normal mode from the holographically computed entropy density near thermodynamic equilibrium. The system consists of a purely thermal Supersymmetric Yang-Mills N=4 plasma in homogeneous isotropization dynamics. The initial state is far-from-equilibrium, proceeding to thermalization over time. The system evolves to equilibrium entropy forming a stairway pattern. The analysis reveals that the rate of increase of the stairway is twice the decay rate of the lowest quasi-normal mode. This leads us to propose a model explaining how this information is encoded in entropy. The model is extended to consider finite temperature, R-charge density and scalar condensate of the medium, disclosing an additional feature. The system's main dissipation channel may shift to one driven by the scalar condensate, depending on the chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Phases of String Stars in the Presence of a Spatial Circle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In string theory, black holes are expected to transition into string stars as their Hawking temperatures approach the Hagedorn temperature. We study string stars and their phase transitions in the Euclidean spacetime $\mathbb{R}^d\times\mathbb{S}_\tau^1\times\mathbb{S}_z^1$. Using the Horowitz-Polchinski (HP) effective field theory, we discover novel solutions for $d=2$. The uniform string star exhibits a scaling symmetry that results in the absence of a critical point for its transition into the non-uniform solution. For $d=4$, we show that quartic corrections to the effective action resolve the mass degeneracy of uniform string stars. At $d=5$, we find that as non-uniformity increases, the quartic terms become significant (while higher-order terms remain negligible) and reverse the direction of temperature variation, leading to a swallowtail-type phase diagram in the canonical ensemble. Extending the quartic-corrected EFT to $d=6$, we find that string stars with small non-uniformity dominate the microcanonical ensemble but not the canonical ensemble, similar to the $d=5$ case. However, in the microcanonical ensemble, the uniform string star is anomalously (un)stable when the spatial circle is larger (smaller) than the critical size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a specific type of atomic Higgsings of the 6d $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ theories, which we call the induced flows. For the conformal matter theory associated with a pair of nilpotent orbits, the induced flows are given by the inductions of the orbits. We also consider the induced flows for the orbi-instanton theories (as well as some little string theories) that are associated with the homomorphisms from the discrete subgroups of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ to $E_8$. This gives a physical definition of the inductions among these discrete homomorphisms, analogous to the inductions of the nilpotent orbits. We analyze the Higgs branch dimensions, the monotonicity of the Weyl anomalies (or the 2-group structure constants for LSTs) and the brane pictures under the induced flows.</description>

In addition to canonical bosonic time variables $p_k$ new Grassmann time variables $\theta_k$ are introduced, and the Hamiltonian is represented as a differential operator acting on a space of functions of both types of variables $p_k$ and $\theta_k$. Eigenfunctions for this Hamiltonian are a suitable generalization of Macdonald polynomials to super-Macdonald polynomials discussed earlier in the literature. Peculiarities of the construction in comparison to the canonical bosonic case are discussed.</description>

      <title>Holographic timelike entanglement and $c$ theorem for supersymmetric QFTs in ($ 0+1 $)d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a holographic set up that computes timelike Entanglement Entropy (tEE) in $ (0+1) $d QFTs preserving some amount of SUSY. The first example we consider is that of $\mathcal{N}=2$ matrix models with massive deformations. These are dual to non-Abelian T-dual of $AdS_5 \times S^5$ that asymptotes to \emph{smeared} D0 branes. The second example, that we consider is of $ \mathcal{N}=4 $ superconformal quantum mechanical quivers in ($ 0+1 $)d that are dual to a class of type IIB backgrounds with an $ AdS_2 $ factor. In both of these examples, tEE reveals a remarkable similarity with holographic $ c $ function pertaining to a RG flow. We further compute the complexity in these models, which also reveals an identical behaviour indicating the fact that tEE is a measure of number of degrees of freedom for these ($ 0+1 $)d SQFTs in a RG flow from UV to deep IR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the two-brane model and show that any field is settled on both neighboring branes, thus forming two independent effective fields with different masses. The hierarchy of the energy scales and the subsequent fine-tuning can be achieved for a brane populated by observers. The neighboring brane is thus populated by extremely massive fields. The electromagnetic field is uniformly distributed over the extra dimensions, preserving charge universality in 4D physics.
  It is shown that the particles on different branes interact by exchanging photons and gravitons, which could explain the phenomena such as ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and dark matter. The latter consists of heavy electrons that are located on a brane free of the observers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by group-theoretical questions that arise in the context of asymptotic symmetries in gravity, we study model spaces and their quantization from the viewpoint of constrained Hamiltonian systems. More precisely, we propose a definition of a model space for a generic Lie group $G$ as a suitable second class constrained system associated to the cotangent bundle $T^{*}G$. Before turning to the non-compact infinite-dimensional groups relevant in the gravitational setting, we work out all details in the simplest case of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$. Besides recovering well-known results on the quantum theory of angular momentum from a unified perspective, the analysis sheds some light on the definition and properties of spin-weighted/monopole spherical harmonics.</description>

      <title>Quantum energies of solitons with different topological charges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vacuum polarization energy is the leading quantum correction to the classical energy of a soliton. We study this energy for two-component solitons in one space dimension as a function of the soliton's topological charge. We find that both the classical and the vacuum polarization energies are linear functions of the topological charge with a small offset. Because the combination of the classical and quantum offsets determines the binding energies, either all higher charge solitons are energetically bound or they are all unbound, depending on model parameters. This linearity persists even when the field configurations are very different from those of isolated solitons, and would not be apparent from an analysis of their bound state spectra alone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the complete trans-series solution for the (non-relativistic) moments of the rapidity density in the Lieb-Liniger model. The trans-series is written explicitly in terms of a perturbative basis, which can be obtained from the already known perturbative expansion of the density by solving several ordinary differential equations. Unknown integration constants are fixed from Volin's method. We have checked that our solution satisfies the analytical consistency requirements including the newly derived resurgence relations and agrees with the high precision numerical solution. Our results also provides the full analytic trans-series for the capacitance of the coaxial circular plate capacitor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The amplitudes of the non-linear sigma model can be obtained from those of Tr($\Phi^3$) theory by sending the kinematic (Mandelstam) variables to infinity in a certain direction. In this paper we characterize the behavior of Tr($\Phi^3$) amplitudes under a general class of large kinematic shifts called $g$-vector shifts. The objects that live in this world at infinity retain certain key amplitude-like properties, most notably factorization, and admit descriptions in terms of polytopes, but they are not generally amplitudes of any cognizable theory. We identify particular $g$-vector shifts that lead at infinity to mixed amplitudes involving two pions and any number of scalars, allowing us to provide polytopal descriptions of these amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this research, the nonstandard form of the Higgs Lagrangian constructed by the inverse problem of calculus of variations is applied to calculate the fermion mass spectra, the weak mixing angle, and $W/Z$ masses, where the SU(2) and U(1) gauge couplings are identical and all Yukawa couplings can be equal to the Higgs self couplings. In the large background field limit, all particles decouple and the Lagrangian itself remains renormalizable. We discuss the potential of the results in this work to incorporate with the quark mass matrix, the hierarchy problem and the one-loop effective potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We clarify the origin of magic angles in twisted multilayered graphene using Yang-Mills flows in two dimensions. We relate the effective Hamiltonian describing the electrons in the multilayered graphene to the ${\bar\partial}_{A}$ operator on a two dimensional torus coupled to an $SU(N)$ gauge field. Despite the absence of a characteristic class such as $c_{1}$ relevant for the quantum Hall effect, we show that there are topological invariants associated with the zero modes occuring in a family of Hamiltonians. The flatbands in the spectrum of the effective Hamiltonian are associated with Yang-Mills connections, studied by M.Atiyah and R.Bott long time ago. The emergent $U(1)$ magnetic field with nonzero flux is presumably responsible for the observed Hall effect in the absence of (external) magnetic field. We provide a numeric algorithm transforming the original single-particle Hamiltonian to the direct sum of ${\bar\partial}_{A}$ operators coupled to abelian gauge fields with non-zero $c_1$'s. Our perspective gives a simple bound for magic angles: if the gauge field $A({\alpha})$ is such that the YM energy $\Vert F_{A({\alpha})} \Vert^2$ is smaller than that of $U(1)$ magnetic flux embedded into $SU(2)$, then $\alpha$ is not magic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17155v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Immersion (i.e., local embedding) is relevant to the physics of topologically ordered phases through the entanglement bootstrap. An annulus can be immersed in a disk or a sphere as a "figure-8", which cannot be smoothly deformed to an embedded annulus. We investigate a simple problem: is there an Abelian state on the immersed figure-8 annulus, locally indistinguishable from the ground state of the background physical system? We show that if the answer is affirmative, a strong sense of isomorphism must hold: two homeomorphic immersed regions must have isomorphic information convex sets, even if they cannot smoothly deform to each other on the background physical system. We explain why to care about strong isomorphism in physical systems with anyons and give proof in the context of Abelian anyon theory. We further discuss a connection between immersed annuli and anyon transportation in the presence of topological defects. In the appendices, we discuss related problems in broader contexts.</description>

Abstract: A Planck scale inflationary era -- in a quantum gravity theory predicting discreteness of quantum geometry at the fundamental scale -- produces the scale invariant spectrum of inhomogeneities with very small tensor-to-scalar ratio of perturbations and a hot big bang leading to a natural dark matter genesis scenario. Here we evoke the possibility that some of the major puzzles in cosmology would have an explanation rooted in quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: We give an analytical approximation for the energy spectrum of the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) generated by a broken power-law power spectrum, and find that both the asymptotic power-law tails and the intermediate peak contribute distinct features to the SIGW spectrum. Moreover, the broken power-law power spectrum has abundant near-peak features and our results can be used as a near-peak approximation that covers a wide range of models. Our analytical approximation is useful in the rapid generation of the SIGW energy spectrum, which is beneficial for gravitational wave data analysis.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Quasi-Integrable Equations from traveling-wave data using the Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19014v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing nonlinear partial differential equations and identifying governing equations from observational data. In this study, we apply PINNs to investigate vortex-type solutions of quasi-integrable equations in two spatial dimensions, specifically the Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) and the Regularized Long-Wave (RLW) equations. These equations are toy models for geostrophic shallow water dynamics in planetary atmospheres. We first demonstrate that PINNs can successfully solve these equations in the forward process using a mesh-free approach with automatic differentiation. However, in the inverse process, substantial misidentification occurs due to the structural similarities between the ZK and the RLW equations. To address this issue, we then introduce conservation law-enhanced PINNs, initial condition variations, and a friction-based perturbation approach to improve identification accuracy. Our results show that incorporating small perturbations while preserving conservation laws significantly enhances the resolution of equation identification. These findings may contribute to the broader goal of using deep learning techniques for discovering governing equations in complex fluid dynamical systems, such as Jupiter's Great Red Spot.</description>

      <title>Quantum anomaly triggers the violation of scaling laws in gravitational system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling laws for critical phenomena take pivotal status in almost all branches of physics. However, as scaling laws are commonly guaranteed by the renormalization group theory, systems that violate them have rarely been found. In this letter, we demonstrate that gravitational system can break scaling laws. We derive this result through investigating phase transition and critical phenomenon in a gravitational system with quantum anomaly. For the first time, we outline the key conditions to violate the scaling laws in generic gravitational system viewed from the equation of state $P=P(T,V)$. Our results indicate that quantum effects can magnify the distinctiveness of gravity, which may be significant to understand the microscopic structure of spacetime.</description>

      <title>The Quest for Understanding: The Case of the Upgraded Superconducting Super Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fundamental particle physics is at a cross road. On the one hand the Standard Model successfully accounts for all experimental observations to date. On the other hand the ElectroWeak symmetry breaking mechanism is poorly understood and suggests the existence of new physics within reach of future colliders. Building on LHC experience, a hadron collider using the well established LHC magnet technology in a 90--100km circular ring, can reach the required 50--60TeV energy range and uncover the next layers of reality by the early 2040s.</description>

      <title>Relativistic dissipative fluids in the trace-fixed particle frame: Hyperbolicity, causality, and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a first-order theory of relativistic dissipative fluids in the trace-fixed particle frame, which is similar to Eckart's frame except that the temperature is determined by fixing the trace of the stress-energy tensor. Our theory is hyperbolic and causal provided a single inequality holds. For low wave numbers, the expected damped modes in the shear, acoustic, and heat diffusion channels are recovered. Stability of global equilibria with respect to all wave numbers is also analyzed. The conditions for hyperbolicity, causality and stability are satisfied for a simple gas of hard spheres or disks.</description>

      <title>Relativistic dissipative fluids in the trace-fixed particle frame: Strongly hyperbolic quasi-linear first-order evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we derive a new first-order theory of relativistic dissipative fluids by adopting the trace-fixed particle frame. Whereas in a companion letter we show that this theory is hyperbolic, causal and stable at global equilibrium states, here we prove that the full nonlinear system of equations can be cast into a first-order quasilinear system which is strongly hyperbolic. By rewriting the system in first-order form, auxiliary constraints are introduced. However, we show that these constraints propagate, and thus our theory leads to a well-posed Cauchy problem.</description>

      <title>C-parity, magnetic monopoles and higher frequency gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the spontaneous breaking of $SO(10)$ grand unified symmetry to the left-right symmetric model $SU(3)_c \times SU(3)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$ with C-parity also unbroken [$C$ converts $Q\to -Q$, where $Q$ is the electric charge operator in $SO(10)$.] This breaking produces the topologically stable GUT monopole as well as a GUT scale C-string. The subsequent breaking at an intermediate scale of C-parity produces domain walls bounded by C-strings, found by Kibble, Lazarides and Shafi. A limited number of inflationary $e$-foldings experienced during these breakings can yield an observable number density of primordial GUT monopoles. The C-strings also experience this inflationary phase, and the subsequent string-wall network decays through the emission of gravitational waves. We estimate the gravitational wave spectrum from these composite structures over a range of values of the domain wall tension $\sigma$. Depending on $\sigma$ the spectrum displays a peak in the higher frequency range between $10^2$ to $10^5$ Hz.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric effects of an interacting hadron gas in the presence of an external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hot and dense hadronic medium formed during the heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and Large Hadron Collider energies can show thermoelectric effects in the presence of temperature gradients and nonzero baryon chemical potential. In this article, we study the thermoelectric coefficients of an interacting hot and dense hadron gas using the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation under the relaxation time approximation. We discuss the thermoelectric properties within different frameworks of hardon resonance gas models. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the thermoelectric coefficients become anisotropic, which leads to Hall-like thermoelectric coefficients, namely Nernst coefficients, along with the magneto-Seebeck coefficients. For the first time, we also estimate the Thomson coefficient of the medium, which comes into the picture due to the temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient of the medium. In the context of studying the thermoelectric generator performance, we calculate the values of the thermoelectric figure of merit of the medium.</description>

      <title>The ISW-Lensing Bispectrum &amp; Trispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization fluctuations are correlated with the gravitational lensing potential. Famously, this induces a CMB three-point function, whose shape can be used to constrain dark energy and modifications to gravity. An analogous effect occurs at higher-order, producing an ISW-lensing trispectrum whose amplitude is hitherto unconstrained. We present a detailed discussion of this effect, and define minimum-variance estimators for the ISW-lensing three- and four-point functions. These are implemented within the PolySpec code, and bear strong similarities to the quadratic estimators used in lensing analyses. Applying these tools to Planck, we obtain strong detections of the bispectrum amplitude (consistent with previous works), but find only weak constraints on the trispectrum, due to a strong cancellation between the various ISW-induced contributions. We additionally forecast the constraints from future datasets, finding that (a) simple estimators for the ISW-lensing bispectrum will be severely limited by non-Gaussian modifications to the covariance, and (b) the ISW-lensing trispectrum will be very challenging to detect even with high-resolution future experiments. We finally consider the induced bias on primordial non-Gaussianity amplitudes (and lensing itself), which we show to be large for the bispectrum (as expected) but negligible for the trispectrum.</description>

      <title>Displacement Memory Effect from Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explain the recent results on the displacement memory effect (DME) of plane gravitational waves using supersymmetric quantum mechanics. This novel approach stems from that both the geodesic and the Schr\"odinger equations are Sturm-Liouville boundary value problems. Supersymmetry provides a unified framework for the P\"oschl-Teller and the Scarf profiles and yields the critical values of the associated wave amplitudes for DME in a natural way. Within our framework, we obtain a compact formula for DME in terms of the asymptotic values of the superpotential and the geodesics. In addition, this new technique enables us to build plane and gravitational waves with 2-transverse directions using superpartner potentials. Lastly, we study DME within a singular wave profile inspired by supersymmetric quantum mechanics, which demonstrates the broader applicability of our method.</description>

      <title>Hints for a Geon from Causal Dynamic Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of geons, physical states of self-bound gravitons, has long been proposed. In the context of four-dimensional causal dynamical triangulation simulations we investigate this possibility by measuring curvature-curvature correlators of different gravitational operators. We find a behavior consistent with a massive state, independent of the operators considered, over a certain distance window. While at most a hint, this is tantalizing due to its possible implications for dark matter or (primordial) black holes. We also find indications that the phase of rapid expansion of the obtained de Sitter universe impacts the mass, and relates to quantum fluctuations of space-time.</description>
