      <title>Ex vivo experiment on vertebral body with defect representing bone metastasis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Osteolytic metastases located in the vertebrae reduce strength and enhance the risk of vertebral fractures. This risk can be predicted by means of validated finite element models, but their reproducibility needs to be assessed. For that purpose, experimental data are requested. The aim of this study was to conduct open-access experiments on vertebrae, with artificial defect representing lytic metastasis and using well-defined boundary conditions. Twelve lumbar vertebral bodies (L1) were prepared by removing the cortical endplates and creating defects that represent lytic metastases, by drilling the cancellous bone. Vertebral bodies were scanned using clinical High Resolution peripherical Quantitative Computed Tomography before and after defect creation for 3D reconstruction. The specimens were then tested under compression loading until failure. Surface Digital Image Correlation was used to assess strain fields on the anterior wall of the vertebral body. These data (biomechanics data and the tomographic images needed to build subject-specific models) are shared with the scientific community in order to assess different vertebral models on the same dataset.</description>
