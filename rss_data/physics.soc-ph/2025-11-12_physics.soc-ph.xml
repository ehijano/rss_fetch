      <title>Analyzing the Impact of Service Frequency and On-time Performance on Transit Ridership in Miami-Dade County</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of transit service attributes, focusing on service frequency and on-time performance (OTP), on bus ridership in Miami-Dade County. We obtained route-level ridership from automated passenger counter (APC) data and service performance metrics from the General Transit Feed Specification Real Time (GTFS-RT) data. The panel dataset allows us to effectively isolate the independent effects of OTP and frequency on bus ridership, contributing to a better understanding of how to improve service quality and support ridership. Our analysis examines both a pre-COVID period (January 2018-December 2019) and a post-COVID recovery period (July 2021-July 2023). Descriptive analysis reveals a steady ridership decline before the pandemic, followed by a sharp drop during the pandemic and a gradual recovery to pre-pandemic levels by late 2022. This recovery, however, varied by route and was accompanied by significant temporal fluctuations in service performance measures. To analyze these dynamics, we developed two-way fixed effects (2FE) models. Model outputs show that while frequency consistently influences ridership over time, OTP becomes an increasingly important determinant in the post-COVID recovery period. The observed significant interaction between frequency and OTP in the recovery period further suggests that improving reliability is particularly effective on frequent routes. Our study also highlights the need for targeted ridership-boosting strategies that differ by time of day, with a focus on punctuality during AM-peak and frequency during midday and PM-peak, to better support ridership growth and improve network performance.</description>

      <title>How Fixed-Amount Transactions and Liquidity Constraints Amplify Wealth Inequality: A Kinetic Model Deviating from the Maximum Entropy Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the emergence of wealth inequality through a minimalist kinetic exchange model that incorporates two fundamental economic features: fixed-amount transactions and hard budget constraints. In contrast to the maximum entropy principle, which predicts an exponential Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution with moderate inequality for unconstrained wealth exchange, we demonstrate that these realistic trading rules drive the system toward a highly unequal steady state. We develop a self-consistent mean-field theory, deriving a master equation where agent income follows a Poisson process coupled to the poverty rate. Numerical solution reveals a stationary distribution characterized by a substantial pauper class, high Gini coefficient, and exponential tail--significantly deviating from the maximum entropy benchmark. Agent-based simulations confirm these findings. We identify the poverty trap as the key mechanism: the liquidity constraint creates asymmetric economic agency, where zero-wealth agents become passive recipients, unable to participate in wealth circulation. This work establishes that substantial inequality can emerge spontaneously from equal-opportunity exchanges under basic economic constraints, without requiring agent heterogeneity or multiplicative advantage, providing a mechanistic foundation for understanding poverty as an emergent property of exchange rules.</description>

      <title>Metros reduce car use in European cities but trams do not</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the evident drawbacks, car ownership and usage continue to rise globally, leading to increased pollution and urban sprawl. As alternatives, Active Mobility and Public Transport are promoted for their health, economic, and environmental benefits. However, the efficiency of Public Transport varies widely. Metro systems, in particular, offer a high-capacity, long-distance solution, but they are expensive and only found in a limited number of cities. Trams, on the other hand, may serve as a substitute. This study compares the modal share in European cities, analysing the differences between those that have a metro, a tram, or neither. The analysis draws on a comprehensive dataset from CitiesMoving.com, which compiles and harmonises mobility surveys from around the world according to the ABC framework (A for Active mobility, B for Bus and other forms of Public Transport, and C for Cars). Findings reveal that cities with a metro have a significantly lower share of car journeys than those with only a tram or no rail system.</description>

      <title>A High-Scale Assessment of Social Media and Mainstream Media in Scientific Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication of scientific knowledge beyond the walls of science is key to science's societal impact. Media channels play sizable roles in disseminating new scientific ideas about human health, economic welfare, and government policy as well as responses to emergent challenges such as climate change. Indeed, effectively communicating science to the public helps inform society's decisions on scientific and technological policies, the value of science, and investment in research. At the same time, the rise of social media has greatly changed communication systems, which may substantially affect the public's interface with science. Examining 20.9 million scientific publications, we compare research coverage in social media and mainstream media in a broad corpus of scientific work. We find substantial shifts in the scale, impact, and heterogeneity of scientific coverage. First, social media significantly alters what science is, and is not, covered. Whereas mainstream media accentuates eminence in the coverage of science and focuses on specific fields, social media more evenly sample research according to field, institutional rank, journal, and demography, increasing the scale of scientific ideas covered relative to mainstream outlets more than eightfold. Second, despite concerns about the quality of science represented in social media, we find that social media typically covers scientific works that are impactful and novel within science. Third, scientists on social media, as experts in their domains, tend to surface high-impact research in their own fields while sampling widely across research institutions. Contrary to prevalent observations about social media, these findings reveal that social media expands and diversifies science reporting by highlighting high-impact research and bringing a broader array of scholars, institutions and scientific concepts into public view.</description>

      <title>Effects of higher-order interactions and homophily on information access inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spread of information through socio-technical systems determines which individuals are the first to gain access to opportunities and insights. Yet, the pathways through which information flows can be skewed, leading to systematic differences in access across social groups. These inequalities remain poorly characterized in settings involving nonlinear social contagion and higher-order interactions that exhibit homophily. We introduce a enerative model for hypergraphs with hyperedge homophily, a hyperedge size-dependent property, and tunable degree distribution, called the $\texttt{H3}$ model, along with a model for nonlinear social contagion that incorporates asymmetric transmission between in-group and out-group nodes. Using stochastic simulations of a social contagion process on hypergraphs from the $\texttt{H3}$ model and diverse empirical datasets, we show that the interaction between social contagion dynamics and hyperedge homophily -- an effect unique to higher-order networks due to its dependence on hyperedge size -- can critically shape group-level differences in information access. By emphasizing how hyperedge homophily shapes interaction patterns, our findings underscore the need to rethink socio-technical system design through a higher-order perspective and suggest that dynamics-informed, targeted interventions at specific hyperedge sizes, embedded in a platform architecture, offer a powerful lever for reducing inequality.</description>

      <title>Sub-exponential Growth of New Words and Names Online: A Piecewise Power-Law Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diffusion of ideas and language in society has conventionally been described by S-shaped models, such as the logistic curve. However, the role of sub-exponential growth -- a slower-than-exponential pattern known in epidemiology -- has been largely overlooked in broader social phenomena. Here, we present a piecewise power-law model to characterize complex growth curves with a few parameters. We systematically analyzed a large-scale dataset of approximately one billion Japanese blog articles linked to Wikipedia vocabulary, and observed consistent patterns in web search trend data (English, Spanish, and Japanese). Our analysis of 2,963 items, selected for reliable estimation (e.g., sufficient duration/peak, monotonic growth), reveals that 1,625 (55%) diffusion patterns without abrupt level shifts were adequately described by one or two segments. For single-segment curves, we found that (i) the mode of the shape parameter $\alpha$ was near 0.5, indicating prevalent sub-exponential growth; (ii) the peak diffusion scale is primarily determined by the growth rate $R$, with minor contributions from $\alpha$ or the duration $T$; and (iii) $\alpha$ showed a tendency to vary with the nature of the topic, being smaller for niche/local topics and larger for widely shared ones. Furthermore, a micro-behavioral model of outward (stranger) vs. inward (community) contact suggests that $\alpha$ can be interpreted as an index of the preference for outward-oriented communication. These findings suggest that sub-exponential growth is a common pattern of social diffusion, and our model provides a practical framework for consistently describing, comparing, and interpreting complex and diverse growth curves.</description>
