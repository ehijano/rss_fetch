      <title>A novel IR-SRGAN assisted super-resolution evaluation of photothermal coherence tomography for impact damage in toughened thermoplastic CFRP laminates under room temperature and low temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating impact-induced damage in composite materials under varying temperature conditions is essential for ensuring structural integrity and reliable performance in aerospace, polar, and other extreme-environment applications. As matrix brittleness increases at low temperatures, damage mechanisms shift: impact events that produce only minor delaminations at ambient conditions can trigger extensive matrix cracking, fiber/matrix debonding, or interfacial failure under severe cold loads, thereby degrading residual strength and fatigue life. Precision detection and quantification of subsurface damage features (e.g., delamination area, crack morphology, interface separation) are critical for subsequent mechanical characterization and life prediction. In this study, infrared thermography (IRT) coupled with a newly developed frequency multiplexed photothermal correlation tomography (FM-PCT) is employed to capture three-dimensional subsurface damage signatures with depth resolution approaching that of X-ray micro-computed tomography. However, the inherent limitations of IRT, including restricted frame rate and lateral thermal diffusion, reduce spatial resolution and thus the accuracy of damage size measurement. To address this, we develop a new transfer learning-based infrared super-resolution generative adversarial network (IR-SRGAN) that enhances both lateral and depth-resolved imaging fidelity based on limited thermographic datasets.</description>

      <title>Thermal diffusivity characterization of impacted composites using evaporative cryocooling excitation and inverse physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal diffusivity measurement of impacted composites using pulsed methods presents an ill-posed inverse problem influenced by multiple factors such as sample thickness, cooling duration, and excitation energy. In this study, a novel excitation method, evaporative cryocooling, was introduced for measuring the thermal diffusivity of tested samples. Compared to conventional excitation modalities, evaporative cryocooling excitation is compact, portable, and low cost. However, evaporative cryocooling cannot be considered a pulsed method due to its prolonged excitation duration. In general, it is difficult to measure thermal diffusivity based on non-impulsive pulsed excitation at times commensurate with the pulse duration, often due to ill-defined pulse shape and width and the subsequent potentially complicated thermal response which may be subject to diffusive broadening. To address this challenge, inverse physics-informed neural networks (IPINNs) were introduced in this work and integrated with an evaporative cryocooling method. The Parker method combined with a photothermal method was employed as a reference. To improve the accuracy of both IPINNs and Parker methods, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) was employed for measuring the thickness of impacted composites. Simulations and experimental results demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of the IPINN-based approach.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Super-Resolution Imaging System Based on Zero-Shot Learning for Infrared Non-Destructive Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared thermography (IRT) and photothermal coherence tomography (PCT) exhibit potential in non-destructive testing and biomedical fields. However, the inevitable heat diffusion significantly affects the sensitivity and resolution of IRT and PCT. Conventional image processing techniques rely on capturing complete thermal sequences, which limits their ability to achieve real-time processes. Here, we construct a real-time super-resolution imaging system based on zero-shot learning strategy for the non-invasive infrared thermography and photothermal coherence tomography techniques. To validate the feasibility and accuracy of this super-resolution imaging system, IRT systems were employed to test several industrial samples and one biomedical sample. The results demonstrated high contrast in the region of interest (ROI) and uncovered valuable information otherwise obscured by thermal diffusion. Furthermore, three-dimensional photothermal coherence tomography was used to validate the excellent denoising and deconvolution capabilities of the proposed real-time super-resolution imaging system.</description>

      <title>Preparation of the First Cu-based Nb$_3$Sn Sample via Bronze Route for Quadrupole Resonator Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first successful production of a Cu-based Nb$_3$Sn sample specifically designed for Quadrupole Resonator (QPR) testing, representing a significant step toward scalable RF superconducting coatings of Nb$_3$Sn on copper substrates. The sample was fabricated using an optimized electrochemical thermal synthesis (ETS) via the bronze route, incorporating several key advancements: electropolishing of the Cu substrate, electroplating of the bronze precursor layer, a tailored heat treatment at approximately 700 $^\circ$C to promote grain growth and suppress tin-rich impurity phases, and a newly developed chemical etching procedure for effective removal of surface bronze residues and contaminants. These improvements address longstanding challenges in the fabrication of high-quality Cu-based Nb$_3$Sn thin films. Subsequent QPR measurements yielded the peak magnetic field and temperature dependent surface resistance $R_s$, as well as the superconducting transition temperature and quench field. Although the achieved RF performance -- characterized by a minimum $R_s$ of 43.4 n$\Omega$ at 4.5 K and 15 mT -- is not yet optimal, the results clearly demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and its potential for further enhancement through process refinement.</description>

      <title>Rydberg atom reception of a handheld UHF frequency-modulated two-way radio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms, due to their large polarizabilities and strong transition dipole moments, have been utilized as sensitive electric field sensors. While their capability to detect modulated signals has been previously demonstrated, these studies have largely been limited to laboratory-generated signals tailored specifically for atomic detection. Here, we extend the practical applicability of Rydberg sensors by demonstrating the reception of real-world frequency-modulated (FM) audio transmissions using a consumer-grade handheld two-way radio operating in the UHF band. Detection is based on the AC Stark shift induced by the radio signal in a Rydberg atomic vapor, with demodulation performed using an offset local oscillator and lock-in amplification. We successfully demodulate speech signals and evaluate the audio spectral response and reception range. We show that all consumer-accessible radio channels can be simultaneously detected, and demonstrate simultaneous reception of two neighboring channels with at least 53 dB of isolation. This work underscores the potential of Rydberg atom-based receivers for practical, real-world FM signal detection.</description>

      <title>Chromatic and Spherical Aberration Correction with Hexapole and Quadrupole Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the development of a chromatic and spherical aberration corrector based on a combination of hexapole and quadrupole fields. Thick hexapole fields are used to generate negative spherical and to correct residual axial and off-axial aberrations. However, instead of using round transfer lenses placed between the hexapoles, a quadrupole multiplet producing superimposed electric and magnetic quadrupole fields is used to produce negative chromatic aberration. The quadrupole multiplet also functions as a transfer doublet within the corrector. In this paper, the simultaneous correction of chromatic and spherical aberrations using this corrector design is described and we demonstrate a resolution improvement in cases where the energy spread is limiting.</description>

      <title>Nanomechanical Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Error correction is essential for modern computing systems, enabling information to be processed accurately even in the presence of noise. Here, we demonstrate a new approach which exploits an error correcting phase that emerges in a system of three coupled nonlinear resonators. Within this phase, perturbed memory states are autonomously restored via the collective dynamics of the nonlinear network. We implement our scheme using a network of nanomechanical resonators. Nanomechanical systems are an attractive platform for low energy computing, but purely mechanical error correction has not been previously demonstrated. We experimentally show that the error correcting phase provides a 35 times reduction in the rate of errors, and allows robust error correction over a wide range of system parameters. These results highlight how emergent nonlinear dynamics can be harnessed for practical applications, paving the way towards error-resilient nanomechanical computing.</description>

      <title>Time-series Neutron Tomography of Rhizoboxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the feasibility of tilt-series neutron tomography for analyzing rhizoboxes used in root-soil interaction studies. Traditional neutron imaging methods are limited by constrained root growth volumes and poor penetration in moist soil. Using a vertical acquisition axis, the tilt-series approach avoids constraints typical of laminography. This method allows simultaneous radiographic and tomographic data acquisition, enhancing time resolution and providing detailed insights into root networks and soil water content. Experiments involved scanning six-week-old maize plants in rhizoboxes filled with sand. Results show that tilt-series tomography can effectively reconstruct root networks despite some artifacts from the missing wedge. While the tilt-series tomographic data qualitatively reveal water distribution changes, radiographic data remain essential for quantitative analysis. This approach demonstrates the potential for dynamic root-soil interaction studies, offering a valuable tool for agricultural and environmental research by providing comprehensive insights into the rhizosphere.</description>

      <title>Experimental Characterization and Simulation-Based Analysis of the RIT-2.5 Radiofrequency Ion Thruster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the experimental characterization of the RIT-2.5 radiofrequency ion thruster, complemented by particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations to establish correlations between plasma parameters and extracted beam properties. The thruster was operated in a dedicated vacuum facility and equipped with optical spectroscopy, Faraday cup, and retarding field energy analyzer (RFEA) diagnostics. Electron temperature was determined from optical emission line ratios (Te about 3-7 eV), while the energy distribution of extracted ions was measured using the RFEA. A comparative simulation campaign was performed to reproduce the experimentally observed energy spectra and to extract plasma density values otherwise inaccessible due to the lack of intrusive diagnostics, yielding best-fit estimates of ne about 1.2x10E16 m-3. The results demonstrate that the energy spread of the extracted beam is strongly dependent on plasma density and electron temperature. The combined experimental-numerical approach provides a non-intrusive yet robust pathway for performance optimization of RF ion thrusters, offers validation benchmarks for advanced plasma simulation codes, and is particularly well-suited to compact micro-N-class thrusters for nanosatellite attitude and orbit control.</description>

      <title>Amorphization-Mediated Si-I to Si-V Phase Transition and Reversible Amorphous-Si-V Phase Memory in Silicon Nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations using a Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) reveal a stress triaxiality driven, two-step Si-I (diamond cubic) to Si-V (simple hexagonal) phase transition pathway in a spherical Si nanoparticle with a 10 nm diameter under triaxial compression. A transient amorphous phase first forms at the surface and propagates inward around Si-I core, where stress triaxiality is low (shear-dominated). Within the amorphous shell, the material recrystallizes into Si-V at locations of elevated stress triaxiality and hydrostatic pressure. The resulting Si-V structure transforms into a fully amorphous state upon unloading. A subsequent loading-unloading cycle applied to this amorphous nanoparticle reveals a reversible amorphous to Si-V transformation, demonstrating a nanoscale phase memory effect.</description>

      <title>Scalable Hardware Maturity Probe for Quantum Accelerators via Harmonic Analysis of QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As quantum processors begin operating as tightly coupled accelerators inside high-performance computing (HPC) facilities, dependable and reproducible behavior becomes a gating requirement for scientific and industrial workloads. We present a hardware-maturity probe that quantifies a device's reliability by testing whether it can repeatedly reproduce the provably global optima of single-layer Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) circuits. Using harmonic analysis, we derive closed-form upper bounds on the number of stationary points in the p=1 QAOA cost landscape for broad classes of combinatorial-optimization problems. These bounds yield an exhaustive yet low-overhead grid-sampling scheme with analytically verifiable outcomes. The probe integrates reliability-engineering notions like run-to-failure statistics, confidence-interval estimation, and reproducibility testing into a single, application-centric benchmark. Our framework supplies a standardized dependability metric for hybrid quantum-HPC (QHPC) workflows.</description>

      <title>Requirements for Early Quantum Advantage and Quantum Utility in the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a transparent, encoding-agnostic framework for determining when the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) can achieve early quantum advantage. Our analysis shows this is unlikely on noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) hardware even in best case scenarios that use the most qubit-efficient direct encodings. Closed-form resource counts, combined with recent device benchmarks, yield three decisive go/no-go figures of merit: the quantum feasibility point and the qubit- and gate-feasibility lines, which place any CVRP instance on a single decision diagram. Contrasting a direct QUBO mapping with a space-efficient higher-order (HOBO) encoding reveals a large gap. Applied to early-advantage benchmarks such as Golden-5, our diagram shows that HOBO circuits require only 7,685 qubits, whereas comparable QUBO encodings still exceed 200,000 qubits. In addition to identifying candidate instances for early quantum advantage in CVRP, the framework provides a unifying go/no-go metric that ingests any CVRP encoding together with any hardware profile and highlights when quantum devices could challenge classical heuristics. Quantum advantage in CVRP would likely require innovative problem decomposition techniques.</description>

      <title>Probing laser-driven surface and subsurface dynamics via grazing-incidence XFEL scattering and diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a grazing-incidence x-ray platform that simultaneously records time-resolved grazing-incidence small-angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS) and grazing-incidence x-ray diffraction (GID) from a femtosecond laser-irradiated gold film above the melting threshold, with picosecond resolution at an x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL). By tuning the x-ray incidence angle, the probe depth is set to tens of nanometers, enabling depth-selective sensitivity to near-surface dynamics. GISAXS resolves ultrafast changes in surface nanomorphology (correlation length, roughness), while GID quantifies subsurface lattice compression, grain orientation, melting, and recrystallization. The approach overcomes photon-flux limitations of synchrotron grazing-incidence geometries and provides stringent, time-resolved benchmarks for complex theoretical models of ultrafast laser-matter interaction and warm dense matter. Looking ahead, the same depth-selective methodology is well suited to inertial confinement fusion (ICF): it can visualize buried-interface perturbations and interfacial thermal resistance on micron to sub-micron scales that affect instability seeding and burn propagation.</description>

      <title>QUEST: QUantum-Enhanced Shared Transportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce ``Windbreaking-as-a-Service'' (WaaS) as an innovative approach to shared transportation in which larger ``windbreaker'' vehicles provide aerodynamic shelter for ``windsurfer'' vehicles, thereby reducing drag and fuel consumption. As a computational framework to solve the large-scale matching and assignment problems that arise in WaaS, we present \textbf{QUEST} (Quantum-Enhanced Shared Transportation). Specifically, we formulate the pairing of windbreakers and windsurfers -- subject to timing, speed, and vehicle-class constraints -- as a mixed-integer quadratic problem (MIQP). Focusing on a single-segment prototype, we verify the solution classically via the Hungarian Algorithm, a Gurobi-based solver, and brute-force enumeration of binary vectors. We then encode the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and map it to an Ising Hamiltonian, enabling the use of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and other quantum and classical annealing technologies. Our quantum implementation successfully recovers the optimal assignment identified by the classical methods, confirming the soundness of the QUEST pipeline for a controlled prototype. While QAOA and other quantum heuristics do not guarantee a resolution of the fundamental complexity barriers, this study illustrates how the WaaS problem can be systematically translated into a quantum-ready model. It also lays the groundwork for addressing multi-segment scenarios and potentially leveraging quantum advantage for large-scale shared-transportation instances.</description>

Abstract: The recently observed plasmonic skyrmions, as electromagnetic counterparts of topologically stable quasiparticles, hold significant promise as novel carriers for robust information transfer and manipulation of nontrivial light-matter interactions. However, their practical applications has been hindered by the lack of flexible tuning devices to encode these topological structures. Here, we present a programmable plasmonic skyrmion platform capable of encoding diverse skyrmion topologies, including Neel-type skyrmions and merons. Based on unprecedented ultra-fast coding feature, we synthesize harmonic skyrmions in the temporal dimension and, for the first time, applied skyrmions in communication and sensing applications. Specifically, we achieved highly robust and multi-channel wireless communications by using programmable topological skyrmions, providing a promising platform for communication in turbulent noise channels and extreme conditions. Furthermore, we implemented intelligent sensing across twenty animal models on the same platform, achieving high recognition accuracy. This methodology offers programmable and temporal insights into the skyrmions for their practical applications in next-generation wireless communication and intelligent sensing.</description>

      <title>Critical Nodes Identification in Complex Networks: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex networks have become essential tools for understanding diverse phenomena in social systems, traffic systems, biomolecular systems, and financial systems. Identifying critical nodes is a central theme in contemporary research, serving as a vital bridge between theoretical foundations and practical applications. Nevertheless, the intrinsic complexity and structural heterogeneity characterizing real-world networks, with particular emphasis on dynamic and higher-order networks, present substantial obstacles to the development of universal frameworks for critical node identification. This paper provides a comprehensive review of critical node identification techniques, categorizing them into seven main classes: centrality, critical nodes deletion problem, influence maximization, network control, artificial intelligence, higher-order and dynamic methods. Our review bridges the gaps in existing surveys by systematically classifying methods based on their methodological foundations and practical implications, and by highlighting their strengths, limitations, and applicability across different network types. Our work enhances the understanding of critical node research by identifying key challenges, such as algorithmic universality, real-time evaluation in dynamic networks, analysis of higher-order structures, and computational efficiency in large-scale networks. The structured synthesis consolidates current progress and highlights open questions, particularly in modeling temporal dynamics, advancing efficient algorithms, integrating machine learning approaches, and developing scalable and interpretable metrics for complex systems.</description>
