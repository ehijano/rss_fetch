      <title>The functional graph of $f(X)=(cX^q+aX)(X^{q}-X)^{n-1}$ over quadratic extensions of finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be the finite field with $q=p^s$ elements, where $p$ is an odd prime and $s$ a positive integer. In this paper, we define the function $f(X)=(cX^q+aX)(X^{q}-X)^{n-1}$, for $a,c\in\mathbb{F}_q$ and $n\geq 1$. We study the dynamics of the function $f(X)$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$, determining cycle lengths and number of cycles. We also show that all trees attached to cyclic elements are isomorphic, with the exception of the tree hanging from zero. We also present the general shape of such hanging trees, which concludes the complete description of the functional graph of $f(X)$.</description>

      <title>Rates of memory loss for null recurrent Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orey (1962) proved that for an irreducible, aperiodic, and recurrent Markov chain with transition operator $P$, the sequence $P^n (\mu - \nu)$ converges to zero in total variation for any two probability measures $\mu$ and $\nu$. In other words, all such Markov chains exhibit memory loss. While the rates of memory loss have been extensively studied for positive recurrent chains, there is a surprising lack of results for null recurrent chains. In this work, we prove the first estimates of memory loss rates in the null recurrent case.</description>

      <title>Invariant tori for the pressure-jump Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major achievement of Dewar and coworkers is the SPEC code to construct stepped-pressure equilibria in magnetohydrostatics without axisymmetry. Their existence had been proved by Bruno and Laurence. As part of the procedure of Bruno and Laurence, it is required to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for a magnetic potential on the outside of an interface given the field on the inside and the pressure-jump across the interface. For non-axisymmetric interface, it was understood that solutions with insufficiently irrational rotational transform might not exist, and examples have been given for which there are no solutions at all for large enough pressure-jump. The present paper gives a method to compute regions in the phase space for the pressure-jump Hamiltonian through which no invariant tori pass. The paper also shows how to present the results as regions in the space of pressure-jumps and outer rotational transform for which there is no solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The method is expected to reach arbitrarily close to the full non-existence region with enough computational work, so what is left over can be relied on to be mostly invariant tori. The paper also brings to attention a class of metrics on tori that are not necessarily axisymmetric yet have integrable geodesic flow. They could give interfaces with solutions for all but finitely many rotational transforms.</description>

      <title>Behavior near the extinction time for systems of differential equations with sublinear dissipation terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.17241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is focused on the behavior near the extinction time of solutions of systems of ordinary differential equations with a sublinear dissipation term. Suppose the dissipation term is a product of a linear mapping $A$ and a positively homogeneous scalar function $H$ of a negative degree $-\alpha$. Then any solution with an extinction time $T_*$ behaves like $(T_*-t)^{1/\alpha}\xi_*$ as time $t\to T_*^-$, where $\xi_*$ is an eigenvector of $A$. The result allows the higher order terms to be general and the nonlinear function $H$ to take very complicated forms. As a demonstration, our theoretical study is applied to an inhomogeneous population model.</description>

      <title>Unique ergodicity for singular holomorphic foliations of $\mathbb{P}^3(\mathbb{C})$ with an invariant plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a unique ergodicity theorem for singular holomorphic foliations of $\mathbb{P}^3(\mathbb{C})$ with hyperbolic singularities and with an invariant plane with no foliation cycle, in analogy with a result of Dinh-Sibony concerning unique ergodicity for foliations of $\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{C})$ with an invariant line. The proof is dynamical in nature and adapts the work of Deroin-Kleptsyn to a singular context, using the fundamental integrability estimate of Nguy\^en.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Fourier decay for fractal measures and their pushforwards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the pushforwards of a very general class of fractal measures $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ under a large family of non-linear maps $F \colon \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$ exhibit polynomial Fourier decay: there exist $C,\eta&gt;0$ such that $|\widehat{F\mu}(\xi)|\leq C|\xi|^{-\eta}$ for all $\xi\neq 0$. Using this, we prove that if $\Phi = \{ \varphi_a \colon [0,1] \to [0,1] \}_{a \in \mathcal{A}}$ is an iterated function system consisting of analytic contractions, and there exists $a \in \mathcal{A}$ such that $\varphi_a$ is not an affine map, then every non-atomic self-conformal measure for $\Phi$ has polynomial Fourier decay; this result was obtained simultaneously by Algom, Rodriguez Hertz, and Wang. We prove applications related to the Fourier uniqueness problem, Fractal Uncertainty Principles, Fourier restriction estimates, and quantitative equidistribution properties of numbers in fractal sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06006v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the property of having good subgroups for actions of countable discrete groups on compact metrizable spaces, and show that it implies comparison when the acting group is amenable. As a consequence, free actions on finite-dimensional spaces of many notable amenable groups of dynamical origin are almost finite. For instance, this applies to topological full groups of Cantor minimal systems and the Basilica group. In particular, minimal such actions give rise to classifiable crossed products.</description>

      <title>Mass action systems: two criteria for Hopf bifurcation without Hurwitz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18188v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We state two sufficient criteria for periodic oscillations in mass action systems. Neither criterion requires a computation of the Hurwitz determinants. Instead, both criteria exploit the linear algebra concepts of $D$-stability and $P$-matrices. The criteria are complementary: the first is based on a stable matrix that is not a $P^-$ matrix, while the second is based on a $P^-$ matrix that is not stable. In analogy, a qualitatively different interpretation follows: the first criterion relates to positive feedback in the network, while the second concerns negative feedback. We present examples that showcase the applicability of both criteria. As a final independent remark, we prove that for the special case of fully-open networks, the capacity for Hopf bifurcation is just equivalent to the capacity for a steady-state with a complex pair of eigenvalues with positive-real part.</description>

      <title>A dynamical view of Tijdeman's solution of the chairman assignment problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1980, R. Tijdeman provided an on-line algorithm that generates sequences over a finite alphabet  with minimal discrepancy, that is, such that the occurrence of  each letter optimally tracks its frequency. In this article, we define discrete dynamical systems generating these sequences. The dynamical systems are defined as exchanges of polytopal pieces, yielding cut and project schemes, and they code tilings of the line whose sets of vertices form model sets. We prove that these sequences of low discrepancy are natural codings of toral translations with respect to polytopal atoms, and that they generate a minimal and uniquely ergodic subshift with purely discrete spectrum. Finally, we show that the factor complexity of these sequences is of polynomial growth order $n^{d-1}$, where $d$ is the cardinality of the alphabet.</description>

      <title>Finite type as fundamental objects even non-single-valued and non-continuous</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the shadowing property for general upper semicontinuous set-valued maps defined by Pilyugin and Rieger \cite{PR}, and inspired by Good and Meddaugh \cite{GM}, we identify the fundamental objects underpinning the shadowing theory for such maps. Specifically, we explore the relationships among shifts of finite type, the simplest set-valued maps, and the shadowing property.
  Our main result establishes that if $X$ is a compact, totally disconnected Hausdorff space, and $F$ is an upper semicontinuous closed-valued map on $X$ with the set-valued shadowing property, the following hold: \begin{enumerate}
  \item If $F$ is expansive, the orbit system of $(X,F)$ is conjugate to a shift of finite type. \item Without expansiveness, $(X,F)$ is conjugate to an inverse limit of a net of the simplest set-valued systems satisfying the Mittag-Leffler condition. Additionally, the orbit system of $(X,F)$ is conjugate to an inverse limit of a net of shifts of finite type, also satisfying the Mittag-Leffler condition \end{enumerate}
  As a consequence, if an upper semicontinuous set-valued map on a totally disconnected space has the set-valued shadowing property, its orbit system also exhibits the single-valued shadowing property.</description>

      <title>Parsings of Stationary Processes, Stopping Times and the Fundamental Pointwise Convergence Theorems of Ergodic Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The idea of a parsing of a stationary process according to a collection of words is introduced, and the basic framework required for the asymptotic analysis of these parsings is presented. We demonstrate how the pointwise ergodic theorem and the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem can be deduced from their respective weaker convergence in probability versions combined with our observations regarding parsings, where the parsings are done according to collections that originate in stopping times tailored for that purpose.</description>

Abstract: We show that the $\mathbb{P}$-twist associated to any $\mathbb{P}$-object of a smooth project variety is not conjugate to a standard autoequivalence. This result is obtained by computing the categorical entropy functions of $\mathbb{P}$-twists.

      <title>A higher-dimensional Van den Essen type formula for projective foliations and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a one-dimensional holomorphic foliation on $\mathbb{P}^n$ such that $W\subset Sing(F)$, where $W$ is a smooth complete intersection variety. We determine and compute the variation of the Milnor number $ \mu(F, W)$ under blowups, which depends on the vanishing order of the pullback foliation along the exceptional divisor, as well as on numerical and topological invariants of $W$. This represents a higher-dimensional version of Van den Essen's formula for projective foliations of dimension one. As an application, we obtain a lower bound for the Milnor number of the foliation. Also, we use this formula to show that for a foliation on $\mathbb{P}^n$ that is singular along a smooth curve, there exists a finite number of blow-ups with centers on smooth curves such that the induced foliation has multiplicity equal to 1 and that for generic points of the curves in the final stage, the singularities are elementary. Moreover, we obtain a bound on the maximum number of blow-ups needed to resolve the foliation, depending on the numerical and topological invariants of the curve.</description>

      <title>On bifurcation from infinity: a compactification approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a scalar parabolic partial differential equation on the interval with nonlinear boundary conditions that are asymptotically sublinear. As the parameter crosses critical values (e.g. the Steklov eigenvalues), it is known that there are large equilibria that arise through a bifurcation from infinity (i.e., such equilibria converge, after rescaling, to the Steklov eigenfunctions). We provide a compactification approach to the study of such unbounded bifurcation curves of equilibria, their stability, and heteroclinic orbits. In particular, we construct an induced semiflow at infinity such that the Steklov eigenfunctions are equilibria. Moreover, we prove the existence of infinite-time blow-up solutions that converge, after rescaling, to certain eigenfunctions that are equilibria of the induced semiflow at infinity.</description>
