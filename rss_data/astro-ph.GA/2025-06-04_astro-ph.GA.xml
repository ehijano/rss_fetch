      <title>Age dependence of Ly\alpha\ escape fraction of Ly\alpha\ emitters and their significant role in cosmic reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction, $f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$ of Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) identified by Subaru/HSC narrowband imaging at $z = 2.2-6.6$, using publicly available deep imaging data from HST and JWST. We perform SED fitting for 127 LAEs at $0.4 - 5.0\, \mathrm{\mu m}$ to estimate their physical properties robustly, and confirm that two distinct LAE populations exist: young LAEs (&lt; 100 Myr) and old LAEs (&gt; 100 Myr). Young LAEs are characterized by burst-like star formation activity and low dust content, significantly differing from Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at the same stellar mass, while old LAEs show similar star formation activity to LBGs, yet with lower dust content and more compact morphology in rest-UV/optical than LBGs. The $f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$ of LAEs is anticorrelated with stellar mass, and this correlation is found to depend on the age of LAEs, such that old LAEs show a weaker anticorrelation than young LAEs, and tend to exhibit higher $f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$ than young LAEs at a given stellar mass. This implies that Ly$\alpha$ photons escape more efficiently from old LAEs, possibly through the low-density channels of HI and dust created by outflows. The average $f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$ of young LAEs remains nearly constant at $\sim40$% at $z = 2.2-6.6$, suggesting that the previously observed evolution of global $f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$ of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is due to the changes in the LAE fraction among the SFGs. Converting $f_{\mathrm{esc}}^{\mathrm{Ly\alpha}}$ to Lyman continuum escape fraction using empirical relations, we demonstrate that LAEs alone can supply the ionizing photons necessary for reionization at $z\sim6$, causing rapid and late reionization.</description>

      <title>COSMOS2025: The COSMOS-Web galaxy catalog of photometry, morphology, redshifts, and physical parameters from JWST, HST, and ground-based imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present COSMOS2025, the COSMOS-Web catalog of photometry, morphology, photometric redshifts and physical parameters for more than 700,000 galaxies in the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field. This catalog is based on our \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} 255\,h COSMOS-Web program, which provides deep near-infrared imaging in four NIRCam (F115W, F150W, F277W, F444W) and one MIRI (F770W) filter over the central $\sim 0.54 {\, \rm deg}^2$ ($\sim 0.2 {\, \rm deg}^2$ for MIRI) in COSMOS. These data are combined with ground- and space-based data to derive photometric measurements of NIRCam-detected sources using both fixed-aperture photometry (on the space-based bands) and a profile-fitting technique on all 37 bands spanning 0.3-8 micron. We provide morphology for all sources from complementary techniques including profile fitting and machine-learning classification. We derive photometric redshifts, physical parameters and non-parametric star formation histories from spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. The catalog has been extensively validated against previous COSMOS catalogs and other surveys. Photometric redshift accuracy measured using spectroscopically confirmed galaxies out to $z\sim9$ reaches $\sigma_{\rm MAD} = 0.012$ at $m_{\rm F444W}&lt;28$ and remains at $\sigma_{\rm MAD} \lesssim 0.03$ as a function of magnitude, color, and galaxy type. This represents a factor of $\sim 2$ improvement at 26 AB mag compared to COSMOS2020. The catalog is approximately 80\% complete at $\log(M_{\star}/{\rm M}_{\odot}) \sim 9$ at $z \sim 10$ and at $\log(M_{\star}/{\rm M}_{\odot}) \sim 7$ at $z \sim 0.2$, representing a gain of 1\,dex compared to COSMOS2020. COSMOS2025 represents the definitive COSMOS-Web catalog. It is provided with complete documentation, together with redshift probability distributions, and it is ready for scientific exploitation today.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Outliers: Low-Spin Halos Explain the Abundance, Compactness, and Redshift Evolution of the Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Little Red Dots (LRDs) are high-redshift galaxies uncovered by JWST, characterized by small effective radii ($R_{\rm eff} \sim 80-300$ pc), number densities intermediate between typical galaxies and quasars, and a redshift distribution peaked at $z \sim 5$. We present a theoretical model in which the LRDs descend from dark matter halos in the extreme low-spin tail of the angular momentum distribution. Within this framework, we explain their three key observational signatures: (i) abundance, (ii) compactness, and (iii) redshift distribution. Our model focuses on observed, not modeled, properties; it is thus independent of whether they are powered primarily by a black hole or stars. We find that the assumption that the prototypical LRD at $z \sim 5$ originates from halos in the lowest $\sim 1\%$ of the spin distribution is sufficient to reproduce both their observed number densities and physical sizes. The redshift evolution of their observability is driven by the interplay between the evolving compact disk fraction and cosmological surface brightness dimming. This effect leads to a well-defined "LRDs Era" at $4&lt;z&lt;8$, during which the LRDs are common and detectable; at $z&lt;4$, they are bright but rare, while at $z&gt;8$, they are common but faint. Finally, we test the predicted redshift trend against observational data, finding excellent agreement. Additional observational support comes from their excess small-scale clustering and spectral signatures of extreme core densities, both of which are expected outcomes of galaxy formation in low-spin halos. These findings suggest that the LRDs are not a fundamentally distinct population but the natural manifestation of galaxies forming in the rarest, lowest angular momentum environments.</description>

      <title>The Pandora project. II: how non-thermal physics drives bursty star formation and temperate mass-loaded outflows in dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies provide powerful laboratories for studying galaxy formation physics. Their early assembly, shallow gravitational potentials, and bursty, clustered star formation histories make them especially sensitive to the processes that regulate baryons through multi-phase outflows. Using high-resolution, cosmological zoom-in simulations of a dwarf galaxy from \textit{the Pandora suite}, we explore the impact of stellar radiation, magnetic fields, and cosmic ray feedback on star formation, outflows, and metal retention. We find that our purely hydrodynamical model without non-thermal physics - in which supernova feedback is boosted to reproduce realistic stellar mass assembly - drives violent, overly enriched outflows that suppress the metal content of the host galaxy. Including radiation reduces the clustering of star formation and weakens feedback. However, the additional incorporation of cosmic rays produces fast, mass-loaded, multi-phase outflows consisting of both ionized and neutral gas components, in better agreement with observations. These outflows, which entrain a denser, more temperate ISM, exhibit broad metallicity distributions while preserving metals within the galaxy. Furthermore, the star formation history becomes more bursty, in agreement with recent JWST findings. These results highlight the essential role of non-thermal physics in galaxy evolution and the need to incorporate it in future galaxy formation models.</description>

      <title>Nearby dwarf galaxies with extreme star formation rates: a window into dwarf-galaxy evolution in the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a sample of nearby (z~0.2) low-luminosity dwarf (10^7 MSun &lt; M* &lt; 10^8 MSun) galaxies which have extreme (0.1 - 3 MSun/yr) star formation rates (SFRs) for this mass regime, making them plausible analogues of dwarfs at z~5.5. We compare the properties of these analogues to control samples of 'normal' dwarfs, which reside on the star formation main sequence (SFMS) at z~0.2 and are matched in their stellar mass and redshift distributions to the analogue population. The analogue and normal populations do not show differences, either in their half-light radii or the projected distances to nodes, filaments and massive galaxies. This suggests that the comparatively extreme SFRs in the analogues are not driven by them being anomalously compact or because they reside in specific environments which might provide a larger gas supply. However, the fractions of interacting galaxies and those that have early-type morphology are significantly elevated (by factors of ~5.6 and ~9 respectively) in the analogues compared to the normal population. Extrapolation of the redshift evolution of the star formation main sequence into our mass range of interest appears to underestimate the SFRs of observed dwarfs at z~5.5. Since current SFMS measurements remain dominated by low and intermediate redshift data (especially at low stellar masses), our study suggests that this underestimation may be driven by interactions (which are more frequent at earlier epochs) boosting the SFRs in the high-redshift dwarf population. Our results are consistent with a picture where higher gas availability, augmented by interactions, drives much of the stellar mass assembly of dwarf galaxies in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>COSMOS-Web: MIRI Data Reduction and Number Counts at 7.7$\mu$m using JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COSMOS-Web survey is the largest JWST Cycle 1 General Observer program covering a contiguous ~0.54 deg$^2$ area with NIRCam imaging in four broad-band filters and a non-contiguous ~0.2 deg$^2$ with parallel MIRI imaging in a single broad-band filter, F770W. Here we present a comprehensive overview of the MIRI imaging observations, the data reduction procedure, the COSMOS-Web MIRI photometric catalog, and the first data release including the entire COSMOS-Web MIRI coverage. Data reduction is predominantly based on the JWST Science Calibration Pipeline with an additional step involving custom background subtraction to mitigate the presence of strong instrumental features and sky background in the MIRI images. We reach 5$\sigma$ (point source) limiting depths ($m_{F770W}$~25.51 based on $r$~0.3'' circular apertures) that are significantly better than initial expectations. We create a COSMOS-Web MIRI catalog based on the images presented in this release and compare the F770W flux densities with the Spitzer/IRAC CH4 measurements from the COSMOS2020 catalog for CH4 detections with S/N $&gt;5$. We find that these are in reasonable agreement with a small median offset of $&lt;0.05$ mag. We also derive robust 7.7$\mu$m number counts spanning five orders of magnitude in flux ($\sim$0.2-2300 $\mu$Jy) $\unicode{x2013}$ making COSMOS-Web the only JWST survey to date to efficiently sample such a large flux range $\unicode{x2013}$ which is in good agreement with estimates from other JWST and IRAC surveys.</description>

      <title>The galaxy-AGN scaling relations over 13 billion years in SHARK v2.0 (I): SMBH masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of strong correlations between super-massive black hole (SMBH) masses and galaxy properties like stellar mass have been well-established in the local Universe, but how these scaling relations evolve with cosmic time is yet to be settled in both observations and theoretical models. Recent works have also highlighted the role of galaxy morphology on the scatter of the SMBH-galaxy mass scaling relations, while the impact of other galaxy properties remains poorly studied, like the role of galaxy environment. We use the state-of-the-art SHARK v2.0 semi-analytic model to explore the evolution of these galaxy-SMBH scaling relations to expand the available predictions from theoretical models to contrast with existing and upcoming observations. We find the relations between SMBH masses and both total and bulge stellar mass predicted by SHARK v2.0 to be in good overall agreement with observational measurements across a wide range of redshift and stellar masses. These scaling relations show a significant evolution as a function of cosmic time in SHARK v2.0, with SMBH masses $\sim1$ dex lower at $z=0$ compared to $z=9$ at fixed stellar mass and the scatter increasing by a factor of $\sim2-5$ towards low redshift. Both relations show a strong dependence with galaxy morphology and the main source for SMBH growth (gas accretion or mergers), with smaller trends with star formation rate, galaxy sizes, and environment. We find that galaxy morphology alone explains most of the scatter around both scaling relations, with other galaxy properties tying to the SMBH scaling relations through their correlations with morphology.</description>

      <title>Changing Look AGN: A study of Optical/UV and the Highly Ionized Fe K$\alpha$ X-ray Line Flux Variations Using Photo-Ionization Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant variability in broad emission line strengths of active galactic nuclei (AGN) over months to years has been observed, often accompanied by intrinsic continuum changes. Such spectral variability challenges the traditional AGN classification scheme, which attributes differences between Type 1 and Type 2 to geometrical effects, as transitions between these types occur on timescales shorter than viscous ones. In this work, using the {\sc cloudy} photo-ionization simulations, we investigated the response of the major emission line fluxes, in the optical/UV and hard X-ray bands, to changes in the intensity and shape of the continuum emission of the AGN under two scenarios: (i) changes in the X-ray power-law while keeping disc emission fixed, and (ii) broadband continuum variations. We demonstrate that BLR line fluxes are insensitive to X-ray power-law changes alone. Considering a well-studied case of the changing-look (CL) AGN Mrk 1018, which exhibits variations in the intrinsic disc emission, as well as the X-ray power-law, our simulations reproduce observed brightening and dimming trends of the BLR emission. Moreover, we show that the highly ionized Fe K$\alpha$ X-ray flux, primarily produced by the H-like and He-like ions of Fe, strongly depends on the X-ray strength of the intrinsic SED. These findings suggest that the origin of highly ionized Fe K$\alpha$ emission is in the coronal part of the accretion disk and that the CL phenomenon can be triggered by intrinsic changes in the accretion properties of AGN.</description>

      <title>Searching for Dark Galaxies with HI detection from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalog of 142 dark galaxy candidates in a region covered by the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey. We start with 344 ALFALFA HI sources without optical counterparts and remove those that do not seem to have dark galaxy origin. To do that, we first eliminate 83 sources that are known HI clouds probably formed from tidal interactions between galaxies and 13 sources that have optical counterparts. We then remove 56 sources located near other HI sources, which are likely to be HI clouds. We further exclude 10 sources that have nearby HI sources within the ALFALFA beam and 40 sources potentially associated with nearby galaxies. We perform visual inspection of optical images from DESI Legacy Imaging Survey with an $r$-band surface brightness limit of $\sim 28.5 \rm \ mag\ arcsec^{-2}$ as well as NUV images from GALEX to confirm the absence of stellar emission. We additionally inspect infrared images from WISE and AKARI for dust emission. As a result, we identify 142 dark galaxy candidates and analyze their physical properties by comparing with luminous galaxies. We find that the dark galaxy candidates generally have smaller dynamical masses, higher HI-to-dynamical mass ratios, and are located in less dense regions when compared to luminous galaxies, which is consistent with results from cosmological simulations. This sample provides an important testbed for studying the role of dark matter in galaxy formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Cosmic ray and plasma coupling for isothermal supersonic turbulence in the magnetized interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) are an integral part of the non-thermal pressure budget in the interstellar medium (ISM) and are the leading-order ionization mechanism in cold molecular clouds. We study the impacts that different microphysical CR diffusion coefficients and streaming speeds have on the evolution of isothermal, magnetized, turbulent plasmas, relevant to the cold ISM. We utilized a two-moment CR magnetohydrodynamic (CRMHD) model, allowing us to dynamically evolve both CR energy and flux densities with contributions from Alfv\'enic streaming and anisotropic diffusion. We identify $\textit{coupled}$ and $\textit{decoupled}$ regimes, and define dimensionless Prandtl numbers $\rm{Pm_c}$ and $\rm{Pm_s}$, which quantify whether the plasma falls within these two regimes. In the coupled regime -- characteristic of slow streaming ($\rm{Pm_s} &lt; 1$) and low diffusion ($\rm{Pm_c} &lt; 1$) -- the CR fluid imprints upon the plasma a mixed equation of state between $P_{\rm{c}} \propto \rho^{4/3}$ (relativistic fluid) and $P_{\rm{c}} \propto \rho^{2/3}$ (streaming), where $P_{\rm{c}}$ is the CR pressure, and $\rho$ is the plasma density. By modifying the sound speed, the coupling reduces the turbulent Mach number, and hence the amplitude of the density fluctuations, whilst supporting secular heating of the CR fluid. In contrast, in the decoupled regime ($\rm{Pm_s} &gt; 1$ or $\rm{Pm_c} &gt; 1$) the CR fluid and the plasma have negligible interactions. We further show that CR heating is enabled by coherent structures within the compressible velocity field, with no impact on the turbulence spectrum of incompressible modes.</description>

      <title>Jet-Feedback on kpc scales: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic jets from AGN are an important driver of feedback in galaxies. They interact with their environments over a wide range of physical scales during their lifetime, and an understanding of these interactions is crucial for unraveling the role of supermassive blackholes in shaping galaxy evolution. The impact of such jets have been traditionally considered in the context of heating the large-scale environments. However, in the last few decades there has been additional focus on the immediate impact of jet feedback on the host galaxy itself. In this review we outline the development of various numerical simulations since the onset of studies of jets to the present day, where sophisticated numerical techniques have been employed to study jet feedback including a range of physical processes. The jets can act as an important agent of injecting energy in the host's ISM, as confirmed both in observations of multi-phase gas, as well as in simulations. Such interactions have the potential to impact the kinematics of the gas as well as its star formation. We summarize the recent results from simulations of jet feedback on kpc scales, and outline the broader implications for observations and galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Gravothermal expansion of dwarf spheroidal galaxies heated by dark subhaloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use analytical and $N$-body methods to study the evolution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) embedded in dark matter (DM) haloes that host a sizeable subhalo population. Dark subhaloes generate a fluctuating gravitational field that injects energy into stellar orbits, driving a gradual expansion of dSphs. Despite the overall expansion, the stellar density profile preserves its initial shape, suggesting that the evolution proceeds in a self-similar manner. Meanwhile, the velocity dispersion profile, initially flat, evolves as the galaxy expands: the inner regions heat up, while the outer regions cool down. Kinematically, this resembles gravothermal collapse but with an inverted evolution, instead of collapsing the stellar system expands within a fluctuating halo potential. As the half-light radius $r_{\rm half}$ approaches the halo peak velocity radius $r_{\rm max}$, the expansion slows, and the velocity dispersion peaks at $\sigma_{\rm max} \simeq 0.27 v_{\rm max}$. The stellar heat capacity remains positive for deeply embedded stars but diverges near $r_{\rm max}$, turning negative beyond this threshold, which indicates a phase transition in the dynamical response to energy injection. The relaxation time scales as $t_{\rm rel} \sim r_{\rm half}^{3/2}$, showing that orbital diffusion slows as the galaxy expands. Ultra-faint dSphs, having the smallest sizes and shortest relaxation times, are particularly sensitive to the presence of dark subhaloes. Some of our dSph models expand beyond the detection of current photometric surveys, becoming `stealth' galaxies with half-light radii and velocity dispersions similar to ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), but orders of magnitude lower luminosities, representing a distinct, yet currently undetected, population of DM-dominated satellites.</description>

      <title>Test of conformal gravity as an alternative to dark matter from the observations of elliptical galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an alternative gravitational theory to General Relativity (GR), the Conformal Gravity (CG) has recently been successfully verified by observations of Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) and the rotation curves of spiral galaxies. The observations of galaxies only pertain to the non-relativistic form of gravity. In this context, within the framework of the Newtonian theory of gravity (the non-relativistic form of GR), dark matter is postulated to account for the observations. On the other hand, the non-relativistic form of CG predicts an additional potential: besides the Newtonian potential, there is a so-called linear potential term, characterized by the parameter $\gamma^*$, as an alternative to dark matter in Newtonian gravity. To test CG in its non-relativistic form, much work has been done by fitting the predictions to the observations of circular velocity (rotation curves) for spiral galaxies. In this paper, we test CG with the observations from elliptical galaxies. Instead of the circular velocities for spiral galaxies, we use the velocity dispersion for elliptical galaxies. By replacing the Newtonian potential with that predicted by non-relativistic form of CG in Hamiltonian, we directly extend the Jeans equation derived in Newtonian theory to that for CG. By comparing the results derived from the ellipticals with that from spirals, we find that the extra potential predicted by CG is not sufficient to account for the observations of ellipticals. Furthermore, we discover a strong correlation between $\gamma^*$ and the stellar mass $M^*$ in dwarf spheroidal galaxies. This finding implies that the variation in $\gamma^*$ violates a fundamental prediction of Conformal Gravity (CG), which posits that $\gamma^*$ should be a universal constant.</description>

      <title>A Relativistic Jet in the Radio Quiet AGN Mrk 110</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a relativistic jet in Mrk~110, a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy historically classified as a radio-quiet active galactic nucleus (AGN). Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations reveal intermittent jet activity during 2015--2016 and 2022--2024, with proper motion measurements yielding superluminal velocities of $\sim3.6\pm0.6\,c$ and $\sim2.1\pm0.2\,c$, respectively. The recent jet component decelerates to $\sim 1.5\pm0.2\,c$ at a projected distance of 1.1 parsec from the core, coinciding with the transition zone between broad-line and narrow-line regions. This deceleration accompanies dramatic spectral evolution from steep (the spectral index $\alpha \approx -0.63 \pm 0.04$) to inverted ($\alpha \approx +0.69 \pm 0.10$) as the 7.6 GHz flux density more than doubled. These episodic jet ejections and their evolutionary pattern match theoretical predictions from magnetically arrested disk (MAD) models for temporary jet formation in systems with Mrk 110's physical parameters on timescales of months to years. The observed jet deceleration distance matches expectations for relativistic outflows interacting with the circumnuclear environment. These findings demonstrate that the traditional radio-loud/quiet AGN dichotomy may reflect time-averaged states rather than intrinsic capabilities, suggesting that jets may form across the AGN population but become observable only during specific accretion phases when MAD conditions are temporarily established. Mrk 110 serves as a critical "missing link" between radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN, providing insight into jet formation mechanisms, environmental interactions, and physical processes that unify various AGN classifications.</description>

      <title>Lonely Little Red Dots: Challenges to the AGN-nature of little red dots through their clustering and spectral energy distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal a previously unseen population of compact red objects, known as ``little red dots`` (LRDs). We study a new photometrically selected sample of 124 LRDs in the redshift range $z$ $\sim$ 3 - 10 selected from NIRCam coverage of the CEERS, NEP-TDF, JADES and JEMS surveys. For JADES, the NEP-TDF and CEERS, we compare SED models with and without AGN components and analyse the impact of an AGN component on the goodness of fit using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). We find that whilst the $\chi^{2}$ of the majority of models containing AGN components is improved compared to models without AGN components, we show that the BIC suggests models without AGN are a more appropriate fit to LRD SEDs, especially when MIRI data is available. We also measure LRD clustering in the CEERS field, JADES field, and NEP-TDF, where we compare the spatial distribution of LRDs and galaxies with Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of equality of distribution. We find that the neighbourhood of LRDs tends to be less dense compared to galaxies at all selections and masses and at similar redshifts. We further measure upper limit estimates for the halo masses of LRDs using abundance matching. Whilst the population of LRDs could be a mixture of several different inherent populations, as a whole it does appear that these systems are mostly hosting compact galaxies or star clusters in formation.</description>

      <title>Brightest Group Galaxies IV: Probing Size--Mass Relation and Morphological Quenching in COSMOS-Web from $z = 3.7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the structural evolution of Brightest Group Galaxies (BGGs) from redshift $z \simeq 0.08$ to $z = 3.7$ using the \textit{James Webb Space Telescope}'s 255h COSMOS-Web program. This survey provides deep NIRCam imaging in four filters (F115W, F150W, F277W, F444W) across $\sim 0.54~\mathrm{deg}^2$ and MIRI coverage in $\sim 0.2~\mathrm{deg}^2$ of the COSMOS field. High-resolution NIRCam imaging enables robust size and morphological measurements, while multiwavelength photometry yields stellar masses, SFRs, and S\'ersic parameters. We classify BGGs as star-forming and quiescent using both rest-frame NUV--$r$--$J$ colors and a redshift-dependent specific star formation rate (sSFR) threshold. Our analysis reveals: (1) quiescent BGGs are systematically more compact than their star-forming counterparts and exhibit steeper size--mass slopes; (2) effective radii evolve as $R_e \propto (1+z)^{-\alpha}$, with $\alpha = 1.11 \pm 0.07$ (star-forming) and $1.40 \pm 0.09$ (quiescent); (3) star formation surface density ($\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$) increases with redshift and shows stronger evolution for massive BGGs ($\log_{10}(M_\ast/M_\odot) \geq 10.75$); (4) in the $\Sigma_e$--sSFR plane, a structural transition marks the quenching process, with bulge-dominated systems comprising over 80\% of the quiescent population. These results highlight the co-evolution of structure and star formation in BGGs, shaped by both internal and environmental processes, and establish BGGs as critical laboratories for studying the baryonic assembly and morphological transformation of central galaxies in group-scale halos.</description>

      <title>Europium, we have a problem. Modelling r-process enrichment across Local Group galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Europium (Eu) serves as a crucial tracer to understand the origin of rapid neutron-capture process (r-process) elements. An extensive effort was made in the last decade to model the chemical evolution of this element in the Galaxy. However, less attention was reserved to Eu in different galaxies of the Local Group (LG). Aims: By employing detailed and well-tested chemical evolution models, we investigate Eu enrichment across LG dwarf spheroidal galaxies, allowing for a direct comparison between model predictions for dwarf galaxies and the Milky Way (MW). Methods: Building upon an r-process enrichment framework that successfully reproduces the observed Eu abundance patterns as well as the supernova and compact binary merger rates in the MW, we build chemical evolution models for the Sagittarius, Fornax, and Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxies and test the enrichment scenario against the abundance patterns observed in these galaxies. Results: Models reproducing the Galactic Eu patterns significantly underestimate the [Eu/Fe] ratios observed in LG dwarfs. To address this "missing Eu" problem, we estimate the Eu production rate needed to match the observations and explore potential contributions either from prompt or delayed sources, assessing their compatibility with the MW observables. Conclusions: The same r-process enrichment frameworks cannot reproduce simultaneously the Eu patterns both in the MW and in dwarf galaxies. However, a scenario where additional Eu is provided by an increased production from delayed sources at low metallicity can theoretically reconcile the trends observed in the MW and in LG dwarfs, because of the small discrepancies (0.1 dex) between model predictions and observations found in this case. Further targeting and modelling of neutron-capture elements in LG galaxies are however needed to fill the gaps in our current understanding of the problem.</description>

      <title>Investigating the HI distribution and kinematics of ESO444-G084 and [KKS2000]23: New insights from the MHONGOOSE survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the HI distribution, kinematics, mass modeling, and disk stability of the dwarf irregular galaxies ESO444-G084 and [KKS2000]23 using high-resolution, high-sensitivity MHONGOOSE survey data from MeerKAT. ESO444-G084 shows centrally concentrated HI emission, while [KKS2000]23 exhibits irregular high-density clumps. Total HI fluxes measured down to 10^19 and 10^18 cm^-2 are nearly identical, indicating that the increased HI diameter at lower column densities results mainly from the larger beam, with no significant extra emission detected. We derive total HI masses of (1.1 +/- 0.1) x 10^8 and (6.1 +/- 0.3) x 10^8 solar masses for ESO444-G084 and [KKS2000]23, respectively. Using PyFAT and TiRiFiC, we extract 3D rotation curves that reveal disk-like kinematics in both galaxies. ESO444-G084 shows a warp beyond ~1.8 kpc and a fast-rising curve consistent with a centrally concentrated dark matter distribution, while [KKS2000]23's more gradual rise suggests a more extended halo. Mass modeling with an isothermal halo and stellar mass-to-light ratios of 0.20 for ESO444-G084 and 0.18 for [KKS2000]23 yields consistent results. We analyze disk stability using spatially resolved Toomre Q and gas-to-critical surface density ratios, linking these with H-alpha and FUV-based star formation. ESO444-G084 supports localized star formation despite global stability, while [KKS2000]23 appears gravitationally unstable yet lacks H-alpha, suggesting that turbulence, gas depletion, or past feedback suppresses star formation. No inflows or outflows are detected, indicating internal processes regulate star formation. This study highlights the interplay between HI morphology, kinematics, dark matter distribution, and disk stability, showing how internal processes shape dwarf galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Exploring over 700 massive quiescent galaxies at z = 2-7: Demographics and stellar mass functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-redshift ($z&gt;2$) massive quiescent galaxies are crucial tests of early galaxy formation and evolutionary mechanisms through their cosmic number densities and stellar mass functions (SMFs). We explore a sample of 745 massive ($\rm M_*&gt; 10^{9.5}M_\odot$) quiescent galaxies from $z=2-7$ in over 800 arcmin$^2$ of NIRCam imaging from a compilation of public JWST fields (with a total area $&gt;$ 5 $\times$ previous JWST studies). We compute and report their cosmic number densities, stellar mass functions, and cosmic stellar mass density. We confirm a significant overabundance of massive quiescent galaxies relative to a range of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and semi-analytic models (SAMs). We find that one SAM, SHARK is able to reproduce our observed number density with the addition of mock observational errors, but that it is still unable to produce quiescent galaxies of the same masses. We find that no simulations or SAMs accurately reproduce the SMF for massive quiescent galaxies at any redshift within the interval $z=2-5$. This shows that none of these models' feedback prescriptions are fully capturing high-z galaxy quenching, challenging the standard formation scenarios. We find a greater abundance of lower-mass ($\rm M_*&lt;10^{10}M_\odot$) quiescent galaxies than previously found, highlighting the importance of sSFR cuts rather than simple colour selection. We show the importance of this selection bias, alongside individual field-to-field variations caused by cosmic variance, in varying the observed quiescent galaxy SMF, especially at higher-z. We also find a steeper increase in the cosmic stellar mass density for massive quiescent galaxies than has been seen previously, with an increase of around a factor of 60 from $z=4.5$ to $z=2$, indicating the increasing importance of galaxy quenching within these epochs.</description>

      <title>COSMOS-Web: Estimating Physical Parameters of Galaxies Using Self-Organizing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COSMOS-Web survey, with its unparalleled combination of multiband data -- particularly near-infrared imaging from JWST's NIRCam (F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W), provides a transformative dataset reaching down to approximately 28th magnitude (F444W) for studying galaxy evolution. In this work, we employ Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), an unsupervised machine learning method, to estimate key physical parameters of galaxies, redshift, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), specific SFR (sSFR), and age, directly from photometric data out to redshift $z = 3.5$. SOMs efficiently project high-dimensional galaxy color information onto two-dimensional maps, revealing how physical properties vary among galaxies with similar spectral energy distributions.We first validate our approach using mock galaxy catalogs from the HORIZON-AGN simulation, where the SOM accurately recovers the true parameters, demonstrating its robustness. Applying the method to COSMOS-Web observations, we find that the SOM delivers reliable estimates despite the increased complexity of real galaxy populations. Performance metrics (NMAD and RMSE typically between 0.1 and 0.3) confirm the method's precision, with about 70\% of predictions falling within one standard deviation (dex) of the reference values. While redshift estimation in COSMOS-Web presents challenges (median NMAD = 0.05), the overall success of the SOM highlights its potential as a powerful and interpretable tool for galaxy parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Stellar distributions around supermassive black holes in gas-rich nuclear star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stellar distribution around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in gas-rich nuclear star clusters (NSCs). NSCs could contain vast amounts of gas, which contribute significantly to shaping the stellar distribution, typically altering the stellar density cusp from the usual Bahcall \&amp; Wolf 1976 solution and consequently affecting the dynamics in the NSC. The dense gaseous environment in NSCs gives rise to dynamical phenomena that are otherwise rare in other gas-free environments. Here we extend the derivation introduced in Bahcall \&amp; Wolf 1976 to include an additional energy dissipation term associated with gas drag. We examine the effect of different forms of gas drag on the stellar density distribution. Finally, we discuss implications on the rates of tidal disruption events and other transients triggered by stellar interactions in gas-rich galactic nuclei.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every halo of collisionless dark matter contains a $\rho = A r^{-1.5}$ density cusp at its center. This prompt cusp is a relic of the halo's earliest moments and has a mass comparable to the cutoff scale in the spectrum of initial density perturbations. In this work, we provide a framework to predict for each halo the coefficient $A$ of its central cusp. We also present a "cusp-NFW" functional form that accurately describes the density profile of a halo with a prompt cusp at its center. Accurate characterization of each halo's central cusp is of particular importance in the study of warm dark matter models, for which the spectral cutoff is on an astrophysically relevant mass scale. To facilitate easy incorporation of prompt cusps into any halo modeling approach, we provide a code package that implements the cusp-halo relation and the cusp-NFW density profile.</description>

      <title>COSMOS-Web: Comprehensive Data Reduction for Wide-Area JWST NIRCam Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the data reduction methodology used for the COSMOS-Web survey JWST NIRCam data. Covering 0.54 deg^2 with four broadband filters (F115W, F150W, F277W, F444W) and a total exposure time of approximately 270 hours, COSMOS-Web represents the largest contiguous field surveyed during JWST Cycle 1, posing unique data reduction challenges due to its extensive scale. By combining the official JWST Calibration Pipeline with custom improvements for noise removal, background subtraction, and astrometric alignment, we achieve high fidelity science-ready mosaics. We detail the systematic approach employed in the three stages of the JWST Calibration Pipeline. The data, collected in three epochs from January 2023 to January 2024, encompass 152 visits and have been processed into 20 mosaic tiles to optimize computational efficiency and data processing. The final data products achieve 5 sigma depths of 26.7-28.3 AB mag in 0.15" apertures. The processed and calibrated datasets are made available to the public.</description>

      <title>Dynamical mass of the Serpens intermediate-mass young stellar system EC\,95 with DYNAMO--VLBA</title>

Abstract: We present dynamical mass measurements, obtained from multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations, for the young multiple stellar system EC\,95, located in the core of the Serpens star-forming region. Our dataset includes both archival data and more recent observations obtained as part of the \textit{Dynamical Masses of Young Stellar Multiple Systems with the VLBA project} (DYNAMO--VLBA), totalling 32 epochs over 12 years of observation. The observations span more than half of the EC\,95AB orbit, which has an estimated period of $21.6\pm0.1$ years, and yield masses of $2.15\pm0.10$ M$_\odot$ for EC\,95A and $2.00\pm0.12$ M$_\odot$ for EC\,95B. Furthermore, for the first time, we have estimated the mass of the third component (EC\,95C) using four available radio detections as well as an infrared observation. We find it to be 0.26 $^{+0.53}_{-0.46}$ M$_\odot$, suggesting that E\,95C is a low-mass T Tauri star. We conclude that EC\,95 is a hierarchical triple system comprised of a tight central binary proto-Herbig\,AeBe system and a lower mass companion on a wider orbit. These results contribute to improve our understanding of the stellar dynamics in this system and provide valuable insights into its triple nature.</description>

      <title>Eye of the vortex: bound spectra in tunable horizonless rotational analogs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analog gravity experiments are making remarkable strides in unveiling both the classical and quantum nature of black holes. By harnessing diverse states of matter, contemporary tabletop setups now replicate strong-field phenomena typically confined to the enigmatic regions surrounding black holes. Through these modern gravity simulators, physical processes once considered elusive may finally be brought into experimental reach. In this work, we investigate the bound spectrum of massless scalar excitations propagating within the effective geometry of a rotating acoustic metric. Specifically, we utilize an analog vortex endowed with a tunable parameter that emulates the spacetime of a rotating gravitational background. This model accommodates both the presence of a sonic horizon--characteristic of an acoustic black hole--for non-zero tuning parameters, and its absence when the parameter vanishes, yielding a horizonless, purely rotational vortex flow devoid of radial inflow. We focus on the latter case, where the vortex flow is purely rotational, and compute the spectral properties of the analog system. The resulting bound-state spectrum is found to be qualitatively consistent with that observed in recent experimental realizations of superfluid Helium giant quantum vortices featuring solid or hollow cores. This correspondence suggests that the analog spacetime geometry used here holds significant potential to replicate the phenomenology of cutting-edge laboratory experiments. In doing so, it offers new insight into the intricate landscape of analog black hole spectroscopy and, potentially, the physical topography of bounded, rotating astrophysical environments around black holes.</description>

      <title>An independent estimate of H(z) at z = 0.5 from the stellar ages of brightest cluster galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several cosmological observations (e.g., Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Supernovae Type Ia, and local distance ladder measurements such as Cepheids) have been used to measure the global expansion rate of the Universe, i.e., the Hubble constant, $H_{0}$. However, these precision measurements have revealed tensions between different probes that are proving difficult to solve. Independent, robust techniques must be exploited to validate results or mitigate systematic effects. We use the Cosmic Chronometer (CC) method, which leverages the differential age evolution of passive galaxies, to measure $H(z)$, without any assumption of the underlying cosmology. Unlike previous CC studies, we used only brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), the oldest and most massive galaxies in the Universe, to construct a pure and homogeneous sample. In this work we used a sample of 53 BCGs in massive, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich selected galaxy clusters (0.3 $&lt; z &lt;$ 0.7) with Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) spectroscopic observations. We used optical spectra to measure D4000$_{\rm n}$ of the BCGs to obtain a new direct measurement of $H(z) = 72.1 \pm 33.9(\rm stat) \pm 7.3$(syst) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ at $z=0.5$. By using BCGs, we significantly reduced the systematic errors to 10% by minimising the stellar mass and metallicity dependence of the method. The dominant uncertainty, and limitation for our study, is statistical, and we need larger, homogeneous samples of the oldest, most massive galaxies. By using the $Planck$+BAO prior of $\Omega_{m}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda}$, the projected Hubble constant is $H_{0}$ = $54.6 \pm 25.7(\rm stat) \pm 5.5$(syst) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, consistent with both CMB and Cepheid measurements.</description>

      <title>A Correlation Between FRB Dispersion Measure and Foreground Large-Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution of baryons in the Universe remains a fundamental open question in astronomy, and the dispersion measure (DM) of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) serves as a valuable tool for probing this cosmic gas. We investigate the impact of the foreground cosmic web on FRB DMs using 61 localized FRBs and public galaxy catalogs. We test for the large-scale structure's impact on cosmological DM using two methods. First, we searched for a correlation between galaxy number density along the line of sight and extragalactic DM, and found a statistically significant positive correlation ($p$ = $1.76 \times 10^{-5}$). The shape of this correlation contains information about the cosmic baryon distribution, and can also be used to better constrain host galaxy DM by providing an estimate of the cosmic contribution on a per-source basis. We observe similar correlations in a mock FRB survey based on the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation, where the DM is dominated by filaments in the IGM and not by halos. Next, we performed a stacking analysis that measures the average excess DM as a function of impact parameter of foreground galaxies to obtain spatial information about how ionized gas is distributed around galaxy halos. We report excess DM in the stacked signal for impact parameters up to Mpc scales ($\sim$3$\sigma$). Finally, we identified FRBs that do not appear to intersect intervening halos within $r_{vir}$, allowing us to estimate the fraction of baryons that reside in the IGM. We find $f_{\mathrm{IGM}} \geq 0.69$ at 95$\%$ confidence, indicating significant astrophysical feedback.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Line-of-sight selection biases in galaxy-scale strong lensing with external convergence and shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will dramatically increase the number of strong gravitational lensing systems, requiring precise modeling of line-of-sight (LOS) effects to mitigate biases in lensing observations and cosmological inferences. We develop a method to construct joint distributions of external convergence ($\kappa_{\mathrm{ext}}$) and shear ($\gamma_{\mathrm{ext}}$) for strong lensing LOS by aggregating large-scale structure simulations with high-resolution halo renderings and non-linear correction. Our approach captures both smooth background matter and perturbations from halos, enabling accurate modeling of LOS effects. We apply non-linear LOS corrections to $\kappa_{\mathrm{ext}}$ and $\gamma_{\mathrm{ext}}$ that address the non-additive lensing effects caused by objects along the LOS in strong lensing. We find that, with a minimum image separation of $1.0^{\prime\prime}$, non-linear LOS correction due to the presence of a dominant deflector slightly increases the ratio of quadruple to double lenses; this non-linear LOS correction also introduces systematic biases of $\sim 0.1\%$ for galaxy-AGN lenses in the inferred Hubble constant ($H_0$) if not accounted for. We also observe a $0.66\%$ bias for galaxy-galaxy lenses on $H_0$, and even larger biases up to $1.02\%$ for galaxy-AGN systems if LOS effects are not accounted for. These results highlight the importance of LOS for precision cosmology. The publicly available code and datasets provide tools for incorporating LOS effects in future analyses.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Mergers in the Epoch of Reionization I: A JWST Study of Pair Fractions, Merger Rates, and Stellar Mass Accretion Rates at $z = 4.5-11.5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a full analysis of galaxy major merger pair fractions, merger rates, and mass accretion rates, thus uncovering the role of mergers in galaxy formation at the earliest previously unexplored epoch of $4.5&lt;z&lt;11.5$. We target galaxies with masses $\log_{10}(\mathrm{M}_*/\mathrm{M}_\odot) = 8.0 - 10.0$, utilizing data from eight JWST Cycle-1 fields (CEERS, JADES GOODS-S, NEP-TDF, NGDEEP, GLASS, El-Gordo, SMACS-0723, MACS-0416), covering an unmasked area of 189.36 $\mathrm{arcmin}^2$. We develop a new probabilistic pair-counting methodology that integrates full photometric redshift posteriors and corrects for detection incompleteness to quantify close pairs with physical projected separations between 20 and 50 kpc. Our analysis reveals an increase in pair fractions up to $z = 8$, reaching $0.211 \pm 0.065$, followed by a statistically flat evolution to $z = 11.5$. We find that the galaxy merger rate increases from the local Universe up to $z = 6$ and then stabilizes at a value of $\sim 6$ Gyr$^{-1}$ up to $z = 11.5$. The redshift evolution of both pair fractions and merger rates is well described by a power-law plus exponential model. In addition, we measure that the average galaxy increases its stellar mass due to mergers by a factor of $2.77 \pm 0.99$ from redshift $z = 10.5$ to $z = 5.0$. Lastly, we investigate the impact of mergers on galaxy stellar mass growth, revealing that mergers contribute as much as $71 \pm 25\%$ to galaxy stellar mass growth. This indicates that mergers drive about half of galaxy assembly at high redshift.</description>

      <title>No Evidence of a Dichotomy in the Elliptical Galaxy Population</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of large integral field spectroscopic surveys has found that elliptical galaxies (EGs) can be classified into two classes: the fast rotators (whose kinematics are dominated by rotation) and the slow rotators (which exhibit slow or no rotation pattern). It is often suggested that while the slow rotators typically have boxy isophotal shapes, have a high $\alpha$-to-iron abundance ratio, and are quite massive, the fast rotators often exhibit the opposite properties (that is, having disky isophotes, lower $\alpha$-to-iron ratio, and of typical masses). Whether the EGs consist of two distinct populations (i.e., a dichotomy exists), remains an unsolved issue. To examine the existence of the dichotomy, we used a sample of 1,895 EGs from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey, and measured robustly the stellar kinematics, isophotal shapes, and [Mg/Fe] ratio. We confirmed the previous finding that the bulk of the EGs are disky (65%) and fast rotators (67%), but found no evidence supporting a dichotomy, based on a principal component analysis. The different classes (boxy/disky and slow/fast rotators) of EGs occupy slightly different loci in the principal component space. This may explain the observed trends that led to the premature support of a dichotomy based on small samples of galaxies.</description>

      <title>A 3D Model of the Local Bubble's Magnetic Field: Insights from Dust and Starlight Polarization</title>

Abstract: Clustered stellar feedback creates expanding voids in the magnetized interstellar medium known as superbubbles. Although theory suggests that superbubble expansion is influenced by interstellar magnetic fields, direct observational data on 3D superbubble magnetic field geometry is limited. The Sun's location inside the Local Bubble provides a unique opportunity to infer a superbubble's 3D magnetic field orientation, under the assumptions that: $\mathrm{I}$) the Local Bubble's surface is the primary contributor to plane-of-the-sky polarization observations across much of the sky, and $\mathrm{II}$) the Local Bubble's magnetic field is tangent to its dust-traced shell. In this work, we validate these assumptions and construct a model of the Local Bubble's 3D B-field orientation from $\textit{Planck}$ 353 GHz polarization observations and a 3D-dust-derived model of the Local Bubble's shell. We test Assumption $\mathrm{I}$ by examining correlations between the Local Bubble's 3D geometry, dust polarization, and starlight polarization. We find that the Local Bubble likely dominates the polarized signal in the majority of lines of sight. We jointly test Assumptions $\mathrm{I}$ and $\mathrm{II}$ by applying our reconstruction method to a simulated superbubble, where we successfully reconstruct the 3D magnetic field orientation over the bulk of its surface. Finally, we use our 3D B-field model to infer the initial magnetic field orientation in the solar neighborhood prior to the Local Bubble's formation, and derive an orientation parallel to the present-day Local Arm of the galaxy. These findings provide new insights into the co-evolution of superbubbles and the magnetized interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Effects of Metallicity on Graphite, TiC, and SiC Condensation in Carbon Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From transmission electron microscopy and other laboratory studies of presolar grains, the implicit condensation sequence of carbon-bearing condensates in circumstellar envelopes of carbon stars is (from first to last) TiC-graphite-SiC. We use thermochemical equilibrium condensation calculations and show that the condensation sequence of TiC, graphite, and SiC depends on metallicity in addition to C/O ratio and total pressure. Calculations were performed for a characteristic carbon star ratio of C/O = 1.2 from 1E-10 to 1E-4 bars total pressure and for uniform metallicity variations ranging from 0.01 to 100 times solar elemental abundances. TiC always condenses before SiC, and the carbide condensation temperatures increase with increasing metallicity and total pressure. Graphite, however, can condense in a cooling circumstellar envelope before TiC, between TiC and SiC, or after SiC, depending on the carbon-bearing gas chemistry, which is dependent on metallicity and total pressure. Analytical expressions for the graphite, TiC, and SiC condensation temperatures as functions of metallicity and total pressure are presented. The inferred sequence from laboratory presolar grain studies, TiC-graphite-SiC, is favored under equilibrium conditions at solar and subsolar metallicities between ~1E-5 to 1E-8 bar total pressure within circumstellar envelopes of carbon stars with nominal C/O = 1.2. We also explored the dependence of the sequence at C/O ratios of 1.1 and 3.0 and found that as the C/O ratio increases, the TiC-graphite-SiC region shifts towards higher total pressures and lower metallicities.</description>

Abstract: Galaxy groups with $M_{tot} \lesssim 10^{14}$ $M_\odot$ and up to a few tens of members are the most common galaxy environment, marking the transition between field and massive clusters. Identifying groups plays a crucial role in understanding structure formation and galaxy evolution. Modern deep surveys allow us to build well-characterized samples of groups up to the regime where structures were taking shape. We aimed to build the largest deep catalog of galaxy groups to date over the COSMOS-Web field effective area of 0.45 deg$^2$, leveraging the deep high quality data of the new COSMOS-Web photometric catalog resulted from the James Webb Space Telescope observations of the COSMOS-Web field. We performed the group search with the AMICO algorithm, a linear matched filter based on an analytical model for the group signal. AMICO has already been tested in wide and deep field surveys, including COSMOS data up to $z=2$. In this work, we tested the algorithm performances at even higher redshift and searched for protocluster cores at $z&gt;2$. We compiled a list of known protoclusters in COSMOS at $2 \leq z \leq 3.7$, matched them with our detections and studied the clustering of the detected cores. We estimated purity and completeness of our sample by creating data-driven mocks with the SinFoniA code and linked signal-to-noise to purity. We detected 1678 groups in the COSMOS-Web field up to $z=3.7$, including lists of members extending nearly two magnitudes deeper than the previous AMICO-COSMOS catalog. 756 groups were detected with purity of 80\%. More than 500 groups have their redshift confirmed by assigning spectroscopic counterparts. This group catalog offers a unique opportunity to explore galaxy evolution in different environments spanning $\sim$12 Gyr and to study groups, from the least rich population to the formation of the most massive clusters.</description>

      <title>Galaxy infall models for arbitrary velocity directions</title>

Abstract: For most galaxies in the cosmos, our knowledge of their motion is limited to line-of-sight velocities from redshift observations. To determine the radial velocity between two galaxies the minor and major infall models were established by Karachentsev &amp; Kashibadze (2006). Regardless of the background cosmology, our derivations reveal that these infall models approximate the total radial velocity between two galaxies by two different projections employing different information about the system. For galaxies having small angular separations $\theta$, all infall models agree that the radial velocity is the difference of their line-of-sight components. Applying these models to ca. $500$ halos of the Illustris-3 simulation, we find the perpendicular and tangential velocity parts to be non-negligible for more than 90% of all, more than 5000 infalling subhalos. Thus, even for $\theta &lt; 10$ deg, the infall-model velocities deviate from the true radial velocity. Only for 30% we found the true one lay between the minor and major infall velocity. However, the infall models yield robust upper and lower bounds to the true radial velocity dispersion. Observed under $\theta &lt; 10$ deg the velocity dispersion inferred from the sole difference of line-of-sight velocity components even coincides with the true one, justifying this approach for high-redshift groups and clusters. Based on these findings, we predict the radial velocity dispersion of the M81-group from the minor infall model (upper bound) $\sigma_{\mathrm{r,min}} = (180 \pm 42)~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}$, from the major infall model (lower bound) $\sigma_{\mathrm{r,maj}} = (142 \pm 64) ~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}$ and $\sigma_\mathrm{r,\Delta v} = (99 \pm 36)~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}$ from the line-of-sight-velocity difference.</description>

      <title>Two categories of UV-upturn galaxies revealed by semi-analytic models</title>

Abstract: UV-upturn galaxies are characterized by unusually excessive flux in the far-ultraviolet (FUV) band, observed in some elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disk galaxies. We examine UV-upturn galaxies within the semi-analytic model GABE, which embeds the formation of extreme horizontal branch (EHB) stars -- proposed as key candidates responsible for the UV-upturn phenomenon. We have analyzed all related physical processes, including stellar evolution, initial mass functions (IMFs), dust attenuation, galaxy age, metallicity, and binary fractions, in an effort to determine which processes play significant roles. Our findings reveal two categories of UV-upturn galaxies in the semi-analytic model, each with distinct formation channels: old metal-rich quenched elliptical galaxies, which are intrinsic UV-upturn galaxies induced by EHB stars within their old stellar populations, and dusty star-forming galaxies, which are relatively young and may also be photometrically identified as UV-upturn galaxies when accounting for dust attenuation. Dust attenuation contributes to 20% - 60% of the UV-upturn galaxies, depending on the specific dust attenuation models adopted. With the binary star formation model of EHB stars, both of these formation channels exhibit strong preferences for high stellar metallicity. The high-mass end slope of the IMFs is found to have a marginal effect, indicating that a universal IMF is adequate for studying the UV-upturn phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Potential-Driven Metal Cycling: JADES Census of Gas-Phase Metallicity for galaxies at 1 &lt; z &lt; 7</title>

Abstract: The gravitational potential is established as a critical determinant of gas-phase metallicity (12+log(O/H)) in low-redshift galaxies, whereas its influence remains unconfirmed at high redshifts. We investigate the correlation between gas-phase metallicity and effective radius ($R_{\rm e}$) for a sample of galaxies with redshifts ranging from 1 to 7, drawn from JADES (JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey) Data Release 3. We calculate the metallicities using four strong-line methods: ${\rm N2S2H\alpha}$, ${\rm R23}$, ${\rm N2}$, and ${\rm O3N2}$, respectively. After taking out the evolution of size, we find that the offsets of mass-size relation ($\Delta \log R_{\rm e}$) are significantly negatively correlated with the offset of mass-metallicity relation ($\Delta \log({\rm O/H})$) for the four metallicity tracers. Regardless of the metallicity tracer used, we obtain Spearman rank $p-$values much less than 0.01, rejecting the null hypothesis that the observed correlation is statistically nonsignificant and attributable to random chance. This is also true for galaxies with $z&gt;3$, with $p-$values less than 0.05 for the four metallicity tracers. We for the first time find evidence of size playing a key role in determining gas-phase metallicity towards cosmic dawn, suggesting that the gravitational potential influences their material-exchange processes with the surrounding environment at very early universe.</description>

      <title>The galaxy-halo connection of disc galaxies over six orders of magnitude in stellar mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (Abridged) The relations between stellar ($M_\ast$), gas ($M_{\rm gas}$), baryonic ($M_{\rm bar} = M_\ast + M_{\rm gas}$), and dark matter halo mass ($M_{200}$) provide unique constraints on galaxy formation and cosmology. The shape of the relations constrains how galaxies regulate their growth through gas accretion, star formation, and feedback; their scatter probes the stochasticity of galaxy assembly.
  Here, we assemble a sample of 49 nearby gas-rich dwarf and massive disc galaxies with unmatched ancillary data. We obtain their gas kinematics and derive their dark matter properties through rotation curve decomposition. Our sample allows us to study the galaxy-halo connection across nearly six orders of magnitude in $M_\ast$. We find that the $M_{\rm gas}-M_{200}$ relation rises monotonically, with galaxies having around 4 per cent of the average cosmological baryon fraction in cold gas. Contrastingly, the $M_\ast-M_{200}$ relation shows a more complex behaviour. A particularly interesting finding is that of a population of baryon-deficient' dwarfs (BDDs) with stellar masses $\sim 1-1.5$ orders of magnitude lower than expected from current models. Yet, baryon-rich galaxies also exist, and we find a large spread in the baryon retention fraction across our galaxies. We compare our findings with semi-analytic and hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations. While the simulations broadly reproduce most observed features, they struggle to match the BDDs and do not capture the diversity in baryon fractions. Understanding these differences will shed new light on how feedback regulates galaxy formation. Finally, we study the dark matter halo concentration-mass relation. We find that below $M_{200} \sim 10^{11}\,M_\odot$, the concentrations are systematically lower than expected. We discuss whether these results stem from the influence of baryonic physics or the environment.</description>

      <title>Phase-space distortion as a key to unraveling galactic bar buckling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the first time, we investigate the resonant structure of $N$-body galactic bar at the stage of buckling using action-angle variables. We studied the evolution of vertical actions ($J_z$) and angles associated with vertical resonance ($\theta_\mathrm{res}=\theta_z - \theta_R$) for all orbits in the bar. For this purpose, we divide the orbits into types according to the behavior (libration or circulation) of their resonant angle with respect to fixed points $\theta_\mathrm{res}=0$ and $\pi$ (vertical resonance). We show that during buckling, flat bar orbits circulating with increasing $\theta_\mathrm{res}$ transformed into banana-shaped librating orbits (resonant capture) or circulating orbits with decreasing $\theta_\mathrm{res}$ (resonant heating). The orbital transformation is accompanied by an increase in $J_z$ and the formation of a boxy/peanut-shaped (B/PS) bulge. During buckling, the phase space $J_z - \theta_\mathrm{res}$ undergoes a distortion creating an asymmetry in the position of the fixed points $\theta_\mathrm{res}=0$ and $\pi$ and in banana-shaped orbits near these points. The fixed point $\theta_\mathrm{res}=0$ may disappear completely. This also breaks the symmetry between the orbits, which are captured into resonance or go into circulation with decreasing $\theta_\mathrm{res}$ near $\theta_\mathrm{res}=0$ and $\pi$. At the same time, near $\theta_\mathrm{res}=0$, banana-shaped orbits with low vertical action $J_z$ appear. This reopens the path of orbital transformation through the fixed point $\theta_\mathrm{res}=0$. The phase space transformation and orbit transformation occur in a coordinated manner and lead to smoothing of phase space perturbations and restoration of symmetry between orbits.</description>

      <title>YSO Jets Magnetocentrifugally Driven by Reconnecting Atmospheric Avalanche Accretion Streams Above Inner Circumstellar Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast, collimated jets are ubiquitous features of young stellar objects (YSOs). They are generally thought to be powered by disk accretion, but the details are debated. Through 2D (axisymmetric) MHD simulations, we find that a fast ($&gt;100$~km/s) collimated bipolar jet is continuously driven along the north and south poles of the circumstellar disk that is initially magnetized by a large-scale open poloidal field and contains a thermally ionized inner magnetically active zone surrounded by a dead zone. The fast jet is primarily driven magneto-centrifugally by the release of the gravitational binding energy of the so-called ``avalanche accretion streams" near the boundary of an evacuated poloidal field-dominated polar region and a thick disk atmosphere raised by a toroidal magnetic field. Specifically, the fast outflow is driven along the upper (open) branch of the highly pinched poloidal field lines threading the (strongly magnetically braked) accretion streams where the density is relatively low so that the lightly loaded material can be accelerated magneto-centrifugally along the open field line to a high speed. The highly pinched poloidal magnetic fields threading the avalanche accretion streams tend to reconnect, enabling mass to accrete to the center without dragging along the poloidal magnetic flux with it. The reconnection provides a potential heating source for producing chondrules and calcium- and aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs).</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Systematic Transient Search of Single Observation Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct a systematic search for astrophysical transients using data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). The data were taken from 2017 to 2022 in three frequency bands spanning 77 GHz to 277 GHz. In this paper we present a pipeline for transient detection using single observation maps where each pixel of a map contains one observation with an integration time of approximately four minutes. We detect 34 transient events at 27 unique locations. All but two of the transients are associated with Galactic stars and exhibit a wide range of properties. We also detect an event coincident with the classical nova YZ Ret and one event consistent with a flaring active galactic nucleus. We notably do not detect any reverse shock emission from gamma ray bursts, a non-detection that may be in tension with current models.</description>

      <title>Deuterated water abundance in the young hot core RCW 120 S2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the emission of water molecules cannot be observed from Earth, less abundant isotopologues, such as H$_2^{18}$O and HDO, are used to trace water in star-forming regions. The main aim of this study is to determine HDO abundance in the hot core RCW 120 S2. We performed observations of the hot core in the 200-255~GHz range using the nFLASH230 receiver on the APEX telescope. Two HDO lines were detected toward RCW 120 S2. Their intensities are described by excitation temperature $286\pm2$~K and gas number density $\geq 10^9$~cm$^{-3}$. The emission originates from the hot core rather than the warm dense envelope surrounding a central young stellar object. The HDO column density ranges from $(3.9-7.9)\times10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$ with a most probable value $5.6\times10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$. The HDO abundance relative to hydrogen nuclei is $1.5\times10^{-9}$. This HDO abundance value is among the lowest reported for hot cores. Combined with the non-detection of the H$_2^{18}$O line, we conclude that protostellar heating in RCW 120 S2 is still in its early stages.</description>
