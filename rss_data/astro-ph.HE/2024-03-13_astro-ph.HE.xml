      <title>Non-thermal emission from mildly relativistic dynamical ejecta of neutron star mergers: spectrum and sky image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary neutron star mergers are expected to produce fast dynamical ejecta, with mildly relativistic velocities extending to $\beta=v/c&gt;0.6$. In a preceding paper, we derived an analytic description of the time-dependent radio to X-ray synchrotron flux produced by collisionless shocks driven by such fast ejecta into the interstellar medium, for spherical ejecta with broken power-law mass (or energy) distributions, $M(&gt;\gamma\beta)\propto(\gamma\beta)^{-s}$ with $s=s_\text{KN}$ at $\gamma\beta&lt;\gamma_0\beta_0$ and $s=s_\text{ft}$ at $\gamma\beta&gt;\gamma_0\beta_0$ (where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor). Here, we extend our analysis and provide analytic expressions for the self-absorption frequency, the cooling frequency, and the observed angular size of the emitting region (which appears as a ring in the sky). For parameter values characteristic of merger calculation results -- a "shallow" mass distribution, $1&lt;s_\text{KN}&lt;3$, for the bulk of the ejecta (at $\gamma\beta\approx0.2$), and a steep, $s_\text{ft}&gt;5$, "fast tail" mass distribution -- the analytic results reproduce well (to tens of percent accuracy) the results of detailed numeric calculations, a significant improvement over earlier order-of-magnitude estimates (based on extrapolations of results valid for $\gamma\beta\ll1$).</description>

      <title>The Peak Frequency and Luminosity of Synchrotron Emitting Shocks: from Non-Relativistic to Ultra-Relativistic Explosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchrotron emission is ubiquitous in explosive astrophysical events -- it is a natural byproduct of shocks formed when matter expelled by the explosion collides with ambient material. This emission is well-observed in various classes of transients, and is often interpreted within a canonical `equipartition' framework that allows physical properties of the shock to be inferred from the frequency and luminosity at which the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) peaks. This framework has been remarkably successful in explaining observations of radio supernovae. It has also been used for trans-relativistic explosions, where the shock velocities approach the speed of light. However, the conventional framework does not incorporate relativistic effects. Neither does it account for thermal electrons, which have been shown to be important for high-velocity shocks. In this paper we describe a revised framework that accounts for these two effects, and is applicable to non-relativistic, trans-relativistic, and ultra-relativistic explosions. We show that accounting for these effects can dramatically change the inferred parameters of high-velocity shocks, and in particular -- that the shock velocity, ambient density, and total energy are overestimated by the conventional non-relativistic framework. We delineate the phase-space where such modifications are important in terms of observationally measurable parameters. We also find a novel upper limit on the peak synchrotron luminosity of shock-powered transients, which is remarkably consistent with existing observations. Finally, we discuss a prediction of the model -- that the SED will qualitatively change as a function of shock velocity -- and show that this is broadly consistent with data for representative events (e.g., SN1998bw, AT2018cow, CSS161010, AT2020xnd).</description>

      <title>Probing Lorentz Invariance Violation with Absorption of Astrophysical Gamma-rays by Solar Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute in detail the absorption optical depth for astrophysical $\gamma$-ray photons interacting with solar photons to produce electron positron pairs. This effect is greatest for $\gamma$-ray sources at small angular distances from the Sun, reaching optical depths as high as $\tau_{\gamma\gamma}\sim 10^{-2}$. We also calculate this effect including modifications to the absorption cross section threshold from subluminal Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). We show for the first time that subluminal LIV can lead to increases or decreases in $\tau_{\gamma\gamma}$ compared to the non-LIV case. We show that, at least in principle, LIV can be probed with this effect with observations of $\gamma$-ray sources near the Sun at $\gtrsim20$ TeV by HAWC or LHAASO, although a measurement will be extremely difficult due to the small size of the effect.</description>

      <title>Dual Role of Accretion Disk Winds as X-ray Obscurers and UV Line Absorbers in AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray obscuration of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is considered in the context of ionized winds of stratified structure launched from accretion disks. We argue that a Compton-thick layer of a large-scale disk wind can obscure continuum X-rays and also lead to broad UV absorption such as in the blue wing of Civ; the former originates from the inner wind while the latter from the outer wind as a dual role. Motivated by a number of observational evidence showing strong AGN obscuration phenomena in Seyfert 1 AGNs, we demonstrate in this work, by utilizing a physically-motivated wind model coupled to post-process radiative transfer calculations, that an extended disk wind under certain physical conditions (e.g. morphology and density) could naturally cause a sufficient obscuration qualitatively consistent with UV/X-ray observations. Predicted UV/X-ray correlation is also presented as a consequence of variable spatial size of the wind in this scenario.</description>

      <title>To Be or not to Be: the role of rotation in modeling Galactic Be X-ray Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Be X-ray binaries (Be-XRBs) are crucial in understanding high-mass X-ray binaries, featuring a rapidly rotating Be star and a neutron star companion in an eccentric orbit, intermittently accreting material from the Be star's decretion disk. Originating from binary stellar evolution, Be-XRBs are of significant interest to binary population synthesis (BPS) studies, encapsulating the physics of supernovae, common envelope, and mass transfer (MT). Using the POSYDON BPS code, employing pre-computed grids of detailed binary stellar evolution models, we investigate the Galactic Be-XRB population. POSYDON incorporates stellar rotation self-consistently during MT phases, enabling a detailed examination of the rotational distribution of Be stars. Our fiducial BPS and Be-XRB model align well with the orbital properties of Galactic Be-XRBs, emphasizing the role of rotational constraints. Our modeling reveals a bimodal rotational distribution of Be-XRB-like systems, in excellent agreement with literature values. All Be-XRBs undergo an MT phase before the first compact object forms, with over half experiencing a second MT phase from a stripped helium companion (Case BB). Computing rotationally-limited MT efficiencies and applying them to our population, we find that the majority of Be-XRBs have undergone highly non-conservative MT (beta ~ 0.15). Our study underscores the importance of detailed angular momentum modeling during MT in interpreting Be-XRB populations, emphasizing this population as a key probe for the stability and efficiency of MT in interacting binaries.</description>

      <title>Reheated Sub-40000 Kelvin Neutron Stars at the JWST, ELT, and TMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars cooling passively since their birth may be reheated in their late-stage evolution by a number of possible phenomena: rotochemical, vortex creep, crust cracking, magnetic field decay, or more exotic processes such as removal of neutrons from their Fermi seas (the nucleon Auger effect), baryon number-violating nucleon decay, and accretion of particle dark matter. Using Exposure Time Calculator tools, we show that reheating mechanisms imparting effective temperatures of 2000--40000 Kelvin may be uncovered with excellent sensitivities at the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), and the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), with imaging instruments operating from visible-edge to near-infrared. With a day of exposure, they could constrain the reheating luminosity of a neutron star up to a distance of 500 pc, within which about $10^5$ (undiscovered) neutron stars lie. Detection in multiple filters could overconstrain a neutron star's surface temperature, distance from Earth, mass, and radius. Using publicly available catalogues of newly discovered pulsars at the FAST and CHIME radio telescopes and the Galactic electron distribution models YMW16 and NE2001, we estimate the pulsars' dispersion measure distance from Earth, and find that potentially 30$-$40 of these may be inspected for late-stage reheating within viable exposure times, in addition to a few hundred candidates already present in the ATNF catalogue. Whereas the coldest neutron star observed (PSR J2144$-$3933) has an upper limit on its effective temperature of about 33000 Kelvin with the Hubble Space Telescope, we show that the effective temperature may be constrained down to 20000 Kelvin with JWST-NIRCam, 15000 Kelvin at ELT-MICADO, and 9000 Kelvin with TMT-IRIS. Campaigns to measure thermal luminosities of old neutron stars would be transformative for astrophysics and fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Identifying a point-symmetric morphology in supernova remnant Cassiopeia A: explosion by jittering jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a point-symmetric morphology of the supernova remnant (SNR) Cassiopeia A compatible with shaping by at least two, and more likely more than four, pairs of opposite jets, as expected in the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) of core-collapse supernovae. Using an old X-ray map of argon, we identify seven pairs of opposite morphological features that we connect with lines that cross each other at the same point on the plane of the sky. The opposite morphological features include protrusions, clumps, filaments, and funnels in the main SNR shell. In addition to these seven symmetry axes, we find two tentative symmetry axes (lines). These lines form a point-symmetric wind-rose. We place this point-symmetric wind-rose on a new JWST and X-ray images of Cassiopeia A. We find other morphological features and one more symmetry axis that strengthen the identified point-symmetric morphology. Not all symmetry axes correspond to jets; e.g., some clumps are formed by the compression of ejecta between two jet-inflated lobes (bubbles). The robust point-symmetric morphology in the iconic Cassiopeia A SNR strongly supports the JJEM and poses a severe challenge to the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism.</description>

      <title>AstroSat View of Transient Low-mass X-ray Binary XTE J1701-462: Spectral and Temporal Evolution along the Z-track</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AstroSat observed transient neutron star low-mass X-ray binary XTE J1701-462 for a total duration of 135 ks during its 2022 outburst. The source traced a complete 'Z' shaped structure in the hardness intensity diagram (HID) during the observation. The source exhibited an extended horizontal branch and a short-dipping flaring branch in the HID. We find that most suitable spectral model comprises emission from a standard multi-color accretion disk and Comptonized radiation from a hot central corona. The observed disk component is cool having temperature in the range of 0.3-0.4 keV and truncated far ( ~100 - 520 km) from the compact object. The Compton corona has optical depth in the range of 3.3-5 and temperature in the range of 3.3-4.9 keV. The disk and corona flux as well as truncation radius varies significantly along the HID. We discuss the possible scenarios to explain the relationship between spectral evolution and motion of the source along the HID. The timing analysis revealed horizontal branch oscillations (HBOs) in the frequency range 34-60 Hz. The frequency and rms strength of HBO vary systematically as the source moves along the horizontal branch (HB). The observed correlation of HBO properties with the position on the HB is similar to that reported previously in this source using \textit{RXTE} data during the 2006 outburst of the source. The source also showed NBOs with frequency $\sim$ 6.7 Hz in the middle and lower normal branch. The energy dependent study of the HBO properties suggests that the HBO is stronger in the higher energy band. We also observed very-low frequency noise (VLFN) and band limited noise (BLN) components in the power-density spectra. The break frequency of BLN component was found to be tightly correlated with the HBO frequency. We discuss possible models to explain the origin and nature of the observed features in the PDS.</description>

      <title>A phase-resolved Fermi-LAT analysis of the mode-changing pulsar PSR J2021+4026 shows hints of a multipolar magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of our work is to study the mode changes of the radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar PSR J2021+4026 with improved detail. By accurately characterizing variations in the gamma-ray spectrum and pulse profile, we aim to relate the Fermi-LAT observations to theoretical models and interpret the mode changes in terms of variations in the structure of a multipolar dissipative magnetosphere. We continually monitored the rotational evolution and the gamma-ray flux of PSR J2021+4026 using more than 13 years of Fermi-LAT data with a binned likelihood approach. We clearly detect the previous mode changes and confirm a more recent mode change that occurred around June 2020. We investigated the features of the phase-resolved spectrum and pulse profile, and we inferred the macroscopic conductivity, the electric field parallel to the magnetic field, and the curvature radiation cutoff energy. These physical quantities are related to the spin-down rate and the gamma-ray flux and therefore are relevant to the theoretical interpretation of the mode changes. We computed the relative variations in the best-fit parameters, finding typical flux changes between 13% and 20%. Correlations appear between the gamma-ray flux and the spectral parameters, as the peak of the spectrum shifts by about 10% toward lower energies when the flux decreases. The analysis of the pulse profile reveals that the pulsed fraction of the light curve is larger when the flux is low. We introduced a simple magnetosphere model that combines a dipole field with a strong quadrupole component. We simulated magnetic field configurations to determine the positions of the polar caps for different sets of parameters, and we conclude that some configurations could explain the observed multiwavelength variability.</description>

      <title>Using Equation of State Constraints to Classify Low-Mass Compact Binary Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact objects observed via gravitational waves are classified as black holes or neutron stars primarily based on their inferred mass with respect to stellar evolution expectations. However, astrophysical expectations for the lowest mass range, $\lesssim 1.2 \,M_\odot$, are uncertain. If such low-mass compact objects exist, ground-based gravitational wave detectors may observe them in binary mergers. Lacking astrophysical expectations for classifying such observations, we go beyond the mass and explore the role of tidal effects. We evaluate how combined mass and tidal inference can inform whether each binary component is a black hole or a neutron star based on consistency with the supranuclear-density equation of state. Low-mass neutron stars experience a large tidal deformation; its observational identification (or lack thereof) can therefore aid in determining the nature of the binary components. Using simulated data, we find that the presence of a sub-solar mass neutron star (black hole) can be established with odds $\sim 100:1$ when two neutron stars (black holes) merge and emit gravitational waves at signal-to-noise ratio $\sim 20$. For the same systems, the absence of a black hole (neutron star) can be established with odds $\sim 10:1$. For mixed neutron star-black hole binaries, we can establish that the system contains a neutron star with odds $\gtrsim 5:1$. Establishing the presence of a black hole in mixed neutron star-black hole binaries is more challenging, except for the case of a $\lesssim 1\,M_{\odot}$ black hole with a $\gtrsim 1\,M_{\odot}$ neutron star companion. On the other hand, classifying each individual binary component suffers from an inherent labeling ambiguity.</description>

      <title>Coupling of radiation and magnetospheric accretion flow in ULX pulsars: radiation pressure and photon escape time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accretion flow within the magnetospheric radius of bright X-ray pulsars can form an optically thick envelope, concealing the central neutron star from the distant observer. Most photons are emitted at the surface of a neutron star and leave the system after multiple reflections by the accretion material covering the magnetosphere. Reflections cause momentum to be transferred between photons and the accretion flow, which contributes to the radiative force and should thus influence the dynamics of accretion. We employ Monte Carlo simulations and estimate the acceleration along magnetic field lines due to the radiative force as well as the radiation pressure across magnetic field lines. We demonstrate that the radiative acceleration can exceed gravitational acceleration along the field lines, and similarly, radiation pressure can exceed magnetic field pressure. Multiple reflections of X-ray photons back into the envelope tend to amplify both radiative force along the field lines and radiative pressure. We analyze the average photon escape time from the magnetosphere of a star and show that its absolute value is weakly dependent on the magnetic field strength of a star and roughly linearly dependent on the mass accretion rate being $\sim 0.1\,{\rm s}$ at $\dot{M}\sim 10^{20}\,{\rm g\,s^{-1}}$. At high mass accretion rates, the escape time can be longer than free-fall time from the inner disc radius.</description>

      <title>Gapless neutron superfluidity can explain the late time cooling of transiently accreting neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current interpretation of the observed late time cooling of transiently accreting neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries during quiescence requires the suppression of neutron superfluidity in their crust at variance with recent ab initio many-body calculations of dense matter. Focusing on the two emblematic sources KS~1731$-$260 and MXB~1659$-$29, we show that their thermal evolution can be naturally explained by considering the existence of a neutron superflow driven by the pinning of quantized vortices. Under such circumstances, we find that the neutron superfluid can be in a gapless state in which the specific heat is dramatically increased compared to that in the classical BCS state assumed so far, thus delaying the thermal relaxation of the crust. We have performed neutron-star cooling simulations taking into account gapless superfluidity and we have obtained excellent fits to the data thus reconciling astrophysical observations with microscopic theories. The imprint of gapless superfluidity on other observable phenomena is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Scrutinising evidence for the triggering of Active Galactic Nuclei in the outskirts of massive galaxy clusters at $z\approx1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Environmental effects are believed to play an important yet poorly understood role in triggering accretion events onto the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of galaxies (Active Galactic Nuclei; AGN). Massive clusters, which represent the densest structures in the Universe, provide an excellent laboratory to isolate environmental effects and study their impact on black hole growth. In this work, we critically review observational evidence for the preferential activation of SMBHs in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. We develop a semi-empirical model under the assumption that the incidence of AGN in galaxies is independent of environment. We demonstrate that the model is broadly consistent with recent observations on the AGN halo occupation at $z=0.2$, although it may overpredict satellite AGN in massive halos at that low redshift. We then use this model to interpret the projected radial distribution of X-ray sources around high redshift ($z\approx1$) massive ($&gt;5 \times 10^{14} \, M_\odot$) clusters, which show excess counts outside their virial radius. Such an excess naturally arises in our model as a result of sample variance. Up to 20% of the simulated projected radial distributions show excess counts similar to the observations, which are however, because of background/foreground AGN and hence, not physically associated with the cluster. Our analysis emphasises the importance of projection effects and shows that current observations of $z\approx1$ clusters remain inconclusive on the activation of SMBHs during infall.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Impact of Extra Dimensions on Neutron Star Structure and Equation of State</title>

Abstract: In this work, we explore the impact of higher dimensional spacetime on the stellar structure and thermodynamic properties of neutron stars. Utilizing the density-dependent relativistic hadron field theory, we introduce modifications to incorporate the influence of higher dimensionality, a novel approach not explored in existing literature to our best knowledge. Our methodology involves solving the essential stellar structure equations in D-dimensional spacetime ($D \geq 4$), starting with the modification of the Einstein-Hilbert action, derivation of the Einstein field equation in D dimensions, and application of the resulting exterior Schwarzschild spacetime metric for D-dimension. Our findings reveal that with incremental dimensions, the central density $\rho_{c} G_D$ and central pressure $p_c G_D$ gradually increase, leading to progressively stiffer neutron matter. Incremental dimensionality also results in a gradual increase in the maximum mass attained, limited to our study between $D=4$ and $D=6$, as no maximum mass value is obtained for $D&gt;6$. We consistently observe the criteria $dM/d\rho_c&gt;0$ fulfilled up to the maximum mass point, supported by stability analysis against infinitesimal radial pulsations. The validity of our solution is confirmed through causality conditions, ensuring that the matter sound speed remains within the speed of light for all cases. Additionally, our examination indicates that the total mass-to-radius ratio for all discussed D-dimensional cases comfortably resides within the modified Buchdahl limit, which exhibits the physical validity of achieved results.</description>

      <title>Gapless superfluidity in neutron stars: Thermal properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interior of mature neutron stars is expected to contain superfluid neutrons and superconducting protons. The influence of temperature and currents on superfluid properties is studied within the self-consistent time-dependent nuclear energy-density functional theory. We find that this theory predicts the existence of a regime in which nucleons are superfluid (the order parameter remains finite) even though the energy spectrum of quasiparticle excitations exhibits no gap. We show that the disappearance of the gap leads to a specific heat that is not exponentially suppressed at low temperatures as in the BCS regime but can be comparable to that in the normal phase. Introducing some dimensionless effective superfluid velocity, we show that the behavior of the specific heat is essentially universal and we derive general approximate analytical formulas for applications to neutron-star cooling simulations.</description>

      <title>Second gadolinium loading to Super-Kamiokande</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first loading of gadolinium (Gd) into Super-Kamiokande in 2020 was successful, and the neutron capture efficiency on Gd reached 50\%. To further increase the Gd neutron capture efficiency to 75\%, 26.1 tons of $\rm Gd_2(\rm SO_4)_3\cdot \rm 8H_2O$ was additionally loaded into Super-Kamiokande (SK) from May 31 to July 4, 2022. As the amount of loaded $\rm Gd_2(\rm SO_4)_3\cdot \rm 8H_2O$ was doubled compared to the first loading, the capacity of the powder dissolving system was doubled. We also developed new batches of gadolinium sulfate with even further reduced radioactive impurities. In addition, a more efficient screening method was devised and implemented to evaluate these new batches of $\rm Gd_2(\rm SO_4)_3\cdot \rm 8H_2O$. Following the second loading, the Gd concentration in SK was measured to be $333.5\pm2.5$ ppm via an Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS). From the mean neutron capture time constant of neutrons from an Am/Be calibration source, the Gd concentration was independently measured to be 332.7 $\pm$ 6.8(sys.) $\pm$ 1.1(stat.) ppm, consistent with the AAS result. Furthermore, during the loading the Gd concentration was monitored continually using the capture time constant of each spallation neutron produced by cosmic-ray muons,and the final neutron capture efficiency was shown to become 1.5 times higher than that of the first loaded phase, as expected.</description>

      <title>Compton scattering of electrons in the intergalactic medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the distribution and implications of cosmic ray electrons within the intergalactic medium (IGM). Utilizing a synthesis model of the extragalactic background, we evolve the spectrum of Compton-included cosmic rays. The energy density distribution of cosmic ray electrons peaks at redshift $z \approx2$, and peaks in the $\sim$MeV range. The fractional contribution of cosmic ray pressure to the general IGM pressure progressively increases toward lower redshift. At mean density, the ratio of cosmic ray electron to thermal pressure in the IGM $ P_{\rm CRe} / P_{\rm th}$ is 0.3% at $z=2$, rising to 1.0% at $z=1$, and 1.8% at $z=0.1$ (considering only the cosmic rays produced locally by Compton scattering). We compute the linear Landau damping rate of plasma oscillations in the IGM caused by the $\sim$MeV cosmic ray electrons, and find it to be of order $\sim 10^{-6}\,\rm s^{-1}$ for wavenumbers $1.2\lesssim ck/\omega_{\rm p}\lesssim 5$ at $z=2$ and mean density (where $\omega_{\rm p}$ is the plasma frequency). This strongly affects the fate of TeV $e^+e^-$ pair beams produced by blazars, which are potentially unstable to oblique instabilities involving plasma oscillations with wavenumber $ck/\omega_{\rm p}\approx\sec\theta$ ($\theta$ being the angle between the beam and wave vector). Linear Landau damping is at least thousands of times faster than either pair beam instability growth or collisional effects; it thus turns off the pair beam instability except for modes with very small $\theta$ ($ck/\omega_{\rm p}\rightarrow 1$, where linear Landau damping is kinematically suppressed). This leaves open the question of whether the pair beam instability is turned off entirely, or can still proceed via the small-$\theta$ modes.</description>

      <title>All-Sky Search for Transient Astrophysical Neutrino Emission with 10 Years of IceCube Cascade Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of a time-dependent search for neutrino flares in data collected by IceCube between May 2011 and 2021. This data set contains cascade-like events originating from charged-current electron neutrino and tau neutrino interactions and all-flavor neutral-current interactions. IceCube's previous all-sky searches for neutrino flares used data sets consisting of track-like events originating from charged-current muon neutrino interactions. The cascade data sets are statistically independent of the track data sets and provide a new opportunity to observe the transient all-sky landscape. This search uses the spatial, temporal, and energy information of the cascade-like events to conduct searches for the most statistically significant neutrino flares in the northern and southern skies. No statistically significant time-dependent neutrino emission was observed. For the most statistically significant location in the northern sky, $p_\mathrm{global} =$ 0.71, and in the southern sky, $p_\mathrm{global} =$ 0.51. These results are compatible with the background hypothesis. Assuming an E$^{-2.53}$ spectrum from the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux as measured with cascades, these results are used to calculate upper limits at the 90\% confidence level on neutrino flares of varying duration and constrain the contribution of these flares to the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux. These constraints are independent of a specified class of astrophysical objects and show that multiple unresolved transient sources may contribute to the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux.</description>

      <title>Chiral kinetic theory with self-energy corrections and neutrino spin Hall effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically derive the chiral kinetic theory for chiral fermions with collisions, including the self-energy corrections, from quantum field theories. We find that the Wigner functions and chiral kinetic equations receive both the classical and quantum corrections from the self-energies and their spacetime gradients. We also apply this formalism to study nonequilibrium neutrino transport due to the interaction with thermalized electrons and nucleons, as realized in core-collapse supernovae. We derive neutrino currents along magnetic fields and neutrino spin Hall effect induced by the density gradient at first order in the Fermi constant $G_{\rm F}$ for anisotropic neutrino distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates static and dynamical quark star properties within a $D_3-D_7$ holographic model. We solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for the quark matter equation of state obtained from the brane configuration. We determine the mass-radius diagram for a range of model parameters and compare with recent NICER observational data for the pulsars PSR J$0030+0451$ and PSR J$0740+6620$. Motivated by the GW170817 event detected by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration, we also calculate the tidal deformability parameter obtained for each component of the binary star system. We show that quark stars composed of flavor-independent quark matter derived from the $D_3-D_7$ holographic model are not able to satisfy simultaneously the LIGO-Virgo and NICER astrophysical bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the current status of astrophysical bounds on QCD axions, primarily based on the observational effects of nonstandard energy losses on stars, including black-hole superradiance. Over the past few years, many of the traditional arguments have been reexamined both theoretically and using modern data and new ideas have been put forth. This compact review updates similar Lecture Notes written by one of us in 2006 [Lect. Notes Phys. 741 (2008) 51-71].</description>

Abstract: Relativistic axions can be readily produced in a broad variety of transient sources, such as axion star bosenova explosions, supernovae or even evaporating primordial black holes. We develop a general framework describing the resulting persistent diffuse axion background (D$a$B) due to accumulated axions from historic transient events. We derive strong constraints on the D$a$B flux from light axions $m\lesssim 10^{-3}\,{\rm eV}$ emitted from sources with energies $\omega \gtrsim{\rm MeV}$ considering the non-observation of excess photons associated with axion-photon coupling from experiments, including COMPTEL, NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, INTEGRAL, EGRET and Fermi. Future searches in experiments such as SKA, JWST, XRISM, Vera C. Rubin Observatory, AMEGO/e-ASTROGAM will allow probing D$a$B and associated axion-photon couplings with unprecedented sensitivity covering a wide range of possible source energies as low as $0.1\,\mu$eV and multiple decades in axion masses. We highlight the differences between astrophysical and dark sector sources of D$a$B. Further, we discuss complementarity with direct detection as well as prospects for other D$a$B searches. Our analysis demonstrates that D$a$B can act as a promising probe of populations of axion emission sources as well as emission mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a Past Merger of the Galactic Center Black Hole</title>

Abstract: The origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) residing in the centers of most galaxies remains a mystery. Various growth models, such as accretion and hierarchical mergers, have been proposed to explain the existence and cosmological evolution of these SMBHs, but no direct observational evidence is available to test these models. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) offered direct imaging of nearby SMBHs, in particular, the one at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy named Sgr~A*. Measurements suggest that the Sgr~A* BH spins rapidly with significant spin axis misalignment relative to the angular momentum of the Galactic plane. Through investigating various SMBH growth models, here we show that the spin properties of Sgr~A* provides strong evidence of a past SMBH merger. Inspired by the merger between the Milky Way and Gaia-Enceladus, which has a 4:1 mass ratio as inferred from Gaia data, we have discovered that a 4:1 major merger of SMBH with a binary angular momentum inclination angle of 15-45 degrees with respect to the line of sight (LOS), can successfully replicate the measured spin properties of Sgr A*. This merger event in our galaxy provides observational support for the theory of hierarchical BH mergers in the formation and growth of SMBHs. The inferred merger rate, consistent with theoretical predictions, suggests a promising detection rate of SMBH mergers for space-borne gravitational wave detectors expected to operate in 2030s.</description>
