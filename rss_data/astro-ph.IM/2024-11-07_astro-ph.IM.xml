      <title>Neural Network Prediction of Strong Lensing Systems with Domain Adaptation and Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling strong gravitational lenses is computationally expensive for the complex data from modern and next-generation cosmic surveys. Deep learning has emerged as a promising approach for finding lenses and predicting lensing parameters, such as the Einstein radius. Mean-variance Estimators (MVEs) are a common approach for obtaining aleatoric (data) uncertainties from a neural network prediction. However, neural networks have not been demonstrated to perform well on out-of-domain target data successfully - e.g., when trained on simulated data and applied to real, observational data. In this work, we perform the first study of the efficacy of MVEs in combination with unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) on strong lensing data. The source domain data is noiseless, and the target domain data has noise mimicking modern cosmology surveys. We find that adding UDA to MVE increases the accuracy on the target data by a factor of about two over an MVE model without UDA. Including UDA also permits much more well-calibrated aleatoric uncertainty predictions. Advancements in this approach may enable future applications of MVE models to real observational data.</description>

      <title>Detection of Thermal Emission at Millimeter Wavelengths from Low-Earth Orbit Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of satellite thermal emission at millimeter wavelengths is presented using data from the 3rd-Generation receiver on the South Pole Telescope (SPT-3G). This represents the first reported detection of thermal emission from artificial satellites at millimeter wavelengths. Satellite thermal emission is shown to be detectable at high signal-to-noise on timescales as short as a few tens of milliseconds. An algorithm for downloading orbital information and tracking known satellites given observer constraints and time-ordered observatory pointing is described. Consequences for cosmological surveys and short-duration transient searches are discussed, revealing that the integrated thermal emission from all large satellites does not contribute significantly to the SPT-3G survey intensity map. Measured satellite positions are found to be discrepant from their two-line element (TLE) derived ephemerides up to several arcminutes which may present a difficulty in cross-checking or masking satellites from short-duration transient searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting exoplanets and other faint sources of emitted and reflected light near a bright star requires deeply suppressing the starlight while efficiently transmitting the dim light from its surroundings. This suppression can be carried out by coronagraphs, nulling interferometers, and starshades. This chapter provides a brief overview of these technologies, emphasizing coronagraphs.</description>

      <title>MARFA: An Effective Line-by-line Tool for Calculating Absorption Coefficients and Cross-sections in Planetary Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MARFA (Molecular atmospheric Absorption with Rapid and Flexible Analysis) -- a streamlined efficient tool for line-by-line calculation of atmospheric absorption signatures in the form of PT lookup tables, which may be used in radiative transfer codes. The tool is intended for computations in the IR and visible spectral regions. Core line-by-line scheme features nine-grid interpolation technique, which strikes good balance between speed and accuracy for calculations in the scenario of unknown continuum function and large lines cut-offs. The model features high flexibility, allowing fast recalculations with different line shapes, $\chi$-factors, line cut-offs conditions, and other parameters, making it valuable for planetary studies where atmospheric and spectroscopic data are sparse or uncertain. The MARFA tool is provided in two ways: through a web interface for onboarding and immediate usage, and as open-source code available in a public repository for advanced utilization, development and contributions.</description>

      <title>Constraints and detection capabilities of GW polarizations with space-based detectors in different TDI combinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-delay interferometry (TDI) is essential in space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors, effectively reducing laser noise and improving detection precision. As one of the most promising GW detectors, the space-based detectors are able to observe the effects from GW polarizations. The detection of GW additional polarizations carries significant implications, potentially revealing deviations from general relativity and opening avenues to explore alternative gravity theories. In this study, we examine the impacts of second-generation TDI combinations on GW polarization detection by simulating LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, including realistic orbital effects such as link length and angle variations. The detector performance is assessed through sensitivity curves derived from averaged response functions, as well as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of binary black holes (BBHs). For massive BBHs, the $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{E}$ channels typically offer the best sensitivity, while the $X$ channel in TianQin is most effective for detecting additional polarizations. For stellar-mass BBHs, the $\alpha$ channel provides the highest SNR for vector modes in LISA and Taiji specifically for lower-mass systems, while the $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{E}$ channels are optimal for higher masses or other polarizations. TianQin consistently favors the $X$ channel for additional polarizations. Our findings emphasize the importance of selecting high-sensitivity TDI combinations to enhance detection capabilities across different polarizations, deepening our insight into GW sources and the fundamental nature of spacetime</description>

      <title>From Particles to Pixels: How many particles do I really need to construct stellar kinematic mock observational measurements?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work considers the impact of resolution in the construction of mock observations of simulated galaxies. In particular, when building mock integral field spectroscopic observations from galaxy formation models in cosmological simulations, we investigate the possible systematics that may arise given the assumption that all galaxies above some stellar mass limit will provide unbiased and meaningful observable stellar kinematics. We build a catalogue of N-body simulations to sample the range of stellar particle resolutions within the EAGLE Ref0050N0752 simulation box and examine how their observable kinematics vary relative to a higher-resolution N-body control. We use these models to compile a table of the minimum number of particles-per-pixel to reach a given uncertainty in the fitted line-of-sight velocity distribution parameters. Further, we introduce a Voronoi-binning module to the mock observation code, SimSpin, in order to meet these minimum numbers. Using EAGLE, we show the impact of this shot noise on the observed spin-ellipticity plane and the recovery of this space when observations are binned with increasing numbers of particles. In conclusion, we advise binning mock images to meet at least 200 particles-per-pixel to avoid systematically under-estimating the velocity dispersion along a given line-of-sight. We demonstrate that this is important for comparing galaxies extracted from the same simulation, as well as between simulations of varying mass resolution and observations of real galaxies.</description>

      <title>Half a Million Binary Stars identified from the low resolution spectra of LAMOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary stars are prevalent yet challenging to detect. We present a novel approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify binary stars from low-resolution spectra obtained by the LAMOST survey. The CNN is trained on a dataset that distinguishes binaries from single main sequence stars based on their positions on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The network achieves high accuracy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.949 on the test set. Its performance is further validated against known eclipsing binaries (97% detection rate) and binary stars identified by radial velocity variations (92% detection rate). Applying the trained CNN to a sample of one million main sequence stars from LAMOST DR10 and Gaia DR3 yields a catalog of 468,634 binary stars. This catalog includes 115 binary stars located beyond 10 kpc from the Sun and 128 cross-matched with known exoplanet hosts from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. This new catalog provides a valuable resource for future research on the properties, formation, and evolution of binary systems, particularly for statistically characterizing large populations.</description>

      <title>Limits to dynamic range in GHz-THz single-dish planetary spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When bright solar-system objects are observed by GHz-THz regime telescopes, off-axis signals bounce around locally and re-enter the signal path with a time delay, causing sinusoidal ripples in output spectra. Ripples that are unstable over time are challenging to remove. A typical detection limit for planetary spectral lines is a fraction of order 0.001 of continuum signal, restricting searches for minor atmospheric trace-gases. Modern wideband spectra of Venus demonstrate a plethora of effects, at three example telescopes spanning nearly a factor of 50 in frequency. Characterisation of instrumental effects as families of pure sine-waves via Fourier-analysis is shown to improve dynamic range by factors of a few. An example upper limit on sulphuric acid vapour in the Venusian mesosphere, from fully-automated data-cleaning of a 3.5 GHz band containing 10 line components, goes as deep as the best previously-published limit. The most challenging cases are searches for single lines of width comparable to ripple periods. Traditional polynomial-fitting approaches can be deployed to test for false positives, to demonstrate robustness at a level of zero 'fake lines' in more than 1000 comparisons. Fourier-based data-cleaning avoids subjectivity and can be fully automated, and synthetic spectra can be injected before processing to test to what degree signals are lost in cleaning. An ideal robustness strategy is mitigation at the data-acquisition stage, e.g. using slow drifts in target-velocity with respect to the telescope to isolate a planetary line from a quasi-static instrumental ripple pattern.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The WIYN 3.5m Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory hosts a suite of optical and near infrared instruments, including an extreme precision, optical spectrograph, NEID, built for exoplanet radial velocity studies. In order to achieve sub ms precision, NEID has strict requirements on survey efficiency, stellar image positioning, and guiding performance, which have exceeded the native capabilities of the telescope's original pointing and tracking system. In order to improve the operational efficiency of the telescope we have developed a novel telescope pointing system, built on a recurrent neural network, that does not rely on the usual pointing models (TPoint or other quasi physical bases). We discuss the development of this system, how the intrinsic properties of the pointing problem inform our network design, and show preliminary results from our best models. We also discuss plans for the generalization of this framework, so that it can be applied at other sites.</description>

Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered a surprising population of bright galaxies in the very early universe (&lt;500 Myrs after the Big Bang) that is hard to explain with conventional galaxy formation models and whose physical properties remain to be fully understood. Insight into their internal physics is best captured through nebular lines but, at these early epochs, the brightest of these spectral features are redshifted into the mid-infrared and remain elusive. Using the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument, MIRI, here we present the first detection of H{\alpha} and doubly-ionized oxygen ([OIII]5007AA) at z&gt;10. These detections place the bright galaxy GHZ2/GLASS-z12 at z=12.33+/-0.04, making it the most distant astronomical object with direct spectroscopic detection of these lines. These observations provide key insights into the conditions of this primeval, luminous galaxy, which shows hard ionizing conditions rarely seen in the local Universe likely driven by compact and young (~30Myr) burst of star formation. Its oxygen-to-hydrogen abundance is close to a tenth of the solar value, indicating a rapid metal enrichment. This study confirms the unique conditions of this remarkably bright and distant galaxy and the huge potential of mid-IR observations to characterize these objects.</description>

      <title>Towards multi-messenger observations of core-collapse supernovae harbouring choked jets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Choked jets (CJ) have attracted particular attention as potential sources of high-energy cosmic neutrinos. Testing this hypothesis is challenging because of the missing gamma-ray counterpart, hence the identification of other electromagnetic (EM) signatures is crucial. A CJ source is expected harbouring in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) with extended H envelopes, releasing ultraviolet (UV) and optical emission for a few days. The UV band will be visible with an unprecedentedly large field of view by the future satellite ULTRASAT, for which we investigate the detection prospects in relation to the CJ visibility in the optical band with the currently operating telescope ZTF. ULTRASAT will be able to double the volume of sky currently visible by ZTF for the same emitting sources (sample of observed Type II SNe enlarged by 60%). As these sources can produce neutrinos via hadronic/photohadronic interactions in CJ, we investigate how neutrino observations by existing Cherenkov high-energy neutrino telescopes (IceCube and KM3NeT) can be used in association with EM signals coming from shock breakout (SBO) events. For optimized multimessenger detections, the delay between neutrino produced at SBO (during the jet propagation inside the stellar envelope) and ULTRASAT observations should be of around 4(5) days, with a follow-up by instruments like ZTF about one week after. Fewer than 1% of the CCSNe from red supergiant stars detectable with ULTRASAT might host a CJ and release TeV neutrinos. EM and neutrino detections, if accompanied by photometric and spectroscopic follow-up with evidence for a relativistic jet launched by the central engine, would suggest CCSNe harbouring choked jets as main contributors to the cosmic diffuse neutrino flux.</description>

Abstract: We present cogsworth, an open-source Python tool for producing self-consistent population synthesis and galactic dynamics simulations. With cogsworth one can (1) sample a population of binaries and star formation history, (2) perform rapid (binary) stellar evolution, (3) integrate orbits through the galaxy and (4) inspect the full evolutionary history of each star or compact object, as well as their positions and kinematics. We include the functionality for post-processing hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations as a basis for galactic potentials and star formation histories to better account for initial spatial stellar clustering and more complex potentials. Alternatively, several analytic models are available for both the potential and star formation history. cogsworth can transform the intrinsic simulated population to an observed population through the joint application of dust maps, bolometric correction functions and survey selection functions.
  We provide a detailed explanation of the functionality of cogsworth and demonstrate its capabilities through a series of use cases: (1) We predict the spatial distribution of compact objects and runaways in both dwarf and Milky-Way-like galaxies, (2) using a star cluster from a hydrodynamical simulation, we show how supernovae can change the orbits of stars in several ways, and (3) we predict the separation of disrupted binary stellar companions on the sky and create a synthetic Gaia colour-magnitude diagram. We also discuss some current limitations and plans for future developments. We designed cogsworth and its online documentation to provide a powerful tool for constraining binary evolution, but also a flexible and accessible resource for the entire community.</description>
