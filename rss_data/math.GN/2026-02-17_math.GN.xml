      <title>Statistically p-Upward Quasi-Cauchy Sequences and Cone-Valued Continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce statistically $p$-upward quasi-Cauchy sequences, defined by the condition $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}|\{k\leq n: x_k - x_{k+p}\geq\varepsilon\}|=0$ for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and develop the corresponding notions of compactness and continuity. We prove that a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is statistically $p$-upward compact if and only if it is bounded below, characterizing lower boundedness sequentially. Statistically $p$-upward continuity is shown to imply uniform continuity on below bounded sets. The function space $\mathrm{SUC}_p(E)$ is a closed convex cone that fails to be a vector subspace -- distinguishing it from all previously studied sequential continuity spaces. We establish that every non-decreasing uniformly continuous function belongs to $\mathrm{SUC}_p(E)$, use Weyl's equidistribution theorem to show $\sin x\notin\mathrm{SUC}_p(\mathbb{R})$, prove a step-parameter hierarchy, and show that $\mathrm{SUC}_p(E)\cap C_b(E)$ is nowhere dense in $C_b(E)$. As an application, we develop a one-sided error control theory for function approximation, illustrated by Bernstein operators on a pharmacokinetic model. The inclusion relations among the continuity types studied and open problems are provided.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Aura Topological Spaces with Applications to Rough Set Theory and Medical Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of a fuzzy aura topological space $(X, \tilde{\tau}, \tilde{a})$, obtained by equipping a Chang-type fuzzy topological space $(X, \tilde{\tau})$ with a fuzzy scope function $\tilde{a} : X \to \tilde{\tau}$ satisfying $\tilde{a}(x)(x) = 1$ for every $x \in X$. This framework generalizes the recently introduced (crisp) aura topological spaces to the fuzzy setting. We define the fuzzy aura-closure operator and the fuzzy aura-interior operator, and prove that the closure is a fuzzy additive \v{C}ech closure operator whose transfinite iteration yields a fuzzy Kuratowski closure. Five classes of generalized fuzzy open sets are introduced, and a complete hierarchy among them is established with counterexamples separating all distinct classes. Fuzzy aura-continuity and its decompositions are studied. Separation axioms and fuzzy aura-regularity are introduced. Fuzzy aura-based lower and upper approximation operators are defined, generalizing both the crisp aura rough set model and the Dubois-Prade fuzzy rough set model. A novel FA-MCDM algorithm is proposed and applied to a medical diagnosis problem with comprehensive sensitivity analysis.</description>

      <title>Soft aura topological spaces and rough approximation operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of a soft aura topological space $(X, \tilde{\tau}, \mathfrak{a}_E)$, obtained by equipping a soft topological space $(X, \tilde{\tau}, E)$ with a soft scope function $\mathfrak{a}_E : X \to \tilde{\tau}$ satisfying $x \in \mathfrak{a}_E(x)(e)$ for every $x \in X$ and every parameter $e \in E$. This framework generalizes the recently introduced aura topological spaces to the soft setting. We define the soft aura-closure operator and the soft aura-interior operator, and prove that the closure is a soft additive \v{C}ech closure operator whose transfinite iteration yields a soft Kuratowski closure. Five classes of generalized soft open sets -- soft $\mathfrak{a}$-semi-open, soft $\mathfrak{a}$-pre-open, soft $\mathfrak{a}$-$\alpha$-open, soft $\mathfrak{a}$-$\beta$-open, and soft $\mathfrak{a}$-$b$-open sets -- are introduced, and a complete hierarchy among them is established. Soft $\mathfrak{a}$-continuity and its decompositions are studied. Separation axioms soft $\mathfrak{a}$-$T_i$ ($i = 0, 1, 2, 3$) are introduced; it is shown that soft $\mathfrak{a}$-$T_1$ and soft $\mathfrak{a}$-$T_2$ coincide due to the scope-based formulation. Soft aura-based lower and upper rough approximation operators are defined, generalizing both the crisp aura rough set model and the classical Pawlak model. An illustrative application to environmental risk assessment demonstrates the practical utility of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Fibers of continuous functions that connect or separate some opposite faces of the unit cube, and a generalization of the Lebesgue Covering Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate and prove a dimension-theoretic generalization of the Lebesgue Covering Theorem. A generalized $n$-dimensional version of the Steinhaus Chessboard Theorem, recently proved by Turza\'nski and Ziajor, is a simple consequence of this result. Moreover, we study two types of sets associated with a continuous function $g \colon I^n \to \mathbb{R}$. Namely, the set of all points $p \in \mathbb{R}$ such that the fiber $g^{-1}[\left\{p\right\}]$ connects $i$th opposite faces of $I^n$, and the set of all points $p \in \mathbb{R}$ such that the fiber $g^{-1}[\left\{p\right\}]$ separates $i$th opposite faces of $I^n$. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a continuous function $g \colon I^n \to \mathbb{R}$ in terms of these sets.</description>

      <title>Edge-ends versus topological ends of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diestel and K\"uhn proved that the topological ends of an infinite graph are precisely its undominated graph ends, yielding a canonical embedding of the space of topological ends into the space of graph ends. For edge-ends, introduced by Hahn, Laviolette and \v{S}ir\'a\v{n}, such an embedding does not exist in general.
  In this note, we characterize the class of infinite graphs for which the topological ends admit a natural injective map into the space of edge-ends that is compatible with the canonical maps between end spaces. Our characterization is purely combinatorial and is expressed in terms of edge-equivalence classes of vertices.
  Moreover, when such an embedding exists, we identify precisely which edge-ends arise from topological ends, showing that they are exactly the edge-ends containing a non-dominated ray. This establishes a parallel result to the theorem of Diestel and K\"uhn for edge-end spaces.</description>

      <title>The topology of finite and infinite-dimensional Stiefel manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11800v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stiefel manifolds arise naturally as spaces of linear monomorphisms and as total spaces of universal frame bundles over Grassmannians. While their finite-dimensional topology is governed by Bott periodicity and nontrivial characteristic classes, the infinite-dimensional theory exhibits a striking collapse phenomenon stemming from Kuiper's contractibility theorem. In this expository article, we present a unified treatment of finite and infinite-dimensional Stiefel manifolds over real and complex Hilbert spaces, emphasizing three structural principles: \\ (i) the interpretation of Stiefel manifolds as spaces of injective operators, \\ (ii) the polar decomposition as a canonical factorization yielding both homotopy decompositions and principal bundle structures, and \\ (iii) the role of Grassmannians as classifying spaces in the stable limit. \\ We show that the polar decomposition provides a global homeomorphism \[ \operatorname{St}(n,H) \cong \operatorname{St}_{\operatorname{orth}}(n,H) \times \operatorname{GL}(n,\mathbb{F})^+ \] valid in arbitrary Hilbert dimension, and that this factorization isolates the entire difference between finite and infinite-dimensional topology. In finite dimension, Bott periodicity and characteristic classes control the nontriviality of the universal bundle; in infinite dimension, Kuiper's theorem forces the contractibility of orthonormal Stiefel manifolds while preserving the nontriviality of the finite-rank universal bundle. This perspective clarifies the precise mechanism behind the "stable" approximation of Grassmannians and highlights the structural transition between classical and Hilbertian topology.</description>
