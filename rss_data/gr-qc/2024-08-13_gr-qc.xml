      <title>New one-parameter models of dynamical particles in spatially flat FLRW space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New one-parameter models of non-rotating dynamical particles are derived as isotropic solutions of Einstein's equations with perfect fluid in space-times with FLRW asymptotic behaviour generalizing thus the models proposed recently in [I. I. Cot\u aescu, Eur. Phys. J. C (2022) 82:86]. These particles are produced by central singularities of the fluid density but without changing the pressure of the asymptotic FLRW space-times. The principal features of these models are investigated using a brief graphical analysis for pointing out the role of the new free parameter. The conclusion is that this gives rise to families of models which behave as non-rotating black holes in the physical space domain bordered by the black hole and cosmological horizons.</description>

      <title>Galaxy dynamics tracing quantum cosmology beyond $\Lambda$CDM below the de Sitter scale of acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is proposed that the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (bTFR) and JWST 'Impossible galaxies' at cosmic dawn are unified in weak gravity by the trace $J$ of the Schouten tensor below the Sitter scale of acceleration $a_{dS}=cH$, where $c$ is the velocity of light and $H$ is the Hubble parameter. Across $a_{dS}$, $J$ parametrizes short-period galaxy rotation curves and fast gravitational collapse beyond the predictions of $\Lambda$CDM. The sensitivity of weak gravitation to $J=\frac{1}{6}R$ is derived from in infrared gravitation from a consistent limit of quantum gravity, reducing to general relativity in the limit of a small Planck constant, where $R$ is Ricci scalar tensor. For the first time, it identifies the exact relation $a_0=c^2\sqrt{J}/2\pi$ of the Milgrom parameter across all redshifts, accounting for the bTFR and early galaxy formation accelerated by a factor $\sim J^{1/8}$. It predicts $a_0^\prime(0)&lt;0$ at the present epoch.</description>

      <title>Interacting Dirac fields in an expanding universe: dynamical condensates and particle production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of particle production for quantum field theories in curved spacetimes is crucial to understand the large-scale structure of a universe from an inflationary epoch. In contrast to the free and fixed-background case, the production of particles with strong interactions and back reaction is not completely understood, especially in situations that require going beyond perturbation theory. In this work, we present advances in this direction by focusing on a self-interacting field theory of Dirac fermions in an expanding Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. By using a Hamiltonian lattice regularization with continuous conformal time and rescaled fields, this model becomes amenable to either a cold-atom analogue-gravity quantum simulation, or a dynamical variational approach. Leveraging a family of variational fermionic Gaussian states, we investigate how dynamical mass generation and the formation of fermion condensates associated to certain broken symmetries modify some well-known results of the free field theory. In particular, we study how the non-perturbative condensates arise and, more importantly, how their real-time evolution has an impact on particle production. Depending on the Hubble expansion rate, we find an interesting interplay of interactions and particle production, including a non-trivial back reaction on the condensates and a parity-breaking spectrum of produced particles.</description>

      <title>DSR, Optics and Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate some interesting solutions in the DSR theories. These solutions have important features in optics and mechanics. We use these similarities for a better understanding of these theories. We know that, the vacuum in the DSR has an effective refractive index which depends on the frequency of the light. We find this modified refractive index which leads us to a modified Electrodynamics with some new interesting aspects, for example near the Planck energy the electric field can be stronger or weaker than the usual case. Also, we will find a new modified Lorentz transformations in the first order of the Planck length which are very similar to the usual Lorentz transformations.</description>

      <title>Interpretating Pulsar Timing Array data of Gravitational Waves with Ekpyrosis-Bouncing Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments have reported strong evidence of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). If interpreted as primordial Gravitational Waves (pGWs), the signal favors a strongly blue-tilted spectrum. On the other hand, the Ekpyrosis-bouncing cosmology with a strongly blue-tilted GW spectrum, i.e., $n_T \simeq 2$, offers a potential explanation for the observed SGWB signal. In this paper, we construct a concrete Ekpyrosis-bouncing model, and show its capacity to intepret the PTA result without pathologies. Both tensor and scalar perturbations are analysed with constraints from the current observations.</description>

      <title>Wormhole Geometries Supported by Strange Quark Matter and Phantom-like Generalized Chaplygin gas within $f(Q)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A crucial aspect of wormhole (WH) physics is the inclusion of exotic matter, which requires violating the null energy condition. Here, we explore the potential for WHs to be sustained by quark matter under conditions of extreme density along with the phantom-like generalized cosmic Chaplygin gas (GCCG) in symmetric teleparallel gravity. Theoretical and experimental studies on baryon structures indicate that strange quark matter, composed of u (up), d (down), and s (strange) quarks, represents the most energy-efficient form of baryonic matter. Drawing from these theoretical insights, we use the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) bag model equation of state to characterize ordinary quark matter. By formulating specific configurations for the bag parameter, we develop several WH models corresponding to different shape functions for the isotropic and anisotropic cases. Our analysis strongly suggests that an isotropic WH is not theoretically possible. Furthermore, we investigate traversable WH solutions utilizing a phantom-like GCCG, examining their feasibility. This equation of state, capable of violating the null energy condition, can elucidate late-time cosmic acceleration through various beneficial parameters. In this framework, we derive WH solutions for both constant and variable redshift functions. We have employed the volume integral quantifier (VIQ) method for both studies to assess the quantity of exotic matter. Furthermore, we have done the equilibrium analysis through the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation, which supports the viability of our constructed WH model.</description>

      <title>Gluing small black holes along timelike geodesics II: uniform analysis on glued spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a smooth globally hyperbolic $(3+1)$-dimensional spacetime $(M,g)$ satisfying the Einstein vacuum equations (possibly with cosmological constant) and an inextendible timelike geodesic $\mathcal{C}$, we constructed in Part I a family of metrics $g_\epsilon$ on the complement $M_\epsilon\subset M$ of an $\epsilon$-neighborhood of $\mathcal{C}$ with the following behavior: away from $\mathcal{C}$ one has $g_\epsilon\to g$ as $\epsilon\to 0$, while the $\epsilon^{-1}$-rescaling of $g_\epsilon$ around every point of $\mathcal{C}$ tends to a fixed subextremal Kerr metric; and $g_\epsilon$ solves the Einstein vacuum equation modulo $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^\infty)$ errors. The ultimate goal, achieved in Part III, is to correct $g_\epsilon$ to a true solution on any fixed precompact subset of $M$ by addition of a size $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^\infty)$ metric perturbation which needs to satisfy a quasilinear wave equation (the Einstein vacuum equations in a suitable gauge).
  The present paper lays the necessary analytical foundations. We develop a framework for proving estimates for solutions of (tensorial) wave equations on $(M_\epsilon,g_\epsilon)$ which, on a suitable scale of Sobolev spaces, are uniform on $\epsilon$-independent precompact subsets of the original spacetime $M$. These estimates are proved by combining two ingredients: the spectral theory for the corresponding wave equation on Kerr; and uniform microlocal estimates governing the propagation of regularity through the small black hole, including radial point estimates reminiscent of diffraction by conic singularities and long-time estimates near perturbations of normally hyperbolic trapped sets.
  As an illustration of this framework, we construct solutions of a toy nonlinear scalar wave equation on $(M_\epsilon,g_\epsilon)$ for uniform timescales and with full control in all asymptotic regimes as $\epsilon\to 0$.</description>

      <title>Gluing small black holes along timelike geodesics III: construction of true solutions and extreme mass ratio mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a smooth globally hyperbolic $(3+1)$-dimensional spacetime $(M,g)$ satisfying the Einstein vacuum equations (possibly with cosmological constant) and an inextendible timelike geodesic $\mathcal{C}$, we construct, on any compact subset of $M$, solutions $g_\epsilon$ of the Einstein equations which describe a mass $\epsilon$ Kerr black hole traveling along $\mathcal{C}$. More precisely, away from $\mathcal{C}$ one has $g_\epsilon\to g$ as $\epsilon\to 0$, while the $\epsilon^{-1}$-rescaling of $g_\epsilon$ around every point of $\mathcal{C}$ tends to a fixed subextremal Kerr metric. Our result applies on all spacetimes with noncompact Cauchy hypersurfaces, and also on spacetimes which do not admit nontrivial Killing vector fields in a neighborhood of a point on the geodesic. As an application, we construct spacetimes which model the merger of a very light subextremal Kerr black hole with a slowly rotating unit mass Kerr(-de Sitter) black hole, followed by the relaxation of the resulting black hole to its final Kerr(-de Sitter) state.
  In Part I, we constructed approximate solutions $g_{0,\epsilon}$ of the gluing problem which satisfy the Einstein equations only modulo $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^\infty)$ errors. Part II introduces a framework for obtaining uniform control of solutions of linear wave equations on $\epsilon$-independent precompact subsets of the original spacetime $(M,g)$. In this final part, we show how to correct $g_{0,\epsilon}$ to a true solution $g_\epsilon$ by adding a metric perturbation of size $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^\infty)$ which solves a carefully chosen gauge-fixed version of the Einstein vacuum equations. The main novel ingredient is the proof of suitable mapping properties for the linearized gauge-fixed Einstein equations on subextremal Kerr spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Analytic solutions for the motion of spinning particles near brane-world black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The general motion of spinning test particles to the leading order approximation of spin in the brane-world spacetime is investigated. Analytical integrations for the equations of motion and linear shifts in orbital frequency are obtained. As a result, we found that both the nodal precession and the periastron precession become larger when the tidal charge $b$ of brane-world spacetime becomes smaller. For the periastron precession, the effect is further amplified as the spin increases. Our work can potentially be applied to the study of gravitational waveforms of Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals with spin in brane-world spacetime.</description>

      <title>Evolution of plane perturbations in the cosmological environment of the Higgs scalar field and an ideal scalar charged fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A phenomenological model of an ideal fluid with a scalar charge is formulated, on the basis of which a model with a neutral fluid and a vacuum-field model with rules of transition between them are constructed. A qualitative analysis of the obtained dynamic systems is carried out and numerical cosmological models based on these systems are constructed. A mathematical model of plane longitudinal scalar-gravitational perturbations of the Friedmann ideal charged fluid with Higgs interaction is formulated. It is shown that in the absence of fluid, i.e., in the vacuum-field model, gravitational perturbations do not arise. Perturbations of the scalar field are possible only in those cases when in the unperturbed state the cosmological system is at singular points. For these cases, exact solutions of the field equation are found, expressed in Bessel functions of the first and second kind and describing damped oscillations in the case of a stable unperturbed state and growing oscillations in the case of an unstable unperturbed state. The WKB theory of plane scalar-gravitational perturbations is constructed: dispersion equations are obtained in general form and solved for a neutral fluid. In this case, expressions are obtained for the local frequency and growth increment of oscillations, as well as the integral increment. It is shown that only free wave regimes or growing standing oscillations are possible during the evolution. Perturbations in the WKB approximation in a neutral fluid are studied and it is shown that local formulas for the evolution of perturbations correspond to the model of the 1985 article by M.Yu. The times of the beginning and end of the instability phase are determined and it is shown that instability can develop only at the unstable inflationary stage of the expansion of the Universe.</description>

      <title>On the KG-constrained Bekenstein's disformal transformation of the Einstein-Hilbert action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by an inclination for symmetry and possible extension of the General Theory of Relativity within the framework of Scalar Theory, we investigate the Bekenstein's disformal transformation of the Einstein-Hilbert action. Owing to the complicated combinations of second order metric derivatives encoded in the Ricci scalar of the action, such a transformation yields an unwieldy expression. To `tame' the transformed action, we exploit the conformal-disformal (KG) constraint previously discovered in the study of the invariance of the massless Klein-Gordon equation under disformal transformation. The result upon its application is a surprisingly much more concise and simple action in four spacetime dimensions containing three out of four sub-Lagrangians found in the Horndeski action, and three beyond-Horndeski terms. The latter group of terms may be attributed to the kinetic dependence of the conformal and disformal factors in the Bekenstein's disformal transformation. This is consistent with a related study on the special disformal transformation of the Einstein-Hilbert action where no such beyond-Horndeski terms are found to exist. Going down to three dimensions, we find a relatively simpler resulting action but the signature of three three `extraneous' terms remains. Remarkably, we find in two dimensions the Einstein-Hilbert action to be invariant under the KG-constrained Bekenstein's disformal transformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many formalisms of special relativity are shown in various textbooks. However, even in those where the underlying geometry of Minkowski space is emphasized, the visualisations are lacking. This article aims to remedy this by expressing relativistic concepts in a visual manner, using the full power of hyperbolic trigonometric functions. Minkowski diagrams in energy-momentum space are used and then augmented in comparison with previous uses in literature by direct usage of triangles in Minkowski space. As a proof-of-concept for the advantages of this holistic approach, elegant new derivations of the relativistic rocket equation and the relativistic Doppler effect are presented.</description>

      <title>Large-kernel Convolutional Neural Networks for Wide Parameter-Space Searches of Continuous Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sensitivity of wide-parameter-space searches for continuous gravitational waves (CWs) is limited by their high computational cost. Deep learning is being studied as an alternative method to replace various aspects of a CW search. In previous work arXiv:2305.01057[gr-qc], new design principles were presented for deep neural network (DNN) search of CWs and such DNNs were trained to perform a targeted search with matched filtering sensitivity. In this paper, we adapt these design principles to build a DNN architecture for wide parameter-space searches in ten days of data from two detectors (H1 and L1). We train a DNN for each of the benchmark cases: six all-sky searches and eight directed searches at different frequencies in the search band of 20 - 1000 Hz. We compare our results to the DNN sensitivity achieved from arXiv:2005.04140[gr-qc] and find that our trained DNNs are more sensitive in all the cases. The absolute improvement in detection probability ranges from 6.5% at 20 Hz to 38% at 1000 Hz in the all-sky cases and from 1.5% at 20 Hz to 59.4% at 500 Hz in the directed cases. An all-sky DNN trained on the entire search band of 20 - 1000 Hz shows a high sensitivity at all frequencies providing a proof of concept for training a single DNN to perform the entire search. We also study the generalization of the DNN performance to signals with different signal amplitude, frequency and the dependence of the DNN sensitivity on sky-position.</description>

      <title>Generalized flow-composed symplectic methods for post-Newtonian Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06591</link>

Abstract: Due to the nonseparability of the post-Newtonian (PN) Hamiltonian systems of compact objects, the symplectic methods that admit the linear error growth and the near preservation of first integrals are always implicit as explicit symplectic methods have not been currently found for general nonseparable Hamiltonian systems. Since the PN Hamiltonian has a particular formulation that includes a dominant Newtonian part and a perturbation PN part, we present the generalized flow-composed Runge--Kutta (GFCRK) method with a free parameter $\lambda$ to PN Hamiltonian systems. It is shown that the GFCRK method is symplectic once the underlying RK method is symplectic, and it is symmetric once the underlying RK method is symmetric under the setting $\lambda=1/2$. Numerical experiments with the 2PN Hamiltonian of spinning compact binaries demonstrate the higher accuracy and efficiency of the symplectic GFCRK method than the underlying symplectic RK. Meanwhile, the numerical results also support higher efficiency of the symplectic GFCRK method than the semi-explicit mixed symplectic method of the same order.</description>

      <title>Quantum obesity and steering ellipsoids for fermionic fields in Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger dilation spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates quantum obesity (QO), quantum discord (QD), and the quantum steering ellipsoid (QSE) for bipartite Gisin states subjected to Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilation of spacetime on the second qubit. These three quantifiers are introduced to characterize quantum correlations beyond entanglement and can also function as entanglement witnesses. Our results demonstrate a monotonic decrease in the physical accessibility of both QD and QO as the dilation parameter increases within the region-I of the second qubit. Conversely, in the anti-particle region, the accessibility of QD and QO stabilizes at finite values of the dilation parameter owing to the influence of the Pauli exclusion principle and Fermi-Dirac statistics, subsequently increasing gradually. Notably, the QSE in the region-I expands as the Dirac field frequency rises and the dilation parameter diminishes, while the opposite trend is observed in the anti-particle region.</description>

      <title>Gluing small black holes along timelike geodesics I: formal solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a smooth globally hyperbolic $(3+1)$-dimensional spacetime satisfying the Einstein vacuum equations (possibly with cosmological constant) and an inextendible timelike geodesic, we construct a family of metrics depending on a small parameter $\epsilon&gt;0$ with the following properties. (1) They solve the Einstein vacuum equations modulo $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^\infty)$. (2) Away from the geodesic they tend to the original metric as $\epsilon\to 0$. (3) Their $\epsilon^{-1}$-rescalings near every point of the geodesic tend to a fixed subextremal Kerr metric. Our result applies on all spacetimes with noncompact Cauchy hypersurfaces, and also on spacetimes without nontrivial Killing vector fields in a neighborhood of a point on the geodesic. If $(M,g)$ is a neighborhood of the domain of outer communications of subextremal or extremal Kerr(-anti de~Sitter) spacetime, our metrics model extreme mass ratio mergers if we choose the timelike geodesic to cross the event horizon.
  The metrics which we construct here depend on $\epsilon$ and the (rescaled) coordinates on the original spacetime in a log-smooth fashion. This in particular justifies the formal perturbation theoretic setup in work of Gralla-Wald on gravitational self-force in the case of small black holes.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider dissipative effects in $\Lambda$CDM model, i.e., we consider a universe with cosmological constant having viscous matter. We assume the most general form for bulk viscous coefficient, $\zeta=\zeta_{0}+\zeta_{1}\frac{\dot{a}}{a}+\zeta_{2}\frac{\ddot{a}}{\dot{a}}$ and obtained various constrains for $\zeta$'s . We also studied the background study of the model with $\zeta=\zeta_{0}$ and $\zeta=\zeta_{1}\frac{\dot{a}}{a}$. Extracted the value of $\zeta_1$ using the Pantheon data and also obtained its thermodynamic evolution and the age.</description>

      <title>Addressing the $r_{d}$ Tension using Late-Time Observational Measurements in a Novel deceleration Parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel cosmological model aimed at probing the accelerated expansion of the late Universe through a unique parametrization of the deceleration parameter. We aim to constrain key cosmic parameters by integrating recent measurements of the Hubble parameter obtained from various observational methods, including cosmic chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB), Quasars, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from recent galaxy surveys. With a redshift range spanning $0.106 &lt; z &lt; 2.33$ and incorporating the latest Hubble constant measurement from Riess in 2022, our analysis yields optimal fit values for the Hubble parameter $H_{0}$ and sound horizon $r_{d}$. Notably, we uncover an inconsistency in $H_{0}$ values derived from late-time observational measurements, reflecting the well-known $H_{0}$ tension. In terms of $r_{d}$, while there is close agreement between Joint analysis and Joint analysis with R22, discrepancies arise upon gradual inclusion of BAO and BAO with R22 datasets. Our model demonstrates excellent fit to observed data and aligns well with the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm at higher redshifts. However, its most intriguing aspect lies in predicting a super-accelerated expansion in the distant future, in contrast to the de Sitter phase predicted by $\Lambda$CDM. Additionally, unique behaviors in the jerk parameter hint at novel dynamics beyond traditional cosmological models. Statefinder and $O_{m}$ Diagnostics tests were conducted, and comparison using the Akaike information criterion indicates neither model can be ruled out based on the latest observational measurements. These findings propose our cosmological model as a compelling alternative to $\Lambda$CDM, offering fresh insights into dark energy's nature and the cosmos' future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that the theory of Cotton gravity proposed by Harada is trivially solved by all isotropic and homogeneous cosmologies. We show that this under-determination is more general. More precisely, the degree of arbitrariness in the solutions increases with the degree of symmetry. We give two simple examples. The first is that of static spherically symmetric solutions, which depend on an arbitrary function of the radial coordinate. The second is that of anisotropic cosmologies, which depend on an arbitrary function of time.</description>

      <title>Perturbation Spectra of Warm Inflation in $f(Q, T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03446v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the warm inflationary scenario within the context of the linear version of f (Q, T ) gravity, coupled with both the inflaton scalar field and the radiation field, under the conditions of the strong dissipation regime. First, we calculate the modified Friedmann equations and the modified slow-roll parameters. Subsequently, we apply the slow-roll approximations to derive the scalar power spectrum and the tensor power spectrum. Also, we develop formulations of the scalar and tensor perturbations for the f (Q, T ) gravity with the warm inflation scenario. Furthermore, we scrutinize two different forms of the dissipation coefficient, a constant and a function of the inflaton field, to determine the scalar spectral index, the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the temperature for the power-law potential case. By imposing some constraints on the free parameters of the model, we attain results in good agreement with both the Planck 2018 data and the joint Planck, BK15 and BAO data for the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and consistent results aligned with the Planck 2018 data for the scalar spectral index. In addition, the obtained results are within the range of observational data for the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum. Consequently, we are able to revive the power-law potential that was previously ruled out by observational data. Moreover, for both dissipation coefficients, the model leads to a scalar spectral index with the blue and red tilts in agreement with the WMAP three years data.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic relation of accelerating black holes in anti-de Sitter spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider accelerating black holes in four-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime and investigate the extremality relations by examining perturbative corrections to both the entropy of black holes and their extremality bounds. It is shown that the so-called Goon and Penco (univeral) relation is also valid for accelerating black holes. Furthermore, it is found that an appropriate matching condition is necessary between the perturbation parameter of the relation with the perturbative correction to such black holes, and the parameter with information about the conical deficits on the north and south poles with the cosmic string tensions in order to satisfy the extremality relations. This result indicates that the extremality (univeral) relation of a class of accelerating black holes holds exhibit behavior similar to the Weak Gravity Conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A long-standing problem in physics is why observed masses are always positive. While energy conditions in quantum field theory can partly answer this problem, in this paper we find evidence that classical general relativity abhors negative masses, without the need for quantum theory or energy conditions. This is done by considering many different models of negative-mass "stars" and showing they are dynamically unstable. A fortiori, we show that any barotropic negative-mass star must be dynamically unstable.</description>

      <title>Carroll black holes in (A)dS and their higher-derivative modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the Carrollian black holes corresponding to the limit of Schwarzschild-(A)dS spacetime and its higher-derivative counterpart known as Schwarzschild-Bach-(A)dS spacetime, which is also a static spherically symmetric vacuum solution of quadratic gravity. By analyzing motion of massive particles in these geometries, we found that: In the case of Schwarzschild-(A)dS, a (nearly) tangential particle from infinity will wind around the extremal surface with a finite number of windings depending on the impact parameter and the cosmological constant. In Schwarzschild-Bach-(A)dS, a particle passing close enough to the extremal surface will have an infinite number of windings; hence, it will not escape to asymptotic infinity as in Schwarzschild-(A)dS. We also calculate the thermodynamical quantities for such black holes and argue that it is analogous to an incompressible thermodynamical system with divergent entropy when the temperature goes to zero (in the strict Carroll limit). We then define a divergent specific heat that can be positive, negative, or zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the 21-cm signal in our Universe containing inhomogeneous matter distribution at considerably large scales. Employing Buchert's averaging procedure in the context of a model of spacetime with multiple inhomogeneous domains, we evaluate the effect of our model parameters on the observable 21-cm signal brightness temperature. Our model parameters are constrained through the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method using the Union 2.1 supernova Ia observational data. We find that a significant dip in the brightness temperature compared to the $\Lambda$CDM prediction could arise as an effect of the inhomogeneities present in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Resummation of local and non-local scalar self energies via the Schwinger-Dyson equation in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a massless and minimally coupled self interacting quantum scalar field in the inflationary de Sitter spacetime. The scalar potential is taken to be a hybrid, $V(\phi)= \lambda \phi^4/4!+\beta \phi^3/3!$ ($\lambda &gt;0$). Compared to the earlier well studied $\beta=0$ case, the present potential has a rolling down effect due to the $\phi^3$ term, along with the usual bounding effect due to the $\phi^4$ term. We begin by constructing the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the scalar Feynman propagator up to two loop, at ${\cal O}(\lambda)$, ${\cal O}(\beta^2)$, ${\cal O}(\lambda^2)$ and ${\cal O}(\lambda \beta^2)$. We consider first the local part of the scalar self energy and compute the rest mass squared of the scalar field, dynamically generated via the late time non-perturbative secular logarithms, by resumming the daisy-like graphs. The logarithms associated here are sub-leading, compared to those associated with the non-local, leading terms. We also argue that unlike the quartic case, considering merely the one loop results for the purpose of resummation does not give us any sensible result here. We next construct the non-perturbative two particle irreducible effective action up to three loop and derive from it the Schwinger-Dyson equation once again. This equation is satisfied by the non-perturbative Feynman propagator. By series expanding this propagator, the resummed local part of the self energy is shown to yield the same dynamical mass as that of the above. We next use this equation to resum the effect of the non-local part of the scalar self energy, and show that even though the perturbatively corrected propagator shows secular growth at late times, there exists one resummed solution which is vanishing for large spatial separations, in qualitative agreement with that of the stochastic formalism.</description>

      <title>Fate of $\kappa$-Minkowski space-time in non-relativistic (Galilean) and ultra-relativistic (Carrollian) regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05769v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, we present an algebraic and kinematical analysis of non-commutative $\kappa$-Minkowski spaces within Galilean (non-relativistic) and Carrollian (ultra-relativistic) regimes. Utilizing the theory of Wigner-In\"{o}nu contractions, we begin with a brief review of how one can apply these contractions to the well-known Poincar\'{e} algebra, yielding the corresponding Galilean (both massive and mass-less) and Carrollian algebras as $c \to \infty$ and $c\to 0$, respectively. Subsequently, we methodically apply these contractions to non-commutative $\kappa$-deformed spaces, revealing compelling insights into the interplay among the non-commutative parameters $a^\mu$ (with $|a^\nu|$ being of the order of Planck length scale) and the speed of light $c$ as it approaches both infinity and zero. Our exploration predicts a sort of ``branching" of the non-commutative parameters $a^\mu$, leading to the emergence of a novel length scale and time scale in either limit. Furthermore, our investigation extends to the examination of curved momentum spaces and their geodesic distances in appropriate subspaces of the $\kappa$-deformed Newtonian and Carrollian space-times. We finally delve into the study of their deformed dispersion relations, arising from these deformed geodesic distances, providing a comprehensive understanding of the nature of these space-times.</description>

      <title>Gravitational algebras and the generalized second law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the generalized second law (GSL) for arbitrary cuts of Killing horizons from the perspective of crossed-product gravitational algebras, making use of a recent proposal by one of us for the construction of local gravitational algebras. This construction relies on the existence of a state whose modular flow is geometric on the horizon. In both free and interacting quantum field theories, such states are guaranteed to exist by the properties of half-sided translations on the horizon. Using geometric identities derived from the canonical analysis of general relativity on null surfaces, we show that the crossed product entropy agrees with the generalized entropy of the horizon cut in a semiclassical limit, and further reproduce Wall's result relating the GSL to monotonicity of relative entropy of the quantum field algebras. We also give a novel generalization of the GSL for interacting theories in asymptotically flat spacetimes involving the concept of an algebra at infinity for a half-sided translation, which accounts for triviality of the algebra of fields smeared only on the horizon. Going beyond the semiclassical limit, we compute subleading corrections to the crossed product entropy, but are unable to determine if the GSL continues to hold after accounting for these. We speculate that an improved GSL could follow from a hidden subalgebra structure of the crossed products, assuming the existence of an operator-valued weight between horizon cut algebras.</description>
