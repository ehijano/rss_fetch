      <title>Diversity of Structured Domains via k-Kemeny Scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the k-Kemeny problem, we are given an ordinal election, i.e., a collection of votes ranking the candidates from best to worst, and we seek the smallest number of swaps of adjacent candidates that ensure that the election has at most k different rankings. We study this problem for a number of structured domains, including the single-peaked, single-crossing, group-separable, and Euclidean ones. We obtain two kinds of results: (1) We show that k-Kemeny remains intractable under most of these domains, even for k=2, and (2) we use k-Kemeny to rank these domains in terms of their diversity.</description>

      <title>Strategy Improvement, the Simplex Algorithm and Lopsidedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strategy improvement algorithm for mean payoff games and parity games is a local improvement algorithm, just like the simplex algorithm for linear programs. Their similarity has turned out very useful: many lower bounds on running time for the simplex method have been created from lower bounds for strategy improvement. However, earlier connections between these algorithms required constructing an intermediate Markov decision process, which is not always possible. We prove a formal, direct connection between the two algorithms, showing that many variants of strategy improvement for parity and mean payoff games are truly an instance of the simplex algorithm, under mild nondegeneracy assumptions. As a result of this, we derive some combinatorial properties of the structure of strategy sets of various related games on graphs. In particular, we show a connection to lopsided sets.</description>

      <title>Strategic Analysis of Just-In-Time Liquidity Provision in Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquidity providers (LPs) are essential figures in the operation of automated market makers (AMMs); in exchange for transaction fees, LPs lend the liquidity that allows AMMs to operate. While many prior works have studied the incentive structures of LPs in general, we currently lack a principled understanding of a special class of LPs known as Just-In-Time (JIT) LPs. These are strategic agents who momentarily supply liquidity for a single swap, in an attempt to extract disproportionately high fees relative to the remaining passive LPs. This paper provides the first formal, transaction-level model of JIT liquidity provision for a widespread class of AMMs known as Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMMs), as seen in Uniswap V3, for instance. We characterize the landscape of price impact and fee allocation in these systems, formulate and analyze a non-linear optimization problem faced by JIT LPs, and prove the existence of an optimal strategy. By fitting our optimal solution for JIT LPs to real-world CLMMs, we observe that in liquidity pools (particularly those with risky assets), there is a significant gap between observed and optimal JIT behavior. Existing JIT LPs often fail to account for price impact; doing so, we estimate they could increase earnings by up to 69% on average over small time windows. We also show that JIT liquidity, when deployed strategically, can improve market efficiency by reducing slippage for traders, albeit at the cost of eroding average passive LP profits by up to 44% per trade.</description>

      <title>Regularity properties of distributions of correspondences without countable generation: applications to large games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that each of the regularity properties of regular conditional distributions of correspondences (convexity, closedness, compactness, and preservation of closed graphs) is equivalent to the condition of nowhere equivalence. This result does not require any countable-generation assumptions. As an application, we establish the existence of a pure-strategy equilibrium for large games with general trait spaces. The trait space may be an arbitrary measurable space. As a corollary, we obtain the existence of a pure-strategy equilibrium in semi-anonymous settings in which payoffs depend, in addition to agents' own actions, on the joint distribution over the space of agents and actions.</description>

      <title>Misspecified learning and evolutionary stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the indirect evolutionary approach to the selection of (possibly misspecified) models. Agents with different models match in pairs to play a stage game, where models define feasible beliefs about game parameters and about others' strategies. In equilibrium, each agent adopts the feasible belief that best fits their data and plays optimally given their beliefs. We define the stability of the resident model by comparing its equilibrium payoff with that of the entrant model, and provide conditions under which the correctly specified resident model can only be destabilized by misspecified entrant models that contain multiple feasible beliefs (that is, entrant models that permit inference). We also show that entrants may do well in their matches against the residents only when the entrant population is large, due to the endogeneity of misspecified beliefs. Applications include the selection of demand-elasticity misperception in Cournot duopoly and the emergence of analogy-based reasoning in centipede games.</description>
