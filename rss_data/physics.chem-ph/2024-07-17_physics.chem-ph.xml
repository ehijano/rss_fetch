      <title>Insights into the Mechanism, Selectivity, and Substituent Effects in the Diels-Alder Reaction of Azatrienes with Electron-rich Dienophiles: An MEDT Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reactivity and mechanistic intricacies of azatrienes in Diels-Alder reactions have been relatively unexplored despite their intriguing potential applications. In this study, we employ Molecular Electron Density Theory to theoretically investigate the hetero-Diels-Alder reaction involving azatrienes with ethyl vinyl ether and allenyl methyl ether. Analysis of Conceptual Density Functional Theory, energetic profiles, and the topological characteristics is conducted to elucidate the reactions. The revealed mechanism manifests as a polar one-step two-stages process under kinetic control. We establish a clear relationship of between the periselectivity, regioselectivity, and stereoselectivity on one hand and the characteristics of the reactions mechanism on the other hand. The influence of weak interactions on reaction activation barriers and bonding evolution are discussed in detail. We demonstrate that substituents enhancing the reverse electron density flux facilitate the feasibility of the reactions. The results lay ground for a meticulous control of the reaction of azatriene in similar synthetic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Periodic Local Coupled-Cluster Theory for Insulators and Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the implementation details of periodic local coupled-cluster theory with single and double excitations (CCSD) and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] using local natural orbitals (LNOs) and $k$-point symmetry. We discuss and compare several choices for orbital localization, fragmentation, and LNO construction. By studying diamond and lithium, we demonstrate that periodic LNO-CC theory can be applied with equal success to both insulators and metals, achieving speedups of two to three orders of magnitude even for moderately sized $k$-point meshes. Our final predictions of the equilibrium cohesive energy, lattice constant, and bulk modulus for diamond and lithium are in good agreement with previous theoretical predictions and experimental results.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Photovoltaic Cells Efficiency to Initial Conditions in Various Aggregation Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is thought that nature already exploits quantum mechanical properties to increase the efficiency of solar energy harvesting devices. So, the operation of these devices can be enhanced by clever design of a nanoscopic, quantum mechanical system where the quantum coherence plays a crucial role in this process. In this investigation, we develop a donor-acceptor two-level trap dipole model converging the key role of quantum coherence and aggregation effects along with different initial states. Our analysis reveals that quenching unwanted emissions is achievable by preparing the system in specific initial state under the effect of optimal spatial aggregation. Interestingly it is observed that characterizing aggregation-induced properties and quantum effects of bandgap engineering can increase the power enhancement up to 35.87% compared with classical counterparts. This encouraging trend suggests a promising novel design aspect of nature-mimicking photovoltaic devices.</description>

      <title>Pre-training with Fractional Denoising to Enhance Molecular Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods have been considered promising for accelerating molecular screening in drug discovery and material design. Due to the limited availability of labelled data, various self-supervised molecular pre-training methods have been presented. While many existing methods utilize common pre-training tasks in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), they often overlook the fundamental physical principles governing molecules. In contrast, applying denoising in pre-training can be interpreted as an equivalent force learning, but the limited noise distribution introduces bias into the molecular distribution. To address this issue, we introduce a molecular pre-training framework called fractional denoising (Frad), which decouples noise design from the constraints imposed by force learning equivalence. In this way, the noise becomes customizable, allowing for incorporating chemical priors to significantly improve molecular distribution modeling. Experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing state-of-the-art results across force prediction, quantum chemical properties, and binding affinity tasks. The refined noise design enhances force accuracy and sampling coverage, which contribute to the creation of physically consistent molecular representations, ultimately leading to superior predictive performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the problems of quantum chemistry, the intuition behind classical heuristic methods used to solve them, a conjectured form of the classical complexity of quantum chemistry problems, and the subsequent opportunities for quantum advantage. This article is written for both quantum chemists and quantum information theorists. In particular, we attempt to summarize the domain of quantum chemistry problems as well as the chemical intuition that is applied to solve them within concrete statements (such as a classical heuristic cost conjecture and a classification of different avenues for quantum advantage) in the hope that this may stimulate future analysis.</description>

      <title>Accurate Numerical Simulations of Open Quantum Systems Using Spectral Tensor Trains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoherence between qubits is a major bottleneck in quantum computations. Decoherence results from intrinsic quantum and thermal fluctuations as well as noise in the external fields that perform the measurement and preparation processes. With prescribed colored noise spectra for intrinsic and extrinsic noise, we present a numerical method, Quantum Accelerated Stochastic Propagator Evaluation (Q-ASPEN), to solve the time-dependent noise-averaged reduced density matrix in the presence of intrinsic and extrinsic noise. Q-ASPEN is arbitrarily accurate and can be applied to provide estimates for the resources needed to error-correct quantum computations. We employ spectral tensor trains, which combine the advantages of tensor networks and pseudospectral methods, as a variational ansatz to the quantum relaxation problem and optimize the ansatz using methods typically used to train neural networks. The spectral tensor trains in Q-ASPEN make accurate calculations with tens of quantum levels feasible. We present benchmarks for Q-ASPEN on the spin-boson model in the presence of intrinsic noise and on a quantum chain of up to 32 sites in the presence of extrinsic noise. In our benchmark, the memory cost of Q-ASPEN scales linearly with the system size once the number of states is larger than the number of basis functions.</description>

      <title>A machine-learned kinetic energy model for light weight metals and compounds of group III-V elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a machine-learned (ML) model of kinetic energy for orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT) suitable for bulk light weight metals and compounds made of group III-V elements. The functional is machine-learned with Gaussian process regression (GPR) from data computed with Kohn-Sham DFT with plane wave bases and local pseudopotentials. The dataset includes multiple phases of unary, binary, and ternary compounds containing Li, Al, Mg, Si, As, Ga, Sb, Na, Sn, P, and In. A total of 433 materials were used for training, and 18 strained structures were used for each material. Averaged (over the unit cell) kinetic energy density is fitted as a function of averaged terms of the 4th order gradient expansion and the product of the density and effective potential. The kinetic energy predicted by the model allows reproducing energy-volume curves around equilibrium geometry with good accuracy. We show that the GPR model beats linear and polynomial regressions. We also find that unary compounds sample a wider region of the descriptor space than binary and ternary compounds, and it is therefore important to include them in the training set; a GPR model trained on a small number of unary compounds is able to extrapolate relatively well to binary and ternary compounds but not vice versa.</description>

Abstract: Several closely related ab initio thermal mean-field theories for fermions, both well-established and new ones, are compared with one another at the formalism level and numerically. The theories considered are Fermi-Dirac theory, thermal Hartree-Fock (HF) theory, two modifications of the thermal single-determinant approximation of Kaplan and Argyres, and first-order thermal perturbation theory based on zero-temperature or thermal HF reference. The thermal full configuration interaction is used as the benchmark.</description>

Abstract: Computations of chemical systems' equilibrium properties and non-equilibrium dynamics have been suspected of being a "killer app" for quantum computers. This review highlights the recent advancements of quantum algorithms tackling complex sampling tasks in the key areas of computational chemistry: ground state, thermal state properties, and quantum dynamics calculations. We review a broad range of quantum algorithms, from hybrid quantum-classical to fully quantum, focusing on the traditional Monte Carlo family, including Markov chain Monte Carlo, variational Monte Carlo, projector Monte Carlo, path integral Monte Carlo, etc. We also cover other relevant techniques involving complex sampling tasks, such as quantum-selected configuration interaction, minimally entangled typical thermal states, entanglement forging, and Monte Carlo-flavored Lindbladian dynamics. We provide a comprehensive overview of these algorithms' classical and quantum counterparts, detailing their theoretical frameworks and discussing the potentials and challenges in achieving quantum computational advantages.</description>

      <title>Simple Fermionic backflow states via a systematically improvable tensor decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an effective ansatz for the wave function of correlated electrons that brings closer the fields of machine learning parameterizations and tensor rank decompositions. We consider a CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) tensor factorization of a general backflow transformation in second quantization for a simple, compact and systematically improvable Fermionic state. This directly encodes $N$-body correlations without the ordering dependence of other tensor decompositions. We consider and explicitly demonstrate various controllable truncations, in the rank and range of the backflow correlations or magnitude of local energy contributions, in order to systematically affect scaling reductions to $\mathcal{O}[N^{3-4}]$. Benchmarking against small Fermi-Hubbard and chemical systems reveals an improvement over other NQS-like models, while extending towards larger strongly correlated ab initio systems demonstrates competitive accuracy with more established DMRG techniques on ab initio 2D hydrogenic lattices with realistic long-range Coulomb interactions.</description>

      <title>A Self-Improvable Polymer Discovery Framework Based on Conditional Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04013v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a polymer discovery platform to efficiently design polymers with tailored properties, exemplified by the discovery of high-performance polymer electrolytes. The platform integrates three core components: a conditioned generative model, a computational evaluation module, and a feedback mechanism, creating a self-improving system for material innovation. To demonstrate the efficacy of this platform, it is used to design polymer electrolyte materials with high ionic conductivity. A simple conditional generative model, based on the minGPT architecture, can effectively generate candidate polymers that exhibit a mean ionic conductivity that is significantly greater than those in the original training set. This approach, coupled with molecular dynamics simulations (MD) for testing and a specifically planned acquisition mechanism, allows the platform to refine its output iteratively. Notably, after the first iteration, we observed an increase in both the mean and the lower bound of the ionic conductivity of the new polymer candidates. The platform's effectiveness is underscored by the identification of 14 polymer repeating units, each displaying a computed ionic conductivity surpassing that of Polyethylene Oxide (PEO). The performance of these polymers in MD simulations verifies the platform's efficacy in generating potential polymer candidate materials. Acknowledging current limitations, future work will focus on enhancing modeling techniques, evaluation processes, and acquisition strategies, aiming for broader applicability in polymer science and machine learning.</description>

Abstract: Strong coupling of organic molecules to the vacuum field of a nanoscale cavity can be used to modify their chemical and physical properties. We extend the Tavis-Cummings model for molecular ensembles and show that the often neglected interaction terms arising from the static dipole moment and the dipole self-energy are essential for a correct description of the light-matter interaction in polaritonic chemistry. On the basis of a full quantum description, we simulate the excited-state dynamics and spectroscopy of MgH$^+$ molecules resonantly coupled to an optical cavity. We show that the inclusion of static dipole moments and the dipole self-energy is necessary to obtain a consistent model. We construct an efficient two-level system approach that reproduces the main features of the real molecular system and may be used to simulate larger molecular ensembles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum chemical simulations can be greatly accelerated by constructing machine learning potentials, which is often done using active learning (AL). The usefulness of the constructed potentials is often limited by the high effort required and their insufficient robustness in the simulations. Here we introduce the end-to-end AL for constructing robust data-efficient potentials with affordable investment of time and resources and minimum human interference. Our AL protocol is based on the physics-informed sampling of training points, automatic selection of initial data, uncertainty quantification, and convergence monitoring. The versatility of this protocol is shown in our implementation of quasi-classical molecular dynamics for simulating vibrational spectra, conformer search of a key biochemical molecule, and time-resolved mechanism of the Diels-Alder reactions. These investigations took us days instead of weeks of pure quantum chemical calculations on a high-performance computing cluster. The code in MLatom and tutorials are available at https://github.com/dralgroup/mlatom.</description>

      <title>A versatile and transportable endstation for controlled molecule experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on a new versatile transportable endstation for controlled molecule (eCOMO) experiments providing a combination of molecular beam purification by electrostatic deflection and simultaneous ion and electron detection using velocity-map imaging (VMI). The $b$-type electrostatic deflector provides spatial dispersion of species based on their effective-dipole-moment-to-mass ratio. This enables selective investigation of molecular rotational quantum states, conformers, and molecular clusters. Furthermore, the double-sided VMI spectrometer equipped with two high-temporal-resolution event-driven Timepix3 cameras provides detection of all generated ions independently of their mass-over-charge ratio and electrons. To demonstrate the potential of this novel apparatus, we present experimental results from our investigation of carbonyl sulfide (OCS) after ionization. Specifically, we provide the characterization of the molecular beam, electrostatic deflector, and electron- and ion-VMI spectrometer. The eCOMO endstation delivers a platform for ultrafast dynamics studies using a wide range of light sources from table-top lasers to free-electron-laser and synchrotron-radiation facilities. This makes it suitable for research activities spanning from atomic, molecular, and cluster physics, over energy science and chemistry, to structural biology.</description>

      <title>Network analysis with quantum dynamics clarifies why photosystem II exploits both chlorophyll a and b</title>

      <description>arXiv:2101.04848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In green plants, chlorophyll-a and chlorophyll-b are the predominant pigments bound to light-harvesting proteins. While the individual characteristics of these chlorophylls are well understood, the advantages of their coexistence remain unclear. In this study, we establish a method to simulate excitation energy transfer within the entire photosystem II supercomplex by employing network analysis integrated with quantum dynamic calculations. We then investigate the effects of the coexistence of chlorophyll-a and chlorophyll-b by comparing various chlorophyll compositions. Our results reveal that the natural chlorophyll composition allows the excited energy to preferentially flow through specific domains that act as safety valves, preventing downstream overflow. Our findings suggest that the light-harvesting proteins in a photosystem II supercomplex achieve evolutionary advantages with the natural chlorophyll-a/b ratio, capturing light energy efficiently and safely across various light intensities. Using our framework, one can better understand how green plants harvest light energy and adapt to changing environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Path integral for the quartic oscillator: An accurate analytic formula for the partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09859v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work an approximate analytic expression for the quantum partition function of the quartic oscillator described by the potential $V(x) = \frac{1}{2} \omega^2 x^2 + g x^4$ is presented. Using a path integral formalism, the exact partition function is approximated by the partition function of a harmonic oscillator with an effective frequency depending both on the temperature and coupling constant $g$. By invoking a Principle of Minimal Sensitivity (PMS) of the path integral to the effective frequency, we derive a mathematically well-defined analytic formula for the partition function. Quite remarkably, the formula reproduces qualitatively and quantitatively the key features of the exact partition function. The free energy is accurate to a few percent over the entire range of temperatures and coupling strengths $g$. Both the harmonic ($g\rightarrow 0$) and classical (high-temperature) limits are exactly recovered. The divergence of the power series of the ground-state energy at weak coupling, characterized by a factorial growth of the perturbational energies, is reproduced as well as the functional form of the strong-coupling expansion along with accurate coefficients. Explicit accurate expressions for the ground- and first-excited state energies, $E_0(g)$ and $E_1(g)$ are also presented.</description>

      <title>Efficient calculation of unbiased atomic forces in ab initio Variational Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17608</link>

Abstract: Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is a state-of-the-art numerical approach for evaluating accurate expectation values of many-body wavefunctions. However, one of the major drawbacks that still hinders widespread QMC applications is the lack of an affordable scheme to compute unbiased atomic forces. In this study, we propose a very efficient method to obtain unbiased atomic forces and pressures in the Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) framework with the Jastrow-correlated Slater determinant ansatz, exploiting the gauge-invariant and locality properties of its geminal representation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for H$_2$ and Cl$_2$ molecules and for the cubic boron nitride crystal. Our framework has a better algorithmic scaling with the system size than the traditional finite-difference method, and, in practical applications, is as efficient as single-point VMC calculations. Thus, it paves the way to study dynamical properties of materials, such as phonons, and is beneficial for pursuing more reliable machine-learning interatomic potentials based on unbiased VMC forces.</description>

      <title>Universal neural network potentials as descriptors: Towards scalable chemical property prediction using quantum and classical computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of diverse chemical properties is crucial for advancing molecular design and materials discovery. Here we present a versatile approach that uses the intermediate information of a universal neural network potential as a general-purpose descriptor for chemical property prediction. Our method is based on the insight that by training a sophisticated neural network architecture for universal force fields, it learns transferable representations of atomic environments. We show that transfer learning with graph neural network potentials such as M3GNet and MACE achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods for predicting the NMR chemical shifts of using quantum machine learning as well as a standard classical regression model, despite the compactness of its descriptors. In particular, the MACE descriptor demonstrates the highest accuracy to date on the ${^{13}}$C NMR chemical shift benchmarks for drug molecules. This work provides an efficient way to accurately predict properties, potentially accelerating the discovery of new molecules and materials.</description>

      <title>Competitive exciton and polariton scattering inhibits condensation in two-dimensional metal-halide-semiconductor microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polariton condensation relies on the macroscopic occupation of the lowest-energy polariton state beyond a critical density. The mechanisms driving the occupation and depopulation of this state all rely on multi-particle scattering, whose dynamics determine the extent to which condensates can form spontaneously. To pinpoint many-body processes hindering polariton condensation in two-dimensional metal-halide semiconductors, we examine the exciton-polariton dynamics in a Fabry-P\'erot microcavity over timescales involving polariton ($\bm{\ll 1}$\,ps) and exciton scattering ($\bm{\gg 1}$\,ps). We find enhanced nonlinear exciton-exciton interactions in the microcavity versus the bare semiconductor and ultrafast polariton scattering depopulating the lowest-energy polariton state. We posit that the complex scattering landscape between the exciton reservoir and polaritons limits the formation of polariton condensates in these semiconductors, and we discuss the generality of our conclusions for highly polar materials in which the lattice mediates multi-particle correlations.</description>

      <title>Core-level signature of long-range density-wave order and short-range excitonic correlations probed by attosecond broadband spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in attosecond core-level spectroscopies have successfully unlocked the fastest dynamics involving high-energy electrons. Yet, these techniques are not conventionally regarded as an appropriate probe for low-energy quasiparticle interactions that govern the ground state of quantum materials, nor for studying long-range order because of their limited sensitivity to local charge environments. Here, by employing a unique cryogenic attosecond beamline, we identified clear core-level signatures of long-range charge-density-wave (CDW) formation in a quasi-2D excitonic insulator candidate, even though equilibrium photoemission and absorption measurements of the same core levels showed no spectroscopic singularity at the phase transition. Leveraging the high time resolution and intrinsic sensitivity to short-range charge excitations in attosecond core-level absorption, we observed compelling time-domain evidence for excitonic correlations in the normal-state of the material, whose presence has been subjected to a long-standing debate in equilibrium experiments because of interfering phonon fluctuations in a similar part of the phase space. Our findings support the scenario that short-range excitonic fluctuations prelude long-range order formation in the ground state, providing important insights in the mechanism of exciton condensation in a quasi-low-dimensional system. These results further demonstrate the importance of a simultaneous access to long- and short-range order with underlying dynamical processes spanning a multitude of time- and energy-scales, making attosecond spectroscopy an indispensable tool for both understanding the equilibrium phase diagram and for discovering novel, nonequilibrium states in strongly correlated materials.</description>
