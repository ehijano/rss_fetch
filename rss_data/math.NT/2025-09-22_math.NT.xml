      <title>Large gaps between values of several binary quadratic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the problem of long gaps between values of binary quadratic forms. Let $D_{1}$, $D_{2},\ldots ,D_{r}$ be negative integers and $(s_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be the sequence of all the numbers representable by any binary quadratic form of discriminant $D_{1}$, $D_{2}$, $\ldots$ or $D_{r}$, and let $d :={\rm lcm}\{D_{1},\ldots ,D_{r}\}$. We show that then \begin{align*} \limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{s_{n+1}-s_{n}}{\log s_{n}}\geq \frac{1}{\log d + \log\log d + \log\log\log d + 4}. \end{align*} This improves and generalises a result by Dietmann, Elsholtz, Kalmynin, Konyagin, and Maynard.
  As a by-product of our preliminary results, we show an improvement to the P\'olya-Vinogradov inequality.</description>

      <title>Numbers in the base $e^\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large-scale experiment was conducted to find formulas relating to the base $e^\pi$. The numbers in this base are $$x = \sum_{n=0}^\infty {a(n)\over e^{\pi n}}$$ where $a(n)$ is taken from the OEIS catalog. These  experiments were inspired by several facts. Indeed, it is known that the formula generating the partitions of integers is generated by an infinite product $$\prod_{k\ge1}^\infty {1\over 1-x^k} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty p(n)x^n$$ that when evaluated at $x=e^{-\pi}$ is equal to $${2^{3/8} \Gamma(3/4) \over \pi^{1/4} e^{\pi/24}}\ .\qquad\qquad (1)$$ By analyzing the 387500 sequences of the OEIS catalog, the model that was used is based on the fact that the infinite sum evaluated at $e^\pi$, is an expression that can be detected using a program like lindep from Pari-Gp. The process made it possible to find 793 expresssions similar to (1).</description>

      <title>Zero-cycles on varieties over a $\mathfrak{B}_s$-field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A field $F$ is a $\mathfrak{B}_s$-field if, for every finite extension $E'/E$ of $F$, the norm map $K_s^M(E')\to K_s^M(E)$ of the Milnor $K$-groups is surjective. In particular, finite fields ($s=1$), local fields, and certain global fields (with $s=2$) satisfy this condition. For such a field $F$ and a $d$-dimensional variety $X$ over $F$, we prove that $CH^{d+n}(X,n)$ is divisible for $n \geq s+1$, and $CH^{d+s}(X,s)$ is isomorphic to the direct sum of the Milnor $K$-group $K_{s}^M(F)$ and a divisible group. As an application, we study the Kato homology groups $KH_0^{(n)}(X,\mathbb{Z}/l^r\mathbb{Z})$ for any prime $l$ different from the characteristic of $F$.</description>

      <title>Mayer--Vietoris sequences for complexes of tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the patching setting, given a factorization inverse system of fields over which patching for finite-dimensional vector spaces holds, together with a crossed module over the inverse limit field, the corresponding six-term Mayer--Vietoris sequence is constructed, generalizing the classical result of Harbater--Hartmann--Krashen for linear algebraic groups. When the crossed module is a two-term complex of tori, the above sequence is extended into a nine-term exact sequence, notably without any assumption on global domination of Galois cohomology of the inverse system. To this end, we develop a theory of (co-)flasque resolutions for short complexes of tori which is built on the work of Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and Sansuc. As an application, we show that patching holds for nonabelian second Galois cohomology of reductive groups with smooth centers. We also obtain a weak local--global principle for this cohomology set in the simply connected semisimple case.</description>

      <title>Geodesic clustering of zeros of Eisenstein series for congruence groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a set of generators for the space of Eisenstein series of even weight $k$ for any congruence group $\Gamma$ and study the set of all of their zeros taken for $\Gamma(1)$-conjugates of $\Gamma$ in the standard fundamental domain for $\Gamma(1)$. We describe (a) an upper bound $\kappa_\Gamma + O(1/k)$ for their imaginary part; (b) a finite configuration of geodesics segments to which all zeros converge in Hausdorff distance as $k \rightarrow \infty$; (c) a finite set containing all algebraic zeros for all weights. The bound in (a) depends on the (non-)vanishing of a new generalization of Ramanujan sums. The proof of (b) originates in a method used to study phase transitions in statistical physics. The proof of (c) relies on the theory of complex multiplication. The results can be made quantitative for specific groups. For $\Gamma=\Gamma(N)$ with $4 \nmid N$, $\kappa_\Gamma=1$ and the zeros tend to the unit circle, whereas if $4 \mid N$, $\kappa_\Gamma=2$ and the limit configuration includes parts of vertical geodesics and circles of radius $2$. In both cases, the only algebraic zeros are at $\mathrm{i}$ and $\exp(2\pi \mathrm{i}/3)$ for sufficiently large $k$. For $\Gamma(N)$ with $N$ odd, we use finer estimates to prove a trichotomy for the exact `convergence speed' of the zeros to the unit circle, as well as angular equidistribution of the zeros as $k \rightarrow \infty$.</description>

      <title>Shanks bias in function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the function field analogue of Shanks bias. For Liouville function $\lambda(f)$, we compare the number of monic polynomials $f$ with $\lambda(f) \chi_m(f) = 1$ and $\lambda(f) \chi_m(f) = -1$ for a nontrivial quadratic character $\chi_m$ modulo a monic square-free polynomial $m$ over a finite field. Under Grand Simplicity Hypothesis (GSH) for $L$-functions, we prove that $\lambda \cdot \chi_m$ is biased towards $+1$. We also give some examples where GSH is violated.</description>

      <title>Analytic ranks of twists of Carlitz modules -- a survey of results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give in this paper a survey of results obtained in our earlier papers, and state explicitly some problems of further research, for example: are the analytic ranks bounded, or not? Twists of Carlitz modules are parametrized by polynomials over finite fields $\Bbb F_q$. The analytic rank of a twist is the order of zero of its L-function at a point. The set of polynomials of degree $\le m$ such that the analytic ranks of the corresponding twists are $\ge i$ is $X(m,i)(\Bbb F_q)$ where $X(m,i)$ is an affine variety defined over $\Bbb F_p$ (we do not know what is its dimension). We consider also a related invariant of a twist, namely, the behaviour of its L-function at infinity (the rank at infinity). We know much more on varieties corresponding to twists of a fixed rank at infinity and on their lifts from $\Bbb F_p$ to $\Bbb Z$ . For example, for $q=2$ the irreducible components of these varieties are described in terms of finite rooted weighted binary trees. A similar description for $q&gt;2$ is not found yet.</description>

      <title>Entropy approximations of algebraic matroids over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of entropy polymatroids associated with algebraic matroids over finite fields. Given an algebraic matroid ${\sf M}:=(\mathcal{E},r)$ and the irreducible variety $V$ associated with ${\sf M}$, we consider the polymatroid $h_{\mathbb{F}}$ induced by the entropies of the projections of $V(\mathbb{F})$, where $\mathbb{F}$ is a finite extension of $\mathbb{G}$. Revisiting a construction of Mat\'u$\check{\mathrm{s}}$, we show that the polymatroid $h_{\mathbb{F}}$ converges to the rank function $r$ of ${\sf M}$ as $q:=|\mathbb{F}|$ tends to infinity.
  Our main contribution is to make this convergence quantitative: we derive explicit uniform error bounds for the deviation $|h_\mathbb{F}-r|$, expressed in terms of the degree of $V$, the ground set size $|\mathcal{E}|$, the rank $r(\mathcal{E})$, and $q$. The proofs combine tools of algebraic geometry (effective Lang-Weil estimates and intrinsic degree bounds for annihilating polynomials of circuits) with information-theoretic arguments (submodularity of entropy and conditional entropy estimates).
  These results provide the first effective and uniform approximation bounds for algebraic matroids by entropy polymatroids, clarifying the quantitative link between algebraic independence (captured by matroid rank) and information-theoretic independence (captured by entropy).</description>

      <title>Approximate Fiber Products of Schemes and Their \'Etale Homotopical Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical fiber product in algebraic geometry provides a powerful tool for studying loci where two morphisms to a base scheme, $\phi: X \to S$ and $\psi: Y \to S$, coincide exactly. This condition of strict equality, however, is insufficient for describing the geometric structure of semantic spaces in modern large language models, whose foundational architecture is the Transformer. The token spaces of these models are fundamentally arithmetic, and recent work has revealed complex geometric singularities, challenging the classical manifold hypothesis.
  This paper develops a new framework to study and quantify the nature of approximate alignment between morphisms in the context of arithmetic geometry, using the tools of \'etale homotopy theory. We introduce the central object of our work, the \'etale mismatch torsor, a sheaf of torsors over the product scheme $X \times_S Y$. The structure of this sheaf serves as a rich, intrinsic, and purely algebraic measure of the global relationship between the two morphisms.
  Our main theorem provides a complete classification of these structures, establishing a bijection between their isomorphism classes and the first \'etale cohomology group $H^1_{\text{\'et}}(X \times_S Y, \underline{\pi_1^{\text{\'et}}(S)})$. This result yields a discrete, algebraic invariant that replaces the non-intrinsic, metric-based notions of approximation first explored in applied contexts. We apply this framework to the concrete case of generalized Howe curves over finite fields to illustrate its connection to classical problems. This work introduces new homotopical invariants to arithmetic geometry, opening new avenues for the structural analysis of complex discrete systems.</description>

      <title>The inverse of the star discrepancy of a union of randomly digitally shifted Korobov polynomial lattice point sets depends polynomially on the dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The star discrepancy is a quantitative measure of the uniformity of a point set in the unit cube. A central quantity of interest is the inverse of the star discrepancy, $N(\varepsilon, s)$, defined as the minimum number of points required to achieve a star discrepancy of at most~$\varepsilon$ in dimension~$s$. It is known that $N(\varepsilon, s)$ depends only linearly on the dimension~$s$. All known proofs of this result are non-constructive. Finding explicit point set constructions that achieve this optimal linear dependence on the dimension remains a major open problem.
  In this paper, we make progress on this question by analyzing point sets constructed from a multiset union of digitally shifted Korobov polynomial lattice point sets. Specifically, we show the following two results. A union of randomly generated Korobov polynomial lattice point sets shifted by a random digital shift of depth $m$ can achieve a star discrepancy whose inverse depends only linearly on $s$. The second result shows that a union of all Korobov polynomial lattice point sets, each shifted by a different random digital shift, achieves the same star discrepancy bound. While our proof relies on a concentration result (Bennett's inequality) and is therefore non-constructive, it significantly reduces the search space for such point sets from a continuum of possibilities to a finite set of candidates, marking a step towards a fully explicit construction.</description>

Abstract: We study the Brauer groups of affine surfaces that are complements of singular hyperplane sections of smooth cubic surfaces over a field $k$ of characteristic $0$. We determine the Brauer group over the algebraic closure as a Galois module for all the possible singular hyperplane sections. For the case when the hyperplane section is geometrically the union of three lines and $k=\mathbb{Q}$, we give examples where the Galois invariant part descends to $\mathbb{Q}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Brauer groups of regular conic bundles over elliptic curves defined over a number field $k$. We explicitly compute the Brauer group of the conic bundle when the singular fibres lie above $k$-points that are divisible by $2$ in $E(k)$, and the corresponding ramification fields are isomorphic. We apply the result to compute the Brauer group of a class of surfaces analogous to that of Ch\^{a}telet surfaces. We investigate Brauer-Manin obstructions to weak approximation coming from the real places on such surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure groups and monoids of set-theoretic solutions to the Yang-Baxter Equation can be regarded as deformations of free abelian groups resp. monoids. In this work, we obtain explicit formulae for the growth series of the structure groups and monoids of transposition and dihedral quandles, and of the structure groups of permutation quandles. These quandles provide important families of YBE solutions. The intricate nature of our formulae confirms that, while preserving many nice properties of free abelian groups, even the simplest structure groups and monoids are remarkably rich objects. We also establish some structural properties and easily computable normal forms for the monoids considered.</description>

      <title>On separating sets of polynomial invariants of finite abelian group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group acting on a finite dimensional complex vector space $V$ via linear transformations. Let $\mathbb{C}[V]^G$ be the algebra of polynomials that are invariant under the induced $G$-action on the polynomial ring $\mathbb{C}[V]$. A subset $S\subseteq\mathbb{C}[V]^G$ is a separating set if it separates the orbits of the group action. If $G$ is abelian, then there exist finite separating sets consisting of monomials. In this paper we investigate properties of separating sets from four different points of view, including the monoid theoretical properties of separating sets consisting of monomials, the minimal size of separating sets consisting of monomials, the exact value of the separating Noether number $\sepbeta(G)$ of abelian groups of rank $4$, and the inverse problem of $\sepbeta(G)$ for abelian groups of rank $2$.</description>

      <title>Modular forms for chromatic homotopy: Supersingular congruences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we confirm a conjecture of Larson that arises in the Adams--Novikov spectral sequence (ANSS) for the stable homotopy groups of spheres and, specifically, in Behrens' program on explicit modular forms detecting $v_2$--periodic classes in the divided $\beta$-family. The conjecture predicts the supersingular order of the weight $12t$ form $L_2(\Delta^t)$, when $(p-1)\mid 12t,$ attached to the $\Gamma_0(2)$ Hecke correspondence. We prove the prediction for all primes $p\ge5$, thereby providing the precise modular input that calibrates the relevant ANSS differentials in the Behrens program and removes the last obstruction to using pure $\Delta$-power across the range of indices where Hodge-scaling cancels.</description>

      <title>The average analytic rank of elliptic curves with prescribed level structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming the Hasse--Weil conjecture and the generalized Riemann hypothesis for the $L$-functions of the elliptic curve, we give an upper bound of the average analytic rank of elliptic curves over the number field with a level structure such that the corresponding compactified moduli stack is representable by the projective line.</description>

      <title>A six-functor formalism for quasi-coherent sheaves and stratifications on rigid-analytic varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of derived rigid spaces and quasi-coherent sheaves and analytic "stratifications" on them. Amongst other things, we obtain a six-functor formalism for these quasi-coherent sheaves and analytic stratifications. We provide evidence that the category of analytic crystals is related to the theory of D-cap-modules introduced by Ardakov--Wadsley.</description>

      <title>Producing supersingular curves of genus five</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a prime $p$ congruent to three modulo four, we prove that there exists a smooth curve of genus five in characteristic $p$ that is supersingular. We produce this curve as an unramified double cover of a curve of genus three. We conjecture that the setting of unramified double covers of curves of genus three also produces supersingular curves of genus five when $p$ is congruent to one modulo four, and we computationally verify this conjecture for primes less than $100$. These results can be viewed as a generalization of work of Ekedahl and of Harashita, Kudo, and Senda.</description>

      <title>$c_{\rm eff}$ from Resurgence at the Stokes Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent papers [1,2], a new method to cross the natural boundary has been proposed, and applied to Mordell-Borel integrals arising in the study of Chern-Simons theory, based on decompositions into {\it resurgent cyclic orbits}. Resurgent analysis on the Stokes line leads to a unique transseries decomposition in terms of unary false theta functions, which can be continued across the natural boundary to produce dual $q$-series whose integer-valued coefficients enumerate BPS states. This constitutes a deeper new manifestation of resurgence in quantum field theoretic path integrals. In this paper we show that the algebraic structure of the {\it resurgent cyclic orbits}, combined with just the leading term of the $q$-series, completely determines the large order rate of growth of the dual $q$-series coefficients. The essential exponent of this asymptotic growth has a Cardy-like interpretation [10] of an effective central charge in a 3 dimensional quantum field theory with $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry related to the Chern-Simons theory through the $3d$-$3d$ correspondence.</description>
