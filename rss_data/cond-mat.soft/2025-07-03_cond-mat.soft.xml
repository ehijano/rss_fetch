      <title>Scaling particle-size segregation in wide-ranging sheared granular flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling relationships have been proposed to describe shear-driven size segregation based on intruder experiments and simulations. While these models have shown agreement with experimental and numerical results under uniform shear rate, their validity across varying shear-rate conditions remains uncertain. Here, we employ Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations to investigate particle size segregation in sheared granular flows under wide-ranging shear-rate conditions. We find that the scaling between segregation velocity and local rheological conditions holds only within a moderate inertial number range ($0.01 &lt; I &lt; 0.1$), and breaks down in both quasi-static and collisional regimes. Furthermore, we show that this discrepancy leads continuum models to mispredict segregation rates in bidisperse mixtures. These findings emphasize the need for more generalized scaling laws capable of capturing segregation dynamics across a broader spectrum of shear-rate conditions and regimes.</description>

      <title>Structure and flow of low-dimensional water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water, a subject of human fascination for millennia, is likely the most studied substance on Earth, with an entire scientific field -- hydrodynamics -- dedicated to understanding water in motion. However, when water flows through one-dimensional or two-dimensional channels, its behavior deviates substantially from the principles of hydrodynamics. This is because reducing the dimensionality of any interacting physical system amplifies interaction effects that are beyond the reach of traditional hydrodynamic equations. In low-dimensional water, hydrogen bonds can become stable enough to arrange water molecules into an ordered state, causing water to behave not only like a liquid but also like a solid in certain respects. In this review, we explore the relationship between water's ordering and its ability to flow in low-dimensional channels, using viscosities of bulk water, vapor, and ice as benchmarks. We also provide a brief overview of the key theoretical approaches available for such analyses and discuss ionic transport, which is heavily influenced by the molecular structure of water.</description>

      <title>A reentrancy of motility-induced phase separation in overdamped active Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a system of Self-Propelled Particles (SPPs), the combination of self-propulsion and excluded volume effects can result in a phase separation called Motility-Induced Phase Separation (MIPS). Previous studies reported that MIPS is one of the phenomena so-called "reentrant phase separation" ,i.e., MIPS is suppressed when the P\'eclet number $Pe$ (dimensionless self-propelled speed) is sufficiently large. We used a fundamental model of SPPs, i.e., overdamped Active Brownian Partcles (ABPs), to investigate the mechanism of the reentrancy of MIPS. We expect that elucidating the conditions under which MIPS occur is important, since MIPS is a phenomenon that can occur in a wide range of SPPs systems, and the potential applications of MIPS can also be wide range. Detailed investigation of particle motion revealed that a entire particle cluster deforms due to multiple slip deformation (known as plastic deformation in materials science). As $Pe$ increases, the frequency of occurrence of slip-lines increases, and the particle motion becomes fluid-like. Therefore, the shape of the cluster becomes unstable and the number of particles in the cluster decreases. Let $\bf{f}_{LA}$ be the local spatial average of the self-propelled force generated by the particles. The observation of the inhomogeneity in the magnitude and direction of $\bf{f}_{LA}$ shows that $\bf{f}_{LA}$ is large on the cluster surface and generally orients toward the cluster inside. We determined that $\bf{f}_{LA}$ generates stress on the cluster, and it causes the multiple slip deformation.</description>

      <title>Prenematic Fluctuations in Nanoparticle-Hosted Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study combines broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) experiments with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the influence of nanoparticle (NP) inclusions on pretransitional phenomena in a liquid crystal (LC) host. We aimed to fill the existing gap between macroscopic observations and their microscopic origins. Our experimental results on SiO$_2$-doped 5CB composites demonstrate that while NP additions do not significantly change the isotropic-nematic transition temperature ($T_c$), the pretransitional effects exhibit universal behavior, confirmed by identical critical exponents across all samples. The observed systematic decrease in dielectric permittivity is explained by MD simulations, which reveal that nanoparticles act as "seeds" for topological defects, forcing the surrounding LC molecules into a "hedgehog" configuration. This static, defect-induced structure leads to a local antiparallel alignment and cancellation of molecular dipoles, providing a direct microscopic mechanism for the macroscopic dielectric response and successfully bridging the micro-macro scales.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature anomalies in 1D hard rods with soft attractive nearest-neighbor interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous experiments and numerical simulations have revealed that a limited number of two- and three-dimensional particle systems contract in volume upon heating isobarically. This anomalous phenomenon is known as negative thermal expansion (NTE). Recently, in a study by [I. Trav\v{e}nec and L. \v{S}amaj: J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. {\bf 58}, 195005 (2025)], exactly solvable one-dimensional fluids of hard rods with various types of soft purely repulsive nearest-neighbor interactions were examined at low temperatures. The presence of the NTE anomaly in such systems heavily depends on the shape of the core-softened potential and, in some cases, is associated with jumps in chain spacing of the equidistant ground state at certain pressures. This paper focuses on one-dimensional fluids of hard rods with soft nearest-neighbor interactions that contain a basin of attraction with just one minimum. The ground-state analysis reveals that, for certain potentials, increasing the pressure can lead to a discontinuous jump in the mean spacing between particles. The low-temperature analysis of the exact equation of state indicates that the NTE anomaly is present if the curvature of the interaction potential increases with the distance between particles or if the potential exhibits a singularity within the basin of attraction. Isotherms of the compressibility factor, which measures the deviation of the thermodynamic behavior of a real gas from that of an ideal gas, demonstrate typical plateau or double-plateau shapes in large intervals of particle density.</description>

      <title>Phototactic Decision-Making by Micro-Algae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how simple eukaryotic organisms make decisions in response to competing stimuli in the context of phototaxis by the unicellular alga $Chlamydomonas~reinhardtii$. While negatively phototactic cells swim directly away from a collimated light beam, when presented with two beams of adjustable intersection angle and intensities, we find that cells swim in a direction given by an intensity-weighted average of the two light propagation vectors. This geometrical law is a fixed point of an adaptive model of phototaxis and minimizes the average light intensity falling on the anterior pole of the cell. At large angular separations, subpopulations of cells swim away from one source or the other, or along the direction of the geometrical law, with some cells stochastically switching between the three directions. This behavior is shown to arise from a population-level distribution of photoreceptor locations that breaks front-back symmetry of photoreception.</description>

      <title>More sophisticated is not always better: comparison of similarity measures for unsupervised learning of pathways in biomolecular simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding process pathways in molecular simulations such as the unbinding paths of small molecule ligands from their binding sites at protein targets in a set of trajectories via unsupervised learning approaches requires the definition of a suitable similarity measure between trajectories. We here evaluate the performance of four such measures with varying degree of sophistication, i.e., Euclidean and Wasserstein distances, Procrustes analysis and dynamical time warping, when analyzing trajectory data from two different biased simulation driving protocols in the form of constant velocity constraint targeted MD and steered MD. In a streptavidin-biotin benchmark system with known ground truth clusters, Wasserstein distances yielded the best clustering performance, closely followed by Euclidean distances, both being the most computationally efficient similarity measures. In a more complex A2a receptor-inhibitor system, however, the simplest measure, i.e., Euclidean distances, was sufficient to reveal meaningful and interpretable clusters.</description>

      <title>Electrostatics overcome acoustic collapse to assemble, adapt, and activate levitated matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic levitation provides a unique method for manipulating small particles as it completely evades effects from gravity, container walls, or physical handling. These advantages make it a tantalizing platform for studying complex phenomena in many-particle systems, save for one severe limitation -- particles suspended by sound interact via acoustic scattering forces, which cause them to merge into a single dense object. To overcome this "acoustic collapse", we have developed a strategy that combines acoustic levitation with controlled electrostatic charging to assemble, adapt, and activate complex, many-particle systems. The key idea is to introduce electrostatic repulsion, which renders a so-called "mermaid" potential where interactions are attractive at short range and repulsive at long range. By controlling the balance between attraction/repulsion, we are able to levitate fully expanded structures where all particles are separated, fully collapsed structures where they are all in contact, and hybrid ones consisting of both expanded and collapsed components. We find that fully collapsed and expanded structures are inherently stable, whereas hybrid ones exhibit transient stability governed by acoustically unstable dimers. Furthermore, we show how electrostatics allow us to adapt between configurations on the fly, either by quasistatic discharge or discrete up/down charge steps. Finally, we demonstrate how large structures experience selective energy pumping from the acoustic field -- thrusting some particles into motion while others remain stationary -- leading to complex dynamics including coupled rotations and oscillations. Our approach provides an easy-to-implement and easy-to-understand solution to the pervasive problem of acoustic collapse, while simultaneously providing new insights into the assembly and activation of many-particle systems with complex interactions.</description>

      <title>Midveins regulate the shape formation of drying leaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dried leaves in nature often exhibit curled and crumpled morphologies, typically attributed to internal strain gradients that produce dome-like shapes. However, the origin of these strain gradients remains poorly understood. Although leaf veins--particularly the midvein--have been suggested to influence shape formation, their mechanical role has not been systematically investigated. Here, we demonstrate that mechanical constraints imposed by the midvein play a crucial role in generating the diverse morphologies that emerge during leaf drying. Combining numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, we show that a uniformly shrinking leaf lamina constrained by a non-shrinking midvein gives rise to two distinct types of configurations: curling-dominated and folding-dominated morphologies. In the curling-dominated regime, both S-curled and C-curled shapes emerge, with C-curled configurations more commonly observed due to their lower elastic energy. In contrast, the folding-dominated regime features folding accompanied by edge waviness. Theoretical modeling reveals a linear relationship between midvein curvature and mismatch strain, consistent with simulation results. Moreover, we find that the morphological outcome is governed by the ratio of bending stiffnesses between the lamina and the midvein. We construct a comprehensive phase diagram for the transitions between different configurations. These findings provide a mechanical framework for understanding shape formation in drying leaves, offering new insights into natural morphing processes and informing the design of bio-inspired morphable structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the tunneling mechanism of cavitation in liquid helium for 3He and 4He is considered on the basis of the Schr\"odinger-like equation. It is assumed that the pairwise interactions of helium atoms are determined by the Lennard-Jones potential. The kinetics of nucleation and the mechanism that limits the growth of cavitation bubbles in liquid helium are considered, taking into account their growth in a negative pressure field.</description>

      <title>Photoelastic Grain Solver v2.0: An updated tool for analysis of force measurements in granular materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoelastic force imaging is an experimental technique whereby a birefringent granular material is imaged with a polariscope to characterize the internal stress state of a granular material. Photoelasticimetry is the only proven experimental technique that allows researchers to measure the shear and normal forces at every particle contact in a granular packing. In 2017, Kollmer et al. [Rev. Sci. Instrum. 88, 051808 (2017)] developed an open-source software to perform this analysis. Here, we present the next substantial update to this software package. The new version improves resolution and efficiency and substantially changes the software architecture. The structural changes better facilitate add-ons, modules, and future improvements to the performance, accessibility, and versatility of the tool. Besides updates to the core software, we introduce new infrastructure to support the ongoing development of software, documentation, and training materials. The full development team, software, and supporting resources are available at https://github.com/photoelasticity .</description>

      <title>Dynamic Models for Two Nonreciprocally Coupled Fields: A Microscopic Derivation for Zero, One, and Two Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the dynamic models governing two nonreciprocally coupled fields for cases with zero, one, and two conservation laws. Starting from two microscopic nonreciprocally coupled Ising models, and using the mean-field approximation, we obtain closed-form evolution equations for the spatially resolved magnetization in each lattice. For single spin-flip dynamics, the macroscopic equations in the thermodynamic limit are closely related to the nonreciprocal Allen-Cahn equations, i.e. conservation laws are absent. Likewise, for spin-exchange dynamics within each lattice, the thermodynamic limit yields equations similar to the nonreciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model, i.e. with two conservation laws. In the case of spin-exchange dynamics within and between the two lattices, we obtain two nonreciprocally coupled equations that add up to one conservation law. For each of these cases, we systematically map out the linear instabilities that can arise. Our results provide a microscopic foundation for a broad class of nonreciprocal field theories, establishing a direct link between non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and macroscopic continuum descriptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bacterial suspensions and other active fluids are known to develop highly dynamical vortex states, denoted as active or mesoscale turbulence. We reveal the pronounced effect of non-Newtonian rheological conditions on these turbulent states, concentrating on shear thinning. A self-sustained heterogeneous state of coexisting turbulent and quiescent areas develops, which results in anomalous velocity statistics. The heterogeneous state emerges in a hysteretic transition when varying activity. We provide an extensive numerical analysis and observe features consistent with a directed percolation transition. Our results are important, for instance, when addressing active objects in biological media with complex rheological properties.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium friction and free energy estimates for kinetic coarse-graining -- Driven particles in responsive media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the molecular friction and energy landscapes under nonequilibrium conditions is key to coarse-graining the dynamics of selective solute transport through complex, fluctuating and responsive media, e.g., polymeric materials such as hydrogels, cellular membranes or ion channels. The analysis of equilibrium ensembles already allows such a coarse-graining for very mild nonequilibrium conditions. Yet in the presence of stronger external driving and/or inhomogeneous setups, the transport process is governed apart from a potential of mean force also by a nontrivial position- and velocity-dependent friction. It is therefore important to find suitable and efficient methods to estimate the mean force and the friction landscape, which then can be used in a low-dimensional, coarse-grained Langevin framework to predict the system's transport properties and timescales. In this work, we evaluate different coarse-graining approaches based on constant-velocity constraint simulations for generating such estimates using two model systems, which are a 1D responsive barrier as a minimalistic model and a single tracer driven through a 3D bead-spring polymer membrane as a more sophisticated problem. Finally, we demonstrate that the estimates from 3D constant-velocity simulations yield the correct velocity-dependent friction, which can be directly utilized for coarse-grained (1D) Langevin simulations with constant external driving forces.</description>
