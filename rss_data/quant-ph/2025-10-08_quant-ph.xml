      <title>Randomness from causally independent processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a pair of causally independent processes, modelled as the tensor product of two channels, acting on a possibly correlated input to produce random outputs X and Y. We show that, assuming the processes produce a sufficient amount of randomness, one can extract uniform randomness from X and Y. This generalizes prior results, which assumed that X and Y are (conditionally) independent. Note that in contrast to the independence of quantum states, the independence of channels can be enforced through spacelike separation. As a consequence, our results allow for the generation of randomness under more practical and physically justifiable assumptions than previously possible. We illustrate this with the example of device-independent randomness amplification, where we can remove the constraint that the adversary only has access to classical side information about the source.</description>

      <title>Self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with transversal Clifford gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bivariate bicycle codes are promising candidates for high-threshold, low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memories. Meanwhile, color codes are the most prominent self-dual CSS codes, supporting transversal Clifford gates that have been demonstrated experimentally. In this work, we combine these advantages and introduce a broad family of self-dual bivariate bicycle codes. These codes achieve higher encoding rates than surface and color codes while admitting transversal CNOT, Hadamard, and $S$ gates. In particular, we enumerate weight-8 self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with up to $n \leq 200$ physical qubits, realized on twisted tori that enhance code distance and improve stabilizer locality. Representative examples include codes with parameters $[[n,k,d]]$: $[[16,4,4]]$, $[[40,6,6]]$, $[[56,6,8]]$, $[[64,8,8]]$, $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[152,6,16]]$, and $[[160,8,16]]$.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant interfaces for modular quantum computing on diverse qubit platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular architectures offer a scalable path toward fault-tolerant quantum computing by interconnecting smaller quantum processing units (QPUs) provided that high-rate, fault-tolerant interfaces can be realized across modules. We present a comprehensive analysis and comparison of known and new methods for establishing such interfaces, including lattice surgery, transversal gates, and novel grow-and-distil protocols based on code growing and logical distillation. Using the surface code, we identify optimal interface strategies across a wide range of hardware parameters, such as gate fidelities, entangling rates, and memory resources, and estimate the requirements to achieve logical error rates of $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-12}$. Our results establish when the interface become a bottleneck in the computation and provide guidance for experimental implementations with superconducting, atomic, and solid-state hardware.</description>

      <title>Dynamical quantum codes and logic gates on a lattice with sparse connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce several dynamical schemes that take advantage of mid-circuit measurement and nearest-neighbor gates on a lattice with maximum vertex degree three to implement topological codes and perform logic gates between them. We first review examples of Floquet codes and their implementation with nearest-neighbor gates and ancillary qubits. Next, we describe implementations of these Floquet codes that make use of the ancillary qubits to reset all qubits every measurement cycle. We then show how switching the role of data and ancilla qubits allows a pair of Floquet codes to be implemented simultaneously. We describe how to perform a logical Clifford gate to entangle a pair of Floquet codes that are implemented in this way. Finally, we show how switching between the color code and a pair of Floquet codes, via a depth-two circuit followed by mid-circuit measurement, can be used to perform syndrome extraction for the color code.</description>

      <title>Peaked quantum advantage using error correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key issue of current quantum advantage experiments is that their verification requires a full classical simulation of the ideal computation. This limits the regime in which the experiments can be verified to precisely the regime in which they are also simulatable. An important outstanding question is therefore to find quantum advantage schemes that are also classically verifiable. We make progress on this question by designing a new quantum advantage proposal--Hidden Code Sampling--whose output distribution is conditionally peaked. These peaks enable verification in far less time than it takes for full simulation. At the same time, we show that exactly sampling from the output distribution is classically hard unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses, and we propose a plausible conjecture regarding average-case hardness. Our scheme is based on ideas from quantum error correction. The required quantum computations are closely related to quantum fault-tolerant circuits and can potentially be implemented transversally. Our proposal may thus give rise to a next generation of quantum advantage experiments en route to full quantum fault tolerance.</description>

      <title>Overshifted Parameter-Shift Rules: Optimizing Complex Quantum Systems with Few Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient-based optimization is a key ingredient of variational quantum algorithms, with applications ranging from quantum machine learning to quantum chemistry and simulation. The parameter-shift rule provides a hardware-friendly method for evaluating gradients of expectation values with respect to circuit parameters, but its applicability is limited to circuits whose gate generators have a particular spectral structure. In this work, we present a generalized framework that, with optimal minimum measurement overhead, extends parameter shift rules beyond this restrictive setting to encompass basically arbitrary gate generator, possibly made of complex multi-qubit interactions with unknown spectrum and, in some settings, even infinite dimensional systems such as those describing photonic devices or qubit-oscillator systems. Our generalization enables the use of more expressive quantum circuits in variational quantum optimization and enlarges its scope by harnessing all the available hardware degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to Arguments of Quantum Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a non-interactive zero-knowledge argument system for QMA with the following properties of interest.
  1. Transparent setup. Our protocol only requires a uniformly random string (URS) setup. The only prior (publicly-verifiable) NIZK for QMA (Bartusek and Malavolta, ITCS 2022) requires an entire obfuscated program as the common reference string.
  2. Extractability. Valid QMA witnesses can be extracted directly from our accepting proofs. That is, we obtain an argument of knowledge, which was previously only known in a secret parameters model (Coladangelo, Vidick, and Zhang, CRYPTO 2020).
  At the heart of our construction is a novel application of the coset state authentication scheme from (Bartusek, Brakerski, and Vaikuntanathan, STOC 2024) to the setting of QMA verification. Along the way, we establish new properties of the authentication scheme, and design a new type of ZX QMA verifier with ``strong completeness.'' The security of our construction rests on the heuristic use of a post-quantum indistinguishability obfuscator. However, rather than rely on the full-fledged classical oracle model (i.e. ideal obfuscation), we isolate a particular game-based property of the obfuscator that suffices for our proof, which we dub the evasive composability heuristic. Going a step further, we show how to replace the heuristic use of an obfuscator with the heuristic use of a hash function (plus sub-exponentially secure functional encryption). We accomplish this by establishing security of the ideal obfuscation scheme of Jain, Lin, Luo, and Wichs (CRYPTO 2023) in the quantum pseudorandom oracle model, which can be heuristically instantiated with a hash function. This result is of independent interest, and allows us to translate several quantum-cryptographic results that were only known in the classical oracle model to results in the quantum pseudorandom oracle model.</description>

      <title>Levitated optomechanics with cylindrically polarized vortex beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically levitated and cooled nanoparticles are a new quantum system whose application to the creation of non-classical states of motion and quantum limited sensing is fundamentally limited by recoil and bulk heating. We study the creation of stable 3D optical traps using optical cylindrically polarized vortex beams with radial and azimuthal polarization and show that a significant reduction in recoil heating by up to an order of magnitude can be achieved when compared with conventional single Gaussian beam tweezers. Additionally these beams allow trapping of larger particles outside the Rayleigh regime using both bright and dark tweezer trapping with reduced recoil heating. By changing the wavelength of the trapping laser, or the size of the particles, non-linear and repulsive potentials of interest for the creation of non-classical states of motion can also be created.</description>

      <title>Quantum Concept Music Score from Quantum Picturalism: Musical Incarnation of a Bell-Pair under Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the development of a new language and theory for quantum music, to which we refer as Quantum Concept Music (QCM). This new music formalism is based on Categorical Quantum Mechanics (CQM), and more specifically, its diagrammatic incarnation Quantum Picturalism (QPict), which is heavily based on ZX-calculus. In fact, it is naturally inherited from CQM/QPict. At its heart is the explicit notational representation of relations that exist within and between the key concepts of music composition, performance, and automation. QCM also enables one to directly translate quantum phenomena into music compositions in a both intuitively obvious, rigorous and mechanical manner.
  Following this pattern, we propose a score for musicians interacting like a Bell-pair under measurement, and outline examples of how it could be live performed. While most of the Western classical music notation has heavily relied on linear representation of music - which does not always adequately capture the nature of music - our approach is distinct by highlighting the fundamental relational dimension of music. In addition, this quantum-based technique not only influences the music at the profound level of composition, but also has a direct impact on a live performance, and also provides a new template for automating music, e.g.~in the context of AI-generation.
  All together, we initiate the creation of new music formalism that is powerful and efficient in capturing the interactive nature of music, both in terms of internal and external interactions, and goes beyond the boundaries of Western classical music notation, which allows to use it in many different genres and directions.</description>

      <title>On Limits on the Provable Consequences of Quantum Pseudorandomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are various notions of quantum pseudorandomness, such as pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs), pseudorandom state generators (PRSGs) and pseudorandom function-like state generators (PRSFGs). Unlike the different notions of classical pseudorandomness, which are known to be existentially equivalent to each other, the relation between quantum pseudorandomness has yet to be fully established.
  We present some evidence suggesting that some quantum pseudorandomness is unlikely to be constructed from the others, or at least is hard to construct unless some conjectures are false. This indicates that quantum pseudorandomness could behave quite differently from classical pseudorandomness. We study new oracle worlds where one quantum pseudorandomness exists but another pseudorandomness does not under some assumptions or constraints, and provide potential directions to achieve the full black-box separation. More precisely:
  - We give a unitary oracle relative to which PRFSGs exist but PRUs without using ancilla do not. This can be extended to the general PRUs if we can prove a structural property of the PRU algorithm.
  - Assuming an isoperimetric inequality-style conjecture, we show a unitary oracle world where log-length output PRFSGs exist but proving the existence of quantum-computable pseudorandom generators (QPRGs) with negligible correctness error is as hard as proving that ${\sf BQP}\neq {\sf QCMA}$. This result suggests that the inverse-polynomial error in the state of the art construction of QPRGs from log-length PRSGs is inherent.
  - Assuming the same conjecture, we prove that some natural way of constructing super-log-length output PRSGs from log-length output PRFSGs is impossible. This partly complements the known hardness of shrinking the PRSG output lengths. Along the way, we also discuss other potential approaches to extend the PRSG output lengths.</description>

      <title>Observation of Genuine Tripartite Non-Gaussian Entanglement from a Superconducting Three-Photon Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of entangled photons through Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a critical resource for many key experiments and technologies in the domain of quantum optics. Historically, SPDC was limited to the generation of photon pairs. However, the use of the strong nonlinearities in circuit quantum electrodynamics has recently enabled the observation of Three-Photon SPDC (3P-SPDC). Despite great interest in the entanglement structure of the resultant states, entanglement between photon triplets produced by a 3P-SPDC source has still has not been confirmed. Here, we report on the observation of genuine tripartite non-Gaussian entanglement in the steady-state output field of a 3P-SPDC source consisting of a superconducting parametric cavity coupled to a transmission line. We study this non-Gaussian tripartite entanglement using an entanglement witness built from three-mode correlation functions, and observe a maximum violation of the bound by 23 standard deviations of the statistical noise. Furthermore, we find strong agreement between the observed and the analytically predicted scaling of the entanglement witness. We then explore the impact of the temporal function used to define the photon mode on the observed value of the entanglement witness.</description>

      <title>Photoswitchable radicals as reporter spins for quantum sensing with spin defects in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid decay of target signal strength with distance from the sensor presents a key challenge in nanoscale magnetic sensing with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, limiting both sensitivity and spatial resolution. Here we introduce a strategy to overcome this limitation by using radical anions formed from rhodamine-derived dyes as reporter spins localized to the diamond surface. These radicals, generated through photoreduction, are optically identifiable and stable on timescales exceeding an hour. We experimentally demonstrate their coherent manipulation and detection using single, shallow NV centers for readout. We observe heterogeneity in the local magnetic environments of the photoactivated spins from site to site, likely due to variations in inter-radical couplings across our measurements. Looking forward, our approach enables correlative nanoscale magnetic and optical imaging, and opens new pathways toward single-molecule magnetic resonance studies.</description>

      <title>AC magnetometry in the strong drive regime with NV centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic response measurements in the presence of AC drive fields provide critical insight into the properties of magnetic and conductive materials, such as phase transitions in two-dimensional van der Waals magnets, the heating efficiency of magnetic nanoparticles in biological environments, and the integrity of metals in eddy current testing. Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a commonly-used platform for such studies, due to their high spatial resolution and sensitivity, but are typically limited to weak-drive conditions, i.e., AC drive fields well below the NV microwave (MW) pulse Rabi strength. Once the AC drive field grows comparable to or larger than the Rabi strength, the induced MW pulse detuning suppresses NV sensitivity to the out-of-phase magnetic response, which encodes dissipation and conductivity in materials of interest. Here, we introduce a phase modulation protocol that cancels MW pulse detuning to leading order, and extends NV AC magnetometry into the strong drive field regime. The protocol, termed SIPHT (Signal Isolation through PHase Tuning), is experimentally demonstrated using an NV ensemble. By directly comparing SIPHT to the conventional Hahn echo AC sensing protocol, we quantify the preservation of NV magnetometry contrast for an out-of-phase signal. We further showcase SIPHT by detecting eddy current-induced magnetic fields from Cu, Al, and Ti samples, with the measured response field phase delays reflecting their distinct conductivities. SIPHT extends NV AC magnetometry to regimes inaccessible to standard dynamical decoupling measurement protocols, unlocking novel utility, e.g., in the study of magnetic hyperthermia and nondestructive testing of conductors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Regression Theory and Efficient Computation of Response Functions for Non-Markovian Open Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear response functions are a cornerstone concept in physics as they enable efficient estimation of many dynamical properties. In addition to predicting dynamics of observables under perturbations without resimulating the system, these response functions lead to electric conductivity, magnetic susceptibility, dielectric constants, etc. Estimating two-time correlation functions is a key ingredient of measuring linear response functions. However, for open quantum systems, simulating the reduced density operator with a quantum master equation only yields \emph{one-point} observables and is insufficient for this task. In this paper, we develop a memoryless, system-only formulation of two-point correlations for open quantum systems that extends the standard quantum regression theorem (QRT) beyond the Markov limit. We further incorporate the spectral property of the bath and express the time propagators in the response function as the memoryless generators in Lindblad-type forms. The resulting expressions recast the total response function into evolutions generated by time-dependent Hamiltonian and Lindblad primitives together with the more challenging propagation of commutators and anti-commutators. In addition to the derivation of the new QRT, we present quantum algorithms for these primitives and obtain an estimator for two-time correlations whose cost scales poly-logarithmically in the system dimension and $1/\epsilon^{1.25}$ in the target accuracy $\epsilon$. The framework removes the separability (Born-Markov) assumption and offers a pathway to efficient computation of nonequilibrium properties from open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Cored product codes for quantum self-correction in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of self-correcting quantum memories in three dimensions is a long-standing open question at the interface between quantum computing and many-body physics. We take the perspective that large contributions to the entropy arising from fine-tuned spatial symmetries, including the assumption of an underlying regular lattice, are responsible for fundamental challenges to realizing self-correction. Accordingly, we introduce a class of disordered quantum codes, which we call "cored product codes". These codes are derived from classical factors via the hypergraph product but undergo a coring procedure which allows them to be embedded in a lower number of spatial dimensions while preserving code properties. As a specific example, we focus on a fractal code based on the aperiodic pinwheel tiling as the classical factor and perform finite temperature numerical simulations on the resulting three-dimensional quantum memory. We provide evidence that, below a critical temperature, the memory lifetime increases with system size for codes up to 60000 qubits.</description>

      <title>Efficient learning of bosonic Gaussian unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic Gaussian unitaries are fundamental building blocks of central continuous-variable quantum technologies such as quantum-optic interferometry and bosonic error-correction schemes. In this work, we present the first time-efficient algorithm for learning bosonic Gaussian unitaries with a rigorous analysis. Our algorithm produces an estimate of the unknown unitary that is accurate to small worst-case error, measured by the physically motivated energy-constrained diamond distance. Its runtime and query complexity scale polynomially with the number of modes, the inverse target accuracy, and natural energy parameters quantifying the allowed input energy and the unitary's output-energy growth.
  The protocol uses only experimentally friendly photonic resources: coherent and squeezed probes, passive linear optics, and heterodyne/homodyne detection. We then employ an efficient classical post-processing routine that leverages a symplectic regularization step to project matrix estimates onto the symplectic group. In the limit of unbounded input energy, our procedure attains arbitrarily high precision using only $2m+2$ queries, where $m$ is the number of modes. To our knowledge, this is the first provably efficient learning algorithm for a multiparameter family of continuous-variable unitaries.</description>

      <title>The code distance of Floquet codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For fault-tolerant quantum memory defined by periodic Pauli measurements, called Floquet codes, we prove that every correctable, undetectable spacetime error occurring during the steady stage is a product of (i) measurement operators inserted at the time of the measurement and (ii) pairs of identical Pauli operators sandwiching a measurement that commutes with the operator. We call such errors benign; they define a binary vector subspace of spacetime errors which properly generalize stabilizers of static Pauli stabilizer codes. Hence, the code distance of a Floquet code is the minimal weight of an undetectable spacetime Pauli error that is not benign. Our results apply more generally to families of dynamical codes for which every instantaneous stabilizer is inferred from measurements in a time interval of bounded length.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Insights into Measurement-Based Quantum Computation: Circle Graph States Are Not Universal Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) is a strong contender for realizing quantum computers. A critical question for MBQC is the identification of resource graph states that can enable universal quantum computation. Any such universal family must have unbounded entanglement width, which is known to be equivalent to the ability to produce any circle graph state from the states in the family using only local Clifford operations, local Pauli measurements, and classical communication. Yet, it was not previously known whether or not circle graph states themselves are a universal resource. We show that, in spite of their expressivity, circle graph states are not efficiently universal for MBQC (i.e., assuming $\mathsf{BQP} \neq \mathsf{BPP}$). We prove this by articulating a precise graph-theoretic correspondence between circle graph states and a certain subset of fermionic Gaussian states. This is accomplished by synthesizing a variety of techniques that allow us to handle both stabilizer states and fermionic Gaussian states at the same time. As such, we anticipate that our developments may have broader applications beyond the domain of MBQC as well.</description>

      <title>A general dark-state theory for arbitrary multilevel quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dark-state effect, caused by destructive quantum interference, is an important physical effect in atomic physics and quantum optics. It not only deepens the understanding of light-atom interactions, but also has wide application in quantum physics and quantum information. Therefore, how to efficiently and conveniently determine the number and form of the dark states in multilevel quantum systems with complex transitions is an important and interesting topic in this field. In this work, we present a general theory for determining the dark states in multilevel quantum systems with any coupling configuration using the arrowhead-matrix method. To confirm the dark states in a multilevel system, we first define the upper- and lower-state subspaces, and then diagonalize the Hamiltonians restricted within the two subspaces to obtain the dressed upper and lower states. By further expressing the transitions between the dressed upper and lower states, we can map the multilevel system to a bipartite-graph network, in which the nodes and links are acted by the dressed states and transitions, respectively. Based on the coupling configurations of the network, we can determine the lower dark states with respect to the upper-state subspace. As examples, we analyze the dark states in three-, four-, and five-level quantum systems, for all possible configurations through the classification of the numbers of upper and lower states. Further, we extend the framework to multilevel quantum systems and discuss the existence of dark states in some typical configurations. We also recover the results of the dark-state polaritons in driven three-level systems with the arrowhead-matrix method. Our theory paves the way for manipulating and utilizing the dark states of multilevel quantum systems in modern quantum science and technology.</description>

      <title>Quantum approximate optimization of bosonic finite-state systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exist numerous problems in nature inherently described by finite $D$-dimensional states. Formulating these problems for execution on qubit-based quantum hardware requires mapping the qudit Hilbert space to that of multiqubit which may be exponentially larger. To exclude the infeasible subspace, one common approach relies on penalizing the objective function. However, this strategy can be inefficient as the size of the illegitimate subspace grows. Here we propose to employ the Hamiltonian-based quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) through devising appropriate mixing Hamiltonians such that the infeasible configuration space is ruled out. We investigate this idea by employing binary, symmetric, and unary mapping techniques. It is shown that the standard mixing Hamiltonian (sum of the bit-flip operations) is the optimal option for symmetric mapping, where the controlled-NOT gate count is used as a measure of implementation cost. In contrast, the other two encoding schemes witness a $p$-fold increase in this figure for a $p$-layer QAOA. We apply this framework to quantum approximate thermalization and find the ground state of the repulsive Bose-Hubbard model in the strong and weak interaction regimes.</description>

      <title>A New Quantum Linear System Algorithm Beyond the Condition Number and Its Application to Solving Multivariate Polynomial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a matrix $A$ of dimension $M \times N$ and a vector $\vec{b}$, the quantum linear system (QLS) problem asks for the preparation of a quantum state $|\vec{y}\rangle$ proportional to the solution of $A\vec{y} = \vec{b}$. Existing QLS algorithms have runtimes that scale linearly with the condition number $\kappa(A)$, the sparsity of $A$, and logarithmically with inverse precision, but often overlook structural properties of $\vec{b}$, whose alignment with $A$'s eigenspaces can greatly affect performance.
  In this work, we present a new QLS algorithm that explicitly leverages the structure of the right-hand side vector $\vec{b}$. The runtime of our algorithm depends polynomially on the sparsity of the augmented matrix $H = [A, -\vec{b}]$, the inverse precision, the $\ell_2$ norm of the solution $\vec{y} = A^+ \vec{b}$, and a new instance-dependent parameter \[ ET= \sum_{i=1}^M p_i^2 \cdot d_i, \] where $\vec{p} = (AA^{\top})^+ \vec{b}$, and $d_i$ denotes the squared $\ell_2$ norm of the $i$-th row of $H$. We also introduce a structure-aware rescaling technique tailored to the solution $\vec{y} = A^+ \vec{b}$. Unlike left preconditioning methods, which transform the linear system to $DA\vec{y} = D\vec{b}$, our approach applies a right rescaling matrix, reformulating the linear system as $AD\vec{z} = \vec{b}$.
  As an application of our instance-aware QLS algorithm and new rescaling scheme, we develop a quantum algorithm for solving multivariate polynomial systems in regimes where prior QLS-based methods fail. This yields an end-to-end framework applicable to a broad class of problems. In particular, we apply it to the maximum independent set (MIS) problem, formulated as a special case of a polynomial system, and show through detailed analysis that, under certain conditions, our quantum algorithm for MIS runs in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kernel Anomaly Detection Using AR-Derived Features from Non-Contact Acoustic Monitoring for Smart Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of manufacturing toward smart factories has underscored major challenges in equipment maintenance, particularly the dependence on numerous contact sensors for anomaly detection, leading to increased sensor complexity and computational costs. This study explores the use of quantum kernels to enhance anomaly detection based on noncontact sensors. We hypothesize that the expressive power of quantum feature spaces can effectively discriminate among multiple anomaly types using fewer sensors. Experiments were conducted on two types of manufacturing equipment a conveyor and a chain belt machine where a single directional microphone was placed at varying distances (0 to 3 m) to capture audio data. The signals were processed using autoregressive (AR) modeling to extract coefficient based features, which were then mapped into quantum feature space via quantum kernels for one class SVM classification. The quantum kernel classifiers achieved consistently high accuracy and F1 scores (more than 0.92) across all distances, while classical counterparts exhibited significant degradation beyond 0 m. Visualization of the feature space revealed clear separability, with distinct quadrants corresponding to different anomaly types: conveyor anomalies were mainly distributed in the second quadrant, and chain belt anomalies clustered in the fourth. These results demonstrate that quantum kernel methods can achieve robust, multi class anomaly detection in noisy factory environments using minimal non contact sensors. This represents a significant advancement toward quantum enhanced smart factories with reduced sensing infrastructure and improved maintenance efficiency. This work has been accepted for presentation at IEEE QCE25 and will appear in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library.</description>

      <title>Quantum interference between autonomous dissimilar quantum light sources for hybrid quantum networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum systems play a crucial role in advancing scalable and versatile quantum networks as they combine the strengths of different quantum platforms. An important challenge for the development of hybrid quantum networks lies in interfacing heterogeneous quantum nodes and distributing entanglement among them. Single photons emitted from these dissimilar quantum nodes typically show distinct spectral and temporal properties. Therefore, they necessitate spectral filtering and temporal synchronization, which introduce significant photon losses and require additional resources. In this work, we successfully generate indistinguishable photons from two distinct quantum systems of a warm atomic ensemble and a solid-state quantum dot. Remarkably, quantum interference between dissimilar sources is achieved without additional spectral filtering and time synchronization, which enables autonomous quantum nodes for a hybrid quantum network. 133Cs atomic ensemble can efficiently generate heralded single photons at the wavelength of 917 nm of the 6P_(3/2)-6D_(5/2) transition, while the single photons emitted from an InAs/GaAs quantum dot can be tuned to match the 133Cs transition wavelength. Our dense warm atomic ensemble and cavity-coupled quantum dot can efficiently generate bright and resonant single photons at detection rates approaching MHz, respectively. More importantly, these single photons exhibit inherent spectral similarities not only in the wavelength but also in the spectral linewidth, achieving a high spectral overlap of 0.92. Such intrinsic compatibility between dissimilar quantum sources is essential to leverage the advantages of different quantum platforms, paving the way toward a large-scale and functional hybrid quantum network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the generic Bell inequalities suggested by Son, Lee, and Kim [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 060406 (2006)] to incorporate multiple observables for tripartite systems and introduce a geometric methodology for calculating classical upper bounds of the inequalities. Our method transforms the problem of finding the classical upper bounds into identifying constraints in linear congruence relations. Using this approach, we derive the upper bounds for scenarios with three and four observables per party. In order to demonstrate quantum violations, we employ Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger entangled states that can achieve values exceeding the classical upper bounds, with the violation becoming more pronounced as the number of observables increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics investigates how robust the second law of thermodynamics serves as the unique fundamental law in the small quantum world. To tackle this problem, the quantum coherence constitutes a major difficulty of investigations, which provides severe constraints hindering the recovery of a single thermodynamic potential. Here we solve this long-standing problem of quantum information theory by revealing that the state convertibility under thermal operations is fully characterized by the second law of thermodynamics. Specifically, we prove that whether a quantum state with quantum coherence is convertible to another by a thermal operation with a correlated catalyst is completely determined by the free energy ordering. Unlike previous attempts, our setting does not resort to any additional external coherent assist, providing a faithful operational characterization of thermodynamic state transformation.</description>

      <title>Low Overhead Universal Quantum Computation with Triorthogonal Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the use of triorthogonal codes for universal fault-tolerant quantum computation and propose two methods to circumvent the Eastin-Knill theorem, which prohibits any single quantum error-correcting code from supporting both universality and a transversal gate set. First, we simplify the implementation of the logical Hadamard gate for triorthogonal codes by exploiting the fact that they have transversal controlled-Z (CZ) gates, resulting in a circuit with reduced overhead. Then, we introduce procedure for generating a symmetric Calderbank-Shor-Steane code paired with a triorthogonal code, which allows CNOT and CZ gate transversality across the pair of codes. We also present a circuit for realizing a logical state teleportation protocol between the two codes, enabling all logical operations to be performed transversally. Finally, we demonstrate how these methods can be integrated into the Steane error correction framework without incurring additional resource cost.</description>

      <title>The PESCAD Method for Autonomous Systems: An Application to Photoionization at Near-optical Wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent publication, Dalen, and Selst{\o}, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 111}, 033116 (2025), it was demonstrated how converged photo electron spectra could be determined using a complex absorbing potential on a truncated numerical domain considerably smaller than the extension of the dynamical wave function. That approach required simulation until virtually all unbound parts of the wave function was absorbed, far beyond the duration of the interaction with the external field. In this work we formulate the method in a semi-analytical manner which allows us to extrapolate to infinite times after the interaction with the external field. In addition to obtaining photoelectron spectra for hydrogen differential in energy and ejection angle, we also demonstrate how -- and when -- the absorber may be seen as a detector, distorting the angular distributions when the detector is placed in the extreme vicinity of the atom.</description>

      <title>Implementation of multiparticle quantum speed limits on observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy-time uncertainty relation limits the maximum speed of quantum system evolution and is crucial for determining whether quantum tasks can be accelerated. However, multiparticle quantum speed limits have not been experimentally explored. In this work, we experimentally verify that both multiparticles and entanglement can accelerate the quantum speed on observables in two-particle systems based on ultrahigh precision control of quantum evolution time. Furthermore, we experimentally prove that the initial quantum state plays a critical role in the quantum speed limits of the entangled systems. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate that the upper bound and lower bound of the quantum speed are workable even in a nonunitary Markovian open system with two photons. The results obtained based on two-photon experiments have been shown to be generalizable to more particles. Our work facilitates the characterization of the dynamic transient properties of complex quantum systems and the control of the quantum speed of large-scale quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Post-Selection for General Quantum LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05795v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-selection strategies that discard low-confidence computational results can significantly improve the effective fidelity of quantum error correction at the cost of reduced acceptance rates, which can be particularly useful for offline resource state generation. Prior work has primarily relied on the "logical gap" metric with the minimum-weight perfect matching decoder, but this approach faces fundamental limitations including computational overhead that scales exponentially with the number of logical qubits and poor generalizability to arbitrary codes beyond surface codes. We develop post-selection strategies based on computationally efficient heuristic confidence metrics that leverage error cluster statistics (specifically, aggregated cluster sizes and log-likelihood ratios) from clustering-based decoders, which are applicable to arbitrary quantum low-density parity check (QLDPC) codes. We validate our method through extensive numerical simulations on surface codes, bivariate bicycle codes, and hypergraph product codes, demonstrating orders of magnitude reductions in logical error rates with moderate abort rates. For instance, applying our strategy to the $[[144, 12, 12]]$ bivariate bicycle code achieves approximately three orders of magnitude reduction in the logical error rate with an abort rate of only 1% (19%) at a physical error rate of 0.1% (0.3%). Additionally, we integrate our approach with the sliding-window framework for real-time decoding, featuring early mid-circuit abort decisions that eliminate unnecessary overheads. Notably, its performance matches or even surpasses the original strategy for global decoding, while exhibiting favorable scaling in the number of rounds. Our approach provides a practical foundation for efficient post-selection in fault-tolerant quantum computing with QLDPC codes.</description>

      <title>Optimal ancilla-free Clifford+T synthesis for general single-qubit unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose two Clifford+$T$ synthesis algorithms that are optimal with respect to $T$-count. The first algorithm, called deterministic synthesis, approximates any single-qubit unitary by a single-qubit Clifford+$T$ circuit with the minimum $T$-count. The second algorithm, called probabilistic synthesis, approximates any single-qubit unitary by a probabilistic mixture of single-qubit Clifford+$T$ circuits with the minimum $T$-count. For most of single-qubit unitaries, the runtimes of deterministic synthesis and probabilistic synthesis are $\varepsilon^{-1/2 - o(1)}$ and $\varepsilon^{-1/4 - o(1)}$, respectively, for an approximation error $\varepsilon$. Although this complexity is exponential in the input size, we demonstrate that our algorithms run in practical time at $\varepsilon \approx 10^{-15}$ and $\varepsilon \approx 10^{-22}$, respectively. Furthermore, we show that, for most single-qubit unitaries, the deterministic synthesis algorithm requires at most $3\log_2(1/\varepsilon) + o(\log_2(1/\varepsilon))$ $T$-gates, and the probabilistic synthesis algorithm requires at most $1.5\log_2(1/\varepsilon) + o(\log_2(1/\varepsilon))$ $T$-gates. Remarkably, complexity analyses in this work do not rely on any numerical or number-theoretic conjectures.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Sequential Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce hybrid sequential quantum computing (HSQC), a paradigm for combinatorial optimization that systematically integrates classical and quantum methods within a structured, stage-wise workflow. HSQC may involve an arbitrary sequence of classical and quantum processes, as long as the global result outperforms the standalone components. Our testbed begins with classical optimizers to explore the solution landscape, followed by quantum optimization to refine candidate solutions, and concludes with classical solvers to recover nearby or exact-optimal states. We demonstrate two instantiations: (i) a pipeline combining simulated annealing (SA), bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BF-DCQO), and memetic tabu search (MTS); and (ii) a variant combining SA, BF-DCQO, and a second round of SA. This workflow design is motivated by the complementary strengths of each component. Classical heuristics efficiently find low-energy configurations, but often get trapped in local minima. BF-DCQO exploits quantum resources to tunnel through these barriers and improve solution quality. Due to decoherence and approximations, BF-DCQO may not always yield optimal results. Thus, the best quantum-enhanced state is used to continue with a final classical refinement stage. Applied to challenging higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problems on a 156-qubit heavy-hexagonal superconducting quantum processor, we show that HSQC consistently recovers ground-state solutions in just a few seconds. Compared to standalone classical solvers, HSQC achieves a speedup of up to 700 times over SA and up to 9 times over MTS in estimated runtimes. These results demonstrate that HSQC provides a flexible and scalable framework capable of delivering up to two orders of magnitude improvement at runtime quantum-advantage level on advanced commercial quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Scheduling in Fiber and Spaceborne Quantum Repeater Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of scheduling in quantum networks amounts to choosing which entanglement swapping operations to perform to better serve user demand. The choice can be carried out following a variety of criteria (e.g. ensuring all users are served equally vs. prioritizing specific critical applications, adopting heuristic or optimization-based algorithms...), requiring a method to compare different solutions and choose the most appropriate. We present a framework to mathematically formulate the scheduling problem over quantum networks and benchmark general quantum scheduling policies over arbitrary lossy quantum networks. By leveraging the framework, we apply Lyapunov drift minimization to derive a novel class of quadratic optimization based scheduling policies, which we then analyze and compare with a Max Weight inspired linear class. We then give an overview of the pre-existing fiber quantum simulation tools and report on the development of numerous extensions to QuISP, an established quantum network simulator focused on scalability and accuracy in modeling the underlying classical network infrastructure. To integrate satellite links in the discussion, we derive an analytical model for the entanglement distribution rates for satellite-to-ground and ground-satellite-ground links and discuss different quantum memory allocation policies for the dual link case. Our findings show that classical communication latency is a major limiting factor for satellite communication, and the effects of physical upper bounds such as the speed of light must be taken into account when designing quantum links, limiting the attainable rates to tens of kHz. We conclude by summarizing our findings and highlighting the challenges that still need to be overcome in order to study the quantum scheduling problem over fiber and satellite quantum networks.

      <title>Entanglement dynamics and performance of two-qubit gates for superconducting qubits under non-Markovian effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within a numerically exact simulation technique, the dissipative dynamics of a two-qubit architecture is considered in which each qubit couples to its individual noise source (reservoir). The goal is to reveal the role of subtle qubit-reservoir correlations including non-Markovian processes as a prerequisite to guide further improvements of quantum computing devices. This paper addresses the following three topics. First, we examine the validity of the rotating wave approximation imposed previously on the qubit-reservoir coupling with respect to the disentanglement dynamics. Second, generation of the entanglement as well as destruction are analyzed by monitoring the reduced dynamics during and after application of a $\sqrt{\mbox{iSWAP}^\dagger}$ gate, also focusing on memory effects caused by reservoirs. Finally, the performance of a Hadamard + CNOT sequence is analyzed for different gate decomposition schemes. In all three cases, various types of noise sources and qubit parameters are considered.</description>

      <title>Learning stabilizer structure of quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the task of learning a structured stabilizer decomposition of an arbitrary $n$-qubit quantum state $|\psi\rangle$: for $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, output a state $|\phi\rangle$ with stabilizer-rank $\textsf{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$ such that $|\psi\rangle=|\phi\rangle+|\phi'\rangle$ where $|\phi'\rangle$ has stabilizer fidelity $&lt; \varepsilon$. We firstly show the existence of such decompositions using the recently established inverse theorem for the Gowers-$3$ norm of states [AD,STOC'25].
  To learn this structure, we initiate the task of self-correction of a state $|\psi\rangle$ with respect to a class of states $\textsf{C}$: given copies of $|\psi\rangle$ which has fidelity $\geq \tau$ with a state in $\textsf{C}$, output $|\phi\rangle \in \textsf{C}$ with fidelity $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle|^2 \geq \tau^C$ for a constant $C&gt;1$. Assuming the algorithmic polynomial Frieman-Rusza (APFR) conjecture (whose combinatorial version was recently resolved [GGMT,Annals of Math.'25], we give a polynomial-time algorithm for self-correction of stabilizer states. Given access to the state preparation unitary $U_\psi$ for $|\psi\rangle$ and its controlled version $cU_\psi$, we give a polynomial-time protocol that learns a structured decomposition of $|\psi\rangle$. Without assuming APFR, we give a quasipolynomial-time protocol for the same task.
  As our main application, we give learning algorithms for states $|\psi\rangle$ promised to have stabilizer extent $\xi$, given access to $U_\psi$ and $cU_\psi$. We give a protocol that outputs $|\phi\rangle$ which is constant-close to $|\psi\rangle$ in time $\textsf{poly}(n,\xi^{\log \xi})$, which can be improved to polynomial-time assuming APFR. This gives an unconditional learning algorithm for stabilizer-rank $k$ states in time $\textsf{poly}(n,k^{k^2})$. As far as we know, learning arbitrary states with even stabilizer-rank $k \geq 2$ was unknown.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum-classical analog simulation of two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard models with neutral atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally study the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model using a Rydberg-based quantum processing unit in the analog mode. Our approach avoids encoding directly the original fermions into qubits and instead relies on reformulating the original model onto a system of fermions coupled to spins and then decoupling them in a self-consistent manner. We then introduce the auxiliary spin solver: this hybrid quantum-classical algorithm handles a free-fermion problem, which can be solved efficiently with a few classical resources, and an interacting spin problem, which can be naturally encoded in the analog quantum computer. This algorithm can be used to study both the equilibrium Mott transition as well as non-equilibrium properties of the original Fermi-Hubbard model, highlighting the potential of quantum-classical hybrid approaches to study strongly correlated matter.</description>

      <title>Fast and Robust Non-Adiabatic Holonomic Gates for Qutrit Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by shortcuts to adiabaticity, we develop a framework that combines inverse engineering with time-dependent perturbation theory to implement non-adiabatic holonomic quantum computing (NHQC) in qutrit systems under realistic error sources. We derive analytical conditions that suppress second-order Rabi errors through tailored pulse parameters and eliminate detuning errors via a compensation pulse. Our analysis reveals the cancellation from the compensation pulse, which ensures robust gate operations. The proposed approach, broadly applicable to superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and atom-based platforms, provides a pathway to fast and error-resilient holonomic gates, potentially for scalable quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Policy Gradient for Adaptive Control of Cyber-Physical Systems: A Comparative Study of VQC vs. MLP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The comparative evaluation between classical and quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) paradigms was conducted to investigate their convergence behavior, robustness under observational noise, and computational efficiency in a benchmark control environment. The study employed a multilayer perceptron (MLP) agent as a classical baseline and a parameterized variational quantum circuit (VQC) as a quantum counterpart, both trained on the CartPole-v1 environment over 500 episodes. Empirical results demonstrated that the classical MLP achieved near-optimal policy convergence with a mean return of 498.7 +/- 3.2, maintaining stable equilibrium throughout training. In contrast, the VQC exhibited limited learning capability, with an average return of 14.6 +/- 4.8, primarily constrained by circuit depth and qubit connectivity. Noise robustness analysis further revealed that the MLP policy deteriorated gracefully under Gaussian perturbations, while the VQC displayed higher sensitivity at equivalent noise levels. Despite the lower asymptotic performance, the VQC exhibited significantly lower parameter count and marginally increased training time, highlighting its potential scalability for low-resource quantum processors. The results suggest that while classical neural policies remain dominant in current control benchmarks, quantum-enhanced architectures could offer promising efficiency advantages once hardware noise and expressivity limitations are mitigated.</description>

      <title>Angular--Momentum--Resolved Aharonov--Bohm Coupling Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Aharonov--Bohm (AB) effect is conventionally interpreted as a phase shift acquired by charged particles encircling a flux, with no fields acting locally along their paths. Here we show that a confined Dirac electron exhibits a distinct AB \emph{coupling energy} arising from a \emph{local current--potential interaction}, whose form depends on the chosen prescription. In the \emph{wave--particle} (WP) prescription the response is confined to the flux core: only the $l=0$ mode leaves a finite remnant as the core shrinks, while all higher modes vanish. In the \emph{wave--entity} (WE) prescription the $l=0$ result coincides with WP, but for $l\!\ge\!1$ the response becomes a quantized, $l$--linear energy shift. The AB effect thereby emerges as a quantized, mode--resolved energy law that establishes locality through standard field coupling and distinguishes between electron prescriptions.</description>

      <title>Fermionic versus Spin Baths in non-Interacting Transport Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how fermionic anticommutation shapes transport in a noninteracting resonant-level model where a single central site is coupled to an environment. To this end, we compare a fermionic reservoir with a bath of spin-half modes using exact diagonalization and a perturbative expansion of the master equation to identify the differences. Notably, we find different reduced dynamics for the spin and fermionic baths even though the particles remain noninteracting and both models enforce local Pauli blocking. These differences originate from higher-order terms in the system-bath coupling, where fermionic anticommutation introduces exchange signs in higher-order correlations. By contrast, all second-order contributions, set solely by two-point correlators, coincide. Deviations are largest for small to intermediate bath sizes, fading in the effectively Markovian regime where higher-order corrections are negligible. These results identify when spin baths can be a substitute for fermionic reservoirs and vice versa.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Managing city traffic is a complex NP-hard problem where traditional methods often fail to scale. We present a data-driven approach that reformulates traffic optimization as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization, capturing both congestion reduction and travel-time efficiency. The model integrates simulated realistic mobility data, multiple routing alternatives, and analytically derived penalty constraints. To address large networks, we apply Leiden clustering to preserve critical congestion patterns while reducing problem size. Benchmarking on up to 25,000 vehicles shows that hybrid quantum annealing achieves near-optimal solutions within 1% of the classical solver Gurobi while reducing congestion by up to 25%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a universal deep-learning method that reconstructs super-resolved images of quantum emitters from a single camera frame measurement. Trained on physics-based synthetic data spanning diverse point-spread functions, aberrations, and noise, the network generalizes across experimental conditions without system-specific retraining. We validate the approach on low- and high-density In(Ga)As quantum dots and strain-induced dots in 2D monolayer WSe$_2$, resolving overlapping emitters even under low signal-to-noise and inhomogeneous backgrounds. By eliminating calibration and iterative acquisitions, this single-shot strategy enables rapid, robust super-resolution for nanoscale characterization and quantum photonic device fabrication.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced decoherence-free zones for anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a stochastic framework for anyonic systems in which the exchange phase is promoted from a fixed parameter to a fluctuating quantity. Starting from the Stratonovich stochastic Liouville equation, we perform the Stratonovich--It\^o conversion to obtain a Lindblad master equation that ties the dissipator directly to the distorted anyon algebra. This construction produces a statistics--dependent dephasing channel, with rates determined by the eigenstructure of the real symmetric correlation matrix $D_{ab}$. The eigenvectors of $D$ select which collective exchange currents -- equivalently, which irreducible representations of the system -- are protected from stochastic dephasing, providing a natural mechanism for decoherence-free subspaces and noise-induced exceptional points. The key result of our analysis is the universality of the optimal statistical angle: in the minimal two-site model with balanced gain and loss, the protected mode always minimizes its dephasing at $\theta^\star = \pi/2$, independent of the specific form of $D$. This robustness highlights a simple design rule for optimizing coherence in noisy anyonic systems, with direct implications for ultracold atomic realizations and other emerging platforms for fractional statistics.</description>

Abstract: Chen, Liu, and Zhandry [CLZ22] introduced the problems $S|LWE\rangle$ and $C|LWE\rangle$ as quantum analogues of the Learning with Errors problem, designed to construct quantum algorithms for the Inhomogeneous Short Integer Solution ($ISIS$) problem. Several later works have used this framework for constructing new quantum algorithms in specific cases. However, the general relation between all these problems is still unknown. In this paper, we investigate the equivalence between $S|LWE\rangle$ and $ISIS$. We present the first fully generic reduction from $ISIS$ to $S|LWE\rangle$, valid even in the presence of errors in the underlying algorithms. We then explore the reverse direction, introducing an inhomogeneous variant of $C|LWE\rangle$, denoted $IC|LWE\rangle$, and show that $IC|LWE\rangle$ reduces to $S|LWE\rangle$. Finally, we prove that, under certain recoverability conditions, an algorithm for $ISIS$ can be transformed into one for $S|LWE\rangle$. We instantiate this reverse reduction by tweaking a known algorithm for $(I)SIS_\infty$ in order to construct quantum algorithm for $S|LWE\rangle$ when the alphabet size q is a small power of 2, recovering some results of Bai et al. [BJK+ 25]. Our results thus clarify the landscape of reductions between $S|LWE\rangle$ and $ISIS$, and we show both their strong connection as well as the remaining barriers for showing full equivalence.</description>

      <title>Quantum Strategies to Overcome Classical Multiplexing Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-term quantum networks face a bottleneck due to low quantum communication rates. This degrades performance both by lowering operating speeds and increasing qubit storage time in noisy memories, making some quantum internet applications infeasible. One way to circumvent this bottleneck is multiplexing: combining multiple signals into a single signal to improve the overall rate. Standard multiplexing techniques are classical in that they do not make use of coherence between quantum channels nor account for decoherence rates that vary during a protocol's execution. In this paper, we first derive semiclassical limits to multiplexing for many-qubit protocols, and then introduce new techniques: quantum multiplexing and multi-server multiplexing. These can enable beyond-classical multiplexing advantages. We illustrate these techniques through three example applications: 1) entanglement generation between two asymetric quantum network nodes (i.e., repeaters or quantum servers with inequal memories), 2) remote state preparation between many end user devices and a single quantum node, and 3) remote state preparation between one end user device and many internetworked quantum nodes. By utilizing many noisy internetworked quantum devices instead of fewer low-noise devices, our multiplexing strategies enable new paths towards achieving high-speed many-qubit quantum network applications.</description>

      <title>Self-concordant Schr\"odinger operators: spectral gaps and optimization without condition numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral gaps play a fundamental role in many areas of mathematics, computer science, and physics. In quantum mechanics, the spectral gap of Schr\"odinger operators has a long history of study due to its physical relevance, while in quantum computing spectral gaps are an important proxy for efficiency, such as in the quantum adiabatic algorithm. Motivated by convex optimization, we study Schr\"odinger operators associated with self-concordant barriers over convex domains and prove non-asymptotic lower bounds on the spectral gap for this class of operators. Significantly, we find that the spectral gap does not display any condition-number dependence when the usual Laplacian is replaced by the Laplace--Beltrami operator, which uses second-order information of the barrier and hence can take the curvature of the barrier into account. As an algorithmic application, we construct a novel quantum interior point method that applies to arbitrary self-concordant barriers and shows no condition-number dependence. To achieve this we combine techniques from semiclassical analysis, convex optimization, and quantum annealing.</description>

      <title>Non-iid hypothesis testing: from classical to quantum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study hypothesis testing (aka state certification) in the non-identically distributed setting. A recent work (Garg et al. 2023) considered the classical case, in which one is given (independent) samples from $T$ unknown probability distributions $p_1, \dots, p_T$ on $[d] = \{1, 2, \dots, d\}$, and one wishes to accept/reject the hypothesis that their average $p_{\mathrm{avg}}$ equals a known hypothesis distribution $q$. Garg et al. showed that if one has just $c = 2$ samples from each $p_i$, and provided $T \gg \frac{\sqrt{d}}{\epsilon^2} + \frac{1}{\epsilon^4}$, one can (whp) distinguish $p_{\mathrm{avg}} = q$ from $d_{\mathrm{TV}}(p_{\mathrm{avg}},q) &gt; \epsilon$. This nearly matches the optimal result for the classical iid setting (namely, $T \gg \frac{\sqrt{d}}{\epsilon^2}$). Besides optimally improving this result (and generalizing to tolerant testing with more stringent distance measures), we study the analogous problem of hypothesis testing for non-identical quantum states. Here we uncover an unexpected phenomenon: for any $d$-dimensional hypothesis state $\sigma$, and given just a single copy ($c = 1$) of each state $\rho_1, \dots, \rho_T$, one can distinguish $\rho_{\mathrm{avg}} = \sigma$ from $D_{\mathrm{tr}}(\rho_{\mathrm{avg}},\sigma) &gt; \epsilon$ provided $T \gg d/\epsilon^2$. (Again, we generalize to tolerant testing with more stringent distance measures.) This matches the optimal result for the iid case, which is surprising because doing this with $c = 1$ is provably impossible in the classical case. We also show that the analogous phenomenon happens for the non-iid extension of identity testing between unknown states. A technical tool we introduce may be of independent interest: an Efron-Stein inequality, and more generally an Efron-Stein decomposition, in the quantum setting.</description>

      <title>Batched high-rate logical operations for quantum LDPC codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-rate quantum LDPC (qLDPC) codes reduce memory overhead by densely packing many logical qubits into a single block of physical qubits. Here we extend this concept to high-rate computation by constructing \emph{batched} fault-tolerant operations that apply the same logical gate across many code blocks in parallel. By leveraging shared physical resources to execute many logical operations in parallel, these operations realize high rates in space-time and significantly reduce computational costs. For \emph{arbitrary} CSS qLDPC codes, we build batched gadgets with \emph{constant space-time overhead} (assuming fast classical computation) for (i) single-shot error correction, state preparation, and code surgeries (ii) code switching, and (iii) addressable Clifford gates. Using these batched gadgets we also construct parallel non-Clifford gates with low space-time cost. We outline principles for designing parallel quantum algorithms optimized for a batched architecture, and show in particular how lattice Hamiltonian dynamical simulations can be compiled efficiently. We also propose a near-term implementation using new self-dual Bivariate-Bicycle codes with high encoding rates ($\sim 1/10$), transversal Clifford gates, and global $T$ gates via parallel magic state cultivation, enabling Hamiltonian simulations with a lower space-time cost than analogous surface-code protocols and low-rate qLDPC protocols. These results open new paths toward scalable quantum computation via co-design of parallel quantum algorithms and high-rate fault-tolerant protocols.</description>

      <title>Quantumness and its hierarchies in PT-symmetric down-conversion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the hierarchy of quantum correlations in a quadratic bosonic parity-time-symmetric system (PTSS) featuring distinct dissipation and amplification channels. The hierarchy includes global nonclassicality, entanglement, asymmetric quantum steering, and Bell nonlocality. We elucidate the interplay between the system physical nonlinearity -- which serves as a source of quantumness -- and the specific dynamics of bosonic PTSSs, which are qualitatively influenced by their damping and amplification characteristics. Using a set of quantifiers -- including local and global nonclassicality depths, negativity, steering parameters, and the Bell parameter -- we demonstrate that the standard PTSS typically exhibits weaker quantumness than its counterparts affected solely by damping or solely by amplification. Both the maximum values attained by these quantifiers and the speed and duration of their generation are generally lower in the standard PTSS. A comparative analysis of three two-mode PTSSs -- standard, passive, and active -- with identical eigenvectors and real parts of eigenfrequencies, but differing in their damping and amplification strengths, reveals the crucial role of quantum fluctuations associated with gain and loss. Among them, the passive PTSS yields the most strongly nonclassical states. Nevertheless, under suitable conditions, the standard PTSS can also generate highly nonclassical states. The supremacy of the passive PTSS is further supported by its fundamental advantages in practical realizations.</description>

      <title>Anchor: Reducing Temporal and Spatial Output Performance Variability on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing, which has the power to accelerate many computing applications, is currently a technology under development. As a result, the existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers suffer from different hardware noise effects, which cause errors in the output of quantum programs. These errors cause a high degree of variability in the performance (i.e., output fidelity) of quantum programs, which varies from one computer to another and from one day to another. Consequently, users are unable to get consistent results even when running the same program multiple times. Current solutions, while focusing on reducing the errors faced by quantum programs, do not address the variability challenge. To address this challenge, we propose Anchor, a first-of-its-kind technique that leverages linear programming to reduce the performance variability by 73% on average over the state-of-the-art implementation focused on error reduction.</description>

      <title>Quantum $f$-divergences and Their Local Behaviour: An Analysis via Relative Expansion Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any reasonable measure of distinguishability of quantum states must satisfy a data processing inequality, that is, it must not increase under the action of a quantum channel. We can ask about the proportion of information lost or preserved and this leads us to study contraction and expansion coefficients respectively, which can be combined into a single \emph{relative expansion coefficient} for study. We focus on two prominent families: (i) standard quantum $f$ divergences and (ii) their local (second-order) behaviour, which induces a monotone Riemannian semi-norm (that is linked to the $\chi^2$ divergence). Building on prior work, we identify new families of $f$ for which the global ($f$ divergence) and local (Riemannian) relative expansion coefficients coincide for every pair of channels, and we clarify how exceptional such exact coincidences are. Beyond equality, we introduce an \emph{equivalence} framework that transfers qualitative properties such as strict positivity uniformly across different relative expansion coefficients.
  Leveraging the link between equality in the data processing inequality (DPI) and channel reversibility, we apply our framework of relative expansion coefficients to approximate recoverability of quantum information. Using our relative expansion results for primitive channels, we prove a reverse quantum Markov convergence theorem, converting positive expansion coefficients into quantitative lower bounds on the convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Optimised spectral purity of unfiltered photons via pump and nonlinearity shaping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic quantum technologies rely on the efficient generation and interference of indistinguishable photons. Exceptional achievements in this respect have been obtained by domain engineering of quasi-phase-matched parametric down-conversion sources, demonstrating high two-photon interference visibility using only moderate bandpass spectral filtering. Here, we optimised the spectral purity and indistinguishability of photons from telecom-wavelength sources by combining Gaussian quasi-phase-matching with Gaussian pump spectral shaping. Without spectral filtering, we used time-of-flight spectrometry to estimate an upper bound spectral purity of 99.9272(6)%, and achieved visibilities of up to 98.5(8)% in two-photon interference experiments with independent sources.</description>

      <title>Anonymous Quantum Tokens with Classical Verification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The no-cloning theorem can be used as a basis for quantum money constructions which guarantee unconditionally unforgeable currency. Existing schemes, however, either (i) require long-term quantum memory and quantum communication between the user and the bank in order to verify the validity of a bill or (ii) fail to protect user privacy due to the uniqueness of each bill issued by the bank, which can allow its usage to be tracked. We introduce a construction of single-use quantum money that gives users the ability to detect whether the issuing authority is tracking them, employing an auditing procedure for which we prove unconditional security. Bill validation is classical, and hence does not require long-term quantum memory or quantum communication, making the protocol relatively practical to deploy. We discuss potential applications beyond money, including anonymous one-time pads and voting.</description>

      <title>Intrinsically Quantum Effects of Axion Dark Matter are Undetectable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Is the usual treatment of axion dark matter as a classical field reliable? We show that the answer is subtle: the axion field could well be in a quantum state that has no complete classical description, but realistic detectors cannot tell the difference. To see this, we solve a fully quantum model of axion detection using quantum optics techniques. We show that intrinsically quantum effects are washed out by mode averaging or small amounts of noise, and significantly suppressed by the weakness of the axion coupling. Our work exemplifies that there should always be a classical analog for axion dark matter effects, extends to other wave (ultralight) dark-matter candidates, and gives a general method to compute the effects of exotic dark-matter states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of the intertube dipole-dipole interactions (DDI) in recent experiments with arrays of nearly integrable one-dimensional (1D) dipolar Bose gases of $^{162}$Dy atoms. An earlier theoretical modeling ignored those interactions, which we include here via a modification of the 1D confining potentials. We investigate the effects of the intertube DDI both during the state preparation and during the measurements of the rapidity distributions. We explore how the strength of the contact interactions and the magnetic field angles modify the intertube DDI corrections. We find that those corrections slightly change both the properties of the equilibrium state and the rapidity measurements. Remarkably, however, the changes nearly cancel each other, resulting in measured rapidity distributions that are very close to those predicted in the absence of the intertube DDI.</description>

      <title>Scalable accuracy gains from postselection in quantum error correcting codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoding stabilizer codes such as the surface and toric codes involves evaluating free-energy differences in a disordered statistical mechanics model, in which the randomness comes from the observed pattern of error syndromes. We study the statistical distribution of logical failure rates across observed syndromes in the toric code, and show that, within the coding phase, logical failures are predominantly caused by exponentially unlikely syndromes. Therefore, postselecting on not seeing these exponentially unlikely syndrome patterns offers a scalable accuracy gain. In general, the logical error rate can be suppressed from $p_f$ to $p_f^b$, where $b \geq 2$ in general; in the specific case of the toric code with perfect syndrome measurements, we find numerically that $b = 3.1(1)$. Our arguments apply to general topological stabilizer codes, and can be extended to more general settings as long as the decoding failure probability obeys a large deviation principle.</description>

      <title>Spin-spiral instability of the Nagaoka ferromagnet in the crossover between square and triangular lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the hard-core Fermi-Hubbard model in the crossover between square and triangular lattices near half-filling. As was recognized by Nagaoka in the 1960s, on the square lattice the presence of a single hole leads to ferromagnetic spin ordering. On the triangular lattice, geometric frustration instead leads to a spin-singlet ground state, which can be associated with a 120-degree spiral order. On lattices which interpolate between square and triangular, there is a phase transition at which the ferromagnetic order becomes unstable to a spin spiral. We model this instability, finding the exact critical point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce TeMFpy, a Python library for converting fermionic mean-field states to finite or infinite matrix product state (MPS) form. TeMFpy includes new, efficient, and easy-to-understand algorithms for both Slater determinants and Pfaffian states. Together with Gutzwiller projection, these also allow the user to build variational wave functions for various strongly correlated electron systems, such as quantum spin liquids.

      <title>Variational and field-theoretical approach to exciton-exciton interactions and biexcitons in semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons are the subject of intense research due to their potential for optoelectronic devices and applications, especially in the realm of two-dimensional materials. While the properties of free excitons in these systems are well understood, a general description of their interactions is complicated due to their composite nature, which leads to exchange between the identical fermions of different excitons. In this work we employ a variational approach to study interactions between Wannier excitons and obtain an effective interaction potential between two ground-state excitons in a system of spin-degenerate electrons and holes. This potential is in general nonlocal and depends on the coupled spins of the particles. When particularized to hydrogen-like excitons with a heavy hole, it becomes local and exactly reproduces the Heitler-London result for two interacting hydrogen atoms. Thus, our result can be interpreted as a generalization of the Heitler-London potential to arbitrary masses. Including corrections due to excited states results in a van der Waals potential at large distances, which is expected due to the induced dipole-dipole nature of the interactions. Additionally, we use a path-integral formalism to develop a many-body theory for a gas of excitons, resulting in an excitonic action that formally includes many-body interactions between excitons. While in the field representing the excitons is exactly bosonic, we clarify how the internal exchange processes arise in the field-theoretical treatment, and show that the diagrams corresponding to the interactions between excitons align with our variational calculation when evaluated on shell. Our methods and results lay the groundwork for a generalized theory of exciton-exciton interactions and their application to the study of biexciton spectra and correlated excitonic matter.</description>

      <title>Exact Quench Dynamics from Thermal Pure Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact solution for a quantum quench in an integrable system that reveals a new, coherent pathway to thermalization. In chaotic systems, thermalization is understood via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which implies that a quench from a thermal pure quantum (TPQ) state should exhibit trivial dynamics. In contrast, integrable systems are expected to retain memory of their initial conditions in a non-thermal generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). We show that a quench from a TPQ state in the integrable spin-1/2 XX chain defies both expectations. The system thermalizes to a canonical Gibbs ensemble, yet the entanglement dynamics are highly non-trivial, exhibiting a "double plateau" structure. We solve this process exactly using techniques in two-dimensional (2D) conformal field theories (CFT), an exact numerical method based on the matrix Riccati equation, and an asymptotically exact quasiparticle picture. We prove that the non-trivial dynamics are the macroscopic signature of the coherent dephasing of the initial state's anomalous pairing correlations.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic growth of aluminum: structural morphology, optical properties, superconductivity and microwave dielectric loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the molecular beam epitaxy synthesis of superconducting aluminum thin films grown on c-plane sapphire substrates at cryogenic temperatures of 6 K and compare their behavior with films synthesized at room temperature. We demonstrate that cryogenic growth increases structural disorder, producing crystalline grains that modify the optical, electrical, and superconducting properties of aluminum. We observe that cryogenic deposition changes the color of aluminum from fully reflective to yellow and correlate the pseudo-dielectric function and reflectance with structural changes in the film. We find that smaller grain sizes enhance the superconductivity of aluminum, increasing its critical temperature and critical field. We then estimate the superconducting gap and coherence length of Cooper pairs in aluminum in the presence of disorder. Finally, we fabricate superconducting microwave resonators on these films and find that, independently of the growth temperature, the system is dominated by two-level system loss with similar quality factors in the high and low power regimes. We further measure a higher kinetic inductance in the cryogenically grown films.</description>

      <title>Full counting statistics of electron-photon hybrid systems: Joint statistics and fluctuation symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron-photon hybrid systems serve as ideal light-matter interfaces with broad applications in quantum technologies. These systems are typically operated dynamically under nonequilibrium conditions, giving rise to coupled electronic and photonic currents. Understanding the joint fluctuation behavior of these currents is essential for assessing the performance of light-matter interfaces that rely on electron-photon correlations. Here, we investigate the full counting statistics of coupled electronic and photonic currents in an experimentally feasible hybrid system composed of a double quantum dot coupled to an optical cavity. We employ the framework of quantum Lindblad master equation which is augmented with both electronic and photonic counting fields to derive their joint cumulant generating function--a treatment that differs significantly from existing studies, which typically focus on either electron or photon statistics separately. We reveal that the ratio between photonic and electronic currents, as well as their variances, can deviate from an expected quadratic scaling law in the large electron-photon coupling regime. Furthermore, we demonstrate that conventional modelings of photonic dissipation channels in quantum master equations must be modified to ensure that the joint cumulant generating function satisfies the fluctuation symmetry enforced by the fluctuation theorem. Our results advance the understanding of joint fluctuation behaviors in electron-photon hybrid systems and may inform the design of efficient quantum light-matter interfaces.</description>

      <title>A fluorescence microscopy platform for time-resolved studies of spin-correlated radical pairs in biological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The importance of spin-correlated radical pairs in biology is increasingly recognized, with roles in biological effects of weak magnetic fields and emerging quantum spin-based biomedical applications. Fluorescence microscopy offers sufficient sensitivity to study magnetic field effects on radical pair reactions in living cells, but conventional techniques cannot directly resolve their dynamics because most biologically relevant radical pairs are non-emissive. To overcome this challenge, we introduce two novel microscopy techniques: single color pump-probe (PP) and pump-field-probe (PFP) fluorescence. Here, we describe their working principles, provide their mathematical formulation, and validate both techniques through theoretical analysis and experiments on well-established flavin-based magnetic field sensitive reactions. These approaches offer a sensitive and broadly applicable platform for quantifying and visualizing the quantum spin dynamics of radical pair chemical reactions in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Valley-dependent topological interface states in biased armchair nanoribbons in gapless graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an electrical bias-controlled, topological kind discontinuity in valley polarization, in a two-segment armchair nanoribbon of gapless graphene, where the discontinuity is created at the interface by applying opposite in-plane, transverse electrical biases to the two segments. In particular, using an efficient tight-binding theoretical formulation, we explicitly obtain energy eigenvalues and probability distributions of discontinuity-induced, interface-confined electron eigenstates, in a reference configuration. Moreover, implications of the confinement for electron transport are explored. A configurational variation is introduced to transform the eigenstates into transport-active, quasi-localized ones. Such states are shown to result in Fano "anti-resonances" in transmission spectra. The resilience of the quasi-localized states and their associated Fano fingerprints is also illustrated with respect to configurational fluctuations, demonstrating their potential detectability in realistic devices and suggesting transport spectroscopy as a practical probe of valley-dependent topological interface physics in graphene nanoribbons.</description>

      <title>All-optical bubble trap for ultracold atoms in microgravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an all-optical method to produce shell-shaped traps for ultracold atoms in microgravity. Our scheme exploits optical double dressing of the ground state to create a short range strongly repulsive central potential barrier. Combined with a long range attractive central potential, this barrier forms the shell trap. We demonstrate that a pure spherical bubble, reaching the quasi 2D regime for standard atom numbers, could be formed from two crossed beams with a parabolic profile. An analytical study shows that the relevant characteristics of the trap depend on the ratio of the ground and excited state polarisabilities and the lifetime of the excited state. As a benchmark, we provide quantitative analysis of a realistic configuration for rubidium ensembles, leading to a 250 Hz transverse confinement for a 35 $\mu$m radius bubble and a trap residual scattering rate of less than 10 s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>First experimental measurements of biophotons from Astrocytes and Glioblastoma cell cultures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biophotons are non-thermal and non-bioluminescent ultraweak photon emissions, first hypothesised by Gurwitsch in 1924 as a regulatory mechanism in cell division, and then experimentally observed in living organisms. Today, two main hypotheses explain their origin: stochastic decay of excited molecules and coherent electromagnetic fields produced in biochemical processes. Recent interest focuses on the role of biophotons in cellular communication and disease monitoring. This study presents the first campaign of biophoton emission measurements from cultured astrocytes and glioblastoma cells, conducted at Fondazione Pisana per la Scienza (FPS) using two ultra-sensitive setups developed by the collaboration at the National Laboratories of Frascati (LNF-INFN) and at the University of Rome II - Tor Vergata. The statistical analyses of the data collected revealed a clear separation between cellular signals and dark noise, confirming the high sensitivity of the apparatuses. The Diffusion Entropy Analysis (DEA) was applied to the data to uncover dynamic patterns, revealing anomalous diffusion and long-range memory effects potentially related to intercellular signalling and cellular communication. These findings support the hypothesis that biophoton emissions encode rich information beyond intensity, reflecting metabolic and pathological states. The differences that emerged from the application of Diffusion Entropy Analysis to the biophotonic signals of Astrocytes and Glioblastoma are highlighted and discussed in the paper. This work lays the foundation for future studies on neuronal cultures and proposes biophoton dynamics as a promising tool for non-invasive diagnostics and cellular communication research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model the Hayden--Preskill (HP) information recovery protocol in 2d CFTs via local joining quenches. Euclidean path integrals with slits prepare the HP subsystems: the message $M$, its reference $N$, the Page-time black hole $B$, the early radiation $E$, and the late radiation $R$; the remaining black hole after emitting $R$ is denoted as $B'$. The single-slit geometry provides an analytically tractable toy model, while the bounded-slit geometry more closely captures the HP setup. In the free Dirac fermion 2d CFT, the mutual information $I(N\!:\!B')$ shows quasi-particle dynamics with partial or full revivals, whereas that in holographic 2d CFTs, which are expected to be maximally chaotic, exhibit sharp transitions: in the bounded-slit case, when the size of the late radiation becomes comparable to that of the reference $N$, $I(N\!:\!B')$ does vanish at late time, otherwise it remains finite. This contrast between free CFTs and holographic CFTs gives a clear characterization of the HP recovery threshold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis(ETH) is a standard tool to understand the thermalization properties of an isolated quantum system. Its generalization to higher order correlations of matrix elements of local operators, dubbed the full ETH, predicts the decomposition of higher-order correlation function into thermal free cumulants. In this work, we numerically test these predictions of full ETH using exact diagonalization of two spin models: the Ising and the XXZ Heisenberg models. The differences from the behavior of full ETH prediction in chaotic systems are highlighted and contrasted along the way. We also show that although in these integrable spin models the dynamics of the four-time correlators, specifically the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), is encoded in the fourth order free cumulant, it exhibits late-time dynamics that is different from nonintegrable systems.</description>

      <title>Identifying chiral topological order in microscopic spin models by modular commutator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chiral central charge $c_-$ is a key topological invariant of the edge characterizing the bulk two-dimensional chiral topological order, but its direct evaluation in microscopic spin models has long been a challenge, especially for non-abelian topological order. Building on the recently developed modular commutator formalism, we numerically obtain $c_-$ directly from single ground-state wave functions of two-dimensional interacting spin models that have chiral topological order. This provides a geometry-independent and bulk diagnostic of chirality. We study two nonintegrable systems -- the Zeeman-Kitaev honeycomb model and the kagome antiferromagnet -- both subjected to scalar spin chirality perturbations. We find that the modular commutator yields results consistent with the expected topological quantum field theories. We also compute the topological entanglement entropy which provides an independent diagnostic of the topological orders. Our work establishes modular commutators as a powerful numerical probe of chiral topological order in strongly correlated quantum magnets.</description>

Abstract: Fraunhofer diffraction plays a vital role in experimental physics not only because it accurately describes the behaviour of light in the usual propagation limit, but also because it links the diffracted light with the scattering object through one of the most important mathematical transformations in physics: the Fourier transform. Acting as a probe in material characterisation as well as used as a tool for particle trapping or sensing, the pattern of interference maxima resulting from the Fraunhofer diffraction through periodic scattering is an ubiquitous routine. In this paper we analyse the Fraunhofer diffraction resulting from the much less studied aperiodic scatter of the light. We provide general conditions for the experimental observation of the peaks of interference maxima featured into patterns that display periodic structures on a number of distance scales. Our theoretical analysis is supported by thorough experimental demonstrations.</description>

      <title>An integrated photonic millimeter-wave receiver with sub-ambient noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decades of progress in radiofrequency (RF) transistors and receiver frontends have profoundly impacted wireless communications, remote sensing, navigation, and instrumentation. Growing demands for data throughput in 6G networks, timing precision in positioning systems, and resolution in atmospheric sensing and automotive radar have pushed receiver frontends into the millimeter-wave (mmW) and sub-mmW/THz regimes. At these frequencies, however, the noise performance of field-effect transistors (FETs) degrades rapidly due to parasitic effects, limited carrier mobility, hot electrons, and shot noise. Parametric transducers that couple electromagnetic signals to optical fields offer quantum-limited sensitivity at room temperature. Electro-optic materials enable receivers that convert RF signals into optical phase shifts. While early demonstrations used resonant devices and recent efforts have focused on cryogenic microwave-to-optical quantum transduction, room-temperature electro-optic receivers have yet to achieve noise figures comparable to their electronic counterparts. Here we demonstrate a room-temperature integrated cavity electro-optic mmW receiver on a lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) photonic integrated circuit with 2.5% on-chip photon-number transduction efficiency, achieving 250 K noise temperature at 59.33 GHz--matching state-of-the-art LNAs. We report the first direct resolution of thermal noise in cavity electro-optic transduction, showing the system is fundamentally limited by thermal photon occupation (~100) in the mmW cavity. Our work establishes integrated photonics as a path to surpass electronic LNAs while offering exceptional resilience to strong electromagnetic inputs and immunity to EMI, establishing cavity electro-optics as a low-noise, chip-scale, EMI-resilient receiver frontend for mmW applications and scalable analog processing in the optical domain.</description>

      <title>Genuine monogamy relations in no-signaling theories - a geometric approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:1812.01494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum correlations are subject to certain distribution rules represented by so-called monogamy relations. Derivation of monogamy relations for multipartite systems is a non-trivial problem, as the multipartite correlations reveal their behaviors in a way different from bipartite systems. We here show that simple geometric properties of probabilistic spaces, in conjunction with no-signaling principle, lead to genuine monogamy relations for a large class of Bell type inequalities for many qubits. The term of 'genuine' implies that only one out of $N$ Bell inequalities exhibits a quantum violation. We also generalize our method to qudits. Using the similar geometric approach with a quasi-distance employed, we derive Svetlichny-Zohren-Gill type Bell inequalities for $d$-dimensional tripartite systems, and show their monogamous nature.</description>

      <title>Parametric multi-element coupling architecture for coherent and dissipative control of superconducting qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As systems for quantum computing keep growing in size and number of qubits, challenges in scaling the control capabilities are becoming increasingly relevant. Efficient schemes to simultaneously mediate coherent interactions between multiple quantum systems and to reduce decoherence errors can minimize the control overhead in next-generation quantum processors. Here, we present a superconducting qubit architecture based on tunable parametric interactions to perform two-qubit gates, reset, leakage recovery and to read out the qubits. In this architecture, parametrically driven multi-element couplers selectively couple qubits to resonators and neighbouring qubits, according to the frequency of the drive. We consider a system with two qubits and one readout resonator interacting via a single coupling circuit and experimentally demonstrate a controlled-Z gate with a fidelity of $98.30\pm 0.23 \%$, a reset operation that unconditionally prepares the qubit ground state with a fidelity of $99.80\pm 0.02 \%$ and a leakage recovery operation with a $98.5\pm 0.3 \%$ success probability. Furthermore, we implement a parametric readout with a single-shot assignment fidelity of $88.0\pm 0.4 \%$. These operations are all realized using a single tunable coupler, demonstrating the experimental feasibility of the proposed architecture and its potential for reducing the system complexity in scalable quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Quantum memory at nonzero temperature in a thermodynamically trivial system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Passive error correction protects logical information forever in the thermodynamic limit by updating the system based only on local information and few-body interactions. A paradigmatic example is the classical two-dimensional Ising model: a Metropolis-style Gibbs sampler retains the sign of the initial magnetization (a logical bit) for thermodynamically long times in the low-temperature phase. Known models of passive quantum error correction similarly exhibit thermodynamic phase transitions to a low-temperature phase wherein logical qubits are protected by thermally stable topological order. Here, in contrast, we show that certain families of constant-rate classical and quantum low-density parity check codes have no thermodynamic phase transitions at nonzero temperature, but nonetheless exhibit ergodicity-breaking dynamical transitions: below a critical nonzero temperature, the mixing time of local Gibbs sampling diverges in the thermodynamic limit. Slow Gibbs sampling of such codes enables fault-tolerant passive quantum error correction using finite-depth circuits. This strategy is well suited to measurement-free quantum error correction and may present a desirable experimental alternative to conventional quantum error correction based on syndrome measurements and active feedback.</description>

      <title>Navigating the phase diagram of quantum many-body systems in phase space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the unique capabilities of the Wigner function, particularly in its positive and negative parts, for exploring the phase diagram of the spin$-(\frac{1}{2\!}-\!\frac{1}{2})$ and spin$-(\frac{1}{2}\!-\!1)$ Ising-Heisenberg chains. We highlight the advantages and limitations of the phase space approach in comparison with the entanglement concurrence in detecting phase boundaries. We establish that the equal angle slice approximation in the phase space is an effective method for capturing the essential features of the phase diagram, but falls short in accurately assessing the negativity of the Wigner function for the homogeneous spin$-(\frac{1}{2}\!-\!\frac{1}{2})$ Ising-Heisenberg chain. In contrast, we find for the inhomogeneous spin$-(\frac{1}{2}\!-\!1)$ chain that an integral over the entire phase space is necessary to accurately capture the phase diagram of the system. This distinction underscores the sensitivity of phase space methods to the homogeneity of the quantum system under consideration.</description>

      <title>Purification and correction of quantum channels by commutation-derived quantum filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reducing errors is essential for reliable quantum computation. Quantum error mitigation (QEM) and quantum error correction (QEC) are two leading approaches for this task, each with challenges: QEM suffers from high sampling costs and cannot recover states, while QEC incurs large qubit and gate overheads. We combine ideas from both and introduce an information-theoretic device called a quantum filter that can purify or correct quantum channels. We present an explicit construction capable of correcting arbitrary noise in an n-qubit Clifford circuit using 2n ancillary qubits through a commutation-derived error-detection circuit. This scheme can also partially purify noise in non-Clifford gates such as T and CCZ. Unlike QEC, it achieves deterministic error reduction without encoding the input state. Under the assumption of clean ancillas, it overcomes the exponential sampling overhead in QEM using a single query to the channel. We also propose an ancilla-efficient Pauli filter that removes nearly all low-weight erroneous Pauli components in noisy Clifford circuits using only two ancillas. For local depolarizing noise, it achieves a quadratic reduction in average infidelity. Beyond existing QEM methods, our approach enables systematic error correction as the infidelity can be exponentially reduced with each added ancilla. Through numerical simulations under ancilla noise, we identify regimes where quantum filters outperform other techniques, demonstrating their effectiveness as a scalable error-reduction tool for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Invested and Potential Magic Resources in Measurement-Based Quantum Computation</title>

Abstract: Magic states and magic gates are crucial for achieving universal quantum computation, but important questions about how magic resources should be implemented to attain maximal quantum advantage have remained unexplored, especially in the context of measurement-based quantum computation (MQC). This work bridges the gap between MQC and the resource theory of magic by introducing the key concepts of "invested" and "potential" magic resources. The former quantifies the magic cost associated with MQC, serving as both a resource witness and a feasible upper bound for the practical realization, and is gate-order independent; The latter represents the maximal achievable magic resource in a given graph structure defining MQC. We utilize both concepts to analyze the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) and provide a fresh perspective on the universality of MQC, highlighting the crucial role of non-Pauli measurements in injecting magic. In particular, we theoretically prove that high-dimensional graphs can generate an exponential advantage of MQC compared to classical computing. We demonstrate experimentally our theoretical findings in a high-fidelity four-photon setup, surpassing conventional magic state injection (MSI) methods in both qubit efficiency and resource utilization. Our findings pave the way for future research exploring magic resource optimization and novel distillation schemes within the MQC framework, advancing fault-tolerant universal quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics predicts that massive particles exhibit wave-like behavior. Matterwave interferometry has been able to validate such predictions through ground-breaking experiments involving microscopic systems like atoms and molecules. The wavefunction of such systems coherently extends over a distance much larger than their size, an achievement that is incredibly challenging for massive and more complex objects. Yet, reaching similar level of coherent diffusion will enable tests of fundamental physics at the genuinely macroscopic scale, as well as the development of quantum sensing apparata of great sensitivity. We report on experimentally achieving an unprecedented degree of position diffusion in a massive levitated optomechanical system through frequency modulation of the trapping potential. By starting with a pre-cooled state of motion and employing a train of sudden pulses yet of mild modulation depth, we surpass previously attained values of position diffusion in this class of systems to reach diffusion lengths that exceed the physical dimensions of the trapped nanoparticle.</description>

Abstract: We investigate multi-mode GKP (Gottesman--Kitaev--Preskill) quantum error-correcting codes from a geometric perspective. First, we construct their moduli space as a quotient of groups and exhibit it as a fiber bundle over the moduli space of symplectically integral lattices. We then establish the Gottesman--Zhang conjecture for logical GKP Clifford operations, showing that all such gates arise from parallel transport with respect to a flat connection on this space. Specifically, non-trivial Clifford operations correspond to topologically non-contractible paths on the space of GKP codes, while logical identity operations correspond to contractible paths.</description>

      <title>Dissipative ground state preparation in ab initio electronic structure theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dissipative engineering is a powerful tool for quantum state preparation, and has drawn significant attention in quantum algorithms and quantum many-body physics in recent years. In this work, we introduce a novel approach using the Lindblad dynamics to efficiently prepare the ground state for general ab initio electronic structure problems on quantum computers, without variational parameters. These problems often involve Hamiltonians that lack geometric locality or sparsity structures, which we address by proposing two generic types of jump operators for the Lindblad dynamics. Type-I jump operators break the particle number symmetry and should be simulated in the Fock space. Type-II jump operators preserves the particle number symmetry and can be simulated more efficiently in the full configuration interaction space. For both types of jump operators, we prove that in a simplified Hartree-Fock framework, the spectral gap of our Lindbladian is lower bounded by a universal constant. For physical observables such as energy and reduced density matrices, the convergence rate of our Lindblad dynamics with Type-I jump operators remains universal, while the convergence rate with Type-II jump operators only depends on coarse grained information such as the number of orbitals and the number of electrons. To validate our approach, we employ a Monte Carlo trajectory-based algorithm for simulating the Lindblad dynamics for full ab initio Hamiltonians, demonstrating its effectiveness on molecular systems amenable to exact wavefunction treatment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous-variable cat codes are encodings into a single photonic or phononic mode that offer a promising avenue for hardware-efficient fault-tolerant quantum computation. Protecting information in a cat code requires measuring the mode's occupation number modulo two, but this can be relaxed to a linear occupation-number constraint using the alternative two-mode pair-cat encoding. We construct multimode codes with similar linear constraints using any two integer matrices satisfying a CSS-like homological condition of a quantum rotor code. Just like the pair-cat code, syndrome extraction can be performed in tandem with stabilizing dissipation using current superconducting-circuit designs. The framework includes codes with various finite- or infinite-dimensional codespaces, and codes with finite or infinite Fock-state support. It encompasses two-component cat, pair-cat, dual-rail, two-mode binomial, various bosonic repetition codes, and aspects of chi-squared encodings while also yielding codes from homological products, lattices, generalized coherent states, and algebraic varieties. Among our examples are analogues of repetition codes, the Shor code, and a surface-like code that is not a concatenation of a known cat code with the qubit surface code. Codewords are coherent states projected into a Fock-state subspace defined by an integer matrix, and their overlaps are governed by Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky hypergeometric functions.</description>

Abstract: Statistical formulations of thermodynamic entropy, such as those by Boltzmann and Gibbs, were originally developed for classical systems and are well understood in that context. However, the foundational aspects of quantum statistical mechanics remain an area of active debate and are yet to be fully understood. This work is motivated by the need to develop a comprehensive understanding of the statistical measures of thermodynamic entropy in quantum systems - a topic intimately connected to the phenomenon of quantum thermalization. In particular, we investigate the conditions under which the von Neumann entropy can be regarded as a valid statistical measure of thermodynamic entropy in quantum systems. This paper demonstrates that the equivalence between the von Neumann and thermodynamic entropies is not universal, but instead depends on several subtle and often overlooked assumptions. In this context, we also briefly revisit key criticisms of von Neumann entropy - particularly its time-invariance and subadditivity - and argue that these concerns can be meaningfully addressed in the setting of thermodynamic systems. To substantiate some arguments and to clarify some issues, we provide suitable numerical results from our analysis of a spin-1/2 system.</description>

Abstract: We use spectral hole burning to investigate spin dynamics within the electronic Zeeman sublevels of the ground state of the erbium ions in erbium-doped fibers (EDF). Conducted at ultra-low temperatures and under varying magnetic fields, our study reveals distinct changes in spin relaxation dynamics across different conditions. We identified three decay components at approximately 7 mK, with one achieving spin lifetimes of over 9 hours under optimal conditions, while two components were observed at higher temperatures. The fairly stable relative weights of the decay components across conditions suggest distinct ion populations contributing to the observed relaxation dynamics. While earlier studies struggled to account for all decay components at higher temperatures, our approach successfully models spin dynamics across all observed decay components, using a consistent set of underlying mechanisms, including spin flip-flop interactions, direct coupling to two-level systems, and Raman-type processes, and distinguishes the decay components by the strengths with which these mechanisms contribute. These results suggest EDFs' potential as a promising candidate for quantum memory applications, with further room for optimization.</description>

Abstract: Quantum simulations of many-body systems are among the most promising applications of quantum computers. In particular, models based on strongly-correlated fermions are central to our understanding of quantum chemistry and materials problems, and can lead to exotic, topological phases of matter. However, due to the non-local nature of fermions, such models are challenging to simulate with qubit devices. Here we realize a digital quantum simulation architecture for two-dimensional fermionic systems based on reconfigurable atom arrays. We utilize a fermion-to-qubit mapping based on Kitaev's model on a honeycomb lattice, in which fermionic statistics are encoded using long-range entangled states. We prepare these states efficiently using measurement and feedforward, realize subsequent fermionic evolution through Floquet engineering with tunable entangling gates interspersed with atom rearrangement, and improve results with built-in error detection. Leveraging this fermion description of the Kitaev spin model, we efficiently prepare topological states across its complex phase diagram and verify the non-Abelian spin liquid phase by evaluating an odd Chern number. We further explore this two-dimensional fermion system by realizing tunable dynamics and directly probing fermion exchange statistics. Finally, we simulate strong interactions and study dynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard model on a square lattice. These results pave the way for digital quantum simulations of complex fermionic systems for materials science, chemistry, and high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Efficient Magic State Cultivation on the Surface Code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magic state cultivation is a newly proposed protocol that represents the state of the art in magic state generation. It uses the transversality of the $H_{XY}$ gate on the 2D triangular color-code, together with a novel grafting mechanism to transform the color-code into a matchable code with minimal overhead. Still, the resulting code has a longer cycle time and some high weight stabilizers. Here, we introduce three new cultivation protocols, each yielding a different magic state. These protocols avoid grafting by exploiting transversal operations on the surface code using non-local connectivity, allowing for a much lower post-selection rates in the expansion process. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our protocol achieves state-of-the-art infidelities and acceptance rates for magic state generation, on par with another recent proposal on the $\mathbb{RP}^2$ code, while still preserving the local geometry of the surface code. Moreover, in platforms such as cold atoms and trapped ions, where idle error rates are lower than two-qubit gate errors, we demonstrate that cultivation exhibits an even greater advantage, yielding an additional order-of-magnitude reduction in resource requirements. Lastly, we analyze the effect of erasure qubits on cultivation and show that \emph{algorithmically-relevant} infidelities can be achieved using only 9 erasure qubits on a distance-2 surface code with a single cultivation round.</description>

      <title>Any theory that admits a Wigner's Friend type multi-agent paradox is logically contextual</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wigner's Friend scenarios push the boundaries of quantum theory by modeling agents, along with their memories storing measurement outcomes, as physical quantum systems. Extending these ideas beyond quantum theory, we ask: in which physical theories, and under what assumptions, can agents who are reasoning logically about each other's measurement outcomes encounter apparent paradoxes? To address this, we prove a link between Wigner's Friend type multi-agent paradoxes and contextuality in general theories: if agents who are modeled within a physical theory come to a contradiction when reasoning using that theory (under certain assumptions on how they reason and describe measurements), then the theory must admit contextual correlations of a logical form. This also yields a link between the distinct fundamental concepts of Heisenberg cuts and measurement contexts in general theories, and in particular, implies that the quantum Frauchiger-Renner paradox is a proof of logical contextuality. Moreover, we identify structural properties of such paradoxes in general theories and specific to quantum theory. For instance, we demonstrate that theories admitting behaviors corresponding to extremal vertices of n-cycle contextuality scenarios admit Wigner's Friend type paradoxes without post-selection, and that any quantum Wigner's Friend paradox based on the n-cycle scenario must necessarily involve post-selection. Further, we construct a multi-agent paradox based on a genuine contextuality scenario involving sequential measurements on a single system, showing that Bell non-local correlations between distinct subsystems are not necessary for Wigner's Friend paradoxes. Our work offers an approach to investigate the structure of physical theories and their information-theoretic resources by means of deconstructing the assumptions underlying multi-agent physical paradoxes.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Open Quantum Systems with Initial System-Environment Correlations via Stochastic Unravelings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In standard treatments of open quantum systems, the reduced dynamics is described starting from the assumption that the system and the environment are initially uncorrelated. This assumption, however, is not always guaranteed in realistic scenarios and several theoretical approaches to characterize initially correlated dynamics have been introduced. For the uncorrelated scenario, stochastic unravelings are a powerful tool to simulate the dynamics, but so far they have not been used in the most general case in which correlations are initially present. In our work, we employ the bath positive (B+) or one-sided positive decomposition (OPD) formalism as a starting point to generalize stochastic unraveling in the presence of initial correlations. Noticeably, our approach doesn't depend on the particular unraveling technique, but holds for both piecewise deterministic and diffusive unravelings. This generalization allows not only for more powerful simulations for the reduced dynamics, but also for a deeper theoretical understanding of open system dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the-art classical optimization solvers set a high bar for quantum computers to deliver utility in this domain. Here, we introduce a quantum preconditioning approach based on the quantum approximate optimization algorithm. It transforms the input problem into a more suitable form for a solver with the level of preconditioning determined by the depth of the quantum circuit. We demonstrate that best-in-class classical heuristics such as simulated annealing and the Burer-Monteiro algorithm can converge more rapidly when given quantum preconditioned input for various problems, including Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glasses, random 3-regular graph maximum-cut problems, and a real-world grid energy problem. Accounting for the additional time taken for preconditioning, the benefit offered by shallow circuits translates into a practical quantum-inspired advantage for random 3-regular graph maximum-cut problems through quantum circuit emulations. We investigate why quantum preconditioning makes the problem easier and test an experimental implementation on a superconducting device. We identify challenges and discuss the prospects for a hardware-based quantum advantage in optimization via quantum preconditioning.</description>

      <title>Towards Code States via Seed-Entangler-Enriched Sequential Quantum Circuits: Application to Tetra-Digit Topological Error-Correcting Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05374v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Demonstrating how long-range entangled states are born from product states has gained much attention, which is not only important for quantum technology but also provides an unconventional tool in characterizing and classifying exotic phases of matter. In this paper, we introduce a unified and efficient framework of quantum circuits (i.e., a series of local unitary transformations), termed the \emph{Seed-Entangler-Enriched Sequential Quantum Circuit} (SEESQC) to construct long-range entangled states (i.e., code states) in code space of topological error-correcting codes. Specifically, we apply SEESQC to construct code states of Tetra-Digit models -- a broad class of long-range entangled stabilizer codes indexed by a four-digit parameter. These models are not rare but encompass Toric Codes across arbitrary dimensions and subsume the X-cube fracton code as special cases. Featuring a hierarchical structure of generalized entanglement renormalization group, many Tetra-Digit models host spatially extended excitations (e.g., loops, membranes, and exotic non-manifold objects) with constrained mobility and deformability, and exhibit system-size-dependent ground state degeneracies that scale exponentially with a polynomial in linear sizes. In this work, we begin with graphical and algebraic demonstration of quantum circuits for computational basis states, before generalizing to broader cases. Central to this framework is a key ingredient termed the \emph{seed-entangler} acting on a small number of qubits termed \textit{seeds}, enabling a systematic scheme to achieve arbitrary code states. Remarkably, the number of available seeds equals the number of logical qubits for the constructed examples, which leaves plenty of room for future investigation in theoretical physics, mathematics and quantum information science. Beyond the critical limitation of prior state-engineering methodologies, ...</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics of Multi-Level Atoms embedded in Photonic Crystals: Leveraging Resonant Dipole-Dipole Interactions and Quantum Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18813v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of entanglement dynamics in multi-level V-type atomic systems embedded within photonic crystals. We mainly focus on the synergistic roles of resonant dipole-dipole interactions and quantum interference through analytical modeling and numerical simulations using the Schrodinger equation. Key findings reveal that resonant interaction dominates when the interatomic distance is comparable to the localization length of photon-atom bound states lying in the bandgap region. For atoms with anti-parallel dipole orientations, both initially entangled and separable states exhibit robust entanglement preservation due to strong collective interactions. Conversely, when dipoles are oriented orthogonally, initially entangled states exhibit unique oscillatory patterns in their entanglement dynamics. This effect arises from the formation of dark states due to destructive interference within the structured photonic environment, with resonant dipole-dipole interactions sustaining non-Markovian dynamics. We further demonstrate that positioning the atomic excited states deeper within the photonic bandgap accelerates the decay of entanglement oscillations due to the exponential suppression of resonant energy exchange mediated by evanescent modes. Our analysis establishes resonant dipole-dipole interactions and quantum interference as potential tools for tailoring entanglement dynamics, paving the way for controlled quantum coherence in photonic crystal platforms.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the phase diagram of an anisotropic Dicke model by revealing the non-analyticity induced by underlying exceptional points (EPs). We find that, from a dynamical perspective, the conventional superradiant phase can be further separated into three regions, in which the systems are characterized by different effective Hamiltonians, including the harmonic oscillator, the inverted harmonic oscillator, and their respective counterparts. We employ the Loschmidt echo to characterize different quantum phases by analyzing the quench dynamics of a trivial initial state. Numerical simulations for finite systems confirm our predictions about the existence of hierarchic superradiant phases.</description>

      <title>Notions of Adiabatic Drift in the Quantized Harper model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a quantized, discrete and drifting version of the Harper Hamiltonian, also called the finite almost Mathieu operator, which resembles the pendulum Hamiltonian but in phase space is confined to a torus. Spacing between pairs of eigenvalues of the operator spans many orders of magnitude, with nearly degenerate pairs of states at energies that are associated with circulating orbits in the associated classical system. When parameters of the system slowly vary, both adiabatic and diabatic transitions can take place at drift rates that span many orders of magnitude. Only under an extremely negligible drift rate would all transitions into superposition states be suppressed. The wide range of energy level spacings could be a common property of quantum systems with non-local potentials that are related to resonant classical dynamical systems. Notions for adiabatic drift are discussed for quantum systems that are associated with classical ones with divided phase space.</description>

      <title>Optomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation enhanced by non-Gaussian distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The capability of magnons to coherently couple with various quantum systems makes them an ideal candidate to build hybrid quantum systems. The optomagnonic coupling is essential for constructing a hybrid magnonic quantum network, as the transmission of quantum information among remote quantum nodes must be accomplished using light rather than microwave field. Here we provide an optomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation protocol, which enables the transfer of an input optical state to a remote magnon mode. To overcome the currently relatively weak coupling in the experiment, we introduce non-Gaussian distillation operations to enhance the optomagnonic entanglement and thus the fidelity of the teleportation. An auxiliary microwave cavity is adopted to realize the non-Gaussian and displacement operations on magnons. We show that a series of optical states, such as coherent, single-photon, squeezed and cat states, can be teleported to the magnon mode. The work provides guidance for the experimental realization of magnonic quantum repeaters and quantum networks and a new route to prepare diverse magnonic quantum states exploiting the photon-to-magnon quantum teleportation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore degenerate Raman sideband cooling in which neighboring Zeeman states of a fixed hyperfine level are coupled via a two-photon Raman transition. The degenerate coupling between $|F,m_F\rangle\rightarrow |F,m_F-1\rangle$ facilitates the removal of multiple motional quanta in a single cycle. This method greatly reduces the number of cooling cycles required to reach the ground state compared to traditional sideband cooling. We show that near ground state cooling can be achieved with a pulse number as low as $\bar{n}$ where $\bar{n}$ is the average phonon number in the initial thermal state. We demonstrate proof-of-concept in $^{176}\mathrm{Lu}^+$ by coupling neighboring Zeeman levels on the motional sideband for the $F=7$ hyperfine level in $^3D_1$. Starting from a thermal distribution with an average phonon number of 6, we demonstrate near ground-state cooling with $\sim10$ pulses. A theoretical description is given that applies to any $F$ level and demonstrates how effective this approach can be.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As fault-tolerant quantum computers scale, certifying the accuracy of computations performed with encoded logical qubits will soon become classically intractable. This creates a critical need for scalable, device-independent certification methods. In this work, we introduce logical accreditation, a framework for efficiently certifying quantum computations performed on logical qubits. Our protocol is robust against general noise models, far beyond those typically considered in performance analyses of quantum error-correcting codes. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that logical accreditation can scalably certify quantum advantage experiments and indicate the crossover point where encoded computations begin to outperform physical computations. The framework also enables evaluation of whether logical error rates are sufficiently low that error mitigation can be efficiently performed, extends entropy benchmarking to the regime of fault-tolerant computation, and upper-bounds the infidelity of the logical output state of a computation. Underlying the framework is a novel randomised compilation scheme that converts arbitrary logical circuit noise into stochastic Pauli noise. This scheme includes a method for twirling non-transversal logical gates beyond the standard T-gate, resolving an open problem posed by [Piveteau et al. PRL 127, 200505 (2021)]. By bridging fault-tolerant computation and computational certification, logical accreditation offers a scalable, practical means of certifying the accuracy of quantum computations performed using encoded logical qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms have emerged as a promising tool to solve combinatorial optimization problems. The quantum walk optimization algorithm (QWOA) is one such variational approach that has recently gained attention. In the broader context of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), understanding the expressivity of the ansatz has proven critical for evaluating their performance. A key method to study this aspect involves analyzing the dimension of the dynamic Lie algebra (DLA). In this work, we derive novel upper bounds on the DLA dimension for QWOA applied to arbitrary optimization problems. Specifically, we show that the DLA dimension scales at most quadratically with the number of distinct eigenvalues of the problem Hamiltonian. As a consequence, our bound guarantees a polynomial DLA dimension with respect to the input size for optimization problems in the class $\mathsf{NPO}\text{-}\mathsf{PB}$. This result, coupled with recently established performance bounds for QWOA, allows us to identify complexity-theoretic conditions under which QWOA must be overparameterized to obtain optimal or approximate solutions for $\mathsf{NPO}\text{-}\mathsf{PB}$ problems.</description>

Abstract: A quantum thermodynamic system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list of conserved, non-commuting charges, and a fundamental goal is to determine the minimum energy of the system subject to constraints on the charges. Recently, [Liu et al., arXiv:2505.04514] proposed first- and second-order classical and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for solving a dual chemical potential maximization problem, and they proved that these algorithms converge to global optima by means of gradient-ascent approaches. In this paper, we benchmark these algorithms on several problems of interest in thermodynamics, including one- and two-dimensional quantum Heisenberg models with nearest and next-to-nearest neighbor interactions and with the charges set to the total x, y, and z magnetizations. We also offer an alternative compelling interpretation of these algorithms as methods for designing ground and thermal states of controllable Hamiltonians, with potential applications in molecular and material design. Furthermore, we introduce stabilizer thermodynamic systems as thermodynamic systems based on stabilizer codes, with the Hamiltonian constructed from a given code's stabilizer operators and the charges constructed from the code's logical operators. We benchmark the aforementioned algorithms on several examples of stabilizer thermodynamic systems, including those constructed from the one-to-three-qubit repetition code, the perfect one-to-five-qubit code, and the two-to-four-qubit error-detecting code. Finally, we observe that the aforementioned hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, when applied to stabilizer thermodynamic systems, can serve as alternative methods for encoding qubits into stabilizer codes at a fixed temperature, and we provide an effective method for warm-starting these encoding algorithms whenever a single qubit is encoded into multiple physical qubits.</description>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning research has expanded rapidly due to potential computational advantages over classical methods. Angle encoding has emerged as a popular choice as feature map (FM) for embedding classical data into quantum models due to its simplicity and natural generation of truncated Fourier series, providing universal function approximation capabilities. Efficient FMs within quantum circuits can exploit exponential scaling of Fourier frequencies, with multi-dimensional inputs introducing additional exponential growth through mixed-frequency terms. Despite this promising expressive capability, practical implementation faces significant challenges. Through controlled experiments with white-box target functions, we demonstrate that training failures can occur even when all relevant frequencies are theoretically accessible. We illustrate how two primary known causes lead to unsuccessful optimization: insufficient trainable parameters relative to the model's frequency content, and limitations imposed by the ansatz's dynamic lie algebra dimension, but also uncover an additional parameter burden: the necessity of controlling non-unique frequencies within the model. To address this, we propose near-zero weight initialization to suppress unnecessary duplicate frequencies. For target functions with a priori frequency knowledge, we introduce frequency selection as a practical solution that reduces parameter requirements and mitigates the exponential growth that would otherwise render problems intractable due to parameter insufficiency. Our frequency selection approach achieved near-optimal performance (median $R^2 \approx 0.95$) with 78\% of the parameters needed by the best standard approach in 10 randomly chosen target functions.</description>

Abstract: Conventionally, covariances do not distinguish between spatial and temporal correlations. The same covariance matrix could equally describe temporal correlations between observations of the same system at two different times or correlations made on two spatially separated systems that arose from some common cause. Here, we demonstrate Gaussian quantum correlations that are `atemporal', such that the covariances governing their quadrature measurements are unphysical without postulating some common cause. We introduce Gaussian atemporality robustness as a measure of atemporality, illustrating its efficient computability and operational meaning as the maximum noise which can be added without removing this uniquely quantum phenomenon. We illustrate that (i) specific spatiotemporal Gaussian correlations possess an intrinsic arrow of time, such that Gaussian atemporality robustness is zero in one temporal direction and not the other and (ii) that it measures quantum correlations beyond entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we present a general class of localized degenerate solutions to the massless Dirac and Weyl equations, which can also describe particles, or systems of particles, with varying energy and spin along their direction of motion. Another interesting characteristic of these solutions is that they remain unaltered in a wide range of electromagnetic 4-potentials and fields, which are analytically calculated. In addition, we propose a new method for spatially separating Weyl particles based on their helicity and direction of motion using appropriate magnetic fields, given in explicit form.</description>

      <title>Detection of long-range coherence in driven hot atomic vapors by spin noise spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study intriguing dynamical features of hot Rubidium atoms driven by two light fields. The fields resonantly drive multiple Zeeman states within two hyperfine levels, yielding a cascaded-$\Lambda$ like structure in the frequency space. A non-Hermitian Floquet tight-binding lattice with imaginary hopping between the nearest states effectively describes the coherence dynamics between Zeeman states within the ground hyperfine manifold. By performing spin noise spectroscopy, we observe higher harmonic peaks in the noise spectrum that capture multi-photon transitions in the ground manifold. Moreover, the peak amplitudes reveal an exponential decay of long-range coherence with increasing separation between the ground states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of identifying the quantum spin states that are the optimal sensors of a given transformation averaged over all possible orientations of the spin system. Our geometric approach to the problem is based on a fidelity criterion and is entirely general, encompassing both unitary transformations (such as rotations and squeezing) and non-unitary transformations (such as Lorentz boosts). This formalism leads to a universality result: There exists a zero-measure subset of states that will be optimal sensors for certain transformations and the worst sensors for others, and this set does not depend on the transformation under consideration. In other words, some spin states are simply the best (or worst) sensors, regardless of what they detect.</description>

      <title>On a discrete version of the position-momentum commutation relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22753v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The usual position-momentum commutation relation plays a fundamental role in the mathematical description of continuous-variable quantum systems. In the case of a qudit described by a Hilbert space of a high enough dimension, there exists a discrete version of the position-momentum commutation relation approximately satisfied by a large part of the pure quantum states. Our purpose is to explore in more details the set of these states. We show that it contains a family of discrete-variable Gaussian states depending on a continuous parameter and certain discrete coherent states. It also contains various discrete-variable versions of the Hermite-Gauss states, defined either as eigenstates of certain discrete versions of the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian or generated by using a discrete version of the creation or annihilation operator. As a direct consequence, a discrete version of the incertitude relation is satisfied by the considered quantum states.</description>

Abstract: We present a technical guide to developing a quantum-mechanical system with co-trapped laser-cooled ions and electrons, aiming to utilize this mixed-species system in quantum computing and sensing. We outline a method to control the system's quantum state and provide a blueprint for a forward-compatible design for containing it. The proposed technical solution features a planar configuration with a large trapping volume located at a considerable height above the electrode plane. We detail a manufacturing method using copper-coated, laser-machined glass substrates suitable for a high-power microwave drive signal. We discuss electron state decoherence in this trap and suggest that using superconductive films could enhance trapping abilities, though initial experiments are feasible with the current design.</description>

      <title>Finite-Size Security Bounds in Semi-Quantum Key Distribution: Spectral, Operator-Theoretic, and Entropic Perspectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Semi-Quantum Key Distribution (SQKD) with a focus on finite-size security bounds, developed through three complementary perspectives. (i) Spectral disturbance: wrong-basis L\"uders updates produce closed-form spectra and purity loss, which serve as basis-independent indicators of disturbance. (ii) Operator-theoretic reduction: in Z/Z-sifted rounds, intercept-resend attacks can be represented as an effective depolarizing channel, characterized by a fidelity-QBER relation. (iii) Entropic trade-offs: Maassen-Uffink and memory-assisted uncertainty relations certify security through X tests and reflection rounds, even when the sifted QBER is low. The exposition provides step-by-step derivations supported by physically interpretable figures, and the framework concludes with finite-size estimates based on concentration inequalities that are suited for practical parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Entanglement distribution via satellite: an evaluation of competing protocols assuming realistic free-space optical channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key technical requirement of any future quantum network is the ability to distribute quantum-entangled resources between two spatially separated points at a high rate and high fidelity. Entanglement distribution protocols based on satellite platforms, which transmit and receive quantum resources directly via free-space optical propagation, are therefore excellent candidates for quantum networking, since the geometry and loss characteristics of satellite networks feasibly allow for up to continental-scale ($\sim10^3$ km) over-the-horizon communication without the infrastructure, cost, or losses associated with equivalent fibre-optic networks. In this work, we explore two network topologies commonly associated with quantum networks - entanglement distribution between two satellites in low-Earth orbit mediated by a third satellite and entanglement distribution between two ground stations mediated by a satellite in low-Earth orbit, and two entanglement distribution schemes - one where the central satellite is used as a relay, and the other where the central satellite is used to generate and distribute the entangled resource directly. We compute a bound on the rate of distribution of distillable entanglement achieved by each protocol in each network topology as a function of the network channels for both single-rail discrete- (DV) and continuous-variable (CV) resources and use or non-use of probabilistic noiseless linear quantum amplification (NLA). In the case of atmospheric channels we take into account the turbulent and optical properties of the free-space propagation. We determine that for the triple-satellite network configuration, the optimal strategy is to perform a distributed NLA scheme in either CV or DV, and for the ground-satellite-ground network the optimal strategy is to distribute a DV resource via the central satellite.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Extended Benders Decomposition with Quantum-Classical Hybrid Solver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a quantum-classical hybrid method for solving large-scale mixed-integer quadratic problems (MIQP). Although extended Benders decomposition is effective for MIQP, its master problem which handles the integer and quadratic variables often becomes a computational bottleneck. To address this challenge, we integrate the D-Wave CQM solver into the decomposition framework to solve the master problem directly. Our results show that this hybrid approach efficiently yields near-optimal solutions and, for certain problem instances, achieves exponential speedups over the leading commercial classical solver. These findings highlight a promising computational strategy for tackling complex mixed-integer optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Less is More: On Copy Complexity in Quantum Cryptography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum cryptographic definitions are often sensitive to the number of copies of the cryptographic states revealed to an adversary. Making definitional changes to the number of copies accessible to an adversary can drastically affect various aspects including the computational hardness, feasibility, and applicability of the resulting cryptographic scheme. This phenomenon appears in many places in quantum cryptography, including quantum pseudorandomness and unclonable cryptography. To address this, we present a generic approach to boost single-copy security to multi-copy security and apply this approach to many settings. As a consequence, we obtain the following new results: -One-copy stretch pseudorandom state generators (under mild assumptions) imply the existence of t-copy stretch pseudorandom state generators, for any fixed polynomial t. -One-query pseudorandom unitaries with short keys (under mild assumptions) imply the existence of t-query pseudorandom unitaries with short keys, for any fixed polynomial t. -Assuming indistinguishability obfuscation and other standard cryptographic assumptions, there exist identical-copy secure unclonable primitives such as public-key quantum money and quantum copy-protection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02069v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The microstate of any degree of freedom of any classical dynamical system can be represented by a point in its two dimensional phase space. Since infinitely precise measurements are impossible, a measurement can, at best, constrain the location of this point to a region of phase space whose area is finite. This paper explores the implications of assuming that this finite area is bounded from below. I prove that if the same lower bound applied to every degree of freedom of a sufficiently cold classical dynamical system, the distribution of the system's energy among its degrees of freedom would be a Bose-Einstein distribution.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rates for the Trotter Splitting for Unbounded Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study convergence rates of the Trotter splitting $e^{A+L} = \lim_{n \to \infty} (e^{L/n} e^{A/n})^n$ in the strong operator topology. In the first part, we use complex interpolation theory to treat generators $L$ and $A$ of contraction semigroups on Banach spaces, with $L$ relatively $A$-bounded. In the second part, we study unitary dynamics on Hilbert spaces and develop a new technique based on the concept of energy constraints. Our results provide a complete picture of the convergence rates for the Trotter splitting for all common types of Schr\"odinger and Dirac operators, including singular, confining and magnetic vector potentials, as well as molecular many-body Hamiltonians in dimension $d=3$. Using the Brezis-Mironescu inequality, we derive convergence rates for the Schr\"odinger operator with $V(x)=\pm |x|^{-a}$ potential. In each case, our conditions are fully explicit.</description>

      <title>Gauging a superposition of fermionic Gaussian projected entangled pair states to get lattice gauge theory eigenstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauged fermionic projected entangled pair states (GFPEPS) and their Gaussian counterpart (GGFPEPS) are a novel type of lattice gauge theory Ansatz state that combine ideas from the Monte Carlo and tensor network communities. In particular, computation of observables for such states boils down to a Monte Carlo integration over possible gauge field configurations that have probabilities dictated by a fermionic tensor network contraction that accounts for the matter in that background configuration. Crucially, this probability distribution is positive definite and real so that there is no sign problem.
  When the underlying PEPS is Gaussian, tensor network contraction can be done efficiently, and in this scenario the Ansatz has been tested well numerically. In this work we propose to gauge superpositions of Gaussian PEPS and demonstrate that one can still efficiently compute observables when few Gaussians are in the superposition. As we will argue, the latter is exactly the case for bound states on top of the strongly interacting LGT vacuum, which makes this Ansatz particularly suitable for that scenario.
  As a corollary, we will provide an exact representation of the LGT ground state as a gauged PEPS.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Vacancy-Bound Non-Abelian Anyons in the Kitaev Model in a Magnetic Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian anyons in quantum spin liquids (QSLs) provide a promising route to fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. In the exactly solvable Kitaev honeycomb model, such anyons of the QSL state can be bound to nonmagnetic spin vacancies and endowed with non-Abelian statistics by an infinitesimal magnetic field. Here, we investigate how this approach for stabilizing non-Abelian anyons extends to a finite magnetic field represented by a proper Zeeman term. Through large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we compute the vacancy-anyon binding energy as a function of magnetic field for both the ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) Kitaev models. We find that anyon binding remains robust within the entire QSL phase for the FM Kitaev model but breaks down already inside this phase for the AFM Kitaev model. To compute a binding energy several orders of magnitude below the magnetic energy scale, we introduce both a refined definition and an extrapolation scheme based on carefully tailored perturbations.</description>

Abstract: We derive the asymptotic forms of the Green's function at the open edges of general non-Hermitian band systems in all dimensions in the long-time limit, using a modified saddle-point approximation and the analytic continuation of the momentum. The edge dynamics is determined by the "dominant saddle point", a complex momentum, which, contrary to previous conjectures, may lie outside the generalized Brillouin zone. From this result, we obtain the effective edge Hamiltonians that evidently, as demonstrated by extensive numerical simulations, characterize the dynamics on the edges, and can be probed in real-time experiments or spectroscopies.</description>

      <title>Observation of Temperature Effects on False Vacuum Decay in Atomic Quantum Gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temperature plays a crucial role in metastable phenomena, not only by contributing to determine the state (phase) of a system, but also ruling the decay probability to more stable states. Such a situation is encountered in many different physical systems, ranging from chemical reactions to magnetic structures. The characteristic decay timescale is not always straightforward to estimate since it depends on the microscopic details of the system. A paradigmatic example in quantum field theories is the decay of the false vacuum, manifested via the nucleation of bubbles. In this paper, we measure the temperature dependence of the timescale for the false vacuum decay mechanism in an ultracold atomic quantum spin mixture which exhibits ferromagnetic properties. Our results show that the false vacuum decay rate scales with temperature as predicted by the finite-temperature extension of the instanton theory, and confirm atomic systems as an ideal platform where to study out-of-equilibrium field theories.</description>

Abstract: Momentum space entanglement of four fermion field theory is calculated from the Wilsonian effective action pertubatively using replica trick, local terms in low energy effective action are proved to be non-relevant pertubatively and nonlocal terms are the only source of entanglement between different momentum modes. The final result again can be represented by a set of basketball feynmann diagrams with new feynmann rules proposed to inteprete them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The charged (symmetry-resolved) vacuum R\'enyi entanglement entropy on a disk is computed in the limit of large U(1) global charge for any R\'enyi index. We show that it behaves universally for a broad class of conformal field theories including the O(2) Wilson-Fisher fixed-point, by using the effective field theory at large global charge. The result establishes one of the first concrete computations of entanglement quantities in strongly-coupled field theories.</description>

      <title>Scalable tensor network algorithm for quantum impurity problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method has shown great potential as a general-purpose quantum impurity solver, as its numerical errors can be well-controlled and it is flexible to be applied on both the imaginary- and real-time axis. However, a major limitation of it is that its computational cost grows exponentially with the number of impurity flavors. In this work, we propose a multi-flavor extension of it to overcome this limitation. The key insight is that to calculate multi-time correlation functions on one or a few impurity flavors, one could integrate out the degrees of freedom of the rest flavors before hand, which could greatly simplify the calculation. The idea is particularly effective for quantum impurity problems with diagonal hybridization function, i.e., each impurity flavor is coupled to an independent bath, a setting which is commonly used in the field. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of our method for the imaginary time evolution of impurity problems with up to three impurity orbitals, i.e., 6 flavors, and benchmark our results against continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo calculations. Our method paves the way of scaling up tensor network algorithms to solve large-scale quantum impurity problems.</description>

      <title>Exact Solution for Two $\delta$-Interacting Bosons on a Ring in the Presence of a $\delta$-Barrier: Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz for Spatially Odd States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17371v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we apply the recently proposed Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz method to the problem of two one-dimensional, short-range-interacting bosons on a ring in the presence of a $\delta$-function barrier. Only half of the Hilbert space--namely, the two-body states that are odd under point inversion about the position of the barrier--is accessible to this method. The other half is presumably non-integrable. We consider benchmarking the recently proposed $1/g$ expansion about the hard-core boson point [A. G. Volosniev, D. V. Fedorov, A. S. Jensen, M. Valiente, N. T. Zinner, Nature Communications 5, 5300 (2014)] as one application of our results. Additionally, we find that when the $\delta$-barrier is converted to a $\delta$-well with strength equal to that of the particle-particle interaction, the system exhibits the spectrum of its non-interacting counterpart while its eigenstates display features of a strongly interacting system. We discuss this phenomenon in the "Summary and Future Research" section of our paper.</description>

      <title>Real-Time String Dynamics in a $2+1$D Non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory: String Breaking, Glueball Formation, Baryon Blockade, and Tension Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding flux string dynamics can provide insight into quark confinement and hadronization. First-principles quantum and numerical simulations have mostly focused on toy-model Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs). With the advent of state-of-the-art quantum simulation experiments, it is important to bridge this gap and study string dynamics in non-Abelian LGTs beyond one spatial dimension. Using tensor network methods, we simulate the real-time string dynamics of a $2\!+\!1$D SU$(2)$ Yang--Mills LGT with dynamical matter. In the strong-coupling regime and at resonance, string breaking occurs through sharp Casimir reduction along with meson and baryon-antibaryon formation, a distinctively non-Abelian feature. At finite baryon density, we discover a \textit{baryon blockade} mechanism that delays string breaking. Away from resonance, the magnetic term drives purely non-Abelian fluctuations: glueball loops and self-crossed strings that resolve two SU$(2)$ intertwiners with distinct dynamics. For higher-energy strings, we uncover representation-dependent tension-reduction resonances. Our findings serve as a guide for upcoming quantum simulators of non-Abelian LGTs.</description>

      <title>Estimation of deuteron binding energy with renormalization group-based effective interactions using the variational quantum eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have obtained the binding energy of the deuteron on a quantum simulator using the variational quantum eigensolver for renormalization group (RG)-based low-momentum effective interactions. The binding energy (BE) has been calculated in the truncated harmonic oscillator (HO) basis, using the Qiskit-Aer simulator in both noise-free and noisy cases. The noise models have been taken from the actual IBM quantum hardware, and the results obtained have been extrapolated to the zero noise limit. The number of HO basis states (hence qubits) needed for computing the BE to within 1 percent of the experimental value in the quantum simulator, decreases with decreasing RG parameter $\lambda$. The $\lambda$-dependence of the extent of entanglement between the oscillator modes has been analysed.</description>

      <title>A unified relativistic path integral origin for noise-activated collapse and decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relativity and quantum mechanics are two cornerstones of modern physics, yet their unification within a single-particle path integral and a dynamic explanation of quantum measurement remain unresolved. Historically, these two problems have been treated as separate, but we in this work show they are intimately linked. We construct a relativistic path integral that recovers the Dirac, Klein-Gordon, and Schr\"odinger equations, while also exposing a latent nonlocal term in the propagator. This term dormant in differentiable potentials but is activated by non-differentiable noise, driving outcome probabilities through bounded-martingale stochastic process. In this regime, the pointer basis emerges as absorbing boundaries, Born's rule arises from first-passage statistics, and collapse occurs in finite, parameter-dependent time, thereby reducing measurement axioms to dynamical consequences. Crucially, our work recovers the standard GKSL master equation by taking the ensemble average over the noise, and thus provides a first-principles foundation for decoherence. Because the trigger is the noise spectrum, our work shows that engineering ``colored'' noise can expedite or steer collapse, suggesting practical routes to fast qubit reset, coherence preservation, and quantum sensing beyond the standard quantum limit.</description>

      <title>Triacontagonal proofs of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coxeter pointed out that a number of polytopes can be projected orthogonally into two dimensions in such a way that their vertices lie on a number of concentric regular triacontagons (or 30-gons). Among them are the 600-cell and 120-cell in four dimensions and Gosset's polytope in eight dimensions. We show how these projections can be modified into Kochen-Secker diagrams from which parity proofs of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem are easily extracted. Our construction trivially yields parity proofs of fifteen bases for all theree polytopes and also allows many other proofs of the same type to be constructed for two of them. The defining feature of these proofs is that they have a fifteen-fold symmetry about the center of the Kochen-Specker diagram and thus involve both rays and bases that are multiples of fifteen. Any proof of this type can be written as a word made up of an odd number of distinct letters, each representing an orbit of fifteen bases. Knowing a word makes it possible to write down all the features of the associated proof without first having to recover its bases. A comparison is made with earlier approaches that have been used to obtain parity proofs in these polytopes, and two questions related to possible applications of these polytopes are raised.</description>

      <title>Quantum dissipative effects for a real scalar field coupled to a dynamical Neumann surface in d+1 dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study dissipative effects for a system consisting of a massless real scalar field satisfying Neumann boundary conditions on a space and time-dependent surface, in d+1 dimensions. We focus on the comparison of the results for this system with the ones corresponding to Dirichlet conditions, and the same surface space-time geometry. We show that, in d=1, the effects are equal up to second order for rather arbitrary surfaces, and up to fourth order for wavelike surfaces. For d&gt;1, we find general expressions for their difference.</description>

      <title>Computational Certified Deletion Property of Magic Square Game and its Application to Classical Secure Key Leasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first construction of a computational Certified Deletion Property (CDP) achievable with classical communication, derived from the compilation of the non-local Magic Square Game (MSG). We leverage the KLVY compiler to transform the non-local MSG into a 2-round interactive protocol, rigorously demonstrating that this compilation preserves the game-specific CDP. Previously, the quantum value and rigidity of the compiled game were investigated. We emphasize that we are the first to investigate CDP (local randomness in [Fu and Miller, Phys. Rev. A 97, 032324 (2018)]) for the compiled game. Then, we combine this CDP with the framework [Kitagawa, Morimae, and Yamakawa, Eurocrypt 2025] to construct Secure Key Leasing with classical Lessor (cSKL). SKL enables the Lessor to lease the secret key to the Lessee and verify that a quantum Lessee has indeed deleted the key. In this paper, we realize cSKL for PKE, PRF, and digital signature. Compared to prior works for cSKL, we realize cSKL for PRF and digital signature for the first time. In addition, we succeed in weakening the assumption needed to construct cSKL.</description>

      <title>Finite temperature dopant-induced spin reorganization explored via tensor networks in the two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Doped Mott insulators host intertwined spin-charge phenomena that evolve with temperature and can culminate in stripe order or superconductivity at low temperatures. The two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model captures this interplay yet finite-temperature, infinite-size calculations remain difficult. Using purification represented by a tensor network - an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz - we simulate the $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit, reaching temperatures down to one tenth of the hopping rate and hole concentrations up to one quarter of the lattice sites. Beyond specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and compressibility, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that map how holes reshape local exchange. Nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a strong cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the adjacent parallel bonds, and single holes weaken nearby antiferromagnetic bonds; d-wave pairing correlations remain short-ranged over the same window. These results provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of short-range spin-texture reorganization at finite temperature.</description>
