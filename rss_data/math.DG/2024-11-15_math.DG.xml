      <title>Integrable sub-Riemannian geodesic flows on the special orthogonal group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One way to define a sub-Riemannian metric is as the limit of a Riemannian metric. Consider a Riemannian structure depending on a parameter $s$ such that its limit defines a sub-Riemannian metric when $s \to \infty$, assuming that the Riemannian geodesic flow is integrable for all $s$. An interesting question is: Can we determine the integrability of the sub-Riemannian geodesic flow as the limit of the integrals of motion of the Riemannian geodesic flow? The paper's main contribution is to provide a positive answer to this question in the special orthogonal group. Theorem 1.1 states that the Riemannian geodesic flow is Liuville integrable: The Manakov integrals' limit suggests the existence of a Lax pair formulation of the Riemannian geodesic equations, and the proof of Theorem 1.1 relies on this Lax pair.</description>

      <title>Scalar curvature rigidity of parabolically convex domains in hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a parabolically convex domain $M\subseteq \mathbb{H}^n$, $n\ge 3$, we prove that if $f:(N,\bar g)\to (M,g)$ has nonzero degree, where $N$ is spin with scalar curvature $R_N\ge -n(n-1)$, and if $f|_{\partial N}$ does not increase the distance and the mean curvature, then $N$ is hyperbolic, and $\partial N$ is isometric to $\partial M$. This is a partial generalization of Lott's result \cite{lott2021index} to negative lower bounds of scalar curvature.</description>

      <title>Seiberg-Witten equations in all dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting with an $n$-dimensional oriented Riemannian manifold with a Spin-c structure, we describe an elliptic system of equations which recover the Seiberg-Witten equations when $n=3,4$. The equations are for a U(1)-connection $A$ and spinor $\phi$, as usual, and also an odd degree form $\beta$ (generally of inhomogeneous degree). From $A$ and $\beta$ we define a Dirac operator $D_{A,\beta}$ using the action of $\beta$ and $*\beta$ on spinors (with carefully chosen coefficients) to modify $D_A$. The first equation in our system is $D_{A,\beta}(\phi)=0$. The left-hand side of the second equation is the principal part of the Weitzenb\"ock remainder for $D^*_{A,\beta}D_{A,\beta}$. The equation sets this equal to $q(\phi)$, the trace-free part of projection against $\phi$, as is familiar from the cases $n=3,4$. In dimensions $n=4m$ and $n=2m+1$, this gives an elliptic system modulo gauge. To obtain a system which is elliptic modulo gauge in dimensions $n=4m+2$, we use two spinors and two connections, and so have two Dirac and two curvature equations, that are then coupled via the form $\beta$. We also prove a collection of a priori estimates for solutions to these equations. Unfortunately they are not sufficient to prove compactness modulo gauge, instead leaving the possibility that bubbling may occur.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we compute the expansion of harmonic functions and 1-forms on ALE Ricci-flat 4-manifolds. As an application, we prove that the existence of a Killing field with a certain leading term improves the asymptotic rate of metric convergence to the Euclidean metric from -4 to -5.</description>

      <title>BPS Skyrme models and contact geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Skyrme type energy functional for maps $\varphi$ from an oriented Riemannian 3-manifold $M$ to a contact 3-manifold $N$ is defined, generalizing the BPS Skyrme energy of Ferreira and Zakrzewski. This energy has a topological lower bound, attained by solutions of a first order self-duality equation which we call (strong) Beltrami maps. In the case where $N$ is the 3-sphere, we show that the original Ferreira-Zakrzewski model (which has $N=S^3$ with the standard contact structure) can have no BPS solutions on $M=S^3$ with $|\mathrm{deg}(\varphi)|&gt;1$ if the coupling constant has the lowest admissible value.</description>

      <title>Geodesic normal coordinates and natural tensors for pseudo-Riemannian submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a version of geodesic normal coordinates adapted to a submanifold of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold and show that the Taylor coefficients of the metric in these coordinates can be expressed as universal polynomials in the components of the covariant derivatives of the background curvature tensor and the covariant derivatives of the second fundamental form. We formulate a definition of natural submanifold tensors and show that these are linear combinations of contractions of covariant derivatives of the background curvature tensor and covariant derivatives of the second fundamental form. We also describe how this result gives a similar characterization of natural submanifold differential operators.</description>

      <title>Reverse isoperimetric properties of thick $\lambda$-sausages in the hyperbolic plane and Blaschke's rolling theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we address the reverse isoperimetric inequality for convex bodies with uniform curvature constraints in the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^2$. We prove that thethick $\lambda$-sausage body, that is, the convex domain bounded by two equal circular arcs of curvature $\lambda$ and two equal arcs of hypercircle of curvature $1 / \lambda$, is the unique minimizer of area among all bodies $K \subset \mathbb{H}^2$ with a given length and with curvature of $\partial K$ satisfying $1 / \lambda \leq \kappa \leq \lambda$ (in a weak sense). We call this class of bodies thick $\lambda$-concave bodies, in analogy to the Euclidean case where a body is $\lambda$-concave if $0 \leq \kappa \leq \lambda$. The main difficulty in the hyperbolic setting is that the inner parallel bodies of a convex body are not necessarily convex. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce an extra assumption of thickness $\kappa \geq 1/\lambda$. In addition, we prove the Blaschke's rolling theorem for $\lambda$-concave bodies under the thickness assumption. That is, we prove that a ball of curvature $\lambda$ can roll freely inside a thick $\lambda$-concave body. In striking contrast to the Euclidean setting, Blaschke's rolling theorem for $\lambda$-concave domains in $\mathbb{H}^2$ does not hold in general, and thus has not been studied in literature before. We address this gap, and show that the thickness assumption is necessary and sufficient for such a theorem to hold.</description>

      <title>Euler's original derivation of elastica equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Euler derived the differential equations of elastica by the variational method in 1744, but his original derivation has never been properly interpreted or explained in terms of modern mathematics. We elucidate Euler's original derivation of elastica and show that Euler used Noether's theorem concerning the translational symmetry of elastica, although Noether published her theorem in 1918. It is also shown that his equation is essentially the static modified KdV equation which is obtained by the isometric and isoenergy conditions, known as the Goldstein-Petrich scheme.</description>

      <title>Discrete Dirac structures and discrete Lagrange--Dirac dynamical systems in mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the concept of $(\pm)$-discrete Dirac structures over a manifold, where we define $(\pm)$-discrete two-forms on the manifold and incorporate discrete constraints using $(\pm)$-finite difference maps. Specifically, we develop $(\pm)$-discrete induced Dirac structures as discrete analogues of the induced Dirac structure on the cotangent bundle over a configuration manifold, as described by Yoshimura and Marsden (2006). We demonstrate that $(\pm)$-discrete Lagrange--Dirac systems can be naturally formulated in conjunction with the $(\pm)$-induced Dirac structure on the cotangent bundle. Furthermore, we show that the resulting equations of motion are equivalent to the $(\pm)$-discrete Lagrange--d'Alembert equations proposed in Cort\'es and Mart\'inez (2001) and McLachlan and Perlmutter (2006). We also clarify the variational structures of the discrete Lagrange--Dirac dynamical systems within the framework of the $(\pm)$-discrete Lagrange--d'Alembert--Pontryagin principle. Finally, we validate the proposed discrete Lagrange--Dirac systems with some illustrative examples of nonholonomic systems through numerical tests.</description>

      <title>A Miyaoka-Yau inequality for hyperplane arrangements in $\mathbb{CP}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a hyperplane arrangement in $\mathbb{CP}^n$. We define a quadratic form $Q$ on $\mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{H}}$ that is entirely determined by the intersection poset of $\mathcal{H}$. Using the Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality for parabolic bundles, we show that if $\mathbf{a} \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{H}}$ is such that the weighted arrangement $(\mathcal{H}, \mathbf{a})$ is \emph{stable}, then $Q(\mathbf{a}) \leq 0$.
  As an application, we consider the symmetric case where all the weights are equal. The inequality $Q(a, \ldots, a) \leq 0$ gives a lower bound for the total sum of multiplicities of codimension $2$ intersection subspaces of $\mathcal{H}$. The lower bound is attained when every $H \in \mathcal{H}$ intersects all the other members of $\mathcal{H} \setminus \{H\}$ along $(1-2/(n+1))|\mathcal{H}| + 1$ codimension $2$ subspaces; extending from $n=2$ to higher dimensions a condition found by Hirzebruch for line arrangements in the complex projective plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify superpotentials for the Hamiltonian system corresponding to the cohomogeneity one gradient Ricci soliton equations. Aside from recovering known examples of superpotentials for steady solitons, we find a new superpotential on a specific case of the B\'erard Bergery-Calabi ansatz. The latter is used to obtain an explicit formula for a steady complete soliton with an equidistant family of hypersurfaces given by circle bundles over $S^2\times S^2$. There are no superpotentials in the non-steady case in dimensions greater than 2, even if polynomial coefficients are allowed. We also briefly discuss generalised first integrals and the limitations of some known methods of finding them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a compact complex $n$-manifold. A Gauduchon metric is a Hermitian metric whose fundamental 2-form $\omega$ satisfies the equation $dd^c(\omega^{n-1})=0$. Paul Gauduchon has proven that any Hermitian metric is conformally equivalent to a Gauduchon metric, which is unique (up to a constant multiplier) in its conformal class. Then $d^c(\omega^{n-1})$ is a closed $(2n-1)$-form; the set of cohomology classes of all such forms, called the Lee-Gauduchon cone, is a convex cone, superficially similar to the Kahler cone. We prove that the Lee-Gauduchon cone is a bimeromorphic invariant, and compute it for several classes of non-Kahler manifolds.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on eigenvalue multiplicities for spheres and plane domains revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.06587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit two papers which appeared in 1999: [1] M. Hoffmann-Ostenhof, T. Hoffmann-Ostenhof, and N. Nadirashvili. On the multiplicity of eigenvalues of the Laplacian on surfaces. Ann. Global Anal. Geom. 17 (1999) 43--48. [2] T. Hoffmann-Ostenhof, P. Michor, and N. Nadirashvili. Bounds on the multiplicity of eigenvalues for fixed membranes. Geom. Funct. Anal. 9 (1999) 1169--1188. The main result of these papers is that the multiplicity $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k(M))$ of the $k$th eigenvalue of the Riemannian surface $M$ is bounded from above by $(2k-3)$ provided that $k \ge 3$. In [1], $M$ is homeomorphic to a sphere. In [2], $M$ is a plane domain with Dirichlet boundary condition. In both cases, the starting label of eigenvalues is $1$. The proofs given in [1,2] are not very detailed, and often rely on figures or special configurations of nodal sets. The purpose of this monograph is to provide detailed general proofs for the above upper bounds and to extend the results to Robin boundary conditions. When $M$ is homeomorphic to a sphere, we provide a complete proof that $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k) \le (2k-3)$ for any $k\ge 3$, by introducing and carefully studying the combinatorial type and a labeling of the nodal domains of some particular eigenfunctions. When $M$ is a plane domain, we consider Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions and we also study the combinatorial types and a labeling of the nodal domains of some particular eigenfunctions. We prove the inequality $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k) \le (2k-2)$ for general $C^{\infty}$ bounded domains and all $k \ge 3$. We prove the inequality $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k) \le (2k-3)$ for $k \ge 3$ under the additional assumption that the domain is simply connected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04513v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate 3-nondegenerate CR structures in the lowest possible dimension 7, and one of our goals is to prove Beloshapka's conjecture on the symmetry dimension bound for hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{C}^4$. We claim that 8 is the maximal symmetry dimension of 3-nondegenerate CR structures in dimension 7, which is achieved on the homogeneous model. This part (I) is devoted to the homogeneous case: we prove that the model is locally the only homogeneous 3-nondegenerate CR structure in dimension 7.</description>

Abstract: We build free, bigraded bidifferential algebra models for the forms on a complex manifold, with respect to a strong notion of quasi-isomorphism and compatible with the conjugation symmetry. This answers a question of Sullivan. The resulting theory naturally accomodates higher operations involving double primitives. As applications, we obtain various refinements of the homotopy groups, sensitive to the complex structure. Under a simple connectedness assumption, one obtains minimal models which are unique up to isomorphism and allow for explicit computations of the new invariants.</description>
