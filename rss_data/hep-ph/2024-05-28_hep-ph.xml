      <title>The Final Frontier for Proton Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel experimental concept to search for proton decay. Using paleo-detectors, ancient minerals acquired from deep underground which can hold traces of charged particles, it may be possible to conduct a search for $p \to \bar{\nu} K^+$ via the track produced at the endpoint of the kaon. Such a search is not possible on Earth due to large atmospheric-neutrino-induced backgrounds. However, the Moon offers a reprieve from this background, since the conventional component of the cosmic-ray-induced neutrino flux at the Moon is significantly suppressed due to the Moon's lack of atmosphere. For a 100 g, $10^9$ year old (100 kton$\cdot$year exposure) sample of olivine extracted from the Moon, we expect about 0.5 kaon endpoints due to neutrino backgrounds, including secondary interactions. If such a lunar paleo-detector sample can be acquired and efficiently analyzed, proton decay sensitivity exceeding $\tau_p\sim10^{34}$ years may be achieved, competitive with Super-Kamiokande's current published limit ($\tau_p&gt;5.9\times 10^{33}$ years at 90% CL) and the projected reach of DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande in the $p \to \bar{\nu} K^+$ channel. This concept is clearly futuristic, not least since it relies on extracting mineral samples from a few kilometers below the surface of the Moon and then efficiently scanning them for kaon endpoint induced crystal defects with sub-micron-scale resolution. However, the search for proton decay is in urgent need of a paradigm shift, and paleo-detectors could provide a promising alternative to conventional experiments.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Higgs Potential with Neural Simulation-based Inference for Di-Higgs Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the form of the Higgs potential is one of the most exciting challenges of modern particle physics. Higgs pair production directly probes the Higgs self-coupling and should be observed in the near future at the High-Luminosity LHC. We explore how to improve the sensitivity to physics beyond the Standard Model through per-event kinematics for di-Higgs events. In particular, we employ machine learning through simulation-based inference to estimate per-event likelihood ratios and gauge potential sensitivity gains from including this kinematic information. In terms of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, we find that adding a limited number of observables can help to remove degeneracies in Wilson coefficient likelihoods and significantly improve the experimental sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Improving Neutrino Energy Reconstruction with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faithful energy reconstruction is foundational for precision neutrino experiments like DUNE, but is hindered by uncertainties in our understanding of neutrino--nucleus interactions. Here, we demonstrate that dense neural networks are very effective in overcoming these uncertainties by estimating inaccessible kinematic variables based on the observable part of the final state. We find improvements in the energy resolution by up to a factor of two compared to conventional reconstruction algorithms, which translates into an improved physics performance equivalent to a 10-30% increase in the exposure.</description>

      <title>New Higgses at the Electroweak Scale and Differential $t\bar t$ Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indications for new Higgs bosons at 95\,GeV and 152\,GeV with significance of 3.8$\sigma$ and $4.3\sigma$, respectively, have been obtained. While the former contains the inclusive $\gamma\gamma$ channel, the latter is obtained by combining several modes of associated di-photon production, i.e. $\gamma\gamma+X$ with $X=\ell,\,\ell b,\,{\rm MET},\,\tau,\,...$, within the $\Delta$SM (the Standard Model extended by a real triplet). Such a triplet predicts a positive definite shift in the $W$ mass, in agreement with the current global electroweak fit, and its neutral component decays dominantly to $W$ bosons (for small mixing angles). This offers a connection to $t\bar t$ differential distributions whose experimental signature is $WW b\bar b$: A simplified model with a new scalar $H$, produced via gluon fusion and decaying to $S$ and $S^\prime$ with subsequent (dominant) decays to $WW$ and $b\bar b$, respectively, has the same final state. In fact, adding this new physics polution to the Standard Model describes the leptonic $t\bar t$ distributions better by at least $5.8\sigma$. Furthermore, assuming that $S^\prime$ is an $SU(2)_L$ singlet, the resulting di-photon signal strength is compatible with the 95\,GeV $\gamma\gamma$ measurements. A possible UV completion of this simplified model is the $\Delta$2HDMS, i.e. a 2HDM supplemented with a singlet and a real triplet, which can successfully accommodate electroweak scale Baryogenesis.</description>

      <title>Gauss-Bonnet Cosmology: large-temperature behaviour and bounds from Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a transparent discussion of the high temperature asymptotic behaviour of Cosmology in a dilaton-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (dEGB) scenario of modified gravity with vanishing scalar potential. In particular, we show that it has a clear interpretation in terms of only three attractors (stable critical points) of a set of autonomous differential equations: $w=-\frac{1}{3}$, $w=1$ and $1&lt;w&lt;\frac{7}{3}$, where $w\equiv p/\rho$ is the equation of state, defined as the ratio of the total pressure and the total energy density. All the possible different high-temperature evolution histories of the model are exhausted by only eight paths in the flow of the set of the autonomous differential equations. Our discussion clearly explains why five out of them are characterized by a swift transition of the system toward the attractor, while the remaining three show a more convoluted evolution, where the system follows a meta-stable equation of state at intermediate temperatures before eventually jumping to the real attractor at higher temperatures. Compared to standard Cosmology, the regions of the dEGB parameter space with $w=-\frac{1}{3}$ show a strong enhancement of the expected Gravitational Wave stochastic background produced by the primordial plasma of relativistic particles of the Standard Model. This is due to the very peculiar fact that dEGB allows to have an epoch when the energy density $\rho_{\rm rad}$ of the relativistic plasma dominates the energy of the Universe while at the same time the rate of dilution with $T$ of the total energy density is slower than what usually expected during radiation dominance. This allows to use the bound from BBN to put in dEGB a constraint $T_{\rm RH}\lesssim 10^8 - 10^9$ GeV on the reheating temperature of the Universe $T_{\rm RH}$. Such BBN bound is complementary to late-time constraints from compact binary mergers.</description>

      <title>The Higgs boson decay $h \rightarrow bs$ in the $U(1)_X$SSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the $U(1)_X$SSM, we delve into the flavor violation of $h \rightarrow bs$, where $h$ is identified with the SM-like Higgs boson discovered at the LHC. As the U(1) extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), the U(1)XSSM has new super fields such as right-handed neutrinos and three Higgs singlets. We conduct a thorough analysis of the underlying mechanisms and parameter dependencies of $h \rightarrow bs$ in the $U(1)_X$SSM. In the $U(1)_X$SSM, we discover that the Br$(h \rightarrow bs)$ for the Higgs decay to $bs$ could significantly differ from the expectation in the standard model (SM), depending on the values of the new parameters introduced in the model. Our research not only contributes to a deeper understanding of Higgs physics within the $U(1)_X$SSM, but also provides valuable guidance for new physics (NP).</description>

      <title>Rescattering effects in $b\to s$ processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurements in $b\to s$ penguin-dominated decays are widely recognized as promising avenues for searching for New Physics by studying the deviation from theoretical estimations within the Standard Model. However, most current estimations focus only on short-distance interactions, and the influence oflong-distance interactions may exclude the impact of new physics. This suggests that it is essential to estimate the long-distance contribution before probing New Physics in penguin-dominated decays. We highlights an oversight regarding long-distance interactions, which significantly contribute to the decay $B_s\to K^{*0}\bar{K}^{*0}$. Both short-distance and long-distance interactions play crucial roles in this decay. We give estimations of the branching ratio and longitudinal polarization of $B_s\to K^{*0}\bar{K}^{*0}$, which is consistent with experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Heavy quark dominance and fine structure of excited heavy baryons $\Sigma_{Q}$, $\Xi '_{Q}$ and $\Omega_{Q}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of the relativized quark model, the calculation of spin-orbit interactions is improved by considering the contribution from the light quark cluster in a singly heavy baryon. It enhances the energy level splitting of the orbital excitation and causes a partial removal of the energy level degeneracy and the emergence of fine structures for $\Sigma_{Q}$, $\Xi '_{Q}$ and $\Omega_{Q}$ baryons. Based on this improvement, we systematically analyze the fine structures and retest the heavy quark dominance mechanism. This mechanism is found to be violated in the $1P$-wave states of the $\Sigma_{c}$, $\Xi '_{c}$ and $\Omega_{c}$ baryons although it remains effective overall, which may help to understand the nature of the heavy quarks and strong interactions. With the predicted fine structures, we make the precise assignments of those observed heavy baryons which once could not be accurately explained due to their close mass values. The method used in this work is instructive and applicable for the study of more complex exotic hadron states, such as the heavy tetraquarks and pentaquarks.</description>

      <title>General Discussions on the SU(2) Vector Boson Dark Matter Model with a Single Higgs Multiplet -- Lagrangian, Discrete Subgroups, and Scalar Classifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vector boson dark matter particles which stem from some broken gauge symmetries usually requires some unbroken symmetries to keep themselves stable. In the previous literature, some simplest cases have been discussed, in which the unbroken symmetry is provided by a remnant subgroup of the gauge group. It would be interesting to ask whether all the possible remnant subgroups as well as all the possible coupling forms can be enumerated. Classifying all the Higgs components into different mass degenerate representations to simplify the diagonalization processes is also necessary. Rather than the ambitious target of providing a general solution to all kinds of gauge groups configured with all forms of the Higgs multiplets, in this paper, we concentrate on the case of $\text{SU(2)}_{\text{D}}$ gauge group together with a single Higgs multiplet. We enumerate all possible discrete subgroups that can survive up to $n=21$, where $n$ is the dimension of the Higgs multiplet. We also provide the general algorithms to enumerate all possible renormalizable operators, to write down the general forms of the vacuum expectation value (VEV) configurations, and to give the detailed results of all the mass degenerate irreducible representations embedded in the Higgs multiplet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the contribution of Scalar Leptoquark (SLQ) loops to the two photon scattering cross section at high energies. The leading order helicity amplitudes are discussed at coupling O(e4) for Standard Model (SM) fermions, weak bosons and SLQs. Helicity amplitudes for the different types of loops are calculated for photon center of mass energies being much higher than weak boson mass scale but still much lower than the predicted Leptoquark mass scales. Finally, the cross section due to the SLQ loops is presented in conjunction with the known SM contribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experimental verification of the Newton law of gravity at small scales has been a longstanding challenge. Recently, torsion balance experiments have successfully measured gravitational force at the millimeter scale. However, testing gravity force on quantum mechanical wave function at small scales remains difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel experiment that utilizes the Josephson effect to detect the different evolution of quantum phase induced from the potential difference caused by gravity. We demonstrate that this experiment can test gravity quantum mechanically at the millimeter scale, and also has a potential to investigate the parity invariance of gravity at small scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new calculations of the leading-order one-loop amplitude and the decay rate for $H\to \bar{\nu}\nu \gamma$ within the standard model, employing reduction to a set of basic Passarino-Veltman functions resulting in a more concise expressions compared to prior works. Our result for the total decay rate is $\Gamma(H\to \bar{\nu}\nu \gamma)=1.33\,\text{keV}$, in close agreement with the narrow width approximation (NWA) for the intermediate Z boson. We also provide a comparison with previous results available in the literature. We evaluate the differential decay rate and find that the non-resonant contributions from box diagrams beyond the NWA notably affect the off-shell kinematic region associated with high-energy photons, suggesting potential implications for dark sector mediators, particularly in future lepton collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Single and Double Diffractive Production of Dilepton and Photon at LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the single and double diffractive production of dileptons and photons in ultra-peripheral collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Utilizing advanced theoretical models that integrate quantum electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) frameworks, we analyze the differential cross sections of these processes, with particular emphasis on the role of the Pomeron and resolved Pomeron structures, as well as resolved photon structures. Our research employs diffractive production mechanisms to predict dilepton and photon production rates under various LHC energy scenarios. Our results demonstrate distinct production patterns for single and double diffractive processes, highlighting their potential as probes for studying the electromagnetic structure of heavy ions and the dynamics of soft interactions in high-energy collisions. This paper provides new insights into the photon-mediated and Pomeron-mediated production mechanisms and sets the stage for future experimental investigations at collider facilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the hard QCD contributions to the pion gravitational form factors (GFFs), in terms of the twist-2,3 pion distribution amplitudes (DA), including novel semi-hard contributions from the instantons. The pion DAs are evaluated in the QCD instanton vacuum, and then properly evolved to higher resolution. The results are compared to our recent results from the QCD instanton vacuum, as well as Bethe-Salpeter calculations and recent lattice data. The interpolated hard and soft contributions to the pion D-form-factor, are used to derive the (gravitational) pressure and shear within the pion, with a clear delineation of their range.</description>

      <title>An innovative quarkonium model and its applications to fermion-antifermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of quark-antiquark ($q\overline{q}$) pairs holds significant importance in modern physics. Governed by the strong force, these systems demonstrate intricate interactions vital for comprehending particle physics and natural forces. The current study introduces a unique theoretical model utilizing the many-body Dirac equation in an effective position-dependent mass setting (i.e., $m\rightarrow m(r)$). To demonstrate the robustness of our model, we show that by modifying the mass with a Coulomb-like potential, $m(r)=m-\alpha/r$, our results precisely align with the well-established energy eigenvalues for fermion-antifermion pairs interacting through the Coulomb potential, without resorting to any approximation. Subsequently, by selecting adjustments rooted in the Cornell potential, we derive a closed-form energy spectrum for quarkonium systems under the influence of an external magnetic field. Our analysis thoroughly explores the characteristics of quarkonium states with magnetic field effects. We believe that this distinctive model holds the potential to offer vital insights into the dynamics of $q\overline{q}$ pairs, encompassing their interactions and potential applications in particle physics. Moreover, it could extend its utility to various fermion-antifermion systems, such as positronium, relativistic Landau levels for neutral mesons, excitons in monolayer transitional metal dichalcogenides, and Weyl pairs in monolayer graphene sheets.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field effect on hadron yield ratios and fluctuations in hadron resonance gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the influence of an external magnetic field on hadron yields and fluctuations in a hadron resonance gas by performing calculations within an updated version of the open-source Thermal-FIST package. The presence of the magnetic field has a sizable influence on certain hadron yield ratios. Most notably, it leads to enhanced $ p/pi$ and suppressed $n/p$ ratios, which may serve as a magnetometer in heavy-ion collisions. By attributing the centrality dependence of the $p/\pi$ ratio in Pb-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV measured by the ALICE Collaboration entirely to the magnetic field, we estimate its maximal strength at freeze-out to be $eB \simeq 0.12$~GeV$^2 \simeq 6.3 m_\pi^2$ in peripheral collisions. The magnetic field also enhances various conserved charge susceptibilities, which is qualitatively consistent with recent lattice QCD data and is driven in the HRG model by the increase of hadron densities. However, the variances of hadrons do not show any enhancement when normalized by the means, therefore, measurements of second-order fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions do not appear to offer additional information about the magnetic field relative to mean multiplicities.</description>

      <title>Nuclear deformation effects in photoproduction of $\rho$ mesons in ultraperipheral isobaric collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the $\rho^{0}$ meson photoproduction in ultraperipheral isobaric collisions between $_{44}^{96}\textrm{Ru}+_{44}^{96}\textrm{Ru}$ and $_{40}^{96}\textrm{Zr}+_{40}^{96}\textrm{Zr}$ at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, employing the dipole model with the equivalent photon approximation. By implementing the Woods-Saxon distribution to represent the nuclear mass density, which is derived from density functional theory with an inclusion of nuclear deformation effects, we have calculated the transverse momentum $q_{T}$ spectra in isobaric collisions. We observe the characteristic dip behavior in these spectra, indicative of diffraction phenomena in high-energy physics. We notice that the deformation effects cause a nearly linear increase with $q_{T}^{2}$ for $q_{T}^{2}\lesssim0.015$ $\textrm{GeV}^{2}$, aligning with experimental observations. We offer a simple explanation for the observed behavior in these spectra by introducing the effective width of the nuclei in the thickness function. We also extend our discussion on the $\rho^{0}$ meson photoproduction with the targets $^{63}\textrm{Cu}$,$^{197}\textrm{Au}$, and $^{238}\textrm{U}$.</description>

      <title>Boosting probes of CP violation in the top Yukawa coupling with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise measurement of the top-Higgs coupling is crucial in particle physics, offering insights into potential new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) carrying CP Violation (CPV) effects. In this paper, we explore the CP properties of a Higgs boson coupling with a top quark pair, focusing on events where the Higgs state decays into a pair of $b$-quarks and the top-antitop system decays leptonically. The novelty of our analysis resides in the exploitation of two conditional Deep Learning (DL) networks: a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a Graph Convolution Network (GCN). These models are trained for selected CPV phase values and then used to interpolate all possible values ranging from $0 \text{ to } \pi/2$. This enables a comprehensive assessment of sensitivity across all CP phase values, thereby streamlining the process as the models are trained only once. Notably, the conditional GCN exhibits superior performance over the conditional MLP, owing to the nature of graph-based Neural Network (NN) structures. Our Machine Learning (ML) informed findings indicate that assessment of the CP properties of the Higgs coupling to the $t\bar{t}$ pair can be within reach of the HL-LHC, quantitatively surpassing the sensitivity of more traditional approaches.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Bell inequality violation in vector diboson systems produced in decays of spin-0 particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss entanglement and the violation of the CGLMP inequality in a system of two vector bosons produced in the decay of a spin-0 particle. We assume the most general CPT conserving, Lorentz-invariant coupling of the spin-0 particle with the daughter bosons. We compute the most general two-boson density matrix obtained by averaging over kinematical configurations with an appropriate probability distribution (which can be obtained when both bosons subsequently decay into fermion-antifermion). We show that the two-boson state is entangled and violates the CGLMP inequality for all values of the (anomalous) coupling constants and that in this case the state is entangled iff it can violate the CGLMP inequality. As an exemplary process of this kind we use the decay $H\to ZZ$ with anomalous coupling.</description>

      <title>The Phase Space Distance Between Collider Events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can one fully harness the power of physics encoded in relativistic $N$-body phase space? Topologically, phase space is isomorphic to the product space of a simplex and a hypersphere and can be equipped with explicit coordinates and a Riemannian metric. This natural structure that scaffolds the space on which all collider physics events live opens up new directions for machine learning applications and implementation. Here we present a detailed construction of the phase space manifold and its differential line element, identifying particle ordering prescriptions that ensure that the metric satisfies necessary properties. We apply the phase space metric to several binary classification tasks, including discrimination of high-multiplicity resonance decays or boosted hadronic decays of electroweak bosons from QCD processes, and demonstrate powerful performance on simulated data. Our work demonstrates the many benefits of promoting phase space from merely a background on which calculations take place to being geometrically entwined with a theory's dynamics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $X(3872)$ is investigated by employing the quark-hadron hybrid model, that consists of the $c\bar c$ core, $D^{(*)}\bar D{}^*$, $J/\psi\omega$, and $J/\psi\rho$ two-meson states. Due to the attraction from the $c\bar c$-$D\bar D{}^*$ coupling and from the OPEP tensor coupling, a very thin peak can appear at the $D^{0}\bar D{}^{*0}$ threshold. The energy of the corresponding pole of the scattering matrix is $E=(+0.06-0.14i)$ MeV, which is on the physical sheet and above the threshold, the same as the one of the poles from the LHCb data analysis.</description>

      <title>The neutrino force in neutrino backgrounds: Spin dependence and parity-violating effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutrino force results from the exchange of a pair of neutrinos. A neutrino background can significantly influence this force. In this work, we present a comprehensive calculation of the neutrino force in various neutrino backgrounds with spin dependence taken into account. In particular, we calculate the spin-independent and spin-dependent parity-conserving neutrino forces, in addition to the spin-dependent parity-violating neutrino forces with and without the presence of a neutrino background for both isotropic and anisotropic backgrounds. Compared with the vacuum case, the neutrino background can effectively violate Lorentz invariance and lead to additional parity-violating terms that are not suppressed by the velocity of external particles. We estimate the magnitude of the effect of atomic parity-violation experiments, and it turns out to be well below the current experimental sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Complementary Search of Fermionic Absorption Operators at Hadron Collider and Direct Detection Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instead of the energy recoil signal at direct detection experiments, dark matter appears always as missing energy at high energy colliders. For a fermionc dark matter coupled with quarks and neutrino via absorption operators, its production is always accompanied by an invisible neutrino. We study in details the mono-X (photon, jet, and $Z$) productions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). To make easy comparison between the collider and DM direct detection experiments, we start from the quark-level absorption operators for the first time. In other words, we study the model-independent constraints on a generic fermionic absorption dark fermion. In addition, the interplay and comparison with the possible detection at the neutrino experiment especially Borexino is also briefly discussed. We find that for both spin-dependent and spin-independent absorption of the dark matter, the experiments with light nuclear target can provide the strongest constraints.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Dark Sector of the Extended FNSM at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the possibility of having a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) Dark Matter (DM) candidate in the Froggatt-Nielsen Singlet Model (FNSM) wherein a direct connection exists between the DM mass and flavon symmetry-breaking scale. We find a considerable allowed region of parameter space for the ensuing pseudoscalar DM, which is dependent upon the flavon Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV) and Yukawa couplings, over which it may be possible to explain the fermion mass hierarchy. Finally, we choose a Benchmark Point (BP) and perform detailed collider analyses to probe this DM state in the context of Run 3 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Specifically, in this model, one obtains large missing transverse energy ($\slashed{E}_T$) when the DM particle is resonantly produced from the decay of a heavy Higgs field, along with multiple jets from Initial State Radiation (ISR). Thus, the ensuing $\slashed{E}_T$ + $n\, {\rm jets}~(n \geq 1)$ signature is an excellent probe of DM in this construct.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the electromagnetic and gravitational form factors as well as the corresponding generalized parton distributions of the electron using the Basis Light-front Quantization approach to QED. We compare our results with those from light-front perturbation theory. We adopt a novel basis with its scale depending on the constituents' longitudinal momentum fraction. We show that this basis improves convergence of the form factors with increasing basis dimension, compared to that calculated in the original basis with fixed scale. These results both validate the BLFQ approach and provide guidance for its efficient implementation in solving light-front Hamiltonian mass eigenstates for more complex systems in QED and QCD.</description>

      <title>Apparent fake neutrino mixture due to seesaw mechanism responsible for oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper assumes that neutrino flavor conversion is induced by right-handed neutrino mixture via seesaw mechanism, which leads to apparent fake neutrino mixture with neutrino mass eigenstate consistent with flavor state of left-handed neutrino rather than mixture of flavor state. The transition probability between right-handed neutrinos due to mixture can be explained well by boson intermediating flavor flip interaction between right-handed neutrinos and neutrino oscillation can be considered macro phenomenon before all flavor flip interactions arrive at balance.</description>

      <title>Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order Evolution of Polarized Parton Densities in the Larin Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many calculations involving polarized twist-2 parton densities to higher order in the strong coupling constant one uses the Larin scheme to describe chiral effects in dimensional regularization. Upon forming observables, the scheme dependence cancels. Still one needs a corresponding regularization scheme to compute the contributing building blocks, like massless and massive Wilson coefficients, as well as the massive 3-loop operator matrix elements used in the variable flavor number scheme. These are matched to the evolved parton distribution functions in the Larin scheme. Starting with suitable input distributions we provide the solution of scale evolution of the different polarized parton distribution functions in Bjorken $x$ space for a wide range of virtualities $Q^2$ in the Larin scheme, at next-to-leading, and to next-to-next-to-leading order for the first time. We also illustrate the deviation between the parton distributions in the Larin and $\overline{\rm MS}$ schemes numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of earth's gravity on neutral kaons oscillations is analyzed. The main effect of a Newtonian potential is to couple the strangeness oscillation and the strange quarks zitterbewegung. This coupling is responsible for the observed CP violations. Gravity induced CP violation is in fact a CPT violation with T conservation rather than a T violation with CPT conservation, but the finite lifetime of the short-lived kaons induces a rotation of the imaginary CPT parameter such that it becomes real and the effect is observed as a CP and T violation. Both indirect and direct violation parameters are predicted in agreement with the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Searching for signatures of new physics in $B \to K \, \nu \, \overline{\nu}$ to distinguish between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a model-independent analysis of the distinct signatures of various generic new physics possibilities in the decay $B \to K \, \nu \, \overline{\nu}$ by analyzing the branching ratio as well as the missing mass-square distribution. Considering the final neutrinos to be of the same flavor with non-zero mass, we discuss the new physics contributions for both Dirac and Majorana neutrino possibilities. In our study, we utilize the analytical relations among form factors in semi-leptonic $B \to K$ transitions, which are consistent with current lattice QCD predictions to a very high numerical accuracy. We provide constraints on different new physics parameters, taking into account the recent measurement of $B^+ \to K^+ \, \nu \, \overline{\nu}$ branching ratio by the Belle-II collaboration. In future, if the missing mass-square distribution for $B^+ \to K^+ \, \nu \, \overline{\nu}$ decay gets reported by Belle-II with analysis of more events than their present data set, one can not only investigate possible new physics effects in these decays, but also probe the Dirac/Majorana nature of the neutrinos using quantum statistics, since a difference between the two cases is known to exist in the presence of non-standard neutrino interactions.</description>

      <title>Memory Burden Effect in Black Holes and Solitons: Implications for PBH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The essence of the \textit{memory burden} effect is that a load of information carried by a system stabilizes it. This universal effect is especially prominent in systems with a high capacity of information storage, such as black holes and other objects with maximal microstate degeneracy, the entities universally referred to as \textit{saturons}. The phenomenon has several implications. The memory burden effect suppresses a further decay of a black hole, the latest, after it has emitted about half of its initial mass. As a consequence, the light primordial black holes (PBHs), that previously were assumed to be fully evaporated, are expected to be present as viable dark matter candidates. In the present paper, we deepen the understanding of the memory burden effect. We first identify various memory burden regimes in generic Hamiltonian systems and then establish a precise correspondence in solitons and in black holes. We make transparent, at a microscopic level, the fundamental differences between the stabilization by a quantum memory burden versus the stabilization by a long-range classical hair due to a spin or an electric charge. We identify certain new features of potential observational interest, such as the model-independent spread of the stabilized masses of initially degenerate PBHs.</description>

      <title>Near-threshold states in coupled $DD^{\ast}-D^{\ast}D^{\ast}$ scattering from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first determination of doubly-charmed isospin-0 coupled-channel $DD^\ast-D^\ast D^\ast$ scattering amplitudes from lattice QCD is presented. The finite-volume spectrum is computed for three lattice volumes with a light-quark mass corresponding to $m_\pi\approx 391$ MeV and is used to extract the scattering amplitudes in $J^P = 1^+$ via the L\"{u}scher quantization condition. By analytically continuing the scattering amplitudes to complex energies, a $T_{cc}$ pole corresponding to a virtual bound state is found below $DD^\ast$ threshold. We also find a second pole, $T_{cc}^\prime$, corresponding to a resonance pole below the kinematically closed $D^\ast D^\ast$ channel, to which it has a strong coupling. A non-zero coupling is robustly found between the $S$-wave $D D^\ast$ and $D^\ast D^\ast$ channels producing a clear cusp in the $D D^\ast$ amplitude at the $D^\ast D^\ast$ threshold energy. This suggests that the experimental $T_{cc}^\prime$ should be observable in $D D^\ast$ and $D^\ast D^\ast$ final states at ongoing experiments.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures of cogenesis from a burdened PBH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of explaining the observed dark matter (DM) relic abundance, along with matter-antimatter asymmetry, entirely from the evaporation of primordial black holes (PBH), beyond the semi-classical approximation. We find that, depending on the timing of modification to the semi-classical approximation and the efficiency of the backreaction, it is possible to produce the correct DM abundance for PBHs with masses $\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ g, whereas producing the right amount of baryon asymmetry requires light PBHs with masses $\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ g, satisfying bounds on the PBH mass from the Cosmic Microwave Background and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. However, in a simplistic scenario, achieving both {\it simultaneously} is not feasible, typically because of the stringent Lyman-$\alpha$ constraint on warm dark matter mass. We also demonstrate how induced gravitational waves from PBH density fluctuations can provide a window to test the memory-burden effects, thereby placing constraints on either the DM mass scale or the scale of leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Dual Inflation and Bounce Cosmologies Interpretation of Pulsar Timing Array Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the entire parameter space of a dual scenario that combines generalized inflation and bounce cosmologies. In this scenario, the redshift term of curvature perturbation are phenomenologically generalized to accommodate various model-building of inflation and bounce cosmologies. Performing a Bayesian analysis with data from NANOGrav 15-year, PPTA DR3, EPTA DR2, and IPTA DR2, we identify, for the first time, two groups of regions -- each comprising dual regions from inflation and bounce -- that can simultaneously explain stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) signals detected by pulsar timing arrays and produce scale-invariant curvature perturbations compatible with observations of CMB anisotropies. Bayes factor (BF) calculations indicate that this dual scenario is strongly favored by NG15 data with large BFs over other conventional astrophysical and cosmological sources, such as supermassive black hole binaries, cosmic strings, domain walls, first-order phase transitions, and scalar-induced gravitational waves. Our Bayesian analysis also provides initial evidence of a duality between inflation and bounce cosmologies regarding SGWB. These results offer new insights for model-building in the early universe's inflation or bounce phases and highlight parameter regions that can be probed by current and future CMB observations and gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Vavilov-\v{C}erenkov radiation for parallel motion in three-dimensional topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our study delves into the modifications observed in Vavilov-\v{C}erenkov radiation when its generating charged particle moves parallel to an interface formed by two generic magnetoelectric media, focusing on topological insulators. We compute the electromagnetic field through the Green's function. Applying the far-field approximation and the steepest descent method, we derive analytical expressions for the electric field, revealing contributions from spherical and lateral waves with topological origins. Subsequently, we analyze the angular distribution of the radiation, particularly focusing on parallel motions in close proximity to the interface. Our findings indicate that the radiation along the Vavilov-\v{C}erenkov cone is inhomogeneous and asymmetric. We analyze the radiated energy at both sides of the interface. Finally, we discuss the particle's retarding force, which is notably enhanced in the ultrarelativistic regime. We illustrate these results for the topological insulator TlBiSe$_2$ and the magnetoelectric TbPO$_4$.</description>

      <title>Localization of $q$-form field on squared curvature gravity domain wall brane coupling with gravity and background scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a $q$-form field, represented as $\displaystyle X_{M_1M_2...M_q}$, where $\displaystyle q$ indicates the number of indices, with special cases $\displaystyle q = 0, 1, 2$ corresponding to the scalar fields, vector fields, and Kalb-Ramond fields, respectively. Unlike the duality observed between scalar and vector fields in four-dimensional spacetime, $q$-form fields in higher dimensions correspond to a wider array of particles. We propose a novel localized Kaluza-Klein decomposition approach for the $q$-form field in a five-dimensional spacetime, considering its coupling with gravity and background scalar fields. This methodology enables the successful localization of the $q$-form field on a domain wall brane, leading to the derivation of zero modes, Schr\"{o}dinger-like equations, and a four-dimensional effective action. Additionally, in order to stand for the coupling of the $q$-form field with gravity and scalar fields of the background spacetime, we propose a new coupling function $F(R,\varphi)$. Our analysis highlights the significance of the parameters $\displaystyle C_2$ and $\displaystyle t$ in the localization process.</description>

      <title>Monte-Carlo Study Of Higher-Order Cumulants of Net-Particle Distributions in $p+p$ Collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement of higher order cumulants of the distributions of conserved quantities, like net-charge, net-baryon and net-strangeness in heavy-ion collisions, is proposed as a sensitive tool to determine the freeze-out parameters and the nature of phase transitions at the LHC energies. Baseline measurements for heavy-ion collisions are essential to understand the experimental measurements. Recently, several experimental observations have shown some QGP-like scenarios in small systems (pp collisions). We report the first Monte-Carlo study of the measurements of cumulants and their ratios for net-charge, net-hadron, net-kaon, net-baryon, and net-proton distributions in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV using pQCD models like Pythia8 and Herwig. We also discuss the effect of different particle production mechanisms on the higher-order cumulants. This simulation study will serve as a baseline for future measurements at the LHC. Furthermore, it will shed more light on the measurement of cumulants and the connection between small systems and heavy-ion collisions at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Bounding Dark Energy from the SPARC rotation curves: Data driven probe for galaxy virialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark Energy (DE) acts as a repulsive force that opposes gravitational attraction. Assuming galaxies maintain a steady state over extended periods, the estimated upper bound on DE studies its resistance to the attractive gravitational force from dark matter. Using the SPARC dataset, we fit the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and Hernquist models to identify the most suitable galaxies for these models. Introducing the presence of DE in these galaxies helps establish the upper limit on its repulsive force. This upper bound on DE sits around $\rho_{\left(&lt;\Lambda\right)} \sim 10^{-25}$~kg/m$^3$, only two orders of magnitude higher than the one measured by Planck. We discuss the conditions for detecting DE in different systems and show the consistency of the upper bound from galaxies to other systems. The upper bound is of the same order of magnitude as $\rho_{200} = 200 \rho_c$ for both dark matter profiles. We also address the implications for future measurements on that upper bound and the condition for detecting the impact of $\Lambda$ on galactic scales.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of false vacuum decay in arbitrary dimensions, in the presence of gravity, and compute the transition probability within the thin-wall approximation, generalising the results of Coleman and de Luccia. In the particular case of one compact dimension, we present explicit formulae for the Euclidean Bounce configuration that drives the transition from a de Sitter to Minkowski or from a Minkowski to anti-de Sitter vacua.</description>

      <title>Searching for Long Lived Particles at LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Search for BSM phenomena is one of the fundamental goals of the LHC experiments. Many BSM models foresee long-lived particles which decay far from the production vertex and a big effort has been done by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations to detect these long-lived particles. A widely studied example for such searches is made through the measurement of displaced vertices produced by a narrow resonance decaying to a muon pair. This paper will first analyze what has been done so far and will try to evaluate if there are improvements which may allow enhancing the discovery potential at LHC for such particles. The outcome of this analysis is that while long-lived particles decaying very far from the primary vertex have been carefully studied by ATLAS and CMS, the region within a few millimeters from the primary vertex may have been partially neglected. A new approach for searching such resonances, fully based on data, will then be proposed which allows minimizing systematic uncertainties while keeping at a maximum the discovery potentiality for long-lived neutral resonances which decay a few millimeters from the primary vertex.</description>

      <title>A universal constraint on axion non-Abelian dynamics during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflationary models equipped with Chern-Simons coupling between their axion and gauge sectors exhibit an array of interesting signals including a testable chiral gravitational wave spectrum. The energy injection in the gauge sector triggered by the rolling axion leads to a well-studied enhancement of gauge field fluctuations. These may in turn affect observables such as the scalar and tensor spectra and also account for non-linear corrections to field propagators. In this work, we focus on non-Abelian gauge sectors. We show that gauge field self-interactions and axion-gauge field non-linear couplings significantly renormalize the gauge field mode function. Operating within the regime of validity of the perturbative treatment places strong constraints on the accessible parameter space of this class of models. We calculate corrections to the gauge field propagator that are universally present in these scenarios. Enforcing perturbativity on such propagators leads to bounds that are competitive with those stemming from analytical estimates on the onset of the strong backreaction regime.</description>

      <title>VBFNLO: A parton level Monte Carlo for processes with electroweak bosons -- Manual for Version 3.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.4038</link>
      <description>arXiv:1107.4038v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: VBFNLO is a flexible parton level Monte Carlo program for the simulation of vector boson fusion (VBF), QCD-induced single and double vector boson production plus two jets, and double and triple vector boson production (plus jet) in hadronic collisions at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the strong coupling constant, as well as Higgs boson plus two jet production via gluon fusion at the one-loop level. For the new version -- Version 3.0 -- several major enhancements have been included. An interface according to the Binoth Les Houches Accord (BLHA) has been added for all VBF and di/tri-boson processes including fully leptonic decays. For all dimension-8 operators affecting vector boson scattering (VBS) processes, a modified T-matrix unitarization procedure has been implemented. Several new production processes have been added, namely the VBS $Z\gamma jj$ and $\gamma \gamma jj$ processes at NLO, $\gamma \gamma jj $, $WWj$ and $ZZj$ production at NLO including the loop-induced gluon-fusion contributions and the gluon-fusion one-loop induced $\Phi jjj$ ($\Phi$ is a CP-even or CP-odd scalar boson) process at LO, retaining the full top-mass dependence. Finally, the code has been parallelized using OpenMPI.</description>

Abstract: Entropy or information is a fundamental quantity contained in a system in statistical mechanics and information theory. In this paper, a definition of classical information entropy of parton distribution functions is suggested. The extensive and supper-additive properties of the defined entropy are discussed. The concavity is also deduced for the defined entropy. As an example, the classical information entropy of the gluon distribution of the proton is presented. There are some particular features of the evolution of the information entropy in the saturating domain, which could be used in finding the signals of gluon saturation.</description>

      <title>Addressing Six Standard Model Problems with Technically Natural Higgs Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to study the potential of the recently proposed model framework, called Technically Natural Higgs (TNH), in addressing six fundamental problems in particle physics and cosmology. These questions encompass the electroweak (EW) naturalness problem, neutrino mass generation, nature of the inflaton, the matter-antimatter asymmetry problem, origin of dark matter (DM) and the strong CP problem. We investigate various solutions within the TNH framework for three inflation scenarios $ - $ Higgs, Starobinsky and scale-independent inflation. In the minimal TNH model, the Higgs is a mixture of an elementary and a composite state, with a compositeness scale far exceeding the EW scale. Traditionally, this has required an unnatural small vacuum misalignment, but in the TNH framework a novel mechanism enables a technically natural large compositeness scale, even up to the Planck scale. In this model framework, we demonstrate that a scale-invariant version of the minimal TNH model, featuring a special energy scale of around $ \mathcal{O}(10^{12}) $ GeV, loop-induced by the inflaton, simultaneously yields a technically natural 125-GeV Higgs boson, scotogenic neutrinos, a scale-invariant inflaton and a QCD axion DM candidate. These components dynamically generate the Planck scale and collectively have the potential to address all six open questions.</description>

      <title>Confronting Dark Matter Freeze-In during Reheating with Constraints from Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the production of particle Dark Matter (DM) in a minimal freeze-in model considering a non-instantaneous reheating phase after inflation. We demonstrate that for low reheating temperatures, bosonic or fermionic reheating from monomial potentials can lead to a different evolution in the DM production and hence to distinct predictions for the parent particle lifetime and mass, constrained by long-lived particle (LLP) searches. We highlight that such scenario predicts parent particle decay lengths larger compared to using the instantaneous reheating approximation. Moreover, we demonstrate the importance of an accurate definition of the reheating temperature and emphasize its relevance for the correct interpretation of experimental constraints. We explore different models of inflation, which can lead to the considered reheating potential. We find that the extent to which the standard DM freeze-in production can be modified crucially depends on the underlying inflationary model. Based on the latest CMB constraints, we derive lower limits on the decay length of the parent particle and confront these results with the corresponding reach of LLP searches. Our findings underscore the impact of the specific dynamics of inflation on DM freeze-in production and highlight their importance for the interpretation of collider signatures. At the same time, our results indicate the potential for LLP searches to shed light on the underlying dynamics of reheating.</description>

Abstract: We discuss entanglement and violation of Bell-type inequalities for a system of two $Z$ bosons produced in Higgs decays. We take into account beyond the Standard Model (anomalous) coupling between $H$ and daughter bosons but we limit ourselves to an overall scalar $ZZ$ state (we exclude the possibility that $H$ contains a pseudo-scalar component). In particular we consider the case when each $Z$ decays further into fermion-antifermion pair. We find that a $ZZ$ state is entangled and violates the CGLMP inequality for all values of the (anomalous) coupling constant.</description>

      <title>When a complementarity in the neutrino and the quark mixing meets a parameter symmetry and its implications to the unitarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a self-complementarity that complements relationship among the parameters in the neutrino and the quark mixing matrix and address its implications to the unitarity of the quark mixing matrix and the mixing between the neutrino and the quark sector. First, we show how a complementarity with a phase being introduced as an extra parameter can be held in the nine independent schemes of parameterizing the matrix introducing a discrete parameter symmetry and a combination of sine functions, a part of Jarlskog invariant, with a certain size of uncertainty and use them. After that, for the first time, we show that we can use the uncertainty associated with the complementarity as an empirical constraint complementing that among the diagonal elements in the neutrino mixing matrix and our result shows one that is comparable to that was reported before. We do the same for the quark sector and then we discuss its implication in relation to the size of the uncertainty among the elements. Our study indicates that we may need to be more cautious when testing for the unitarity of the quark mixing matrix and opens up a possibility of estimating the size of mixing between the two sectors.</description>

      <title>Pair Production in time-dependent Electric field at Finite times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the finite-time behavior of pair production from the vacuum by a time-dependent Sauter pulsed electric field using the spinor quantum electrodynamics (QED). In the adiabatic basis, the one-particle distribution function in momentum space is determined by utilizing the exact analytical solution of the Dirac equation. By examining the temporal behavior of the one-particle distribution function and the momentum spectrum of created pairs in the sub-critical field limit $(E_0 = 0.2E_c)$, we observe oscillatory patterns in the longitudinal momentum spectrum(LMS) of particles at finite times. These oscillations arise due to quantum interference effects resulting from the dynamical tunneling. Furthermore, we derive an approximate and simplified analytical expression for the distribution function at finite times, which allows us to explain the origin and behavior of these oscillations. Additionally, we discuss the role of the vacuum polarization function and its counter term to the oscillations in LMS vacuum excitation.

      <title>One-loop correction contributions in the decoupling limit of generalized Yukawa model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the generalized Yukawa model consisting of two Dirac fermions and two scalar fields. One of the scalars is assumed to be much heavier than the other particles, so it decouples at low energies. Low-energy effective Lagrangian (EL) of the model is derived. It describes the contributions of the heavy scalar into observables in the limit when this particle is decoupled. We consider the cross-sections of $s$- and $t$-channel processes, obtained within the complete model and its low-energy approximation. The contributions of the one-loop corrections in the cross-sections coming from light particles are analyzed. These are corrections to the parameters of the heavy boson and the contributions of the one-loop mixing of light and heavy scalars. We identify the ranges of Yukawa's couplings where the corrections are significant. We find that if the interaction between fermions and either light or heavy scalar is strong enough, the derived EL could not be applied for the description of the analyzed cross-sections even if the heavy scalar decouples. Implications of our results in searching for new particles beyond the Standard model are discussed.</description>

      <title>The flavor of a minimal composite $S_1$ leptoquark and the $b\to c\tau\bar\nu$ anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several experiments have measured a deviation in $B\to D^{(*)}$ semileptonic decays, that point to new physics at the TeV scale violating lepton flavor universality. A scalar leptoquark $S_1$, with a suitable structure of couplings in flavor space, is known to be able to solve this anomaly modifying $b\to c\tau\bar\nu$. In the context of composite Higgs models, we consider a theory containing $H$ and $S_1$ as Nambu-Goldstone bosons (NGBs) of a new strongly interacting sector, with ordinary resonances at a scale ${\cal O}(10)$ TeV. Assuming anarchic partial compositeness of the Standard Model (SM) fermions we calculate the potential of the NGBs that is dominated by the fermions of the third generation, we compute $R_{D^{(*)}}$ and estimate the corrections to flavor observables by the presence of $S_1$. We find that the SM spectrum and $m_{S_1}\sim$ TeV can be obtained with a NGB decay constant of order $\sim 5$ TeV. We obtain a robust correlation between the main corrections to $R_{D^{(*)}}$, $B_{K^{(*)}\nu\nu}$ and $g_\tau/g_\mu$, that leads to a sever bound on $R_{D^{(*)}}$, roughly $2\sigma$ below the experimental value. Besides the bounds on the flavor observables $g_\tau^W$, BR$(\tau\to\mu\gamma)$ and $\Delta m_{B_s}$ are saturated, with the first one requiring a coupling between resonances $g_*\lesssim 2$, whereas the second one demands $m_{S_1}\gtrsim 1.7$ TeV, up to corrections of ${\cal O}(1)$.</description>

      <title>Bridging the $ \mu $Hz gap in the gravitational-wave landscape: unveiling dark baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study gravitational waves (GWs) with frequencies in the $\mu$Hz range, which arise from phase transitions related to dark confinement in the context of dark versions of Quantum Chromodynamics. Based on several compelling motivations, we posit that these theories predict the existence of GeV-mass asymmetric dark baryons, akin to ordinary baryons, with the potential to contribute to dark matter. Furthermore, we emphasize the significance of a particular $\mathcal{O}(\text{TeV})$ scale for multiple reasons. First, to account for the similarity in present-day mass densities between dark matter and visible matter, various TeV-scale mechanisms can elucidate the similarities in both their number densities and masses. Moreover, to address the so-called electroweak hierarchy problem, we consider the introduction of either the Composite Higgs or Supersymmetry at around $\mathcal{O}(\text{TeV})$. These mechanisms lead to intriguing TeV collider signatures and the possibility of detecting mHz GWs in future experiments. In summary, this study provides a strong motivation for advancing GW experiments that can bridge the $\mu$Hz frequency gap in the GW spectrum. Additionally, there is a need for the construction of more powerful particle colliders to explore higher energy regimes. In consideration of the possibility to scrutinize these models from various perspectives, we strongly advocate their further development.</description>

      <title>From Optimal Observables to Machine Learning: an Effective-Field-Theory Analysis of $e^+e^- \to W^+W^-$ at Future Lepton Colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply machine-learning techniques to the effective-field-theory analysis of the $e^+e^- \to W^+W^-$ processes at future lepton colliders, and demonstrate their advantages in comparison with conventional methods, such as optimal observables. In particular, we show that machine-learning methods are more robust to detector effects and backgrounds, and could in principle produce unbiased results with sufficient Monte Carlo simulation samples that accurately describe experiments. This is crucial for the analyses at future lepton colliders given the outstanding precision of the $e^+e^- \to W^+W^-$ measurement ($\sim 10^{-4}$ in terms of anomalous triple gauge couplings or even better) that can be reached. Our framework can be generalized to other effective-field-theory analyses, such as the one of $e^+e^- \to t\bar{t}$ or similar processes at muon colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a succinct formulation of the energy-momentum tensor of the Glasma characterizing the initial color fields in relativistic heavy-ion collisions in the Color Glass Condensate effective theory. We derive concise expressions for the (3+1)D dynamical evolution of symmetric nuclear collisions in the weak field approximation employing a generalized McLerran-Venugopalan model with non-trivial longitudinal correlations. Utilizing Monte Carlo integration, we calculate in unprecedented detail non-trivial rapidity profiles of early-time observables at RHIC and LHC energies, including transverse energy densities and eccentricities. For our setup with broken boost invariance, we carefully discuss the placement of the origin of the Milne frame and interpret the components of the energy-momentum tensor. We find longitudinal flow that deviates from standard Bjorken flow in the (3+1)D case and provide a geometric interpretation of this effect. Furthermore, we observe a universal shape in the flanks of the rapidity profiles regardless of collision energy and predict that limiting fragmentation should also hold at LHC energies.</description>

Abstract: We present the gluon distribution functions of pion and kaon in small-$x$ and large-$x$ regions, and compare them with the results obtained from lattice QCD and continuum Schwinger function methods. Whether in the small-$x$ region or the large-$x$ region, our gluon distribution of pion is consistent with the results of lattice QCD and continuum Schwinger function method. In addition, the first four moments of gluon distributions of pion and kaon at different $Q^{2}$ scales are calculated. Furthermore, we present the mass decompositions of pion and kaon with the dynamical parton distribution functions calculated by the DGLAP equation with parton-parton recombination corrections. The mass structures of pion and kaon are totally different from that of the proton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10265v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of the dynamics of QCD have been limited by the complexities of mapping the continuous gauge fields onto quantum computers. By parametrizing the gauge invariant Hilbert space in terms of plaquette degrees of freedom, we show how the Hilbert space and interactions can be expanded in inverse powers of N_c. At leading order in this expansion, the Hamiltonian simplifies dramatically, both in the required size of the Hilbert space as well as the type of interactions involved. Adding a truncation of the resulting Hilbert space in terms of local energy states we give explicit constructions that allow simple representations of SU(3) gauge fields on qubits and qutrits. This formulation allows a simulation of the real time dynamics of a SU(3) lattice gauge theory on a 5x5 and 8x8 lattice on ibm_torino with a CNOT depth of 113.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stimulated by the observation of a new structure, named $\Lambda_{c}(2910)$, in the $\Sigma_{c}(2455)^{0,++}\pi^{+,-}$ decay channel from B meson decay process by the Belle Collaboration, and the similarity of the $\Lambda_{c}(2910)/\Lambda_{c}(2940)$ and $P_{c}$ states, we investigate the decay behavior of the $\Lambda_{c}(2910)$ and $\Lambda_{c}(2940)$ in the $N D^{*}$ molecular frame with the possible $J^{P}$ quantum numbers to be $1/2^{-}$ and $3/2^{-}$. We employ an effective Lagrangian approach to evaluate the partial widths of $ND$, $\Sigma_{c}\pi$ and $\Sigma_{c}^{*}\pi$ channels. The estimations in the present work indicate that the $J^P$ quantum numbers of $\Lambda_{c}(2910)$ and $\Lambda_{c}(2940)$ are preferred to be $1/2^{-}$ and $3/2^{-}$, respectively. From the present estimations, we also find the branching ratio of $\Lambda_c(3/2) \to \Sigma_c^\ast \pi$ is much larger than that of $\Lambda_c(1/2) \to \Sigma_c^\ast \pi$, thus $\Sigma_{c}^{*}\pi$ could be a good channel to distinguish the $J^{P}$ quantum numbers of $\Lambda_{c}(2910)$ and $\Lambda_{c}(2940)$. Therefore, we suggest to searching for the structure in $\Sigma_{c}^{*}\pi$ invariant mass distribution in Belle $\amalg$.</description>

Abstract: We study the triply heavy spin-1/2 baryons with quark contents $ ccb $ and $ bbc $, and calculate their mass and residue using QCD sum rules. In the calculations, we consider the ground (1S), first orbitally excited (1P) and first radially excited (2S) states. Aiming to achieve higher accuracies in the results, we perform the computations by taking into account the non-perturbative operators up to eight mass dimensions. We compare our results with the predictions of other theoretical studies existing in the literature. The obtained results may help experimental groups in their search for these yet unseen, but previously predicted by the quark model, interesting particles.</description>

      <title>Ghost-gluon vertex in the presence of the Gribov horizon: General kinematics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlation functions are important probes for the behavior of quantum field theories. Already at tree-level, the Refined Gribov Zwanziger (RGZ) effective action for Yang-Mills theories provides a good approximation for the gluon propagator, as compared to that calculated by nonperturbative methods such as Lattice Field Theory and Dyson-Schwinger Equations. However, the study of higher correlation functions of the RGZ theory is still at its beginning. In this work we evaluate the ghost-antighost-gluon vertex function in Landau gauge at one-loop level, in $d=4$ space-time dimensions for the gauge groups SU(2) and SU(3). More precisely, we extend the analysis conducted in [1] for the soft-gluon limit to an arbitrary kinematic configuration. We introduce renormalization group effects by means of a toy model for the running coupling and investigate the impact of such a model in the ultraviolet tails of our results. We find that RGZ results match fairly closely those from lattice simulations, Schwinger-Dyson equations and the Curci-Ferrari model for three different kinematic configurations. This is compatible with RGZ being a feasible theory for the strong interaction in the infrared regime.</description>

      <title>Nucleons and vector mesons in a confining holographic QCD model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple holographic QCD model that provides a unified description of vector mesons and nucleons in a confining background based on Einstein-dilaton gravity. For the confining background we consider analytical solutions of the Einstein-dilaton equations where the dilaton is a quadratic function of the radial coordinate far from the boundary. We build actions for the 5d gauge field and the 5d Dirac field dual to the 4d flavor current and the 4d nucleon interpolator respectively. In order to obtain asymptotically linear Regge trajectories we impose for each sector the condition that the effective Schr\"odinger equation has a potential that grows quadratically in the radial coordinate far from the boundary. For the vector mesons we show that this condition is automatically satisfied by a 5d Yang-Mills action minimally coupled to the metric and the dilaton. For the nucleons we find that the mass term of the 5d Dirac action needs to be generalised to include couplings to the metric and the dilaton. Using Sturm-Liouville theory we obtain a spectral decomposition for the hadronic correlators consistent with large $N_c$ QCD. Our setup contains only three parameters: the mass scale associated with confinement, the 5d gauge coupling and the 5d Dirac coupling. The last two are completely fixed by matching the correlators at high energies to perturbative QCD. We calculate masses and decay constants and compare our results against available experimental data. Our model can be thought of as a consistent embedding of soft wall models in Einstein-dilaton gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Sun may capture asymmetric dark matter (DM), which can subsequently form bound-states through the radiative emission of a sub-GeV scalar. This process enables generation of scalars without requiring DM annihilation. In addition to DM capture on nucleons, the DM-scalar coupling responsible for bound-state formation also induces capture from self-scatterings of ambient DM particles with DM particles already captured, as well as with DM bound-states formed in-situ within the Sun. This scenario is studied in detail by solving Boltzmann equations numerically and analytically. In particular, we take into consideration that the DM self-capture rates require a treatment beyond the conventional Born approximation. We show that, thanks to DM scatterings on bound-states, the number of DM particles captured increases exponentially, leading to enhanced emission of relativistic scalars through bound-state formation, whose final decay products could be observable. We explore phenomenological signatures with the example that the scalar mediator decays to neutrinos. We find that the neutrino flux emitted can be comparable to atmospheric neutrino fluxes within the range of energies below one hundred MeV. Future facilities like Hyper-K, and direct DM detection experiments can further test such scenario.</description>

Abstract: In this study, 24.5 TeV CoM energy FCC-$\mu p$ and 20.2 TeV CoM energy SPPC-$\mu p$ muon-proton colliders have been utilized to explore the anomalous $ZZ\gamma$ and $Z\gamma\gamma$ couplings corresponding to dim-8 operators through the process of $\mu^- \gamma \to Z l^{-} \to l^{-} \tilde{\nu_{l}} \nu_{l}$. A cut-based method has been applied to enhance the signal background ratio in the analysis. Coupling limits, at a 95\% Confidence Level (C.L.), under the systematic uncertainties of 0\%, 3\%, and 5\%, were obtained with luminosities of ${\cal L}_{int}=5$ and 42.8 fb$^{-1}$ for FCC-$\mu p$ and SPPC-$\mu p$ colliders, respectively. The limits for anomalous $C_{BB}/\Lambda^{4}$, $C_{\tilde{B}W}/\Lambda^{4}$, $C_{WW}/\Lambda^{4}$, $C_{BW}/\Lambda^{4}$ couplings without systematic uncertainty for FCC-$\mu p$ and SPPC-$\mu p$ were found as follows, respectively: [0.06845; 0.070019967] TeV-4, [-0.18662; 0.18422] TeV-4, [-0.23623; 0.23815] TeV-4, [-0.61912; 0.62072] TeV-4, and [-0.06606; 0.05050] TeV-4, [-0.15791; 0.15126] TeV-4, [-0.20663; 0.19155] TeV-4, [-0.51383; 0.52211] TeV-4.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims to develop second-order relativistic viscous magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) derived from kinetic theory within an extended relaxation time approximation (momentum/energy dependent) for the collision kernel. The investigation involves a detailed examination of shear stress tensor evolution equations and associated transport coefficients. The Boltzmann equation is solved using a Chapman-Enskog-like gradient expansion for a charge-conserved conformal system, incorporating a momentum-dependent relaxation time. The derived relativistic non-resistive, viscous second-order MHD equations for the shear stress tensor reveal significant modifications in the coupling with dissipative charge current and magnetic field due to the momentum dependence of the relaxation time. By utilizing a power law parametrization to quantify the momentum dependence of the relaxation time, the anisotropic magnetic field-dependent shear coefficients in the Navier-Stokes limit have been investigated. The resulting viscous coefficients are seen to be sensitive to the momentum dependence of the relaxation time.</description>

      <title>Calculation of the total 10-th order QED contribution to the electron magnetic moment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The total 5-loop quantum electrodynamics universal contribution to the anomalous magnetic moments of the leptons was calculated by the author. The obtained value $A_1^{(10)}=5.891(61)$ provides the first complete verification of the previously known value obtained by T. Aoyama, M. Hayakawa, T. Kinoshita, M. Nio (AHKN). The discrepancy is $5 \sigma$. The computation includes the recalculation of the part that the author calculated in 2019 using a slightly different method and the calculation of the remaining part of the coefficient. A comparison with the AHKN values in 32 gauge-invariant classes is provided. In addition, the results are divided into 95 small gauge-invariant classes that subdivide the former ones. Such a detailzation is provided for the first time. The method described in previous works of the author was used in general. However, the Monte Carlo integration method is new and is described in detail. Some useful technical information and information on numerical cancellations is also given.</description>

      <title>Total Gluon Helicity from Lattice without Effective Theory Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose two approaches for extracting the total gluon helicity contribution to proton spin from lattice QCD, one from local operator matrix elements in a fixed gauge accessible on lattice with feasible renormalization, and the other from gauge-invariant nonlocal gluon correlators. Neither of these approaches requires a matching procedure when converted to the MS scheme. Our proposal resolves a long-standing inconsistency in the literature regarding lattice calculations of the total gluon helicity, and has the potential to greatly facilitate these calculations.</description>

Abstract: We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for order-2 $CP$ ($CP2$) symmetry in $N$-Higgs-doublet potentials for $N&gt;2$. The conditions, which are formulated as relations between vectors that transform under the adjoint representation of $\mathsf{SU}(N)$ under a change of doublet basis, are representation theoretical in nature. Making use of Lie algebra and representation theory we devise an efficient, computable algorithm which may be applied to decide whether or not a given numerical potential is $CP2$ invariant.</description>

      <title>Release Note -- VBFNLO 3.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: VBFNLO is a flexible parton level Monte Carlo program for the simulation of vector boson fusion (VBF), QCD-induced single and double vector boson production plus two jets, and double and triple vector boson production (plus jet) in hadronic collisions at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the strong coupling constant, as well as Higgs boson plus two and three jet production via gluon fusion at the one-loop level. For the new version -- Version 3.0 -- several major enhancements have been included. An interface according to the Binoth Les Houches Accord (BLHA) has been added for all VBF and di/tri-boson processes including fully leptonic decays. For all dimension-8 operators affecting vector boson scattering (VBS) processes, a modified T-matrix unitarization procedure has been implemented. Several new production processes have been added, namely the VBS $Z\gamma jj$ and $\gamma \gamma jj$ processes at NLO, $\gamma \gamma jj $, $WWj$ and $ZZj$ production at NLO including the loop-induced gluon-fusion contributions and the gluon-fusion one-loop induced $\Phi jjj$ ($\Phi$ is a CP-even or CP-odd scalar boson) process at LO, retaining the full top-mass dependence. Finally, the code has been parallelized using OpenMPI.</description>

      <title>Pole structure of $P_\psi^N(4312)^+$ via machine learning and uniformized S-matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We probed the pole structure of the $P_\psi^{N}(4312)^{+}$ using a trained deep neural network. The training dataset was generated using uniformized independent S-matrix poles to ensure that the obtained interpretation is as model-independent as possible. To prevent possible ambiguity in the interpretation of the pole structure, we included the contribution from the off-diagonal element of the S-matrix. Five out of the six neural networks we trained favor $P_\psi^{N}(4312)^{+}$ as possibly having a three-pole structure, with one pole on each of the unphysical sheets - a first in its report. The two poles can be associated to a pole-shadow pair which is a characteristic of a true resonance. On the other hand, the last pole is most likely associated with the coupled-channel effect. The combined effect of these poles produced a peak below the $\Sigma^{+}_C\bar{D}^0$ which mimic the line shape of a hadronic molecule.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.01169v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a formalism to extract triple crossing symmetric positivity bounds for effective field theories with multiple degrees of freedom, by making use of $su$ symmetric dispersion relations supplemented with positivity of the partial waves, $st$ null constraints and the generalized optical theorem. This generalizes the convex cone approach to constrain the $s^2$ coefficient space to higher orders. Optimal positive bounds can be extracted by semi-definite programs with a continuous decision variable, compared with linear programs for the case of a single field. As an example, we explicitly compute the positivity constraints on bi-scalar theories, and find all the Wilson coefficients can be constrained in a finite region, including the coefficients with odd powers of $s$, which are absent in the single scalar case.</description>

Abstract: We present comparisons to experimental data along with predictions of observables for U+U collisions at 193 GeV using a multistage theoretical and computational framework consisting of boost-invariant IP-Glasma initial state, MUSIC hydrodynamics, and a hadronic transport cascade generated by iS3D \&amp; SMASH. Our results show great agreement with existing anisotropic flow measurements from RHIC [ arXiv:1505.07812 ; arXiv:1901.08155 ] . We provide predictions for differential flow observables as well as multiparticle correlations and transverse-momentum-flow correlations. When possible, we compare our predictions to results from Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV to properly outline the effects of deformation in the initial state on final state observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice-QCD result for the Zemach and Friar radii of the proton and neutron. Our calculation includes both quark-connected and -disconnected diagrams and assesses all sources of systematic uncertainties arising from excited-state contributions, finite-volume effects and the continuum extrapolation. At the physical point, we obtain for the proton $r_Z^p = ( 1.013 \pm 0.010\ (\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.012\ (\mathrm{syst}) )~\mathrm{fm}$ and $r_F^p = ( 1.301 \pm 0.012\ (\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.014\ (\mathrm{syst}) )~\mathrm{fm}$. These numbers suggest small values of the Zemach and Friar radii of the proton, but are compatible with most of the experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Expanding neutrino oscillation parameter measurements in NOvA using a Bayesian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07835v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: NOvA is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment that measures oscillations in charged-current $\nu_{\mu} \rightarrow \nu_{\mu}$ (disappearance) and $\nu_{\mu} \rightarrow \nu_{e}$ (appearance) channels, and their antineutrino counterparts, using neutrinos of energies around 2 GeV over a distance of 810 km. In this work we reanalyze the dataset first examined in our previous paper [Phys. Rev. D 106, 032004 (2022)] using an alternative statistical approach based on Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo. We measure oscillation parameters consistent with the previous results. We also extend our inferences to include the first NOvA measurements of the reactor mixing angle $\theta_{13}$ and the Jarlskog invariant. We use these results to quantify the strength of our inferences about CP violation, as well as to examine the effects of constraints from short-baseline measurements of $\theta_{13}$ using antineutrinos from nuclear reactors when making NOvA measurements of $\theta_{23}$. Our long-baseline measurement of $\theta_{13}$ is also shown to be consistent with the reactor measurements, supporting the general applicability and robustness of the PMNS framework for neutrino oscillations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave constraints on scalar-tensor gravity from a neutron star and black-hole binary GW200115</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In nonminimally coupled theories where a scalar field is coupled to the Ricci scalar, neutron stars (NSs) can have scalar charges through an interaction with matter mediated by gravity. On the other hand, the same theories do not give rise to hairy black hole (BH) solutions. The observations of gravitational waves (GWs) emitted from an inspiralling NS-BH binary system allows a possibility of constraining the NS scalar charge. Moreover, the nonminimally coupled scalar-tensor theories generate a breathing scalar mode besides two tensor polarizations. Using the GW200115 data of the coalescence of a BH-NS binary, we place observational constraints on the NS scalar charge as well as the nonminimal coupling strength for a subclass of massless Horndeski theories with a luminal GW propagation. Unlike past related works, we exploit a waveform for a mixture of tensor and scalar polarizations. Taking the breathing mode into account, the scalar charge is more tightly constrained in comparison to the analysis of the tensor GWs alone. In nonminimally coupled theories including Brans-Dicke gravity and spontaneous scalarization scenarios with/without a kinetic screening, we put new bounds on model parameters of each theory.</description>

Abstract: We consider antisymmetric Metric-Affine Theories of Gravity with a Lagrangian containing the most general terms up to dimension four and search for theories that are ghost- and tachyon-free when expanded around flat space. We find new examples that propagate only the graviton and one other massive degree of freedom of spin zero, one or two. These models require terms of the form $(\nabla T)^2$ in the Lagrangian, that have been largely ignored in the literature.</description>

      <title>Higgs-Confinement Transitions in QCD from Symmetry Protected Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In gauge theories with fundamental matter there is typically no sharp way to distinguish confining and Higgs regimes, e.g. using generalized global symmetries acting on loop order parameters. It is standard lore that these two regimes are continuously connected, as has been explicitly demonstrated in certain lattice and continuum models. We point out that Higgsing and confinement sometimes lead to distinct symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases -- necessarily separated by a phase transition -- for ordinary global symmetries. We present explicit examples in 3+1 dimensions, obtained by adding elementary Higgs fields and Yukawa couplings to QCD while preserving parity P and time reversal T. In a suitable scheme, the confining phases of these theories are trivial SPTs, while their Higgs phases are characterized by non-trivial P- and T-invariant theta-angles $\theta_f, \theta_g = \pi$ for flavor or gravity background gauge fields, i.e. they are topological insulators or superconductors. Finally, we consider conventional three-flavor QCD (without elementary Higgs fields) at finite $U(1)_B$ baryon-number chemical potential $\mu_B$, which preserves P and T. At very large $\mu_B$, three-flavor QCD is known to be a completely Higgsed color superconductor that also spontaneously breaks $U(1)_B$. We argue that this high-density phase is in fact a gapless SPT, with a gravitational theta-angle $\theta_g = \pi$ that safely co-exists with the $U(1)_B$ Nambu-Goldstone boson. We explain why this SPT motivates unexpected transitions in the QCD phase diagram, as well as anomalous surface modes at the boundary of quark-matter cores inside neutron stars.</description>

Abstract: We propose an orbifold lattice formulation of QCD suitable for quantum simulations. We show explicitly how to encode gauge degrees of freedom into qubits using noncompact variables, and how to write down a simple truncated Hamiltonian in the coordinate basis. We show that SU(3) gauge group variables and quarks in the fundamental representation can be implemented straightforwardly on qubits, for arbitrary truncation of the gauge manifold.</description>

      <title>Late-Time constraints on Interacting Dark Energy: Analysis independent of $H_0$, $r_d$ and $M_B$</title>

Abstract: A possible interaction between cold dark matter and dark energy, corresponding to a well-known interacting dark energy model discussed in the literature within the context of resolving the Hubble tension, has been investigated. We put constraints on it in a novel way, by creating new likelihoods with an analytical marginalization over the Hubble parameter $H_0$, the sound horizon $r_d$, and the supernova absolute magnitude $M_B$. Our aim is to investigate the impacts on the coupling parameter of the interacting model, $\xi$, and the equation of state of dark energy $w$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{m,0}$. The late-time cosmological probes used in our analysis include the PantheonPlus (calibrated and uncalibrated), Cosmic Chronometers, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations samples and the Pantheon for comparison. Through various combinations of these datasets, we demonstrate hints of up to $2\sigma$ deviation from the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Symmetry Breaking: Unequal Probabilities of Vacuum Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a fundamental notion in modern physics, ranging from high energy to condensed matter. However, the usual spontaneous symmetry breaking only considers the equal probability to select the vacua. In this work, we conceive a model to realize the unequal probability of the symmetry breaking, leading to an unbalanced number of ground states. Specifically, we study the probabilities of a scalar field to roll down from the top of a potential, where the top is only $C^1$ continuous. As the whole system is subject to random perturbations, we find that the probability for the field to roll down to the left or right side depends the square root of the second derivative of the potential at the top. We solve this problem theoretically by using the Fokker-Planck equations in stochastic process and verify our findings numerically. This study may potentially be a new mechanism to explain the origins of asymmetries in the Universe.</description>

      <title>On model emulation and closure tests for 3+1D relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In nuclear and particle physics, reconciling sophisticated simulations with experimental data is vital for understanding complex systems like the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) generated in heavy-ion collisions. However, computational demands pose challenges, motivating using Gaussian Process emulators for efficient parameter extraction via Bayesian calibration. We conduct a comparative analysis of Gaussian Process emulators in heavy-ion physics to identify the most adept emulator for parameter extraction with minimal uncertainty. Our study contributes to advancing computational techniques in heavy-ion physics, enhancing our ability to interpret experimental data and understand QGP properties.</description>
