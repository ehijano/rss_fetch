      <title>Multilayer directed random networks: Scaling of spectral properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the wide presence of multilayer networks in both natural and human-made systems, within a random matrix theory (RMT) approach, in this study we compute eigenfunction and spectral properties of multilayer directed random networks (MDRNs) in two setups composed by $M$ layers of size $N$: A line and a complete graph (node-aligned multiplex network). First, we numerically demonstrate that the normalized localization length $\beta$ of the eigenfunctions of MDRNs follows a simple scaling law given by $\beta=x^*/(1+x^*)$, with $x^*\propto (b_{\rm eff}^2/L)^\delta$, $\delta\sim 1$ and $b_{\rm eff}$ being the effective bandwidth of the adjacency matrix of the network of size $L=M\times N$. Here, $b_{\rm eff}$ incorporates both intra- and inter-layer edges. Then, we show that other eigenfunction and spectral RMT measures (the inverse participation ratio of eigenfunctions, the ratio between nearest- and next-to-nearest-neighbor eigenvalue distances, and the ratio between consecutive singular-value spacings) of MDRNs also scale with $x^*$.</description>

      <title>Exact spectral form factors of non-interacting fermions with Dyson statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral form factor (SFF) is a powerful diagnostic of random matrix behavior in quantum many-body systems. We introduce a family of random circuit ensembles whose SFFs can be computed $\textit{exactly}$. These ensembles describe the evolution of non-interacting fermions in the presence of correlated on-site potentials drawn from the eigenvalue distribution of a circular ensemble. For disorder parameters drawn from the circular unitary ensemble (CUE), we derive an exact closed form for the SFF, valid for any choice of system size $L$ or time $t$. When the disorder is drawn from the circular orthogonal or symplectic ensembles (COE and CSE, respectively), we carry out the disorder averages analytically and reduce the computation of the SFF to a combinatorial problem amenable to transfer matrix methods. In each of these cases the SFF grows exponentially in time, which we argue is a signature of random matrix universality at the single-particle level. Finally, we develop matchgate circuit representations of our circuit ensembles, enabling their experimental realization in quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure prediction of medium and high entropy alloys across composition space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose machine learning (ML) models to predict the electron density -- the fundamental unknown of a material's ground state -- across the composition space of concentrated alloys. From this, other physical properties can be inferred, enabling accelerated exploration. A significant challenge is that the number of sampled compositions and descriptors required to accurately predict fields like the electron density increases rapidly with species. To address this, we employ Bayesian Active Learning (AL), which minimizes training data requirements by leveraging uncertainty quantification capabilities of Bayesian Neural Networks. Compared to strategic tessellation of the composition space, Bayesian-AL reduces the number of training data points by a factor of 2.5 for ternary (SiGeSn) and 1.7 for quaternary (CrFeCoNi) systems. We also introduce easy-to-optimize, body-attached-frame descriptors, which respect physical symmetries and maintain approximately the same descriptor-vector size as alloy elements increase. Our ML models demonstrate high accuracy and generalizability in predicting both electron density and energy across composition space.</description>

      <title>Reflected multi-entropy and its holographic dual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a mixed-state generalization of the multi-entropy through the canonical purification, which we called reflected multi-entropy. We propose the holographic dual of this measure. For the tripartite case, a field-theoretical calculation is performed using a six-point function of twist operators at large $c$ limit. At both zero and finite temperature, the field-theoretical results match the holographic results exactly, supporting our holographic conjecture of this new measure.</description>

      <title>Higher-order gap ratios of singular values in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding open quantum systems using information encoded in its complex eigenvalues has been a subject of growing interest. In this paper, we study higher-order gap ratios of the singular values of generic open quantum systems. We show that $k$-th order gap ratio of the singular values of an open quantum system can be connected to the nearest-neighbor spacing ratio of positions of classical particles of a harmonically confined log-gas with inverse temperature $\beta'(k)$ where $\beta'(k)$ is an analytical function that depends on $k$ and the Dyson's index $\beta=1,2,$ and $4$ that characterizes the properties of the associated Hermitized matrix. Our findings are crucial not only for understanding long-range correlations between the eigenvalues but also provide an excellent way of distinguishing different symmetry classes in an open quantum system. To highlight the universality of our findings, we demonstrate the higher-order gap ratios using different platforms such as non-Hermitian random matrices, random dissipative Liouvillians, Hamiltonians coupled to a Markovian bath, and Hamiltonians with in-built non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Gyromorphs: a new class of functional disordered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of functional correlated disordered materials, termed Gyromorphs, which uniquely combine liquid-like translational disorder with quasi-long-range rotational order, induced by a ring of $G$ delta peaks in their structure factor. We generate gyromorphs in $2d$ and $3d$ by spectral optimization methods, verifying that they display strong discrete rotational order but no long-range translational order, while maintaining rotational isotropy at short range for sufficiently large $G$. We show that they are distinct from quasicrystals, which we argue are akin to Fourier ''duals'' of gyromorphs. Using a coupled dipole approximation, we show that these structures outperform quasicrystals, stealthy hyperuniformity, and Vogel spirals in the formation of isotropic bandgaps in $2d$, for both scalar and vector waves, and open complete isotropic bandgaps in $3d$. Finally, we introduce ''polygyromorphs'' with several rotational symmetries at different length scales (i.e., multiple rings of delta peaks), enabling the formation of multiple bandgaps in a single structure, thereby paving the way for fine control over optical properties.</description>

      <title>Geometric Characterization of Many Body Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many body localization (MBL) represents a unique physical phenomenon, providing a testing ground for exploring thermalization, or more precisely its failure. Here we characterize the MBL phase geometrically by the many-body quantum metric (MBQM), defined in the parameter space of twist boundary. We find that we can characterise the transition by comparing the thermodynamic limits of the MBQM and localization length as defined in the modern theory of polarization and insulators. As such we find that we can extract a natural localization length in the MBL phase that relies only on the real space spread of the wave function and can be measured through lattice shaking or AC response measurements.</description>

      <title>Universal Performance Gap of Neural Quantum States Applied to the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01981v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) have demonstrated significant potential in approximating ground states of many-body quantum systems, though their performance can be inconsistent across different models. This study investigates the performance of NQS in approximating the ground state of the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard (HBH) model, an interacting boson system on a two-dimensional square lattice with a perpendicular magnetic field. Our results indicate that increasing magnetic flux leads to a substantial increase in energy error, up to three orders of magnitude. Importantly, this decline in NQS performance is consistent across different optimization methods, neural network architectures, and physical model parameters, suggesting a significant challenge intrinsic to the model. Despite investigating potential causes such as wave function phase structure, quantum entanglement, fractional quantum Hall effect, and the variational loss landscape, the precise reasons for this degradation remain elusive. The HBH model thus proves to be an effective testing ground for exploring the capabilities and limitations of NQS. Our study highlights the need for advanced theoretical frameworks to better understand the expressive power of NQS which would allow a systematic development of methods that could potentially overcome these challenges.</description>
