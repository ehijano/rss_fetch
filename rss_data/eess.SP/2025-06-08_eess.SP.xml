      <title>UAV-Based Remote Sensing of Soil Moisture Across Diverse Land Covers: Validation and Bayesian Uncertainty Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution soil moisture (SM) observations are critical for agricultural monitoring, forestry management, and hazard prediction, yet current satellite passive microwave missions cannot directly provide retrievals at tens-of-meter spatial scales. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mounted microwave radiometry presents a promising alternative, but most evaluations to date have focused on agricultural settings, with limited exploration across other land covers and few efforts to quantify retrieval uncertainty. This study addresses both gaps by evaluating SM retrievals from a drone-based Portable L-band Radiometer (PoLRa) across shrubland, bare soil, and forest strips in Central Illinois, U.S., using a 10-day field campaign in 2024. Controlled UAV flights at altitudes of 10 m, 20 m, and 30 m were performed to generate brightness temperatures (TB) at spatial resolutions of 7 m, 14 m, and 21 m. SM retrievals were carried out using multiple tau-omega-based algorithms, including the single channel algorithm (SCA), dual channel algorithm (DCA), and multi-temporal dual channel algorithm (MTDCA). A Bayesian inference framework was then applied to provide probabilistic uncertainty characterization for both SM and vegetation optical depth (VOD). Results show that the gridded TB distributions consistently capture dry-wet gradients associated with vegetation density variations, and spatial correlations between polarized observations are largely maintained across scales. Validation against in situ measurements indicates that PoLRa derived SM retrievals from the SCAV and MTDCA algorithms achieve unbiased root-mean-square errors (ubRMSE) generally below 0.04 m3/m3 across different land covers. Bayesian posterior analyses confirm that reference SM values largely fall within the derived uncertainty intervals, with mean uncertainty ranges around 0.02 m3/m3 and 0.11 m3/m3 for SCA and DCA related retrievals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge intelligence in IoT and IIoT demands lightweight algorithms for data processing on resource-constrained devices. This paper introduces a novel adaptive pulse shape filter based on TinyML for PAPR and SER optimization on edge devices used in uplink IoT communication. Implemented on IoT nodes such as sensors, our pruned neural network provides up to 2 dB PAPR saving over root-raised-cosine (RRC) filters.

      <title>On Level Crossings and Fade Durations in von Mises-Fisher Scattering Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the second-order statistics of multipath fading channels with von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributed scatters. Simple closed-form expressions for the mean Doppler shift and Doppler spread are derived as the key spectral moments that capture the impact of mobility and scattering characteristics on level crossings and fade durations. These expressions are then used to analyze the influence of vMF parameters on the Level-Crossing Rate (LCR) The results show that isotropic scattering yields the highest LCR, while fading dynamics reduce with the decreasing angular spread of scatterers. Moreover, obile antenna motion parallel to the mean scattering direction results in a lower LCR than the perpendicular motion, with the difference between the two cases increasing with the higher concentration of scatterers.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Large Models Based Beam Prediction: An Example Empowered by DeepSeek</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beam prediction is an effective approach to reduce training overhead in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, existing beam prediction models still exhibit limited generalization ability in diverse scenarios, which remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose MLM-BP, a beam prediction framework based on the multi-modal large model released by DeepSeek, with full consideration of multi-modal environmental information. Specifically, the distribution of scatterers that impact the optimal beam is captured by the sensing devices. Then positions are tokenized to generate text-based representations, and multi-view images are processed by an image encoder, which is fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation (LoRA), to extract environmental embeddings. Finally, these embeddings are fed into the large model, and an output projection module is designed to determine the optimal beam index. Simulation results show that MLM-BP achieves 98.1% Top-1 accuracy on the simulation dataset. Additionally, it demonstrates few-shot generalization on a real-world dataset, achieving 72.7% Top-1 accuracy and 92.4% Top-3 accuracy with only 30% of the dataset, outperforming the existing small models by over 15%.</description>

      <title>A Flexible Design Framework for Integrated Communication and Computing Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework to design integrated communication and computing (ICC) receivers capable of simultaneously detecting data symbols and performing over-the-air computing (AirComp) in a manner that: a) is systematically generalizable to any nomographic function, b) scales to a massive number of user equipments (UEs) and edge devices (EDs), c) supports the computation of multiple independent functions (streams), and d) operates in a multi-access fashion whereby each transmitter can choose to transmit either data symbols, computing signals or both. For the sake of illustration, we design the proposed multi-stream and multi-access method under an uplink setting, where multiple single-antenna UEs/EDs simultaneously transmit data and computing signals to a single multiple-antenna base station (BS)/access point (AP). Under the communication functionality, the receiver aims to detect all independent communication symbols while treating the computing streams as aggregate interference which it seeks to mitigate; and conversely, under the computing functionality, to minimize the distortion over the computing streams while minimizing their mutual interference as well as the interference due to data symbols. To that end, the design leverages the Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) framework relying only on element-wise scalar operations coupled with closed-form combiners purpose-built for the AirComp operation, which allows for its use in massive settings, as demonstrated by simulation results incorporating up to 200 antennas and 300 UEs/EDs. The efficacy of the proposed method under different loading conditions is also evaluated, with the performance of the scheme shown to approach fundamental limiting bounds in the under/fully loaded cases.</description>

      <title>Dual Approach to Inverse Covariance Intersection Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear fusion of estimates under the condition of no knowledge of correlation of estimation errors has reached maturity. On the other hand, various cases of partial knowledge are still active research areas. A frequent motivation is to deal with "common information" or "common noise", whatever it means. A fusion rule for a strict meaning of the former expression has already been elaborated. Despite the dual relationship, a strict meaning of the latter one has not been considered so far. The paper focuses on this area. The assumption of unknown "common noise" is formulated first, analysis of theoretical properties and illustrations follow. Although the results are disappointing from the perspective of a single upper bound of mean square error matrices, the partial knowledge demonstrates improvement over no knowledge in suboptimal cases and from the perspective of families of upper bounds.</description>

      <title>Distribution-Level AirComp for Wireless Federated Learning under Data Scarcity and Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional FL methods face critical challenges in realistic wireless edge networks, where training data is both limited and heterogeneous, often leading to unstable training and poor generalization. To address these challenges in a principled manner, we propose a novel wireless FL framework grounded in Bayesian inference. By virtue of the Bayesian approach, our framework captures model uncertainty by maintaining distributions over local weights and performs distribution-level aggregation of local distributions into a global distribution. This mitigates local overfitting and client drift, thereby enabling more reliable inference. Nevertheless, adopting Bayesian FL increases communication overhead due to the need to transmit richer model information and fundamentally alters the aggregation process beyond simple averaging. As a result, conventional Over-the-Air Computation (AirComp), widely used to improve communication efficiency in standard FL, is no longer directly applicable. To overcome this limitation, we design a dedicated AirComp scheme tailored to Bayesian FL, which efficiently aggregates local posterior distributions at the distribution level by exploiting the superposition property of wireless channels. In addition, we derive an optimal transmit power control strategy, grounded in rigorous convergence analysis, to accelerate training under power constraints. Our analysis explicitly accounts for practical wireless impairments such as fading and noise, and provides theoretical guarantees for convergence. Extensive simulations validate the proposed framework, demonstrating significant improvements in test accuracy and calibration performance over conventional FL methods, particularly in data-scarce and heterogeneous environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the happiest accidents in all math is the ease of transforming a function to and taking derivatives in the Fourier frequency domain. But in order to exploit this extraordinary fact without serious artefacting, and in order to be able to use a computer, we need quite a bit of extra knowledge and care. This document sets out the math behind the spectral-derivatives Python package. I touch on fundamental signal processing and calculus concepts as necessary and build upwards.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Secure Transmissions in IRS-Assisted NOMA Communications: CO-GNN Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) enhance spectral efficiency by adjusting reflection phase shifts, while Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) increases system capacity. Consequently, IRS-assisted NOMA communications have garnered significant research interest. However, the passive nature of the IRS, lacking authentication and security protocols, makes these systems vulnerable to external eavesdropping due to the openness of electromagnetic signal propagation and reflection. NOMA's inherent multi-user signal superposition also introduces internal eavesdropping risks during user pairing. This paper investigates secure transmissions in IRS-assisted NOMA systems with heterogeneous resource configuration in wireless networks to mitigate both external and internal eavesdropping. To maximize the sum secrecy rate of legitimate users, we propose a combinatorial optimization graph neural network (CO-GNN) approach to jointly optimize beamforming at the base station, power allocation of NOMA users, and phase shifts of IRS for dynamic heterogeneous resource allocation, thereby enabling the design of dual-link or multi-link secure transmissions in the presence of eavesdroppers on the same or heterogeneous links. The CO-GNN algorithm simplifies the complex mathematical problem-solving process, eliminates the need for channel estimation, and enhances scalability. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances the secure transmission performance of the system.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation with Asynchronous Reception for User-Centric Cell-Free MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The user-centric, cell-free wireless network is a promising next-generation communication system, but signal synchronization issues arise due to distributed access points and lack of cellular structure. We propose a novel method to recover synchronous pilot reception by introducing new pilot sequences and a matched filter window, enabling orthogonality even with asynchronous reception. Our approach mimics synchronous transmission by extending training sequences. Analysis shows asynchronous reception's impact on channel estimation, and our method significantly improves performance with a small increase of training time overhead. Results demonstrate a 7.26 dB reduction in normalized mean square error and 40% increase in data rate, achieving performance levels comparable to the synchronous case.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna System-Assisted Self-Interference Cancellation for In-Band Full Duplex Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-band full-duplex (IBFD) systems are expected to double the spectral efficiency compared to half-duplex systems, provided that loopback self-interference (SI) can be effectively suppressed. The inherent interference mitigation capabilities of the emerging fluid antenna system (FAS) technology make it a promising candidate for addressing the SI challenge in IBFD systems. This paper thus proposes a FAS-assisted self-interference cancellation (SIC) framework, which leverages a receiver-side FAS to dynamically select an interference-free port. Analytical results include a lower bound and an approximation of the residual SI (RSI) power, both derived for rich-scattering channels by considering the joint spatial correlation amongst the FAS ports. Simulations of RSI power and forward link rates validate the analysis, showing that the SIC performance improves with the number of FAS ports. Additionally, simulations under practical conditions, such as finite-scattering environments and wideband integrated access and backhaul (IAB) channels, reveal that the proposed approach offers superior SIC capability and significant forward rate gains over conventional IBFD SIC schemes.</description>

      <title>Joint User Association and Beamforming Design for ISAC Networks with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been envisioned to play a more important role in future wireless networks. However, the design of ISAC networks is challenging, especially when there are multiple communication and sensing (C\&amp;S) nodes and multiple sensing targets. We investigate a multi-base station (BS) ISAC network in which multiple BSs equipped with multiple antennas simultaneously provide C\&amp;S services for multiple ground communication users (CUs) and targets. To enhance the overall performance of C\&amp;S, we formulate a joint user association (UA) and multi-BS transmit beamforming optimization problem with the objective of maximizing the total sum rate of all CUs while ensuring both the minimum target detection and parameter estimation requirements. To efficiently solve the highly non-convex mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) optimization problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm that decomposes the problem into two sub-problems, i.e., UA optimization and multi-BS transmit beamforming optimization. Inspired by large language models (LLMs) for prediction and inference, we propose a unified framework integrating LLMs with convex-based optimization methods. First, we propose a comprehensive design of prompt engineering, including few-shot, chain of thought, and self-reflection techniques to guide LLMs in solving the binary integer programming UA optimization problem. Second, we utilize convex-based optimization methods to handle the non-convex beamforming optimization problem based on fractional programming (FP), majorization minimization (MM), and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with an optimized UA from LLMs. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed LLM-enabled AO-based algorithm achieves fast convergence and near upper-bound performance with the GPT-o1 model, outperforming various benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>NILMFormer: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring that Accounts for Non-Stationarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millions of smart meters have been deployed worldwide, collecting the total power consumed by individual households. Based on these data, electricity suppliers offer their clients energy monitoring solutions to provide feedback on the consumption of their individual appliances. Historically, such estimates have relied on statistical methods that use coarse-grained total monthly consumption and static customer data, such as appliance ownership. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is the problem of disaggregating a household's collected total power consumption to retrieve the consumed power for individual appliances. Current state-of-the-art (SotA) solutions for NILM are based on deep-learning (DL) and operate on subsequences of an entire household consumption reading. However, the non-stationary nature of real-world smart meter data leads to a drift in the data distribution within each segmented window, which significantly affects model performance. This paper introduces NILMFormer, a Transformer-based architecture that incorporates a new subsequence stationarization/de-stationarization scheme to mitigate the distribution drift and that uses a novel positional encoding that relies only on the subsequence's timestamp information. Experiments with 4 real-world datasets show that NILMFormer significantly outperforms the SotA approaches. Our solution has been deployed as the backbone algorithm for EDF's (Electricit\'e De France) consumption monitoring service, delivering detailed insights to millions of customers about their individual appliances' power consumption. This paper appeared in KDD 2025.</description>

      <title>DeviceScope: An Interactive App to Detect and Localize Appliance Patterns in Electricity Consumption Time Series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, electricity suppliers have installed millions of smart meters worldwide to improve the management of the smart grid system. These meters collect a large amount of electrical consumption data to produce valuable information to help consumers reduce their electricity footprint. However, having non-expert users (e.g., consumers or sales advisors) understand these data and derive usage patterns for different appliances has become a significant challenge for electricity suppliers because these data record the aggregated behavior of all appliances. At the same time, ground-truth labels (which could train appliance detection and localization models) are expensive to collect and extremely scarce in practice. This paper introduces DeviceScope, an interactive tool designed to facilitate understanding smart meter data by detecting and localizing individual appliance patterns within a given time period. Our system is based on CamAL (Class Activation Map-based Appliance Localization), a novel weakly supervised approach for appliance localization that only requires the knowledge of the existence of an appliance in a household to be trained. This paper appeared in ICDE 2025.</description>

      <title>A Proximal Variable Smoothing for Minimization of Nonlinearly Composite Nonsmooth Function -- Maxmin Dispersion and MIMO Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a proximal variable smoothing algorithm for a nonsmooth optimization problem whose cost function is the sum of three functions including a weakly convex composite function. The proposed algorithm has a single-loop structure inspired by a proximal gradient-type method. More precisely, the proposed algorithm consists of two steps: (i) a gradient descent of a time-varying smoothed surrogate function designed partially with the Moreau envelope of the weakly convex function; (ii) an application of the proximity operator of the remaining function not covered by the smoothed surrogate function. We also present a convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm by exploiting a novel asymptotic approximation of a gradient mapping-type stationarity measure. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in two scenarios: (i) maxmin dispersion problem and (ii) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) signal detection.</description>

      <title>Capacity of MIMO Systems Aided by Microwave Linear Analog Computers (MiLACs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future wireless systems, known as gigantic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), are expected to enhance performance by significantly increasing the number of antennas, e.g., a few thousands. To enable gigantic MIMO overcoming the scalability limitations of digital architectures, microwave linear analog computers (MiLACs) have recently emerged. A MiLAC is a multiport microwave network that processes input microwave signals entirely in the analog domain, thereby reducing hardware costs and computational complexity of gigantic MIMO architectures. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental limits on the rate achievable in MiLAC-aided MIMO systems. We model a MIMO system employing MiLAC-aided beamforming at the transmitter and receiver, and formulate the rate maximization problem to optimize the microwave networks of the MiLACs, which are assumed lossless and reciprocal for practical reasons. Under the lossless and reciprocal constraints, we derive a global optimal solution for the microwave networks of the MiLACs in closed form. In addition, we also characterize in closed-form the capacity of MIMO systems operating MiLAC-aided beamforming. Our theoretical analysis, confirmed by numerical simulations, reveals that MiLAC-aided beamforming achieves the same capacity as digital beamforming, while significantly reducing the number of radio frequency (RF) chains, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)/digital-to-analog converters (DACs) resolution requirements, and computational complexity.</description>

      <title>SATversary: Adversarial Attacks on Satellite Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As satellite systems become increasingly vulnerable to physical layer attacks via SDRs, novel countermeasures are being developed to protect critical systems, particularly those lacking cryptographic protection, or those which cannot be upgraded to support modern cryptography. Among these is transmitter fingerprinting, which provides mechanisms by which communication can be authenticated by looking at characteristics of the transmitter, expressed as impairments on the signal.
  Previous works show that fingerprinting can be used to classify satellite transmitters, or authenticate them against SDR-equipped attackers under simple replay scenarios. In this paper we build upon this by looking at attacks directly targeting the fingerprinting system, with an attacker optimizing for maximum impact in jamming, spoofing, and dataset poisoning attacks, and demonstrate these attacks on the SatIQ system designed to authenticate Iridium transmitters. We show that an optimized jamming signal can cause a 50% error rate with attacker-to-victim ratios as low as -30dB (far less power than traditional jamming) and demonstrate successful identity forgery during spoofing attacks, with an attacker successfully removing their own transmitter's fingerprint from messages. We also present a data poisoning attack, enabling persistent message spoofing by altering the data used to authenticate incoming messages to include the fingerprint of the attacker's transmitter.
  Finally, we show that our model trained to optimize spoofing attacks can also be used to detect spoofing and replay attacks, even when it has never seen the attacker's transmitter before. Furthermore, this technique works even when the training dataset includes only a single transmitter, enabling fingerprinting to be used to protect small constellations and even individual satellites, providing additional protection where it is needed the most.</description>

      <title>Inverse-designed nanophotonic neural network accelerators for ultra-compact optical computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse-designed nanophotonic devices offer promising solutions for analog optical computation. High-density photonic integration is critical for scaling such architectures toward more complex computational tasks and large-scale applications. Here, we present an inverse-designed photonic neural network (PNN) accelerator on a high-index contrast material platform, enabling ultra-compact and energy-efficient optical computing. Our approach introduces a wave-based inverse-design method based on three dimensional finite-difference time-domain (3D-FDTD) simulations, exploiting the linearity of Maxwell's equations to reconstruct arbitrary spatial fields through optical coherence. By decoupling the forward-pass process into linearly separable simulations, our approach is highly amenable to computational parallelism, making it particularly well suited for acceleration using graphics processing units (GPUs) and other parallel computing platforms, thereby enhancing scalability across large problem domains. We fabricate and experimentally validate two inverse-designed PNN accelerators on the silicon-on-insulator platform, achieving on-chip MNIST and MedNIST classification accuracies of 89% and 90% respectively, within ultra-compact footprints of just 20 $\times$ 20 $\mu$m$^{2}$ and 30 $\times$ 20 $\mu$m$^{2}$. Our results establish a scalable and energy-efficient platform for analog photonic computing, effectively bridging inverse nanophotonic design with high-performance optical information processing.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation for Pinching-Antenna Systems: State-of-the-Art, Key Techniques and Open Issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pinching antennas have emerged as a promising technology for reconfiguring wireless propagation environments, particularly in high-frequency communication systems operating in the millimeter-wave and terahertz bands. By enabling dynamic activation at arbitrary positions along a dielectric waveguide, pinching antennas offer unprecedented channel reconfigurability and the ability to provide line-of-sight (LoS) links in scenarios with severe LoS blockages. The performance of pinching-antenna systems is highly dependent on the optimized placement of the pinching antennas, which must be jointly considered with traditional resource allocation (RA) variables -- including transmission power, time slots, and subcarriers. The resulting joint RA problems are typically non-convex with complex variable coupling, necessitating sophisticated optimization techniques. This article provides a comprehensive survey of existing RA algorithms designed for pinching-antenna systems, supported by numerical case studies that demonstrate their potential performance gains. Key challenges and open research problems are also identified to guide future developments in this emerging field.</description>

      <title>Neural Responses to Affective Sentences Reveal Signatures of Depression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent mental health condition, and a deeper understanding of its neurocognitive foundations is essential for identifying how core functions such as emotional and self-referential processing are affected. We investigate how depression alters the temporal dynamics of emotional processing by measuring neural responses to self-referential affective sentences using surface electroencephalography (EEG) in healthy and depressed individuals. Our results reveal significant group-level differences in neural activity during sentence viewing, suggesting disrupted integration of emotional and self-referential information in depression. Deep learning model trained on these responses achieves an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.707 in distinguishing healthy from depressed participants, and 0.624 in differentiating depressed subgroups with and without suicidal ideation. Spatial ablations highlight anterior electrodes associated with semantic and affective processing as key contributors. These findings suggest stable, stimulus-driven neural signatures of depression that may inform future diagnostic tools.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Common filters are usually based on the linear approximation of the optimal minimum mean square error estimator. The Extended and Unscented Kalman Filters handle nonlinearity through linearization and unscented transformation, respectively, but remain linear estimators, meaning that the state estimate is a linear function of the measurement. This paper proposes a quadratic approximation of the optimal estimator, creating the Quadratic Extended and Quadratic Unscented Kalman Filter. These retain the structure of their linear counterpart, but include information from the measurement square to obtain a more accurate estimate. Numerical results show the benefits in accuracy of the new technique, which can be generalized to upgrade other linear estimators to their quadratic versions.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Multimodal Physiological Foundation Models: Handling Arbitrary Missing Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal physiological signals, such as EEG, ECG, EOG, and EMG, are crucial for healthcare and brain-computer interfaces. While existing methods rely on specialized architectures and dataset-specific fusion strategies, they struggle to learn universal representations that generalize across datasets and handle missing modalities at inference time. To address these issues, we propose PhysioOmni, a foundation model for multimodal physiological signal analysis that models both homogeneous and heterogeneous features to decouple multimodal signals and extract generic representations while maintaining compatibility with arbitrary missing modalities. PhysioOmni trains a decoupled multimodal tokenizer, enabling masked signal pre-training via modality-invariant and modality-specific objectives. To ensure adaptability to diverse and incomplete modality combinations, the pre-trained encoders undergo resilient fine-tuning with prototype alignment on downstream datasets. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks, emotion recognition, sleep stage classification, motor prediction, and mental workload detection, demonstrate that PhysioOmni achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining strong robustness to missing modalities. Our code and model weights will be released.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel distributed expectation propagation algorithm for multiple sensors, multiple objects tracking in cluttered environments. The proposed framework enables each sensor to operate locally while collaboratively exchanging moment estimates with other sensors, thus eliminating the need to transmit all data to a central processing node. Specifically, we introduce a fast and parallelisable Rao-Blackwellised Gibbs sampling scheme to approximate the tilted distributions, which enhances the accuracy and efficiency of expectation propagation updates. Results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves both communication and inference efficiency for multi-object tracking tasks with dynamic sensor connectivity and varying clutter levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point-mass filters solve Bayesian recursive relations by approximating probability density functions of a system state over grids of discrete points. The approach suffers from the curse of dimensionality. The exponential increase of the number of the grid points can be mitigated by application of low-rank approximations of multidimensional arrays. Tensor train decompositions represent individual values by the product of matrices. This paper focuses on selected issues that are substantial in state estimation. Namely, the contamination of the density approximations by negative values is discussed first. Functional decompositions of quadratic functions are compared with decompositions of discretised Gaussian densities next. In particular, the connection of correlation with tensor train ranks is explored. Last, the consequences of interpolating the density values from one grid to a new grid are analysed.</description>

Abstract: The envelope of an elliptical Gaussian complex vector, or equivalently, the amplitude or norm of a bivariate normal random vector has application in many weather and signal processing contexts. We explicitly characterize its distribution in the general case through its probability density, cumulative distribution and moment generating function. Moments and limiting distributions are also derived. These derivations are exploited to also characterize the special cases where the bivariate Gaussian mean vector and covariance matrix have a simpler structure, providing new additional insights in many cases. Simulations illustrate the benefits of using our formulae over Monte Carlo methods. We also use our derivations to get a better initial characterization of the distribution of the observed values in structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging datasets, and of wind speed.</description>

      <title>SGD Jittering: A Training Strategy for Robust and Accurate Model-Based Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14667v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems aim to reconstruct unseen data from corrupted or perturbed measurements. While most work focuses on improving reconstruction quality, generalization accuracy and robustness are equally important, especially for safety-critical applications. Model-based architectures (MBAs), such as loop unrolling methods, are considered more interpretable and achieve better reconstructions. Empirical evidence suggests that MBAs are more robust to perturbations than black-box solvers, but the accuracy-robustness tradeoff in MBAs remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective training scheme for MBAs, called SGD jittering, which injects noise iteration-wise during reconstruction. We theoretically demonstrate that SGD jittering not only generalizes better than the standard mean squared error training but is also more robust to average-case attacks. We validate SGD jittering using denoising toy examples, seismic deconvolution, and single-coil MRI reconstruction. Both SGD jittering and its SPGD extension yield cleaner reconstructions for out-of-distribution data and demonstrates enhanced robustness against adversarial attacks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of uncertainty propagation in the discrete Fourier transform by modeling the fast Fourier transform as a factor graph. Building on this representation, we propose an efficient framework for approximate Bayesian inference using belief propagation (BP) and expectation propagation, extending its applicability beyond Gaussian assumptions. By leveraging an appropriate BP message representation and a suitable schedule, our method achieves stable convergence with accurate mean and variance estimates. Numerical experiments in representative scenarios from communications demonstrate the practical potential of the proposed framework for uncertainty-aware inference in probabilistic systems operating across both time and frequency domain.</description>

Abstract: Radio maps reflect the spatial distribution of signal strength and are essential for applications like smart cities, IoT, and wireless network planning. However, reconstructing accurate radio maps from sparse measurements remains challenging. Traditional interpolation and inpainting methods lack environmental awareness, while many deep learning approaches depend on detailed scene data, limiting generalization. To address this, we propose MARS, a Multi-scale Aware Radiomap Super-resolution method that combines CNNs and Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections. MARS focuses on both global and local feature extraction, enhancing feature representation across different receptive fields and improving reconstruction accuracy. Experiments across different scenes and antenna locations show that MARS outperforms baseline models in both MSE and SSIM, while maintaining low computational cost, demonstrating strong practical potential.</description>
