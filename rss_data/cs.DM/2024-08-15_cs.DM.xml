      <title>Quantum algorithms for optimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a set of lecture notes for a Ph.D.-level course on quantum algorithms, with an emphasis on quantum optimization algorithms. It is developed for applied mathematicians and engineers, and requires no previous background in quantum mechanics. The main topics of this course, in addition to a rigorous introduction to the computational model, are: input/output models, quantum search, the quantum gradient algorithm, matrix manipulation algorithms, the matrix multiplicative weights update framework for semidefinite optimization, adiabatic optimization.</description>

      <title>Finite Vertex-colored Ultrahomogeneous Oriented Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A relational structure R is ultrahomogeneous if every isomorphism of finite induced substructures of R extends to an automorphism of R. We classify the ultrahomogeneous finite binary relational structures with one asymmetric binary relation and arbitrarily many unary relations. In other words, we classify the finite vertex-colored oriented ultrahomogeneous graphs. The classification comprises several general methods with which directed graphs can be combined or extended to create new ultrahomogeneous graphs. Together with explicitly given exceptions, we obtain exactly all vertex-colored oriented ultrahomogeneous graphs this way. Our main technique is a technical tool that characterizes precisely under which conditions two binary relational structures with disjoint unary relations can be combined to form a larger ultrahomogeneous structure.</description>

      <title>The Chv\'atal-Sankoff problem: Understanding random string comparison through stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given two equally long, uniformly random binary strings, the expected length of their longest common subsequence (LCS) is asymptotically proportional to the strings' length. Finding the proportionality coefficient $\gamma$, i.e. the limit of the normalised LCS length for two random binary strings of length $n \to \infty$, is a very natural problem, first posed by Chv\'atal and Sankoff in 1975, and as yet unresolved. This problem has relevance to diverse fields ranging from combinatorics and algorithm analysis to coding theory and computational biology. Using methods of statistical mechanics, as well as some existing results on the combinatorial structure of LCS, we link constant $\gamma$ to the parameters of a certain stochastic particle process, which we use to obtain a new estimate for $\gamma$.</description>

      <title>Biclique immersions in graphs with independence number 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analogue of Hadwiger's conjecture for the immersion relation states that every graph $G$ contains an immersion of $K_{\chi(G)}$. For graphs with independence number 2, this is equivalent to stating that every such $n$-vertex graph contains an immersion of $K_{\lceil n/2 \rceil}$. We show that every $n$-vertex graph with independence number 2 contains every complete bipartite graph on $\lceil n/2 \rceil$ vertices as an immersion.</description>

      <title>SAT Encoding of Partial Ordering Models for Graph Coloring Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15961v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we suggest new SAT encodings of the partial-ordering based ILP model for the graph coloring problem (GCP) and the bandwidth coloring problem (BCP). The GCP asks for the minimum number of colors that can be assigned to the vertices of a given graph such that each two adjacent vertices get different colors. The BCP is a generalization, where each edge has a weight that enforces a minimal "distance" between the assigned colors, and the goal is to minimize the "largest" color used. For the widely studied GCP, we experimentally compare our new SAT encoding to the state-of-the-art approaches on the DIMACS benchmark set. Our evaluation confirms that this SAT encoding is effective for sparse graphs and even outperforms the state-of-the-art on some DIMACS instances. For the BCP, our theoretical analysis shows that the partial-ordering based SAT and ILP formulations have an asymptotically smaller size than that of the classical assignment-based model. Our practical evaluation confirms not only a dominance compared to the assignment-based encodings but also to the state-of-the-art approaches on a set of benchmark instances. Up to our knowledge, we have solved several open instances of the BCP from the literature for the first time.</description>

      <title>The complexity of strong conflict-free vertex-connection $k$-colorability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a new variant of graph coloring by adding a connectivity constraint. A path in a vertex-colored graph is called conflict-free if there is a color that appears exactly once on its vertices. A connected graph $G$ is said to be strongly conflict-free vertex-connection $k$-colorable if $G$ admits a vertex $k$-coloring such that any two distinct vertices of $G$ are connected by a conflict-free $shortest$ path.
  Among others, we show that deciding whether a given graph is strongly conflict-free vertex-connection $3$-colorable is NP-complete even when restricted to $3$-colorable graphs with diameter $3$, radius $2$ and domination number $3$, and, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH), cannot be solved in $2^{o(n)}$ time on such restricted input graphs with $n$ vertices. This hardness result is quite strong when compared to the ordinary $3$-COLORING problem: it is known that $3$-COLORING is solvable in polynomial time in graphs with bounded domination number, and assuming ETH, cannot be solved in $2^{o(\sqrt{n})}$ time in $n$-vertex graphs with diameter $3$ and radius $2$. On the positive side, we point out that a strong conflict-free vertex-connection coloring with minimum color number of a given split graph or a co-bipartite graph can be computed in polynomial time.</description>
