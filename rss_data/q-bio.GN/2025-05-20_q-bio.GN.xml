      <title>scSiameseClu: A Siamese Clustering Framework for Interpreting single-cell RNA Sequencing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) reveals cell heterogeneity, with cell clustering playing a key role in identifying cell types and marker genes. Recent advances, especially graph neural networks (GNNs)-based methods, have significantly improved clustering performance. However, the analysis of scRNA-seq data remains challenging due to noise, sparsity, and high dimensionality. Compounding these challenges, GNNs often suffer from over-smoothing, limiting their ability to capture complex biological information. In response, we propose scSiameseClu, a novel Siamese Clustering framework for interpreting single-cell RNA-seq data, comprising of 3 key steps: (1) Dual Augmentation Module, which applies biologically informed perturbations to the gene expression matrix and cell graph relationships to enhance representation robustness; (2) Siamese Fusion Module, which combines cross-correlation refinement and adaptive information fusion to capture complex cellular relationships while mitigating over-smoothing; and (3) Optimal Transport Clustering, which utilizes Sinkhorn distance to efficiently align cluster assignments with predefined proportions while maintaining balance. Comprehensive evaluations on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that~\methodname~outperforms state-of-the-art methods in single-cell clustering, cell type annotation, and cell type classification, providing a powerful tool for scRNA-seq data interpretation.</description>

      <title>ChromFound: Towards A Universal Foundation Model for Single-Cell Chromatin Accessibility Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) offers an innovative perspective for deciphering regulatory mechanisms by assembling a vast repository of single-cell chromatin accessibility data. While foundation models have achieved significant success in single-cell transcriptomics, there is currently no foundation model for scATAC-seq that supports zero-shot high-quality cell identification and comprehensive multi-omics analysis simultaneously. Key challenges lie in the high dimensionality and sparsity of scATAC-seq data, as well as the lack of a standardized schema for representing open chromatin regions (OCRs). Here, we present \textbf{ChromFound}, a foundation model tailored for scATAC-seq. ChromFound utilizes a hybrid architecture and genome-aware tokenization to effectively capture genome-wide long contexts and regulatory signals from dynamic chromatin landscapes. Pretrained on 1.97 million cells from 30 tissues and 6 disease conditions, ChromFound demonstrates broad applicability across 6 diverse tasks. Notably, it achieves robust zero-shot performance in generating universal cell representations and exhibits excellent transferability in cell type annotation and cross-omics prediction. By uncovering enhancer-gene links undetected by existing computational methods, ChromFound offers a promising framework for understanding disease risk variants in the noncoding genome.</description>

      <title>Foundation Models for AI-Enabled Biological Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper surveys foundation models for AI-enabled biological design, focusing on recent developments in applying large-scale, self-supervised models to tasks such as protein engineering, small molecule design, and genomic sequence design. Though this domain is evolving rapidly, this survey presents and discusses a taxonomy of current models and methods. The focus is on challenges and solutions in adapting these models for biological applications, including biological sequence modeling architectures, controllability in generation, and multi-modal integration. The survey concludes with a discussion of open problems and future directions, offering concrete next-steps to improve the quality of biological sequence generation.</description>
