      <title>Depth-one foliations, pseudo-Anosov flows and universal circles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a taut depth-one foliation $\mathcal{F}$ in a closed atoroidal 3-manifold $M$ transverse to a pseudo-Anosov flow $\phi$ without perfect fits, we show that the universal circle coming from leftmost sections $\mathfrak{S}_\mathrm{left}$ associated to $\mathcal{F}$, constructed by Thurston and Calegari-Dunfield, is isomorphic to the ideal boundary of the flow space associated to $\phi$ with natural structure maps. As a corollary, we use a theorem of Barthelm\'e-Frankel-Mann to show that there is at most one pseudo-Anosov flow without perfect fits transverse to $\mathcal{F}$ up to orbit equivalence.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the mosaic number of Legendrian Knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mosaic tiles were first introduced by Lomonaco and Kauffman in 2008 to describe quantum knots, and have since been studied for their own right. Using a modified set of tiles, front projections of Legendrian knots can be built from mosaics as well. In this work, we compute lower bounds on the mosaic number of Legendrian knots in terms of their classical invariants. We also provide a class of examples that imply sharpness of these bounds in certain cases. An additional construction of Legendrian unknots provides an upper bound on the mosaic number of Legendrian unknots. We also adapt a result of Oh, Hong, Lee, and Lee to give an algorithm to compute the number of Legendrian link mosaics of any given size. Finally, we use a computer search to provide an updated census of known mosaic numbers for Legendrian knots, including all Legendrian knots whose mosaic number is 6 or less.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use Luttinger surgery to show that there are no Lagrangian Klein bottles in $S^2\times S^2$ in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-homology class of an $S^2$-factor if the symplectic area of that factor is at least twice that of the other.</description>

      <title>$f$-vectors of balanced simplicial complexes, flag spheres, and geometric Lefschetz decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that there are $f$-vectors of balanced simplicial complexes giving a source of simplicial complexes exhibiting Boolean a decomposition similar to a geometric Lefschetz decomposition. The objects we are working with are $h$-vectors of flag spheres and balanced simplicial complexes whose $f$-vectors are equal to them. This builds on work of Nevo-Petersen-Tenner on a conjecture of Nevo-Petersen that the gamma vector of an odd-dimensional flag sphere is the $f$-vector of a balanced simplicial complex (which was for barycentric subdivisions by Nevo-Petersen-Tenner). We can connect our decomposition to positivity questions on reciprocal/palindromic polynomials associated to flag spheres and geometric questions motivating them. In addition, we note that that the degrees in the Lefschetz-like decomposition are not halved unlike the usual $h$-vector setting.</description>

      <title>Sharpness of proper and cocompact actions on reductive homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that if $G$ is a noncompact connected real reductive linear Lie group, then any discrete subgroup of $G$ acting properly discontinuously and cocompactly on some homogeneous space $G/H$ of $G$ is quasi-isometrically embedded and sharp for $G/H$, i.e. satisfies a strong, quantitative form of proper discontinuity. For noncompact reductive $H$, this was known as the Sharpness Conjecture, with applications to spectral analysis on pseudo-Riemannian locally symmetric spaces developed in arXiv:1209.4075. For $G/H$ rational of real corank one, we use sharpness to fully characterize properly discontinuous and cocompact actions on $G/H$ in terms of Anosov representations. This enables us to show that in real corank one, acting properly discontinuously and cocompactly on $G/H$ is an open property, and also to prove that a number of homogeneous spaces do not admit compact quotients, such as $\mathrm{SL}(n+1,\mathbb{K})/\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{K})$ for $n&gt;1$ and $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$, or the quaternions.</description>

      <title>Equivariant algebraic concordance of strongly invertible knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11895v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By considering a particular type of invariant Seifert surfaces we define a homomorphism $\Phi$ from the (topological) equivariant concordance group of directed strongly invertible knots $\widetilde{\mathcal{C}}$ to a new equivariant algebraic concordance group $\widetilde{\mathcal{G}}^{\mathbb{Z}}$. We prove that $\Phi$ lifts both Miller and Powell's equivariant algebraic concordance homomorphism, and Alfieri and Boyle's equivariant signature. Moreover, we provide a partial result on the isomorphism type of $\widetilde{\mathcal{G}}^{\mathbb{Z}}$, and we obtain a new obstruction to equivariant sliceness, which can be viewed as an equivariant Fox-Milnor condition. We define new equivariant signatures and using these we obtain novel lower bounds on the equivariant slice genus. Finally, we show that $\Phi$ can obstruct equivariant sliceness for knots with Alexander polynomial one.</description>

      <title>Relative Cubulation of Small Cancellation Free Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.03008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We expand the class of groups with relatively geometric actions on CAT(0) cube complexes by proving that it is closed under $C'(\frac16)$--small cancellation free products. We build upon a result of Martin and Steenbock who prove an analogous result in the more specialized setting of groups acting properly and cocompactly on CAT(0) cube complexes. Our methods make use of the same blown-up complex of groups to construct a candidate collection of walls. However, rather than arguing geometrically, we show relative cubulation by appealing to a boundary separation criterion and proving that wall stabilizers form a sufficiently rich family of full relatively quasiconvex codimension-one subgroups. The additional flexibility of relatively geometric actions has surprising new applications. In particular, we prove that $C'(\frac16)$--small cancellation free products of residually finite groups are residually finite.</description>

      <title>Structure constants for simple Lie algebras from principal $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-triple</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08213v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a simple complex Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, fixing a principal $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-triple and highest weight vectors induces a basis of $\mathfrak{g}$ as vector space. For $\mathfrak{sl}_n$, we describe how to compute the Lie bracket in this basis using transvectants. This generalizes a well-known rule for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ using Poisson brackets and degree 2 monomials in two variables. Our proof method uses a graphical calculus for classical invariant theory. Other Lie algebra types are discussed.</description>
