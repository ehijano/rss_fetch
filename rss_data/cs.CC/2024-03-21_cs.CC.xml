      <title>A combinatorial view of Holant problems on higher domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the Boolean domain, there is a class of symmetric signatures called ``Fibonacci gates" for which a beautiful P-time combinatorial algorithm has been designed for the corresponding $\operatorname{Holant}^*$ problems.
  In this work, we give a combinatorial view for $\operatorname{Holant}^*(\mathcal{F})$ problems on a domain of size 3 where $\mathcal{F}$ is a set of arity 3 functions with inputs taking values on the domain of size 3 and the functions share some common properties. The combinatorial view can also be extended to the domain of size 4.
  Specifically, we extend the definition of "Fibonacci gates" to the domain of size 3 and the domain of size 4. Moreover, we give the corresponding combinatorial algorithms.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Phylogenetic Diversity under Time Pressure: Planning with Extinctions Ahead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic Diversity (PD) is a measure of the overall biodiversity of a set of present-day species (taxa) within a phylogenetic tree. In Maximize Phylogenetic Diversity (MPD) one is asked to find a set of taxa (of bounded size/cost) for which this measure is maximized. MPD is a relevant problem in conservation planning, where there are not enough resources to preserve all taxa and minimizing the overall loss of biodiversity is critical. We consider an extension of this problem, motivated by real-world concerns, in which each taxon not only requires a certain amount of time to save, but also has an extinction time after which it can no longer be saved. In addition there may be multiple teams available to work on preservation efforts in parallel; we consider two variants of the problem based on whether teams are allowed to collaborate on the same taxa. These problems have much in common with machine scheduling problems, (with taxa corresponding to tasks and teams corresponding to machines), but with the objective function (the phylogenetic diversity) inspired by biological considerations. Our extensions are, in contrast to the original MPD, NP-hard, even in very restricted cases. We provide several algorithms and hardness-results and thereby show that the problems are fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized the target phylogenetic diversity, and that the problem where teams are allowed to collaborate is FPT when parameterized the acceptable loss of diversity.</description>

      <title>Rescue Craft Allocation in Tidal Waters of the North and Baltic Sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to improve the average response time for naval accidents in the North and Baltic Sea. To do this we optimize the strategic distribution of the vessel fleet used by the Deutsche Gesellschaft zur Rettung Schiffbr\"uchiger (German Maritime Search and Rescue Service) (DGzRS) across several home stations. Based on these locations, in case of an incoming distress call the vessel with the lowest response time is dispatched. A particularity of the region considered is the fact that due to low tide, at predictable times some vessels and stations are not operational. In our work, we build a corresponding mathematical model for the allocation of rescue crafts to multiple stations. Thereafter, we show that the problem is NP-hard. Next, we provide an Integer Programming (IP) formulation. Finally, we propose several methods of simplifying the model and do a case study to compare their effectiveness. For this, we generate test instances based on real-world data.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-Time Classical Simulation of Noisy IQP Circuits with Constant Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling from the output distributions of quantum computations comprising only commuting gates, known as instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) computations, is believed to be intractable for classical computers, and hence this task has become a leading candidate for testing the capabilities of quantum devices. Here we demonstrate that for an arbitrary IQP circuit undergoing dephasing or depolarizing noise, whose depth is greater than a critical $O(1)$ threshold, the output distribution can be efficiently sampled by a classical computer. Unlike other simulation algorithms for quantum supremacy tasks, we do not require assumptions on the circuit's architecture, on anti-concentration properties, nor do we require $\Omega(\log(n))$ circuit depth. We take advantage of the fact that IQP circuits have deep sections of diagonal gates, which allows the noise to build up predictably and induce a large-scale breakdown of entanglement within the circuit. Our results suggest that quantum supremacy experiments based on IQP circuits may be more susceptible to classical simulation than previously thought.</description>

      <title>On SAT information content, its polynomial-time solvability and fixed code algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The amount of information in satisfiability problem (SAT) is considered. SAT can be polynomial-time solvable when the solving algorithm holds an exponential amount of information. It is also established that SAT Kolmogorov complexity is constant. It is argued that the amount of information in SAT grows at least exponentially with the size of the input instance. The amount of information in SAT is compared with the amount of information in the fixed code algorithms and generated over runtime.</description>
