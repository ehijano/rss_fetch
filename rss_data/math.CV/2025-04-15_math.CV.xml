      <title>Subelliptic and Maximal $L^p$ Estimates for the Complex Green Operator on non-pseudoconvex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove subelliptic estimates for ethe complex Green operator $ K_q $ at a specific level $ q $ of the $ \bar\partial_b $-complex, defined on a not necessarily pseudoconvex CR manifold satisfying the commutator finite type condition. Additionally, we obtain maximal $ L^p $ estimates for $ K_q $ by considering closed-range estimates. Our results apply to a family of manifolds that includes a class of weak $ Y(q) $ manifolds satisfying the condition $ D(q) $. We employ a microlocal decomposition and Calder\'on-Zygmund theory to obtain subelliptic and maximal-$ L^p $ estimates, respectively.</description>

      <title>Prescribing hyperbolic bordered surfaces via combinatorial flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to investigate the fractional combinatorial Calabi flow for hyperbolic bordered surfaces. By Lyapunov theory, it is proved that the flow exists for all time and converges exponentially to a conformal factor that generates a hyperbolic surface whose lengths of boundary components are prescribed positive numbers. Furthermore, a generalized combinatorial Yamabe flow is introduced in the same geometry setting, with the long time existence and convergence established. This result yields an algorithm for searching bordered surfaces, which may accelerate convergence speed.</description>

      <title>On the topology of $B\Gamma_n^\mathbb{C}$ and its application to complex structures on open manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the 1970s, it has been known that any open connected manifold of dimension 2, 4 or 6 admits a complex analytic structure whenever its tangent bundle admits a complex linear structure. For half a century, this has been conjectured to hold true for manifolds of any dimension. In this paper, we extend the result to manifolds of dimension 8 and 10.
  The result is proved by applying Gromov's h-principle in order to adapt a method of Haefliger, originally used to study foliations, to the holomorphic setting. For dimension 12 and greater, the conjecture remains open.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex (affine) lines are a major object of study in complex geometry, but their symplectic aspects are not well understood. We perform a systematic study based on their associated Ahlfors currents. In particular, we generalize (by a different method) a result of Bangert on the existence of complex lines. We show that Ahlfors currents control the asymptotic behavior of families of pseudoholomorphic curves, refining a result of Demailly. Lastly, we show that the space of Ahlfors currents is convex.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of germs (of mappings and sets) over k vs that over K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider real-analytic mapping-germs, (R^n,o)-&gt; (R^m,o). They can be equivalent (by coordinate changes) complex-analytically, but not real-analytically. However, if the transformation of complex-equivalence is identity modulo higher order terms, then it implies the real-equivalence.
  On the other hand, starting from complex-analytic map-germs (C^n,o)-&gt;(C^m,o), and taking any field extension, C to K, one has: if two maps are equivalent over K, then they are equivalent over C.
  These (quite useful) properties seem to be not well known. We prove slightly stronger properties in a more general form:
  * for Maps(X,Y) where X,Y are (formal/analytic/Nash) scheme-germs, with arbitrary singularities, over a base ring k;
  * for the classical groups of (right/left-right/contact) equivalence of Singularity Theory;
  * for faithfully-flat extensions of rings k -&gt; K. In particular, for arbitrary extension of fields, in any characteristic.
  The case ``k is a ring" is important for the study of deformations/unfoldings. E.g. it implies the statement for fields: if a family of maps {f_t} is trivial over K, then it is also trivial over k.
  Similar statements for scheme-germs (``isomorphism over K vs isomorphism over k") follow by the standard reduction ``Two maps are contact equivalent iff their zero sets are ambient isomorphic".
  This study involves the contact equivalence of maps with singular targets, which seems to be not well-established. We write down the relevant part of this theory.</description>

      <title>On Rigid Varieties Isogenous to a Product of Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study rigid complex manifolds that are realized as quotients of a product of curves by a free action of a finite group. They serve as higher-dimensional analogues of Beauville surfaces. Using uniformization, we outline the theory to characterize these manifolds through specific combinatorial data associated with the group under the assumption that the action is diagonal and the manifold is of general type. This leads to the notion of a $n$-fold Beauville structure. We define an action on the set of all $n$-fold Beauville structures of a given finite group that allows us to distinguish the biholomorphism classes of the underlying rigid manifolds. As an application, we give a classification of these manifolds with group $\mathbb Z_5^2$ in the three dimensional case and prove that this is the smallest possible group that allows a rigid, free and diagonal action on a product of three curves. In addition, we provide the classification of rigid 3-folds $X$ given by a group acting faithfully on each factor for any value of the holomorphic Euler number $\chi(\mathcal O_X) \geq -5$.</description>

      <title>Boundedness and compactness of Bergman projection commutators in two-weight setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to study the boundedness and compactness of the Bergman projection commutators in two weighted settings via the weighted BMO and VMO spaces, respectively. The novelty of our work lies in the distinct treatment of the symbol b in the commutator, depending on whether it is analytic or not, which turns out to be quite different. In particular, we show that an additional weight condition due to Aleman, Pott, and Reguera is necessary to study the commutators when b is not analytic, while it can be relaxed when b is analytic. In the analytic setting, we completely characterize boundedness and compactness, while in the non-analytic setting, we provide a sufficient condition which generalizes the Euclidean case and is also necessary in many cases of interest. Our work initiates a study of the commutators acting on complex function spaces with different symbols.</description>

      <title>Regularity in the $\overline{\partial}$--Neumann problem, D'Angelo forms, and Diederich--Forn\ae ss index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article chronicles a development that started around 1990 with \cite{BoasStraube91}, where the authors showed that if a smooth bounded pseudoconvex domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ admits a defining function that is plurisubharmonic at points of the boundary, then the $\overline{\partial}$--Neumann operators on $\Omega$ preserve the Sobolev spaces $W^{s}_{(0,q)}(\Omega)$, $s\geq 0$. The same authors then proved a further regularity result and made explicit the role of D'Angelo forms for regularity (\cite{BoasStraube93}). A few years later, Kohn (\cite{Kohn99}) initiated a quantitative study of the results in \cite{BoasStraube91} by relating the Sobolev level up to which regularity holds to the Diederich--Forn\ae ss index of the domain. Many of these ideas were synthesized and developed further by Harrington (\cite{Harrington11,Harrington19,Harrington22}). Then, around 2020, Liu (\cite{Liu19b, Liu19}) and Yum (\cite{Yum21}) discovered that the DF--index is closely related to certain differential inequalities involving D'Angelo forms. This relationship in turn led to a recent new result which supports the conjecture that DF--index one should imply global regularity in the $\overline{\partial}$--Neumann problem (\cite{LiuStraube22}). Much of the work described above relies heavily on Kohn's groundbreaking contributions to the regularity theory of the $\overline{\partial}$--Neumann problem.</description>

      <title>Classical $6j$-symbols for finite dimensional representation of the algebra $\mathfrak{gl}_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the paper an explicit formula for an arbitrary $6j$-symbol for finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the algebra $\mathfrak{gl}_3$ is derived. A $6j$-symbol is written as a result of substitution of $\pm 1$ into a series of hypergeometric type, which is similar to a $\Gamma$-series, which is a simplest example of a multivariate series of hypergeometric type. The selection rulers for a $6j$-symbol are derived.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An explicit description of the multiplicity space that describes occurrences of irreducible representations in a splitting of a tensor product of two irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ is given. Using this description an explicit formula for an arbitrary $6j$-symbol for the algebra $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ is derived. The $6j$-symbol is expressed through a value of a generalized hypergeometric function.</description>

      <title>Compactness and related properties of weighted composition operators on weighted BMOA spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that a large class of properties coincide for weighted composition operators on a large class of weighted VMOA spaces, including the ones with logarithmic weights and the ones with standard weights $(1-|z|)^{-c}, \ 0\leq c&lt; 1/2$. Some of these properties are compactness, weak compactness, complete continuity and strict singularity. A function-theoretic characterization for these properties is also given. Similar results are also proved for many weighted composition operators on similarly weighted BMOA spaces. The main results extend the theorems given in [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 151 (2023), 1195--1207], and new test functions that are suitable for the weighted setting are developed.</description>
