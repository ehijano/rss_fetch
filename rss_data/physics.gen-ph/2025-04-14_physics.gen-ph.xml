      <title>Progress in evaluating a possible electromagnetic interaction energy in a gravitational field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08015v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lorentz-Poincar\'e interpretation of special relativity (SR) keeps the classical concepts of separated space and time, at the price of postulating an indetectable preferred inertial frame or ``ether". But SR does not contain gravity. The presence of gravity could make the ether detectable. This is one idea behind the ``scalar ether theory of gravitation" (SET), which coincides with SR if the gravity field vanishes, and passes a number of tests. However, the coupling of SET with the Maxwell electromagnetic (EM) field needs to use the theory's dynamical equation for the energy tensor in a non-trivial way. It cannot be assumed that the energy tensors of the charged matter and the EM field add to give the total energy tensor, source of the gravitational field. Thus, an additional, ``interaction" energy tensor ${\bf T}_\mathrm{inter}$ has to be postulated. Asking that ${\bf T}_\mathrm{inter}$ is Lorentz-invariant in the situation of SR, fixes its form. It depends only on a scalar field $p$. ${\bf T}_\mathrm{inter}$ is an exotic kind of matter and is distributed in the whole space, hence it could contribute to dark matter. For a weak gravitational field, $p$ obeys a first-order partial differential equation (PDE) involving the EM field and the Newtonian potential. However, the EM field varies on the scale of the wavelength, which is extremely small. To get the field $p$ in a galaxy, some averaging has to be done. After several attempts based on the homogenization theory, a simpler way has been found recently: If the macro-averages of $p$ and the EM field vary smoothly, it can be shown that the PDE for $p$ remains valid in the same form with spacetime-averaged fields. The current stage of calculations will also been shown.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves beyond the Linear Approximation and Gravitational Wave Reflection</title>

Abstract: We derive a relativistic field equation for the trace of the metric perturbation beyond the weak field approximation to the Einstein field equations. The dynamics is governed by a massive Klein-Gordon equation on curved space-time, where the effective mass of the field is associated with the material and the dark energy content via the cosmological term. We solve the equation in the case of a Schwarzschild black hole and show that it can be cast into an effective Schr\"odinger form with an effective geometric potential which binds the zero angular momentum states. The non-zero angular momentum states experience a positive potential peak before the event horizon pointing to gravitational waves scattering. Black holes scatter gravitational waves and thus we provide an unambiguous testable prediction of black hole existence. The Newtonian limit for this equation points to the possibility of reflecting gravitational waves at interfaces with sharp density boundary, thus opening up gravitational wave propulsion physics. We discuss this type of propulsion in the light of Newton's third law of Mechanics. Compelling questions such as the existence of quanta of this field which may account for the dark matter content are also addressed.</description>
