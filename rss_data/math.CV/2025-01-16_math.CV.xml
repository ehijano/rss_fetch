      <title>Differentiable Singular Value Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singular value decomposition is widely used in modal analysis, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and resolvent analysis, to extract key features from complex problems. SVD derivatives need to be computed efficiently to enable the large scale design optimization. However, for a general complex matrix, no method can accurately compute this derivative to machine precision and remain scalable with respect to the number of design variables without requiring the all of the singular variables. We propose two algorithms to efficiently compute this derivative based on the adjoint method and reverse automatic differentiation and RAD-based singular value derivative formula. Differentiation results for each method proposed were compared with FD results for one square and one tall rectangular matrix example and matched with the FD results to about 5 to 7 digits. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of the proposed method by calculating the derivatives of singular values with respect to the snapshot matrix derived from the POD of a large dataset for a laminar-turbulent transitional flow over a flat plate, sourced from the John Hopkins turbulence database.</description>

      <title>Algebra of slice regular functions on non-symmetric domains in several quaternionic variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primary objective of this paper is to establish an algebraic framework for the space of weakly slice regular functions over several quaternionic variables. We recently introduced a $*$-product that maintains the path-slice property within the class of path-slice functions. It is noteworthy that this $*$-product is directly applicable to weakly slice regular functions, as every slice regular function defined on a slice-open set inherently possesses path-slice properties. Building on this foundation, we propose a precise definition of an open neighborhood for a path $\gamma$ in the path space $\mathscr{P}(\mathbb{C}^n)$. This definition is pivotal in establishing the holomorphism of stem functions. Consequently, we demonstrate that the $*$-product of two weakly slice regular functions retains its weakly slice regular nature. This retention is facilitated by holomorphy of stem functions and their relationship with weakly slice regular functions, providing a comprehensive algebraic structure for this class of functions.</description>

      <title>Zeroes of weakly slice regular functions of several quaternionic variables on non-axially symmetric domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this research, we study zeroes of weakly slice regular functions within the framework of several quaternionic variables, specifically focusing on non-axially symmetric domains. Our recent work introduces path-slice stem functions, along with a novel $*$-product, tailored for weakly slice regular functions. This innovation allows us to explore new techniques for conjugating and symmetrizing path-slice functions. A key finding of our study is the discovery that the zeroes of a path-slice function are comprehensively encapsulated within the zeroes of its symmetrized counterpart. This insight is particularly significant in the context of path-slice stem functions. We establish that for weakly slice regular functions, the processes of conjugation and symmetrization gain prominence once the function's slice regularity is affirmed. Furthermore, our investigation sheds light on the intricate nature of the zeroes of a slice regular function. We ascertain that these zeroes constitute a path-slice analytic set. This conclusion is drawn from the observed phenomenon that the zeroes of the symmetrization of a slice regular function also form a path-slice analytic set. This finding marks an advancement in understanding the complex structure and properties of weakly slice regular functions in quaternionic analysis.</description>

      <title>Runge and Mergelyan theorems on families of open Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the Oka theory for maps from families of open Riemann surfaces to any Oka manifold. Along the way, we prove Runge and Mergelyan approximation theorems and Weierstrass interpolation theorem for families of complex structures on a smooth open surface, with continuous or smooth dependence of the data and the approximating functions on the complex structure. This implies global solvability of the $\overline\partial$-equation on such families. We also obtain an Oka principle for complex line bundles on families of open Riemann surfaces, and we show that the canonical bundles of open Riemann surfaces are holomorphically trivial in families. We include applications to directed holomorphic immersions and conformal minimal immersions.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Calabi flow for ideal circle pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the combinatorial Calabi flow for ideal circle patterns in both hyperbolic and Euclidean background geometry. We prove that the flow exists for all time and converges exponentially fast to an ideal circle pattern metric on surfaces with prescribed attainable curvatures. As a consequence, we provide an algorithm to find the desired ideal circle patterns.</description>
