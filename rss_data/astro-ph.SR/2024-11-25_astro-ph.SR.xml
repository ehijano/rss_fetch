      <title>Hot and cool: Characterising the companions of red supergiant stars in binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study the nature of the recently identified populations of hot companions to red supergiant stars (RSGs). To this end, we compile the literature on the most well characterised systems with the aim of better understanding the hot companions identified with ultra-violet photometry and confirmed with Hubble Space Telescope spectra in the Local Group. We identify 9 systems with current masses greater than around 8 solar masses that have constraints on their orbital periods, which are in the range 3 to 75a. Antares (Alpha Sco) is the obvious outlier in this distribution, having an estimated orbital period of around 2000 a. Mass-ratio (q=M2/MRSG) estimates are available only for 5 of the compiled systems and range between 0.16 &lt; q &lt; 1. Ongoing efforts to identify and characterise hot companions to RSGs in the SMC have revealed 88 hot companions that have observational constraints free of contamination from the RSG component. We present a summary of a recently conducted HST UV spectroscopic survey that aims to characterise a subset of these companions. These companions show a flat-q distribution in the range 0.3 &lt; q &lt; 1.</description>

      <title>Protosolar D-to-H abundance and one part-per-billion PH$_{3}$ in the coldest brown dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14541v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coldest Y spectral type brown dwarfs are similar in mass and temperature to cool and warm ($\sim$200 -- 400 K) giant exoplanets. We can therefore use their atmospheres as proxies for planetary atmospheres, testing our understanding of physics and chemistry for these complex, cool worlds. At these cold temperatures, their atmospheres are cold enough for water clouds to form, and chemical timescales increase, increasing the likelihood of disequilibrium chemistry compared to warmer classes of planets. JWST observations are revolutionizing the characterization of these worlds with high signal-to-noise, moderate resolution near- and mid-infrared spectra. The spectra have been used to measure the abundances of prominent species like water, methane, and ammonia; species that trace chemical reactions like carbon monoxide; and even isotopologues of carbon monoxide and ammonia. Here, we present atmospheric retrieval results using both published fixed-slit (GTO program 1230) and new averaged time series observations (GO program 2327) of the coldest known Y dwarf, WISE 0855-0714 (using NIRSpec G395M spectra), which has an effective temperature of $\sim$ 264 K. We present a detection of deuterium in an atmosphere outside of the solar system via a relative measurement of deuterated methane (CH$_{3}$D) and standard methane. From this, we infer the D/H ratio of a substellar object outside the solar system for the first time. We also present a well-constrained part-per-billion abundance of phosphine (PH$_{3}$). We discuss our interpretation of these results and the implications for brown dwarf and giant exoplanet formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Unequivocal detection of the tidal deformation of a red giant in a binary system via interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While mass transfer in binary systems is a crucial aspect of binary evolution models, it remains far from understood. HD 352 is a spectroscopic binary exhibiting ellipsoidal variability, likely due to a tidally deformed giant donor filling its Roche lobe and transferring matter to a faint companion. Here, we analyse VLTI/PIONIER interferometric observations of the system, obtained between 2010 to 2020. We demonstrate that observations near the system's quadrature cannot be explained by simple symmetric disk models, but are consistent with the shape of a Roche-lobe-filling star. We think that this is the first case of tidal deformation of a red giant being observed directly, thanks to the interferometric technique. By combining our interferometric modeling results with the analysis of the optical spectrum, multi-frequency spectral energy distribution, and published radial velocities and light curves, we constrain the system parameters and show that HD 352 will likely soon enter the common envelope phase, although we cannot reject the hypothesis that it is undergoing stable mass transfer against theoretical predictions. This has important consequences for modeling a large class of binary systems. Additionally, our observations confirm that Roche-lobe-filling giants can be resolved with interferometry under favorable conditions. Such observations may help resolve the mass transfer dichotomy in systems like symbiotic binaries, where the predominant mass transfer mode remains unclear.</description>

      <title>Constraining the progenitor of the nearby Type II-P SN 2024ggi with environmental analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The progenitors of Type II-P supernovae (SN) have been confirmed to be red supergiants. However, the upper mass limit of the directly probed progenitors is much lower than that predicted by current theories, and the accurate determination of the progenitor masses is key to understand the final fate of massive stars. Located at a distance of only 6.72 Mpc, the Type II-P SN 2024ggi is one of the closest SN in the last decade. Previous studies have analyzed its progenitor by direct detection, but the derived progenitor mass may be influenced by the very uncertain circumstellar extinction and pulsational brightness variability. In this work, we try to constrain the progenitor mass with an environmental analysis based on images from the Hubble Space Telescope. We found that stars in the progenitor environment have a uniform spatial distribution without significant clumpiness, and we derived the star formation history of the environment with a hierarchical Bayesian method. The progenitor is associated with the youngest population in the SN environment with an age of log($t$/yr) = 7.41 (i.e. 25.7 Myr), which corresponds to an initial mass of $10.2^{+0.06}_{-0.09}$ $M_\odot$. Our work provides an independent measurement of the progenitor mass, which is not affected by circumstellar extinction and pulsational brightness variability.</description>

      <title>A detailed investigation of particle energisation mechanisms in models of collapsing magnetic traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a detailed investigation of the energisation processes in two-dimensional, two and a half-dimensional and three-dimensional collapsing magnetic trap models. Using kinematic magnetohydrodynamic models of collapsing magnetic traps, we examine the importance of Fermi acceleration in comparison with betatron acceleration in these models. We extend previous work by investigating particle orbits in two-dimensional models without and with a guide field component and from full three-dimensional models. We compare the outcomes for the different models and how they depend on the chosen initial conditions. While in the literature betatron acceleration has been emphasised as the major mechanism for particle energisation in collapsing magnetic traps, we find that Fermi acceleration can play a significant role as well for particle orbits with suitable initial conditions.</description>

      <title>pyEQUIB Python Package, an addendum to proEQUIB: IDL Library for Plasma Diagnostics and Abundance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emission lines from ionized nebulae allow us to determine their physical and chemical properties, along with the interstellar extinction. "pyEQUIB" is a pure Python open-source package including several application programming interface (API) functions that can be employed for plasma diagnostics, abundance analysis of collisionally excited lines (CEL) and recombination lines (RL) in nebular astrophysics, and extinction analysis of Balmer lines. This package implements the IDL library "proEQUIB" in Python and couples it with the "AtomNeb" Python package. This package relies on the Python packages NumPy and SciPy. The API functions of this package can be used for studies of ionized nebulae by astronomers who are familiar with the high-level, general-purpose programming language Python.</description>

      <title>Time evolution of o-H$_2$D$^+$, N$_2$D$^+$, and N$_2$H$^+$ during the high-mass star formation process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deuterium fractionation is a well-established evolutionary tracer in low-mass star formation, but its applicability to the high-mass regime remains an open question. The abundances and ratios of deuterated species have often been proposed as reliable evolutionary indicators for different stages of the high-mass star formation. We investigate the role of N$_2$H$^+$ and key deuterated molecules as tracers of the different stages of the high-mass star formation, and test whether their abundance ratios can serve as reliable evolutionary indicators. We conducted APEX observations of o-H$_2$D$^+$ (1$_{10}$-1$_{11}$), N$_2$H$^+$ (4-3), and N$_2$d$^+$ (3-2) in 40 high-mass clumps at different evolutionary stages, selected from the ATLASGAL survey. Molecular column densities ($N$) and abundances ($X$), were derived through spectral line modelling, both under local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE conditions. The $N$(o-H$_2$D$^+$) show the smallest deviation from LTE results when derived under non-LTE assumptions. In contrast, N$_2$D$^+$ shows the largest discrepancy between the $N$ derived from LTE and non-LTE. In all the cases discussed, we found that $X$(o-H$_2$D$^+$) decreases more significantly with time than in the case of $X$(N$_2$D$^+$); whereas $X$(N$_2$H$^+$) increases slightly. Therefore, the validity of the recently proposed $X$(o-H$_2$D$^+$)/$X$(N$_2$D$^+$) ratio as a reliable evolutionary indicator was not observed for this sample. While the deuteration fraction derived from N$_2$D$^+$ and N$_2$H$^+$ clearly decreases with clump evolution, the interpretation of this trend is complex, given the different distribution of the two tracers. Our results suggest that a careful consideration of the observational biases and beam-dilution effects are crucial for an accurate interpretation of the evolution of the deuteration process during the high-mass star formation process.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Future of Exoplanets: Asteroseismic Confirmation of Subgiant and Red Giant Hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asteroseismology has emerged as a powerful tool to unravel the intricate relationships between evolved stars and their planetary systems. In this study, we leverage this technique to investigate the evolutionary stages of five exoplanet host stars, each exhibiting solar-like oscillations. Building on our previous work that identified two host stars as red clump and red giant branch (RGB) stars, this study focuses on a new and broader sample. By precisely measuring asteroseismic parameters such as the period spacing of dipole gravity modes ($\Delta\Pi_{1}$), we provide definitive confirmation of these stars' evolutionary states as subgiants or RGB stars. These results are not only crucial for understanding the internal structures of evolved stars but also for predicting the eventual fate of their planetary companions, which may face engulfment as their host stars expand. This research highlights the profound role of asteroseismology in advancing our knowledge of planetary system evolution and opens new pathways for exploring how stellar evolution impacts planetary survival. Our findings set the stage for future studies on the dynamic fates of exoplanets, providing key insights into the intricate processes of stellar and planetary evolution.</description>

      <title>Starkiller: subtracting stars and other sources from IFU spectroscopic data through forward modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present starkiller, an open-source Python package for forward-modeling flux retrieval from integral field unit spectrograph (IFU) datacubes. Starkiller simultaneously provides stellar spectral classification, relative velocity, and line-of-sight extinction for all sources in a catalog, alongside a source-subtracted datacube. It performs synthetic difference imaging by simulating all catalog sources in the field of view, using the catalog for positions and fluxes to scale stellar models, independent of the datacube. This differencing method is particularly powerful for subtracting both point-sources and trailed or even streaked sources from extended astronomical objects. We demonstrate starkiller's effectiveness in improving observations of extended sources in dense stellar fields for VLT/MUSE observations of comets, asteroids and nebulae. We also show that starkiller can treat satellite-impacted VLT/MUSE observations. The package could be applied to tasks as varied as dust extinction in clusters and stellar variability; the stellar modeling using Gaia fluxes is provided as a standalone function. The techniques can be expanded to imagers and to other IFUs.</description>

      <title>Mining double-line spectroscopic candidates in the LAMOST medium-resolution spectroscopic survey using human-AI hybrid method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We utilize a hybrid approach that integrates the traditional cross-correlation function (CCF) and machine learning to detect spectroscopic multi-systems, specifically focusing on double-line spectroscopic binary (SB2). Based on the ninth data release (DR9) of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), which includes a medium-resolution survey (MRS) containing 29,920,588 spectra, we identify 27,164 double-line and 3124 triple-line spectra, corresponding to 7096 SB2 candidates and 1903 triple-line spectroscopic binary (SB3) candidates, respectively, representing about 1% of the selection dataset from LAMOST-MRS DR9. Notably, 70.1% of the SB2 candidates and 89.6% of the SB3 candidates are newly identified. Compared to using only the traditional CCF technique, our method significantly improves the efficiency of detecting SB2, saves time on visual inspections by a factor of four.</description>

      <title>On the effective spin-mass ratio '$\chi_{\rm eff}-q$' relation of binary black hole mergers that evolved in isolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ground-based measurement of gravitational waves (GW) from merging binary black holes (BBH) uniquely allows determination of spins of stellar-remnant black holes (BH), thereby offering insights into their formation mechanisms. The observed population of BBH mergers exhibits two intriguing peculiarities related to BH spins, namely, a positively biased distribution of effective spin parameter, $\chi_{\rm eff}$, and an apparent anti-correlation between merger mass ratio, $q$, and $\chi_{\rm eff}$. Here we investigate the potential mechanisms for such observed properties, in BBH mergers via isolated binary evolution. We synthesize BBH mergers with the fast binary evolution code BSE. The role of various physical assumptions is explored, including tidal spin-up, compact remnant mass, and mass transfer physics. We compare the properties of WR-BH binaries that formed through stable mass transfer (SMT) and common envelope evolution (CE). We find that both the asymmetry in $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution and the $\chi_{\rm eff}-q$ anti-correlation are natural outcomes of isolated-binary BBH formation with the standard assumptions on mass transfer physics. The anti-correlation is particularly pronounced for SMT-channel BBH mergers that experience a mass-ratio-reversal, i.e., those where the second-born BH is the more massive member. The anti-correlation arises from the dependence of orbital shrinking during mass transfer and the Roche lobe size on the system's mass ratio. This characteristic $\chi_{\rm eff}-q$ trend diminishes with increasing metallicity and when the isolated-binary BBH merger population is mixed with a significant contribution of dynamically formed BBH mergers. Our results demonstrate that isolated massive binary evolution via the SMT sub-channel can reproduce the observable BBH merger population, with characteristic signatures in mass, mass ratio, and spin distributions.[abr.]</description>

      <title>PDS 70b Shows Stellar-like Carbon-to-Oxygen Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\sim$5 Myr PDS 70 is the only known system with protoplanets residing in the cavity of the circumstellar disk from which they formed, ideal for studying exoplanet formation and evolution within its natal environment. Here we report the first spin constraint and C/O measurement of PDS 70b from Keck/KPIC high-resolution spectroscopy. We detected CO (3.8 $\sigma$) and H$_2$O (3.5 $\sigma$) molecules in the PDS 70b atmosphere via cross-correlation, with a combined CO and H$_2$O template detection significance of 4.2 $\sigma$. Our forward model fits, using BT-Settl model grids, provide an upper limit for the spin-rate of PDS 70b ($&lt;$29 km s$^{-1}$). The atmospheric retrievals constrain the PDS 70b C/O ratio to ${0.28}^{+0.20}_{-0.12}$ ($&lt;$0.63 under 95$\%$ confidence level) and a metallicity [C/H] of ${-0.2}^{+0.8}_{-0.5}$ dex, consistent with that of its host star. The following scenarios can explain our measured C/O of PDS 70b in contrast with that of the gas-rich outer disk (for which C/O $\gtrsim$ 1). First, the bulk composition of PDS 70b might be dominated by dust+ice aggregates rather than disk gas. Another possible explanation is that the disk became carbon-enriched $\textit{after}$ PDS 70b was formed, as predicted in models of disk chemical evolution and as observed in both very low mass star and older disk systems with $\textit{JWST}$/MIRI. Because PDS 70b continues to accrete and its chemical evolution is not yet complete, more sophisticated modeling of the planet and the disk, and higher quality observations of PDS 70b (and possibly PDS 70c), are necessary to validate these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Examining the rotation of the planet-hosting M dwarf GJ 3942</title>

Abstract: Based on radial velocities, EXORAP photometry, and activity indicators, the HADES team reported a 16.3-day rotation period for the M dwarf GJ 3942. However, an RV--H$\alpha$ magnitude-squared coherence estimate has significant peaks at frequencies 1/16 cycles/day and 1/32 cycles/day. We re-analyze HADES data plus Hipparcos, SuperWASP, and TESS photometry to see whether the rotation period could be 32 days with 16-day harmonic. SuperWASP shows no significant periodicities, while the Hipparcos observing cadence is suboptimal for detecting 16- and 32-day periodicities. Although the average TESS periodogram has peaks at harmonics of 1/16 cycles/day, the harmonic sequence is not fully resolved according to the Rayleigh criterion. The TESS observations suggest a 1/16 cycles/day rotation frequency and a 1/32 cycles/day subharmonic, though resolution makes the TESS rotation detection ambiguous.</description>

      <title>Shaping Outflows and Jets by Ambient Pressure: a Unified Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrophysical outflows are ubiquitous across cosmic scales, from stellar to galactic systems. While diverse launching mechanisms have been proposed, we demonstrate that these outflows share a fundamental commonality: their morphology follows the physics of pressure-confined supersonic flows. By extending classical deLaval nozzle theory to account for ambient pressure gradients, we present a unified framework that successfully describes outflows from young stellar objects to active galactic nuclei. Our model reveals a remarkable consistency in pressure profiles, characterized by a power-law exponent near minus two, independent of the internal characteristics of the outflow or the nature of central engine. This discovery suggests a universal mechanism for outflow collimation and acceleration, bridging the gap between theoretical models and observational features across a wide range of astronomical scales.</description>

      <title>First Calculations of Starspot Spectra based on 3D Radiative Magnetohydrodynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate calculations of starspot spectra are essential for multiple applications in astronomy. The current standard is to represent starspot spectra by spectra of stars that are cooler than the quiet star regions. This implies approximating a starspot as a non-magnetic 1D structure in radiative-convective equilibrium, parametrizing convective energy transport by mixing length theory. It is the inhibition of convection by the starspot magnetic field that is emulated by using a lower spot temperature relative to the quiet stellar regions. Here, we take a different approach avoiding the approximate treatment of convection and instead self-consistently accounting for the interaction between matter, radiation, and the magnetic field. We simulate spots on G2V, K0V, M0V stars with the 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamics code MURaM and calculate spectra ($R \approx 500$ from 250~nm to 6000~nm) using ray-by-ray radiative transfer with the MPS-ATLAS code. We find that the 1D models fail to return accurate umbral and penumbral spectra on K0V and M0V stars where convective and radiative transfer of energy is simultaneously important over a broad range of atmospheric heights rendering mixing length theory inaccurate. However, 1D models work well for G2V stars, where both radiation and convection significantly contribute to energy transfer only in a narrow region near the stellar surface. Quantitatively, the 1D approximation leads to errors longward of 500 nm of about 50\% for both umbral and penumbral flux contrast relative to quiet star regions on M0V stars, and less than 2\% (for umbrae) and 10\% (for penumbrae) for G2V stars.</description>
