      <title>Predicting the energies of Cf17+ for an optical clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly charged ions (HCIs) combine compact electronic structure with strong relativistic effects, offering both robustness against external perturbations and enhanced sensitivity to variations of the fine-structure constant. Recent advances in sympathetic cooling and trapping enable precision measurements of highly charged ions; however, fully exploiting their potential requires accurate theoretical predictions. In particular, reliable calculations of clock wavelengths are essential for experimentally locating HCI clock transitions. Here, we treat Cf17+ as a univalent ion and perform calculations within the relativistic coupled-cluster framework, iteratively including nonlinear single-double contributions and valence and core triple excitations. We also assess quantum-electrodynamic corrections and basis-set and partial-wave truncation effects. Our results establish the impact of different correlation contributions on the low-lying energy spectrum and provide a quantitatively reliable prediction of the 5f_5/2 - 6p_1/2 clock transition, highlighting the critical role of core-valence correlations and iterative triples for precision spectroscopy and optical clock development.</description>

      <title>Design of Robust Raman Pulses for Cold Atom Interferometers Based on the Krotov Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of high-precision cold-atom interferometers, which are important for applications in gravimetry and fundamental physics, is often limited by noise and imperfections in the driving laser system. To address this, we propose and numerically demonstrate a method for designing robust Raman pulses using the Krotov quantum optimal control algorithm. We establish a theoretical model for the atom-laser interaction and detail the implementation of the Krotov method to optimize the temporal shape of the pulse's amplitude and phase. Numerical simulations indicate that, compared to standard pulses, the optimized pulses maintain high atomic manipulation fidelity over an extended range of laser frequency detunings and intensity fluctuations. Furthermore, in simulations of a full interferometer sequence, this robustness translates to a significant enhancement in the final fringe contrast under a systematic detuning. This work demonstrates that quantum optimal control is a promising pathway for suppressing experimental noise and improving the signal-to-noise ratio and precision of next-generation atomic sensors.</description>

      <title>Sub-part-per-trillion test of the Standard Model with atomic hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum electrodynamics (QED), the first relativistic quantum field theory, describes light-matter interactions at a fundamental level and is one of the pillars of the Standard Model (SM). Through the extraordinary precision of QED, the SM predicts the energy levels of simple systems such as the hydrogen atom with up to 13 significant digits, making hydrogen spectroscopy an ideal test bed. The consistency of physical constants extracted from different transitions in hydrogen using QED, such as the proton charge radius $r_\mathrm{p}$, constitutes a test of the theory. However, values of $r_\mathrm{p}$ from recent measurements of atomic hydrogen are partly discrepant with each other and with a more precise value from spectroscopy of muonic hydrogen. This prevents a test of QED at the level of experimental uncertainties. Here we present a measurement of the 2S-6P transition in atomic hydrogen with sufficient precision to distinguish between the discrepant values of $r_\mathrm{p}$ and enable rigorous testing of QED and the SM overall. Our result $\nu^{}_{\text{2S-6P}}$ = 730,690,248,610.79(48) kHz gives a value of $r_\mathrm{p}$ = 0.8406(15) fm at least 2.5-fold more precise than from other atomic hydrogen determinations and in excellent agreement with the muonic value. The SM prediction of the transition frequency (730,690,248,610.79(23) kHz) is in excellent agreement with our result, testing the SM to 0.7 parts per trillion (ppt) and, specifically, bound-state QED corrections to 0.5 parts per million (ppm), their most precise test so far.</description>

      <title>Multielectron ionization in O$_2^+$ driven by intense infrared laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend a recently developed three-dimensional semiclassical model [\href{https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.109.033106}{Phys. Rev. \textbf{A} 109, 033106 (2024)}] to study multielectron ionization and the formation of highly excited Rydberg states in O$_{2}^+$ driven by intense infrared laser pulses. Our model fully accounts for the Coulomb interaction between all particles, except for the Coulomb repulsion between bound electrons which is replaced by effective potentials. This replacement overcomes the hurdle of artificial autoinization. In addition, the multielectron motion is treated on an equal footing with nuclear motion, that is, electrons and nuclei are both allowed to move at the same time. We focus on triple and double ionization as well as frustrated triple and double ionization. For these processes, we identify and explain the main features of the sum of the kinetic energies of the final ion fragments resulting from the break-up of O$_{2}^+$. We also describe a physical mechanism that underlies frustrated triple ionization.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbital entanglement in Cr$^{3+}$-doped glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A framework for reconstructing the one-electron spinors $\Gamma_7$ and $\Gamma_8$ of Cr$^{3+}$ embedded in glasses from optical measurements has been developed. From the spinors, the spin-orbital von Neumann entropy can be calculated. An aluminum phosphate glass doped with 1 mol % chromium is prepared, and its optical absorption spectrum is recorded to validate the method. The spin-orbit coupling constant, crystal field strength, and Racah parameters are obtained from the absorption spectrum. Subsequently, the spin-orbital entanglement entropy is calculated and analyzed for a family of chromium-doped glasses. It is found that individually, neither the spin-orbit coupling constant, nor the crystal field strength, nor the Racah parameters correlate with the entanglement entropy. In contrast, the ratio between the spin-orbit coupling constant and the crystal field strength correlates linearly with the entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Ultraviolet Dual-Comb Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical frequency comb has made a significant impact in precision spectroscopy and on our ability to probe atomic, molecular and, recently, nuclear transitions to further our understanding of their fundamental properties and how their dynamics and complex interactions affect the observed world. To expand the energy scales and types of systems that can be studied, frequency comb sources from terahertz to vacuum ultraviolet frequencies and beyond have been pursued. Dual-comb spectroscopy, enabled by the development of these frequency comb sources, allows broadband absorption measurements of complicated spectra, exceeding the limitations of direct, single-comb spectroscopy. To date, however, the dual-comb approach has not been able to directly access many important transitions that lie at challenging vacuum ultraviolet wavelengths. Here, we demonstrate dual-comb spectroscopy in the vacuum ultraviolet utilizing intracavity high harmonic generation. This multi-harmonic source is used to measure molecular absorbance spectra at $\lambda=210$~nm and $\lambda=149$~nm from room-temperature samples of acetylene and ammonia, respectively. These measurements resolve the Doppler broadened structure of congested molecular spectra with absolute frequency accuracy. Noise contributions to the vacuum ultraviolet dual-comb spectroscopy measurements are characterized, guiding future efforts and technological development in this region.</description>

      <title>Optical transport of cold atoms to quantum degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient transport of cold atoms is essential for continuous operation, enabling applications ranging from atomic lasers to continuously operated qubits. However, deep potentials required to overcome vibrations, axial trap nonuniformity and insufficient cooling have limited transport of cold atoms near quantum degeneracy. Here we demonstrate rapid optical transport of cold atoms to Bose-Einstein condensation using a moving optical lattice formed by two Bessel beams. A gas of $3 \times 10^5$ ytterbium atoms at a temperature of $340\,$nK is transported over $34\,$cm in $350\,$ms with efficiency over $60\%$. Furthermore, a degenerate gas of $1 \times 10^5$ atoms with a $40\%$ condensate fraction emerges from the phase synchronization process driven by atomic interactions. This demonstration enables the fast preparation of ultracold atomic beams and large-scale atom arrays for quantum sensing, simulation and computing.</description>

      <title>Dirac Spin Liquid Candidate in a Rydberg Quantum Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate a frustrated spin-exchange antiferromagnet in a quantum simulator, composed of N = 114 dipolar Rydberg atoms arranged into a kagome array. Motivated by a recent theoretical proposal of a gapless U(1) Dirac spin liquid ground state, we use local addressing to adiabatically prepare low-energy states. We measure the local polarization and spin-spin correlations over this adiabatic protocol, and observe our system move from a staggered product state, through an intermediate magnetic crystal, and finally into a disordered, correlated liquid. We estimate the entropy density of this atomic liquid to be similar to that of frustrated magnetic insulators at liquid nitrogen temperatures. We compare the correlations in our liquid to those of a simple, parameter-free ansatz for the Dirac spin liquid, and find good agreement in the sign structure and spatial decay. Finally, we probe the static susceptibility of our system to a local field perturbation and to a geometrical distortion. Our results establish Rydberg atom arrays as a promising platform for the preparation and microscopic characterization of quantum spin liquid candidates.</description>

      <title>A cryogenic buffer gas beam source with in-situ ablation target replacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design and performance of a cryogenic buffer gas beam (CBGB) source with a load-lock system is presented. The ACME III electron electric dipole moment (eEDM) search experiment uses this source to produce a beam of cold, slow thorium monoxide (ThO) molecules. A key feature of the apparatus is its capability to replace ablation targets without interrupting vacuum or cryogenic conditions, increasing the average signal in the eEDM search. The source produces approximately $1.3 \times 10^{11}$ ground-state ThO molecules per pulse, with a rotational temperature of $4.8$ K, molecular beam solid angle of $0.31$ sr, and forward velocity of $200$ m/s. These parameters match the performance of traditional sources that require time-consuming thermal cycles for target replacement. A long-term yield improvement of about 40% is achieved when the load-lock system is used to replace targets biweekly.</description>

      <title>Efficient optical configurations for trapped-ion entangling gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-fidelity and parallel realization in scalable platforms of the two-qubit entangling gates fundamental to universal quantum computing constitutes one of the largest challenges in implementing fault-tolerant quantum computation. Integrated optical addressing of trapped-ion qubits offers routes to scaling the high-fidelity optical control demonstrated to date in small systems. Here we show that in addition to scaling, capabilities practically enabled by integrated optics can substantially alleviate laser powers required for both light-shift (LS) and Molmer-Sorensen (MS) geometric phase gates acting on long-lived ground-state qubit encodings in a broad range of ion species. In the proposed gate schemes utilizing carrier nulling via ion positioning at phase-stable standing-wave (SW) nodes, our calculations suggest that suppressed spontaneous photon scattering at the SW node allows for gate drives operating at smaller Raman detunings, resulting in approximately an order-of-magnitude reduction in power requirement (and significantly larger in certain parameter regimes) for gates of a given duration and scattering-limited fidelity as compared to conventional running wave (RW)-based approaches. The SW schemes have the additional benefit of simultaneously eliminating undesired coherent couplings that typically limit gate speeds. Our work quantifies power requirements for multiple ion species and enhancements to be expected from carrier-nulled configurations practically enabled by integrated delivery, and informs experiments and systems for realization of fast and power-efficient laser-based entangling gates in scalable platforms.</description>

      <title>Direct Measurement of the $5s5p\,{}^1P_1 \to 5s4d\,{}^1D_2$ Decay Rate in Strontium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first direct experimental determination of the branching ratio of the $5s4d\,{}^1D_2 \to 5s5p\,{}^3P_2$ transition and the decay rate of the $5s5p\,{}^1P_1 \to 5s4d\,{}^1D_2$ transition in neutral strontium. For more than four decades, these quantities lacked an experimental determination independent of theoretical input. We measure the branching ratio to be $0.177(4)$, significantly lower than the widely cited theoretical value of $0.322$ [C. W. Bauschlicher Jr. {\it et al.}, J. Phys. B \textbf{18}, 1523 (1985)]. We also determine the decay rate to be $5.3(5)\times10^3\,\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, consistent with the value reported by Hunter [L. R. Hunter {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{56}, 823 (1986)] but substantially lower than the recent theoretical prediction of $9.25(40)\times10^3\,\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ [A. Cooper {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. X \textbf{8}, 041055 (2018)]. These measurements provide an experimental benchmark for quantitative modeling of loss processes in laser cooling and single-atom fluorescence detection in optical tweezers with Sr.</description>

      <title>Dual Magnetic and Electric Dipole Symmetry: Pseudo Angular Momentum in Parity Space and the Electric Land\'e $g$-Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: EDMs probe fundamental symmetries and underpin BSM searches. We give a symmetry-based description, analogous to the Zeeman effect, that puts magnetic and electric dipoles on equal footing under EM duality. In hydrogen, $\vec B$ (pseudovector) couples to $\hat{\vec J}$ and reduces $SO(4)$ to $SO(2)$ generated by $\hat J_z$. A static $\vec E$ (polar) couples within a fixed $n$ to a scaled Runge-Lenz operator $\hat{\vec A}_{\rm sc}$, mixes parities, and preserves $SO(2)\times SO(2)$ generated by $\hat J_z$ and $\hat A_{{\rm sc},z}$. This motivates a pseudo-angular momentum $\hat{\vec J}_p$ built from $\hat{\vec A}_{\rm sc}$ and a Land\'e factor $g_E$, so the orbital dipole is $\hat{\vec d}_{\rm orb}=g_E d_B \hat{\vec J}_p/\hbar$, with $d_B=ea_0=2\mu_B/(c\alpha)$. Stark mixing of $2s$ and $2p_{m=0}$ gives $|\langle d_{\rm orb}\rangle|=3d_B$ ($g_E=3$). Following Ohanian's magnetisation formalism, we construct its electric dual: the microscopic polarisation $\vec P$ has nonzero curl, defining a magnetic probability current $\vec J_m=-\epsilon_0^{-1}\nabla\times\vec P$, and the EDM expectation is $\langle \hat{\vec d}_{\rm tot}\rangle=-\frac{\epsilon_0}{2}\int \vec r\times \vec J_m\, d^3r=d_B\big[g_E\langle \hat{\vec J}_p\rangle/\hbar+g_E^{e}\langle \hat{\vec S}\rangle/\hbar\big]$, with $g_E^{e}=2d_{\rm int}/d_B$. Here $\hat{\vec S}$ encodes any intrinsic EDM $d_{\rm int}$, while $\hat{\vec J}_p$ captures the Stark-induced pseudo-angular momentum from Runge-Lenz symmetry. The dual framework shows that induced EDMs may be described by circulating magnetic probability currents, mirroring magnetic dipoles from circulating electric probability currents.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodic nondipole ionization dynamics in the x-ray stabilization regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in strong x-ray laser techniques enable the study of nonlinear multiphoton ionization in extreme high-frequency fields. Although the stabilization regime in such fields is theoretically established, its modified properties in the nondipole regime for long laser pulses remains unknown. Here, we numerically investigate the strong-field ionization of an atom in a long XUV laser pulse in the nondipole regime. Our study of the time-dependent quantum dynamics reveals a quasiperiodic modulation of the ionization yield as a function of pulse duration. We demonstrate that the Coulomb-field-induced slow oscillation of the ionized electron wave packet during the interaction is responsible for the observed modulation of the ionization yield. Furthermore, we scrutinize the unusual photon momentum sharing between the photoelectron and the ion in this extreme regime. These effects are observable in upcoming x-ray free-electron laser facilities.</description>

Abstract: Rapidly oscillating, inhomogeneous electromagnetic field from laser exert a force that repels charged particles from regions of high light intensity. We propose and analyze a flat-bottomed hollow-beam ponderomotive optical trap for an ultracold neutral plasma (UNP), driven by a high-power CO$_2$ laser. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the plasma and Rydberg atoms are effectively trapped within a nearly uniform dark region bounded by repulsive light walls. In contrast to RF traps, flat-bottomed traps yield a small density-weighted mean ponderomotive energy per electron, while the UNP collision frequency is far below the laser frequency, thereby making collisional absorption negligible and does not limit the lifetime of the trap. This approach could enhance antimatter production and storage.</description>

      <title>Imaginary gauge potentials in a non-Hermitian spin-orbit coupled quantum gas</title>

Abstract: In 1996, Hatano and Nelson proposed a non-Hermitian lattice model containing an imaginary Peierls phase [Phys. Rev. Lett. 77 570-573 (1996)], which subsequent analyses revealed to be an instance of a new class of topological systems. Here, we experimentally realize a continuum analog to this model containing an imaginary gauge potential using a homogeneous spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Non-Hermiticity is introduced by adding tunable spin-dependent loss via microwave coupling to a subspace with spontaneous emission. We demonstrate that the resulting Heisenberg equations of motion for position and momentum depend explicitly on the system's phase-space distribution. First, we observe collective nonreciprocal transport in real space, with a "self-acceleration" that decreases with the BEC's spatial extent, consistent with non-Hermitian Gross-Pitaevskii simulations. We then examine localized edge states: the relatively strong interactions in our BEC suppress the formation of topological edge states, yielding instead highly excited states localized by an interplay between self-acceleration and wavefunction spreading. Finally, we confirm that our non-Hermitian description remains valid at all times by comparing to a multi-level master-equation treatment.</description>

      <title>A cavity array microscope for parallel single-atom interfacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutral atom arrays and optical cavity QED systems have developed in parallel as central pillars of modern experimental quantum science. While each platform has demonstrated exceptional capabilities-such as high-fidelity quantum logic in atom arrays, and strong light-matter coupling in cavities-their combination holds promise for realizing fast and non-destructive atom measurement, building large-scale quantum networks, and engineering hybrid atom-photon Hamiltonians. However, to date, experiments integrating the two platforms have been limited to spatially interfacing the entire atom array with one global cavity mode, a configuration that constrains addressability, parallelism, and scalability. Here we introduce the cavity array microscope, an experimental platform where each individual atom is strongly coupled to its own individual cavity across a two-dimensional array of over 40 modes. Our approach requires no nanophotonic elements, and instead uses a new free-space cavity geometry with intra-cavity lenses to realize above-unity peak cooperativity with micron-scale mode waists and spacings, compatible with typical atom array length scales while keeping atoms far from dielectric surfaces. We achieve homogeneous atom-cavity coupling, and show fast, non-destructive, parallel readout on millisecond timescales, including through a fiber array as a proof-of-principle for networking applications. As an outlook, we realize a next-generation iteration of the platform with over 500 cavities and a nearly 10 times improvement in finesse. Our work unlocks the regime of many-cavity QED, and opens an unexplored frontier of large-scale quantum networking with atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Measured Lepton Magnetic Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electron and muon magnetic moments have played, and continue to play, important roles in testing the fundamental mathematical description of physical reality called the Standard Model of particle physics (SM). The electron magnetic moment is the most precisely measured property of an elementary particle and the most precise SM prediction, setting up the most precise confrontation ever between experiment and theory. It enables the most precise test of quantum field theory, and of the fundamental CPT symmetry invariance of the SM with leptons. The stable electron is studied with quantum methods while the electron remains for months in its quantum ground and first excited states. The muon magnetic moment is one of the most precisely measured property of an unstable elementary particle. Although less precise measured than the electron, it provides greater sensitivity to physics beyond the Standard Model -- a powerful tool for testing the existence of new particles and forces. Because muons decay quickly, they must be studied as they orbit at nearly the speed of light in a large storage ring. The extremely high precision of the electron and muon magnetic moment measurements has driven major advances in theoretical physics, inspiring new techniques in quantum field theory, precision calculations, and lattice gauge theory. Only experimental limits currently exist on the size of the magnetic moments of the tau and neutrino leptons.</description>

      <title>Reaction processes of muon-catalyzed fusion in the muonic molecule $dd\mu$ studied with the tractable $T$-matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Muon-catalyzed fusion has recently regained significant attention due to experimental and theoretical developments being performed. The present authors [Phys. Rev. C {\bf 109} 054625 (2024)] proposed the tractable $T$-matrix model based on the Lippmann-Schwinger equation to approximate the elaborate two- and three-body coupled-channel (CC) calculations [Kamimura, Kino, and Yamashita, Phys. Rev. C {\bf 107}, 034607 (2023)] for the nuclear reaction processes in the muonic molecule $dt\mu$, $(dt\mu)_{J=0} \to\!^4{\rm He} + n + \mu + 17.6 \, {\rm MeV}$. % or $(^4{\rm He}\mu)_{nl} + n + 17.6 \,{\rm MeV}$. The $T$-matrix model well reproduced almost all of the results generated by the CC work. In the present paper, we apply this model to the nuclear reaction processes in the $dd\mu$ molecule, $(dd\mu)_{J=1} \to\!^3{\rm He} + n + \mu +3.27 \,$ MeV or $t + p + \mu + 4.03 \,$ MeV, in which the fusion takes place via the $p$-wave $d$-$d$ relative motion. Recently, significantly different $p$-wave astrophysical $S(E)$ factors of the reaction $d + d \to\!^3{\rm He} + n$ or $t + p$ at $E \! \simeq \! 1$ keV to 1 MeV have been reported experimentally and theoretically by five groups. Employing many sets of nuclear interactions that can reproduce those five cases of $p$-wave $S(E)$ factors, we calculate the fusion rate of the $(dd\mu)_{J=1}$ molecule using three kinds of methods where results are consistent with each other. We also derive the $^3{\rm He}$-$\mu$ sticking probability and the absolute values of the energy and momentum spectra of the emitted muon. The violation of charge symmetry in the $p$-wave $d$-$d$ reaction and the $dd\mu$ fusion reaction is discussed. Information on the emitted 2.45-MeV neutrons and \mbox{1 keV-dominant} muons should be useful for the application of $dd\mu$ fusion.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum beam dynamics simulation of the RF photoinjector test bench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00732v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present beam-dynamics simulations for an S-band RF photoinjector test bench under development at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, aimed at producing high-quality electron beams and enabling future generation of relativistic vortex electrons with a quantized orbital angular momentum (OAM). Simulations of the 1.5-cell photogun are performed assuming an RF gradient of 45 MV/m, which, in accordance with our simulations with CST Studio, corresponds to the currently achieved input RF power of 3 MW. At low charge (Q = 0.63 pC), stable bunch formation is obtained, with weak space-charge effects and transverse emittance dominated by RF-induced correlations. Optimization of the injection phase and cathode solenoid results in a robust emittance-compensated regime with a final normalized emittance of 2.08 pi mm mrad. To assess prospects for accelerating vortex electron beams, we additionally model the quantum evolution of single-electron Laguerre-Gaussian wave packets. The results show that multi-MeV acceleration suppresses free-space spreading of the electron packet and preserves the packet's initial OAM structure, indicating that the test bench provides suitable conditions for forthcoming experimental studies of relativistic vortex electrons.</description>
