      <title>An Algorithm for Illuminating $n$ Nonoverlapping Circular Discs' Boundaries on the Plane with Application to Tree Stem Illumination Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set of $n$ nonoverlapping circular discs on a plane, we aim to determine possible positions of points (referred to as cameras) that could fully illuminate all the circular discs' boundaries. This work presents a geometric approach for determining feasible camera positions that would provide total illumination of all circular discs. The Laguerre Delaunay triangulation, coupled with the intersection of slabs formed by the boundaries of circular discs, is employed to form the region that satisfies the given conditions. The experiment is conducted using a set of randomly positioned circular discs on a plane. This study has the potential to address the issue of illumination in forests by utilizing a LiDAR camera to determine the possible number and placement of cameras that can effectively illuminate trees within a forest.</description>

      <title>Hardness of computation of quantum invariants on 3-manifolds with restricted topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum invariants in low dimensional topology offer a wide variety of valuable invariants of knots and 3-manifolds, presented by explicit formulas that are readily computable. Their computational complexity has been actively studied and is tightly connected to topological quantum computing. In this article, we prove that for any 3-manifold quantum invariant in the Reshetikhin-Turaev model, there is a deterministic polynomial time algorithm that, given as input an arbitrary closed 3-manifold $M$, outputs a closed 3-manifold $M'$ with same quantum invariant, such that $M'$ is hyperbolic, contains no low genus embedded incompressible surface, and is presented by a strongly irreducible Heegaard diagram. Our construction relies on properties of Heegaard splittings and the Hempel distance. At the level of computational complexity, this proves that the hardness of computing a given quantum invariant of 3-manifolds is preserved even when severely restricting the topology and the combinatorics of the input. This positively answers a question raised by Samperton.</description>
