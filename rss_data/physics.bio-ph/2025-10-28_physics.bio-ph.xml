      <title>Les Houches Lectures on Flow Networks in Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flows are essential to transport resources over large distances. As soon as diffusion becomes time-limiting, flows are needed. Flows are key for the function of multiple human organs, from the blood vasculature to the lungs, the digestive tract, the lymphatic system, and many more. While physics governs the flow dynamics, biology's response to flows governs the flow network architecture. We start with the fluid physics of Stokes flow, the prerequisite to describe the flows in biological flow networks. Then we explore how the network adaptation dynamics of biological flow networks reorganize network architecture to minimize flow dissipation or homogenize transport, storing memories of past flows along the way.</description>

      <title>Genetic interfaces at the frontier of expanding microbial colonies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the genetic interfaces between two species of an expanding colony that consists of individual microorganisms that reproduce and undergo diffusion, both at the frontier and in the interior. Within the bulk of the colony, the genetic interface is controlled in a simple way via interspecies interactions. However, at the frontier of the colony, the genetic interface width saturates at finite values for long times, both for neutral strains and interspecies interactions such as antagonism. This finite width arises from geometric effects: genetic interfaces drift toward local minima at an undulating colony frontier, where a focusing mechanism induced by curvature impedes diffusive mixing. Numerical simulations support a logarithmic dependence of the genetic interface width on the strength of the number fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Statistics of correlations in nonlinear recurrent neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The statistics of correlations are central quantities characterizing the collective dynamics of recurrent neural networks. We derive exact expressions for the statistics of correlations of nonlinear recurrent networks in the limit of a large number N of neurons, including systematic 1/N corrections. Our approach uses a path-integral representation of the network's stochastic dynamics, which reduces the description to a few collective variables and enables efficient computation. This generalizes previous results on linear networks to include a wide family of nonlinear activation functions, which enter as interaction terms in the path integral. These interactions can resolve the instability of the linear theory and yield a strictly positive participation dimension. We present explicit results for power-law activations, revealing scaling behavior controlled by the network coupling. In addition, we introduce a class of activation functions based on Pade approximants and provide analytic predictions for their correlation statistics. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical results with excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Lateral Ventricular Brain-Computer Interface System with Lantern-Inspired Electrode for Stable Performance and Memory Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a lateral ventricular brain-computer interface (LV-BCI) that deploys an expandable, flexible electrode into the lateral ventricle through a minimally invasive external ventricular drainage pathway. Inspired by the framework of traditional Chinese lanterns, the electrode expands uniformly within the ventricle and conforms to the ependymal wall. Compared with conventional subdural ECoG electrodes, the LV-BCI shows superior signal stability and immunocompatibility. Resting-state spectral analyses revealed a maximum effective bandwidth comparable to subdural ECoG. In evoked potential tests, the LV-BCI maintained a consistently higher signal-to-noise ratio over 112 days without the decline typically associated with scarring or other immune responses. Immunohistochemistry showed only a transient, early microglial activation after implantation, returning to control levels and remaining stable through 168 days. We further designed an "action-memory T-maze" task and developed a microstate sequence classifier (MSSC) to predict rats' turn decisions. The LV-BCI achieved prediction accuracy up to 98%, significantly outperforming subdural ECoG, indicating enhanced access to decision-related information from deep structures such as the hippocampus. These results establish the lateral ventricle as a viable route for neural signal acquisition. Using a lantern-inspired flexible electrode, we achieve long-term stable recordings and robust memory decision decoding from within the ventricular system, opening new directions for BCI technology and systems neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Glymphatic Clearance in the Optic Nerve: A Multidomain Electro-osmostic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective metabolic waste clearance and maintaining ionic homeostasis are essential for the health and normal function of the central nervous system. To understand its mechanism and the role of fluid flow, we develop a multidomain electro-osmotic model of optic-nerve microcirculation that couples hydrostatic and osmotic fluid transport with electro-diffusive solute movement across axons, glia, the extracellular space, and arterial/venous/capillary perivascular spaces. Cerebrospinal fluid enters the optic nerve via the arterial parivascular space, passes both the glial and ECS before exiting through the venous parivascular space. Exchanges across astrocytic endfeet are essential and they occur in two distinct and coupled paths: through AQP4 on glial membranes and gaps between glial endfeet, thus establishing a mechanistic substrate for two modes of glymphatic transport, at rest and during stimulus-evoked perturbations. Parameter sweeps show that lowering AQP4-mediated fluid permeability or PVS permeability elevates pressure, suppresses radial exchange and slows clearance, effects most pronounced for solutes reliant on PVS V export. The model reproduces baseline and stimulus-evoked flow and demonstrates that PVS-mediated export is the primary clearance route for both small and moderate solutes. Small molecules clear faster because rapid ECS diffusion broadens their distribution and enhances ECS PVS exchange, whereas moderate species have low ECS diffusivity, depend on transendfoot transfer, and clear more slowly via PVS V convection. Our framework can also be used to explain the sleep-wake effect mechanistically: enlarging ECS volume or permeability increases transinterface flux and accelerates waste removal.</description>

      <title>Transverse contributions to the longitudinal stiffness of the human foot</title>

      <description>arXiv:1706.04610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans rely on foot stiffness to withstand the propulsive forces of walking and running. Skeletal adaptations that increase foot stiffness include the medial longitudinal arch (MLA) and the transverse tarsal arch (TTA). The TTA has been hypothesized to stiffen the foot through cross-axis coupling of transverse intermetatarsal stiffness with sagittal-plane midfoot stiffness, but this has been tested only in cadaveric specimens. In vivo testing is essential because muscle contraction substantially modulates MLA function and may similarly affect the TTA's cross-axis coupling. Here we provide in vivo evidence for the TTA's contribution to foot stiffness by externally increasing intermetatarsal stiffness and measuring its effects on midfoot elasticity during walking. As predicted by the cross-axis coupling hypothesis, increasing intermetatarsal stiffness with an elastic tape wrapped around the forefoot reduced the energy absorbed in midfoot flattening and increased sagittal-plane midfoot stiffness concomitantly (mean,$\pm$,standard error of the mean (SEM): $13.9\% \pm 3\%$ and $16.8\% \pm 5.8\%$, respectively). However, taping did not change the curvature of the TTA, thereby isolating the effects of cross-axis coupling from morphological changes to the TTA. Thus, forefoot taping modulates midfoot stiffness through cross-axis coupling and could provide a non-invasive means to manage pathological foot flexibility or enhance athletic performance.</description>

      <title>General integrated rate law for complex self-assembly reactions reveals the mechanism of amyloid-beta co-aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15932v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing kinetic experiments on protein aggregation using integrated rate laws has led to numerous advances in our understanding of the fundamental chemical mechanisms behind amyloidogenic disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. However, the description of biologically relevant processes may require rate equations that are too complex to solve using existing methods, hindering mechanistic insights into these processes. An example of significance is co-aggregation in environments containing multiple amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide alloforms, which may play a crucial role in the biochemistry of Alzheimer's disease but whose mechanism is still poorly understood. Here, we use the mathematics of symmetry to derive a general integrated rate law valid for most plausible linear self-assembly reactions. We use it in conjunction with experimental data to determine the mechanism of co-aggregation of the most physiologically abundant Abeta alloforms: Abeta42, Abeta40, Abeta38 and Abeta37 peptides. We find that Abeta42 fibril surfaces catalyze the formation of co-oligomers, which accelerate new Abeta40, Abeta38 and Abeta37 fibril formation whilst inhibiting secondary nucleation of new Abeta42 fibrils. The simplicity, accuracy and broad applicability of our general integrated rate law will enable kinetic analysis of more complex filamentous self-assembly reactions, both with and without co-aggregation.</description>

      <title>Active Hydrodynamic Theory of Euchromatin and Heterochromatin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20964v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The genome contains genetic information essential for cell's life. The genome's spatial organization inside the cell nucleus is critical for its proper function including gene regulation. The two major genomic compartments -- euchromatin and heterochromatin -- contain largely transcriptionally active and silenced genes, respectively, and exhibit distinct dynamics. In this work, we present a hydrodynamic framework that describes the large-scale behavior of euchromatin and heterochromatin, and accounts for the interplay of mechanical forces, active processes, and nuclear confinement. Our model shows contractile stresses from cross-linking proteins lead to the formation of heterochromatin droplets via mechanically driven phase separation. These droplets grow, coalesce, and in nuclear confinement, wet the boundary. Active processes, such as gene transcription in euchromatin, introduce non-equilibrium fluctuations that drive long-range, coherent motions of chromatin as well as the nucleoplasm, and thus alter the genome's spatial organization. These fluctuations also indirectly deform heterochromatin droplets, by continuously changing their shape. Taken together, our findings reveal how active forces, mechanical stresses and hydrodynamic flows contribute to the genome's organization at large scales and provide a physical framework for understanding chromatin organization and dynamics in live cells.</description>
