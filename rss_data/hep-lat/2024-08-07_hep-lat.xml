      <title>Phase Diagram of the Schwinger Model by Adiabatic Preparation of States on a Quantum Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue the feasibility to study the phase structure of a quantum physical system on quantum devices via adiabatic preparation of states. We introduce a novel method and successfully test it in application to the Schwinger model in the presence of a topological $\theta$-term. We explore the first-order-phase-transition and the no-transition regions of the corresponding phase diagram. The core idea of the method is to separately evolve the ground and the first excited states with a time-dependent Hamiltonian, the time-dependence of which interpolates between different values of $\theta$. Despite our approach being a direct application of the adiabatic theorem, in some cases we are able to demonstrate its advantages in comparison to a different method from the literature that also employs adiabatic state preparation.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic properties of $\Omega_{c}^0$ resonances via light-cone QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18901v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically study the electromagnetic properties of controversial states whose internal structure is not elucidated and we try to offer a different point of view to unravel the internal structure of these states. Inspired by the $\Omega_c$ states observed by the LHCb Collaboration, we study the electromagnetic properties of the $\Omega_c$ states as the compact diquark-diquark-antiquark pentaquarks with both $J^P = \frac{1}{2}^-$ and $J^P = \frac{3}{2}^-$ in the context of the QCD light-cone sum rule model. From the obtained numerical results, we conclude that the magnetic dipole moments of the $\Omega_c$ states can reflect their inner structures, which can be used to distinguish their spin-parity quantum numbers. Measuring the magnetic moment of the $\Omega_c$ states in future experimental facilities can be very helpful for understanding the internal organization and identifying the quantum numbers of these states.</description>

      <title>Highly-efficient quantum Fourier transformations for some nonabelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Fourier transformations are an essential component of many quantum algorithms, from prime factoring to quantum simulation. While the standard abelian QFT is well-studied, important variants corresponding to \emph{nonabelian} groups of interest have seen less development. In particular, fast nonabelian Fourier transformations are important components for both quantum simulations of field theories as well as approaches to the nonabelian hidden subgroup problem. In this work, we present fast quantum Fourier transformations for a number of nonabelian groups of interest for high energy physics, $\mathbb{BT}$, $\mathbb{BO}$, $\Delta(27)$, $\Delta(54)$, and $\Sigma(36\times3)$. For each group, we derive explicit quantum circuits and estimate resource scaling for fault-tolerant implementations. Our work shows that the development of a fast Fourier transformation can substantively reduce simulation costs by up to three orders of magnitude for the finite groups that we have investigated.</description>
