      <title>Robust Elicitable Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elicitable functionals and (strict) consistent scoring functions are of interest due to their utility of determining (uniquely) optimal forecasts, and thus the ability to effectively backtest predictions. However, in practice, assuming that a distribution is correctly specified is too strong a belief to reliably hold. To remediate this, we incorporate a notion of statistical robustness into the framework of elicitable functionals, meaning that our robust functional accounts for "small" misspecifications of a baseline distribution. Specifically, we propose a robustified version of elicitable functionals by using the Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify potential misspecifications from a baseline distribution. We show that the robust elicitable functionals admit unique solutions lying at the boundary of the uncertainty region. Since every elicitable functional possesses infinitely many scoring functions, we propose the class of b-homogeneous strictly consistent scoring functions, for which the robust functionals maintain desirable statistical properties. We show the applicability of the REF in two examples: in the reinsurance setting and in robust regression problems.</description>

      <title>Convolution Bounds on Quantile Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.09320v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantile aggregation with dependence uncertainty has a long history in probability theory with wide applications in finance, risk management, statistics, and operations research. Using a recent result on inf-convolution of quantile-based risk measures, we establish new analytical bounds for quantile aggregation which we call convolution bounds. Convolution bounds both unify every analytical result available in quantile aggregation and enlighten our understanding of these methods. These bounds are the best available in general. Moreover, convolution bounds are easy to compute, and we show that they are sharp in many relevant cases. They also allow for interpretability on the extremal dependence structure. The results directly lead to bounds on the distribution of the sum of random variables with arbitrary dependence. We discuss relevant applications in risk management and economics.</description>

      <title>Universal randomised signatures for generative time series modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomised signature has been proposed as a flexible and easily implementable alternative to the well-established path signature. In this article, we employ randomised signature to introduce a generative model for financial time series data in the spirit of reservoir computing. Specifically, we propose a novel Wasserstein-type distance based on discrete-time randomised signatures. This metric on the space of probability measures captures the distance between (conditional) distributions. Its use is justified by our novel universal approximation results for randomised signatures on the space of continuous functions taking the underlying path as an input. We then use our metric as the loss function in a non-adversarial generator model for synthetic time series data based on a reservoir neural stochastic differential equation. We compare the results of our model to benchmarks from the existing literature.</description>
