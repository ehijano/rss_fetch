      <title>The nonlinear dynamics of a cantilever beam subject to axial flow in a tapered passage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cantilever beam under axial flow, confined or not, is known to develop self-sustained oscillations at sufficiently large flow velocities. In recent decades, the analysis of this archetypal system has been mostly pursued under linearized conditions, to calculate the critical boundaries separating stable from unstable behavior. However, nonlinear analysis of the self-sustained oscillations ensuing flutter instabilities are considerably rarer. Here we present a simplified one-dimensional nonlinear model describing a cantilever beam subjected to confined axial flow, for generic axial profiles of the fluid channels. In particular, we explore how the shape of the confinement walls affects the dynamics of the system. To simplify the problem, we consider symmetric channels with plane walls in either converging or diverging configurations. The beam is modeled in a modal framework, while bulk-flow equations, including singular head-loss terms, are used to model the flow-structure coupling forces. The dynamics of the system are first analyzed through linear stability analysis to assess the stabilizing/destabilizing effects of the channel walls configuration. Subsequently, we develop a systematic nonlinear analysis based on the continuation of periodic solutions. The harmonic balance method is used in conjunction with the asymptotic numerical method to calculate branches of periodic solutions. The continuation-based methods are used to investigate bifurcations with respect to both the reduced flow velocity and the channel slope parameter. From the results presented, we illustrate how continuationbased approaches and bifurcation analysis provide an efficient tool to analyze the nonlinear behavior of flow-induced vibration problems, particularly when reduced/simplified models are available.</description>

      <title>Linear Nonreciprocal Dynamics of Coupled Modulated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Waveguides subject to spatiotemporal modulations are known to exhibit nonreciprocal vibration transmission, whereby interchanging the locations of the source and receiver change the end-to-end transmission characteristics. The scenario of typical interest is unidirectional transmission in long, weakly modulated systems: when transmission is possible in one direction only. Here, with a view toward expanding their potential application as devices, we explore the vibration characteristics of spatiotemporally modulated systems that are short and strongly modulated. Focusing on two coupled systems, we develop a methodology to investigate the nonreciprocal vibration characteristics of both weakly and strongly modulated systems. In particular, we highlight the contribution of phase to nonreciprocity, a feature that is often overlooked. We show that the difference between the transmitted phases is the main contributor to breaking reciprocity in short systems. We clarify the roles of primary and side-band resonances, and their overlaps, in breaking reciprocity. We discuss the influence of modulation amplitude and wavenumber on the resonances of the modulated system.</description>

      <title>Operating conditions and thermodynamic bounds of dual radiative heat engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified description of dual radiative heat engines (RHEs), consisting of two facing optoelectronic components (diodes) and capable of generating electrical power from heat. They can operate in three regimes depending on the applied biases, namely in thermoradiative-negative elec-troluminescent (TRNEL), thermoradiative-photovoltaic (TRPV) or thermophotonic regimes (TPX, consisting of a light-emitting diode and a PV cell). They have access to operating conditions that are unachievable by single RHEs such as thermophotovoltaic systems: at the radiative limit, TRNEL devices can reach the Carnot efficiency for any bandgap, while TPX devices achieve large power outputs by means of electroluminescent enhancement. Expressions of the maximum power output and related efficiency achieved by dual engines are derived analytically, and reveal that the power output of TPX engines is not bounded. A comparison to usual efficiency bounds also highlights the impact of thermalisation losses, and the subsequent interest of spectral filtering to extend the operating region. The influence of nonradiative recombinations is also investigated. This work provides common framework and guidelines for the study of RHEs, which represent a promising solution for reliable and scalable energy conversion.</description>
