      <title>On the application of refractive index matching to study the buoyancy-driven motion of spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refractive index matching (RIM) is a powerful tool for multiphase flow studies as it eliminates optical distortions and enables high-fidelity tomographic measurements near solid-fluid interfaces of freely moving solids in the flow. However, by improving the RIM and optical quality, the solids become effectively invisible, preventing direct identification of their location. To address this limitation, we develop a physics-informed detection framework that locates transparent spheres within time-resolved tomographic Particle Tracking Velocimetry by combining tracer voids, vertical velocity signatures, and vortex structures into a unified optimization problem. Integrated with volumetric reconstructions, the method provides simultaneous analysis of velocity, pressure, and force on the sphere. Applied to an example case of an 11.11 mm acrylic sphere rising in a RIM sodium iodide solution, the technique reveals a clear phase-locked relation between double-thread wake structures, surface-pressure distributions, and unsteady hydrodynamic forces over half a cycle of the sphere motion in the 4R vortex shedding regime. For the first time, this enables direct calculation of drag and lift histories on a freely moving sphere. The framework can be extended to dynamic masking for improved tomographic reconstruction and pressure-field calculations, to non-spherical bodies with more complex motions, and to multi-body interactions, advancing RIM from a flow-only diagnostic to a tool for fully coupled body-wake measurements.</description>

      <title>Non-Newtonian viscous fluid models with learned rheology accurately reproduce Lagrangian sea ice simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar sea ice is crucial to Earth's climate system. Its dynamics also affect coastal communities, wildlife, and global shipping. Sea ice is typically modeled as a continuum fluid using a model proposed almost 50 years, which is moderately accurate for packed ice, but loses its predictive accuracy outside of the central ice pack. Discrete element methods (DEMs) offer an alternative by resolving the behavior of individual ice floes, including collisions, frictional contact, fracture, and ridging. However, DEMs are generally too costly for large-scale simulations. To address this, we present a framework for inferring rheological behavior from DEM velocity data. We characterize isotropic constitutive laws as scalar functions of the principal invariants of the strain-rate tensor. These functions are parameterized by neural networks trained on DEM data. By combining machine learning and finite element methods, we incorporate the governing partial differential equation (PDE) into the training, requiring to solve a PDE-constrained optimization problem for the network parameters. We find that, over a wide range of ice concentrations, the velocity fields observed in a complex sea ice DEM can be captured by a nonlinear rheology. Depending on the ice concentration, a shear-thinning or a shear-thickening behavior is observed. Moreover, the effective shear viscosity is found to increase by several orders of magnitude with changes as small as 5% in the sea ice concentration. We show that the learned rheology generalizes to different forcing scenarios, time-dependent problems, and settings in which compressibility is not a dominant factor. For these reasons, our framework represents a major step towards developing non-Newtonian models that accurately reproduce observed sea ice dynamics.</description>

      <title>Transport barriers for microswimmers in unsteady flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certain flow structures trap active microorganisms over extended periods, impacting mortality and growth by inhibiting foraging, exploration, and predator evasion. We show that transport barriers and trapping of a microswimmer in unsteady vortex flow can be understood in terms of Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) in phase space, taking into account both flow and swimming dynamics. These phase-space LCS constrain when and how artificial microswimmers can be trained by reinforcement learning to escape traps. Our results suggest that phase-space LCS can explain training failure and success in a broad class of navigation problems.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution reconstruction of turbulent flows from a single Lagrangian trajectory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the reconstruction of turbulent flow fields from trajectory data recorded by actively migrating Lagrangian agents. We propose a deep learning model, Track-to-Flow (T2F), which employs a Vision Transformer as an encoder to capture the spatiotemporal features of a single agent trajectory, and a convolutional neural network as the decoder to reconstruct the flow field. To enhance the physical consistency of the T2F model, we further incorporate a physics-informed loss function inspired by the framework of Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), yielding a variant model referred to as T2F+PINN. We first evaluate both models in a laminar cylinder wake flow at a Reynolds number of $Re = 800$ as a proof-of-concept. The results show that the T2F model achieves velocity reconstruction accuracy comparable to existing flow reconstruction methods, while the T2F+PINN model reduces the normalized error in vorticity reconstruction relative to the T2F model. We then apply the models in a turbulent Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection at a Rayleigh number of $Ra = 10^{8}$ and a Prandtl number of $Pr = 0.71$. The results show that the T2F model accurately reconstructs both the velocity and temperature fields, whereas the T2F+PINN model further improves the reconstruction accuracy of gradient-related physical quantities, such as temperature gradients, vorticity, and the $Q$ value, with a maximum improvement of approximately 60\% compared to the T2F model. Overall, the T2F model is better suited for reconstructing primitive flow variables, while the T2F+PINN model provides advantages in reconstructing gradient-related quantities. Our models open a promising avenue for accurate flow reconstruction from a single Lagrangian trajectory.</description>

      <title>Towards a unified turbulence model through multi-objective learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence is a central challenge in classical physics and a critical barrier to accurate flow prediction in climate, aerospace, and energy systems. Despite the widespread reliance on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solvers in industrial simulations, existing turbulence models lack the generalizability to handle diverse regimes, such as separation, secondary flows, and free-shear flows, without manual tuning or switching. We propose a unified data-driven turbulence modeling framework based on multi-objective learning. The goal is to achieve Pareto-optimal performance across heterogeneous flow datasets, each representing distinct mechanisms and quantities of interest. The resulting unified foundation model employs a parallel tensor basis neural network with automatic balancing and internal branching to adapt across flow regimes without explicit switching. The parallel architecture enables explicit regularization to promote model parsimony, while the tensor-basis formulation preserves physical symmetries. Trained on five representative flows, the model is evaluated on 27 test cases spanning attached, separated, and secondary flows, as well as two realistic three-dimensional flows of industrial relevance. It improves or matches the performance of the baseline $k$-$\omega$ model in all cases. For specific applications, we show that specialist models trained on tailored datasets can further improve accuracy in challenging configurations, such as three-dimensional diffuser flows common in gas turbine aerodynamics, which exhibit simultaneous separation and secondary flows. These results demonstrate that a generalized, deployable turbulence model unifying multiple flow mechanisms within a single architecture is achievable. This work marks significant progress toward unified turbulence modeling for scientific and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Rarefied Flow at Micro-Step using a DeepONet Surrogate Model with a Physics-Guided Zonal Loss Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method remains the gold standard for simulating rarefied gas flows but is prohibitively expensive for parametric and many-query applications. To address this limitation, we introduce a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) surrogate framework featuring an innovative, physics-guided zonal loss function. The zonal loss prioritizes physical fidelity in critical flow regions over global error metrics, leading to predictions with greater engineering relevance. It explicitly emphasizes accuracy in the recirculation zone, ensuring faithful reconstruction of separated flow features that are often under-resolved by conventional, globally averaged error metrics. Two operator-learning tasks are demonstrated: mapping the Knudsen number to the velocity field and mapping the step-height ratio to the flow solution. The results show excellent agreement with high-fidelity DSMC data. An ablation study highlights that, while global error metrics may suggest only marginal improvements, localized error analysis reveals the superior fidelity of the zonal loss in capturing vortex dynamics -- an aspect central to engineering relevance. The proposed surrogate reproduces detailed velocity fields with high physical fidelity and achieves predictions for unseen parameters in milliseconds, representing speedups of several orders of magnitude relative to DSMC. This capability enables the quantification of uncertainty, optimization, and design-space exploration that would otherwise be computationally intractable.</description>

      <title>JPResUnet: A Joint Probability Density Function Translation Model in Partially Premixed Flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are often constrained by their limitations in extrapolation, which restricts their applicability in engineering contexts. Conversely, while exhibiting broad generality, many established scientific models seem to lack the necessary accuracy. This study addresses these challenges by introducing JPResUnet (Joint PDF Residual U-net), a novel model that integrates the strengths of both ML and traditional scientific approaches to predict sub-grid joint probability density functions (PDFs) in partially premixed flames. JPResUnet employs a residual U-Net architecture to translate classic $\beta$-PDFs to sub-grid PDFs. The model is trained using direct numerical simulation (DNS) data from methane-air moderate or intense low-oxygen dilution (MILD) combustion and is initially tested through a priori assessments on out-of-sample data. Comparative analyses against an artificial neural network (ANN) and the $\beta$-PDF approach demonstrate that JPResUnet consistently outperforms these methods in capturing complex sub-grid features with greater accuracy and robustness for both box and Gaussian kernels of varying widths, and for more extrapolated cases. Subsequent a posteriori assessment involves two versions of JPResUnet with different output PDF resolutions, which are deployed for large eddy simulation (LES) of a multi-regime burner through the look-up table (LUT) approach. The higher resolution model yields improvements in temperature estimates compared to the conventional LUT method. This highlights the potential of the JPResUnet model for robust and accurate LES of reacting flows with ML.</description>

      <title>Compact representation of transonic airfoil buffet flows with observable-augmented machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transonic buffet presents time-dependent aerodynamic characteristics associated with shock, turbulent boundary layer, and their interactions. Despite strong nonlinearities and a large degree of freedom, there exists a dominant dynamic pattern of a buffet cycle, suggesting the low dimensionality of transonic buffet phenomena. This study seeks a low-dimensional representation of transonic airfoil buffet at a high Reynolds number with machine learning. Wall-modeled large-eddy simulations of flow over the OAT15A supercritical airfoil at two Mach numbers, $M_\infty = 0.715$ and 0.730, respectively producing non-buffet and buffet conditions, at a chord-based Reynolds number of $Re = 3\times 10^6$ are performed to generate the present datasets. We find that the low-dimensional nature of transonic airfoil buffet can be extracted as a sole three-dimensional latent representation through lift-augmented autoencoder compression. The current low-order representation not only describes the shock movement but also captures the moment when the separation occurs near the trailing edge in a low-order manner. We further show that it is possible to perform sensor-based reconstruction through the present low-dimensional expression while identifying the sensitivity with respect to aerodynamic responses. The present model trained at $Re = 3\times 10^6$ is lastly evaluated at the level of a real aircraft operation of $Re = 3\times 10^7$, exhibiting that the phase dynamics of lift is reasonably estimated from sparse sensors. The current study may provide a foundation toward data-driven real-time analysis of transonic buffet conditions under aircraft operation.</description>

      <title>A zero-dimensional global conservation model to determine non-ideal nozzle conditions for gas injections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To reduce computation times of simulations involving gas fueled internal combustion engines (ICEs), a model is developed that determines non-ideal nozzle exit conditions to spare expensive simulations of internal injector flows. The model, to which we will refer as the Global Conservation Model (GCM), computes nozzle exit values based on reservoir conditions, and a discharge and momentum coefficient. These coefficients can be obtained via common flow bench experiments or a validated numerical simulation setup. Furthermore, it allows to use real gas thermodynamics which is often needed for ICE applications. The model is validated for three commonly used injector types, injection pressures up to 300 bar, subsonic and choked injections, and at flow bench and engine conditions using numerical simulations. If real gas thermodynamics is applied, differences with the simulated nozzle conditions are typically within 1.5% uncertainty, which is within the typical range of experimental momentum flow measurements found in literature. Differences in mass and momentum flow obtained by the numerical simulations between flow bench and engine conditions are negligible, indicating that flow bench measurements can be applied to engine conditions. Once an injector is characterized for mass and momentum flow, applying the GCM can reduce computation times by more than a factor 8, while accurately simulating the spatial and temporal jet development. With the reduction in computation time, the GCM reduces costs associated with numerical simulations and accelerates research and design of efficient and low-emission gas fueled ICEs.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Low and high-Order Methods for the Simulation of Supersonic Jet Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work compares results for different numerical methods in search of alternatives to improve the quality of large-eddy simulations for the problem of supersonic turbulent jet flows. Previous work has analyzed supersonic jet flows using a second-order, finite difference solver based on structured meshes, and the results indicated a shorter potential core of the jet and different levels of velocity fluctuations. In the present work, the results of previous simulations are compared to new results using a high-order, discontinuous Galerkin solver for unstructured meshes. All simulations are performed keeping the total number of degrees of freedom constant. The results of the current simulations present very similar mean velocity distributions and slightly smaller velocity fluctuations, and they seem to correlate better with the experimental data. The present results indicate that additional studies should focus on the jet inlet boundary conditions in order to improve the physical representation of the early stages of the jet development.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of LES Inlet Boundary Conditions for Supersonic Jet Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work evaluates the effects of three inflow boundary conditions on large-eddy simulations of supersonic jet flows. The three inlet flow configurations considered are an inviscid profile, a stationary turbulent profile extracted from a RANS calculation, and a time-dependent tripped turbulent profile. The study applies the nodal discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretization to perform the supersonic jet flow simulations. Initially, a mesh and polynomial resolution study is performed to identify the requisites for simulating the supersonic jet flow. The velocity profiles resulting from the three numerical simulations with the different inflow conditions are compared with experimental data. The velocity profiles extracted from the calculation results indicate a major role of the steady turbulent inlet profile on the jet flow behavior, even for the tripped inlet condition. The imposition of a steady turbulent inlet profile could approximate the velocity distributions in the region close to the jet inlet section with the experimental reference. Negligible changes were observed to the velocity profiles far from the inlet section, where a good agreement with the experimental reference was already obtained from the simulations even with the inviscid profile.</description>

      <title>Characterization of boundary layers on isothermal and adiabatic curved surfaces of a supersonic turbine cascade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of adiabatic and isothermal boundary conditions are investigated on the shock-boundary layer interactions (SBLIs) in a supersonic turbine cascade. Special attention is given to the characterization of the incoming boundary layers over the convex and concave walls of the blade and their impact in the SBLIs. Large eddy simulations (LES) are performed for an inlet Mach number of $\mathbf{M_\infty = 2.0}$ and Reynolds number based on the axial chord $\mathbf{Re = 200\,000}$. For the isothermal condition, the wall to inlet temperature ratio is $\mathbf{T_w/T_{\infty}=0.75}$, representing a cooled wall. Different incident shock wave topologies occur on the suction and pressure sides of the airfoil. For the former, an oblique shock impinges on the boundary layer leading to a larger separation bubble. On the other hand, a normal shock from a Mach reflection induces a small separation region near the wall for the pressure side. Results are presented in terms of mean velocity and temperature contours, and the incoming boundary layers are characterized by looking at the Clauser parameter, shape factor, dilatation and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) profiles. Inspection of the shape factors show that the adiabatic wall boundary layers are more prone to separate than the isothermal ones. This is indeed observed in the airfoil suction side, but not on the pressure side, where the flow separates in the same chord position regardless of the thermal boundary condition. This is a topic for investigation in the final version of the paper. An assessment of the dilatation and TKE profiles explains the disparities of the bubble sizes on the pressure and suction sides of the airfoil.</description>

      <title>Whistling of turbulent cavity flows: Self-consistent predictions with the linearized compressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A self-consistent saturation model for the prediction of aeroacoustic limit cycles emerging in turbulent low-Mach cavity flows (Re=O(10^5), M\simeq 0.2) is proposed. It predicts the nonlinear interactions between the acoustic modes of a deep rectangular cavity and the hydrodynamic instabilities of the turbulent shear-layer that forms over its opening due to the presence of a grazing flow. The model is based on the triple decomposition of the flow variables and the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. At each step of the iterative process, the nonlinear eigenvalue problem associated to perturbations around the mean flow is updated with the steady component of the forcing from the unstable eigenmode's Reynolds stress. The iterations are performed until the dominant eigenmode becomes marginally stable, i.e. its growth rate vanishes. The evolution of the coherent velocity fluctuations as function of the oscillation amplitude is in good qualitative agreement with previously published compressible Large Eddy Simulations. Furthermore, the predictions of the frequency and amplitude of the aeroacoustic limit cycle oscillations are validated against the ones obtained from a low order model, whose parameters were adjusted to reproduce the experimental measurements of the deep cavity whistling.</description>

      <title>Long-wave instability of periodic shear flows for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1959, Kolmogorov proposed to study the instability of the shear flow $(\sin(y),0)$ in the vanishing viscosity regime in tori $\mathbb{T}_{\alpha}\times \mathbb{T}$. This question was later resolved by Meshalkin and Sinai. We extend the problem to general shear flows $(U(y),0)$ and show that every $U(y)$ exhibits long-wave instability whenever $\|\partial_y^{-1} U\|_{L^2} &gt; \nu$ and $\alpha\ll \nu$, with $\nu$ being the kinematic viscosity. This instability mechanism confirms previous findings by Yudovich in 1966, supported also by several numerical results, and is established through two independent approaches: one via the construction of Kato's isomorphism and one via normal forms. Unlike in many other applications of the latter methods, both proofs deal with the presence of a delicate term in the linearized operator that becomes singular as $\alpha$ approaches $0$.</description>

      <title>On the applicability of the actuator line method for unsteady aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17395v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A linear theory for unsteady aerodynamic effects of the actuator line method (ALM) was developed. This theory is validated using two-dimensional ALM simulations, where we compute the unsteady lift generated by the plunging and pitching motion of a thin airfoil in uniform flow, comparing the results with Theodorsen's theory. This comparison elucidates the underlying characteristics and limitations of ALM when applied to unsteady aerodynamics. Numerical simulations were conducted across a range of chord lengths and oscillation frequencies. Comparison of ALM results with theoretical predictions shows consistent accuracy, with all Gaussian parameter choices yielding accurate results at low reduced frequencies. Furthermore, the study indicates that selecting a width parameter ratio of $\varepsilon/c$ (the Gaussian width parameter over the chord length) between 0.33 and 0.4 in ALM yields the closest alignment with analytical results across a broader frequency range. Additionally, a proper definition of angle of attack for a pitching airfoil is shown to be important for accurate computations. These findings offer valuable guidance for the application of ALM in unsteady aerodynamics and aeroelasticity.</description>

      <title>Defining the mean turbulent boundary layer thickness based on streamwise velocity skewness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00157v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new statistical definition for the mean turbulent boundary layer thickness is introduced, based on identification of the point where the streamwise velocity skewness changes sign, from negative to positive, in the outermost region of the boundary layer. Importantly, this definition is independent of arbitrary thresholds, and broadly applicable, including to past single-point measurements. Further, this definition is motivated by the phenomenology of streamwise velocity fluctuations near the turbulent/non-turbulent interface, whose local characteristics are shown to be universal for turbulent boundary layers under low freestream turbulence conditions (i.e., with or without pressure gradients, surface roughness, etc.) through large-scale experiments, simulations and coherent structure-based modelling. The new approach yields a turbulent boundary layer thickness that is consistent with previous definitions, such as those based on Reynolds shear stress or `composite' mean velocity profiles, and which can be used practically e.g., to calculate integral thicknesses. Two methods are proposed for estimating the turbulent boundary layer thickness using this definition: one based on simple linear interpolation and the other on fitting a generalised Fourier model to the outer skewness profile. The robustness and limitations of these methods are demonstrated through analysis of several published experimental and numerical datasets, which cover a range of canonical and non-canonical turbulent boundary layers. These datasets also vary in key characteristics such as wall-normal resolution and measurement noise, particularly in the critical turbulent/non-turbulent interface region.</description>

      <title>Vortex-magnetic competition and regime transitions in antiparallel flux tubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vortex-magnetic interactions shape magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, influencing energy transfer in astrophysical, geophysical, and industrial systems. On the Sun, granular-scale vortex flows couple strongly with magnetic fields, channeling energy into the corona. At high Reynolds numbers, vorticity and magnetic fields are nearly frozen into the charged fluid, and MHD flows emerge from the Lorentz force mediated interactions between coherent vortex structures in matter and the field. To probe this competition in a controlled setting, we revisit the canonical problem of two antiparallel flux tubes. By varying the magnetic flux threading each tube--and thus sweeping the interaction parameter $N_i$, which gauges Lorentz-to-inertial force balance--we uncover three distinct regimes: vortex-dominated joint reconnection, instability-triggered cascade, and Lorentz-induced vortex disruption. At low $N_i$, classical vortex dynamics dominate, driving joint vortex-magnetic reconnection and amplifying magnetic energy via a dynamo effect. At moderate $N_i$, the system oscillates between vorticity-driven attraction and magnetic damping, triggering instabilities and nonlinear interactions that spawn secondary filaments and drive an energy cascade. At high $N_i$, Lorentz forces suppress vortex interactions, aligning the tubes axially while disrupting vortex cores and rapidly converting magnetic to kinetic energy. These findings reveal how the inertial-Lorentz balance governs energy transfer and coherent structure formation in MHD turbulence, offering insight into vortex-magnetic coevolution in astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Resolving Turbulent Magnetohydrodynamics: A Hybrid Operator-Diffusion Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a hybrid machine learning framework that combines Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINOs) with score-based generative diffusion models to simulate the full spatio-temporal evolution of two-dimensional, incompressible, resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence across a broad range of Reynolds numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$). The framework leverages the equation-constrained generalization capabilities of PINOs to predict coherent, low-frequency dynamics, while a conditional diffusion model stochastically corrects high-frequency residuals, enabling accurate modeling of fully developed turbulence. Trained on a comprehensive ensemble of high-fidelity simulations with $\mathrm{Re} \in \{100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 3000, 10000\}$, the approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in regimes previously inaccessible to deterministic surrogates. At $\mathrm{Re}=1000$ and $3000$, the model faithfully reconstructs the full spectral energy distributions of both velocity and magnetic fields late into the simulation, capturing non-Gaussian statistics, intermittent structures, and cross-field correlations with high fidelity. At extreme turbulence levels ($\mathrm{Re}=10000$), it remains the first surrogate capable of recovering the high-wavenumber evolution of the magnetic field, preserving large-scale morphology and enabling statistically meaningful predictions.</description>

      <title>Accuracy and stability of the accelerated multi-direct-forcing immersed boundary method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multi-direct-forcing immersed boundary method allows for high accuracy of the no-slip condition in moving-particle problems but suffers from numerical instability if simulation parameters are not carefully chosen. This study investigates the numerical accuracy and stability of the accelerated multidirect-forcing immersed boundary method. An analysis of the discretized equations of body motion in moving boundary problems identifies a critical parameter that solely determines the numerical stability for the body motion. Additionally, numerical simulations reveal the optimal acceleration parameter that minimizes the error in the no-slip condition and is independent of details of the boundary discretisation, the boundary shape, and spatial dimensionality. This study provides a guideline for establishing numerically stable simulations of moving boundary problems at optimal accuracy of the no-slip condition.</description>

      <title>Holey sheets: Double-Threshold Rupture of Draining Liquid Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical rupture is attributed to molecular (van der Waals) forces acting at nanometric thicknesses. Nonetheless, micron-thick liquid sheets routinely perforate far above the scale where these molecular forces act, yet the mechanism that selects opening versus healing has remained unclear. Using direct numerical simulations of a draining sheet with an entrained air bubble (cavity), we show that irreversible rupture occurs only when a deterministic double-threshold is crossed: (i) the outward driving (from airflow or inertia) is strong enough and (ii) the cavity is distorted enough. If either condition falls short, surface tension heals the cavity and the sheet reseals. The time for this process is set by the balance between inertia and viscosity -- fast for inertia-dominated sheets and slower for viscous ones. This double-threshold mechanism explains why micrometer-thick films perforate and offers practical control options -- driving strength and defect geometry -- for predicting and controlling breakup in spray formation processes, wave breaking, and respiratory films.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporally Resolved Measurements of CO2 Distribution at the Air-Water Interface Using Tunable Diode Laser Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transport of CO2 across the air-water interface is central to physical oceanography and carbon sequestration. A comprehensive understanding of this process requires high-resolution diagnostics of diffusion, absorption, and reaction across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. The current study presents a novel measurement method to quantify the CO2 distribution at the air-water interface. This method combines the advantages of tunable diode laser spectroscopy and rapid spatial beam scanning for in situ, nonintrusive, and spatiotemporally resolved measurement of the CO2 concentration distribution above the interface. The performance of this method was examined in a series of quasi-1D experiments in a miniature gas chamber, where the diffusion and absorption of CO2 into pure water and alkaline solutions of different pH values were continuously monitored. An effective time resolution of 5 ms and an effective spatial resolution of 1 mm were achieved. The observed gas-phase CO2 distribution evolution agreed with the classic one-dimensional diffusion model, which validated the accuracy of the current method. PH-dependent dynamics of interfacial CO2 concentration were also observed. The CO2 depletion rate is highly pH-sensitive at low pH and saturates at pH = 10, revealing complex competition between the gas-phase and the liquid-phase transport processes. The current method's high spatial and temporal resolution holds promise for studying cross-interface gas transport under more complex flow conditions, in both field measurements and laboratory studies.</description>

      <title>Super resonance: Breaking the bandwidth limit of resonant modes and its application to flow control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of super resonance--a new regime of resonant behavior in which a mode's out-of-phase response persists far beyond its classical bandwidth. This effect emerges from a coiled phononic structure composed of a locally resonant elastic metamaterial and architected to support multiple internal energy pathways. These pathways converge at a single structural location, enabling extended modal dominance and significantly broadening the frequency range over which a resonant phase is sustained. We demonstrate by direct numerical simulations the implications of this mechanism in the context of flow instability control, where current approaches are inherently constrained by the characteristically narrow spectral bandwidth of conventional resonances. Using a super-resonant phononic subsurface structure interfacing with a channel flow, we show passive simultaneous suppression of four unstable flow perturbations across a frequency range more than five times wider than that is achievable with a standard resonance in an equivalent uncoiled structure. By enabling broadband, passive control of flow instabilities, super resonance overcomes a longstanding limitation in laminar flow control strategies. More broadly, it introduces a powerful new tool for phase-engineered wave-matter interaction. The ability to preserve out-of-phase modal response across wide spectral ranges establishes a fundamental advance in the physics of resonance, with far-reaching implications for suppressing fully developed turbulent flows and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential equations containing memory terms that depend nonlinearly on past states model a variety of non-Markovian processes. In this study, we present a Markovian embedding procedure for such equations with distributed delay by utilising an exact spectral representation of the nonlinear memory function. This allows us to transform the nonlocal system to an equivalent local-in-time system in an abstract extended space. We demonstrate our embedding procedure for two one-dimensional physical models: (i) the walking droplet and (ii) the single-phase Stefan problem. In addition to providing an alternative representation of the underlying physical system, the local representation finds applications in designing efficient time-integrators with time-independent computational costs for memory-dependent systems which typically suffer from growing-in-time costs.</description>

      <title>A free boundary problem for an immersed filament in 3D Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a simplified extensible version of a dynamic free boundary problem for a thin filament with radius $\epsilon&gt;0$ immersed in 3D Stokes flow. The 3D fluid is coupled to the quasi-1D filament dynamics via a novel type of angle-averaged Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator for the Stokes equations, and much of the difficulty in the analysis lies in understanding this operator. Here we show that the main part of this angle-averaged NtD map about a closed, curved filament is the corresponding operator about a straight filament, for which we can derive an explicit symbol. Remainder terms due to curvature are lower order with respect to regularity or size in $\epsilon$. Using this operator decomposition, it is then possible to show that the simplified free boundary evolution is a third-order parabolic equation and is locally well posed. This establishes a more complete mathematical foundation for the myriad computational results based on slender body approximations for thin immersed elastic structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a new class of plane billiards - the `pensive billiard' - in which the billiard ball travels along the boundary for some distance depending on the incidence angle before reflecting, while preserving the billiard rule of equality of the angles of incidence and reflection. This generalizes so called `puck billiards' proposed by M.Bialy, as well as a `vortex billiard', i.e. the motion of a point vortex dipole in 2D hydrodynamics on domains with boundary. We prove the variational origin and invariance of a symplectic structure for pensive billiards, as well as study their properties including conditions for a twist map, the existence of periodic orbits, etc. We also demonstrate the appearance of both the golden and silver ratios in the corresponding hydrodynamical vortex setting. Finally, we introduce and describe basic properties of pensive outer billiards.</description>

      <title>The Granule-In-Cell Method for Simulating Sand--Water Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simulation of sand--water mixtures requires capturing the stochastic behavior of individual sand particles within a uniform, continuous fluid medium, such as the characteristic of migration, deposition, and plugging across various scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a Granule-in-Cell (GIC) method for simulating such sand--water interaction. We leverage the Discrete Element Method (DEM) to capture the fine-scale details of individual granules and the Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method for its continuous spatial representation and particle-based structure for density projection. To combine these two frameworks, we treat granules as macroscopic transport flow rather than solid boundaries for the fluid. This bidirectional coupling allows our model to accommodate a range of interphase forces with different discretization schemes, resulting in a more realistic simulation with fully respect to the mass conservation equation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in simulating complex sand--water interactions, while maintaining volume consistency. Notably, in the dam-breaking experiment, our simulation uniquely captures the distinct physical properties of sand under varying infiltration degree within a single scenario. Our work advances the state of the art in granule--fluid simulation, offering a unified framework that bridges mesoscopic and macroscopic dynamics.</description>
