      <title>How Combined Pairwise and Higher-Order Interactions Shape Transient Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Understanding how species interactions shape biodiversity is a core challenge in ecology. While much focus has been on long-term stability, there is rising interest in transient dynamics-the short-lived periods when ecosystems respond to disturbances and adjust toward stability. These transitions are crucial for predicting ecosystem reactions and guiding effective conservation. Our study introduces a model that uses convex combinations to blend pairwise and higher-order interactions, offering a more realistic view of natural ecosystems. We find pairwise interactions slow the journey to stability, while higher-order interactions speed it up. Employing global stability analysis and numerical simulations, we establish that as the proportion of higher-order interactions (HOIs) increases, mean transient times exhibit a significant reduction, thereby underscoring the essential role of HOIs in enhancing biodiversity stabilization. Our results reveal a robust correlation between the most negative real part of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix associated with the linearized system at the coexistence equilibrium and the mean transient times. This indicates that a more negative leading eigenvalue correlates with accelerated convergence to stable coexistence abundances. This insight is vital for comprehending ecosystem resilience and recovery, emphasizing the key role of HOIs in promoting stabilization. Amid growing interest in transient dynamics and its implications for biodiversity and ecological stability, our study enhances the understanding of how species interactions affect both transient and long-term ecosystem behavior. By addressing a critical gap in ecological theory and offering a practical framework for ecosystem management, our work advances knowledge of transient dynamics, ultimately informing effective conservation strategies.</description>
