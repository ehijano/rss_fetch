      <title>Neuroblastoma: nutritional strategies as supportive care in pediatric oncology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuroblastoma, is a highly heterogeneous pediatric tumour and is responsible for 15% of pediatric cancer-related deaths. The clinical outcomes can vary from spontaneous regression to high metastatic disease. This extracranial tumour arises from a neural crest-derived cell and can harbor different phenotypes. Its heterogeneity may result from variations in differentiation states influenced by genetic and epigenetic factors and individual patient characteristics. This leads downstream to disruption of homeostasis and a metabolic shift in response to the tumour needs. Nutrition can play a key role in influencing various aspects of a tumour behaviour. This review provides an in-depth exploration of the aetiology of neuroblastoma and the different avenues of disease progression, which can be targeted with individualized nutrition intervention strategies to improve the well-being of children and optimize clinical outcomes.</description>

      <title>A large population of cell-specific action potential models replicating fluorescence recordings of voltage in rabbit ventricular myocytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent high-throughput experiments unveil substantial electrophysiological diversity among uncoupled healthy myocytes under identical conditions. To quantify inter-cell variability, the values of a subset of the parameters in a well-regarded mathematical model of the action potential of rabbit ventricular myocytes are estimated from fluorescence voltage measurements of a large number of cells. Statistical inference yields a population of nearly 1200 cell-specific model variants that, on a population-level replicate experimentally measured biomarker ranges and distributions, and in contrast to earlier studies, also match experimental biomarker values on a cell-by-cell basis. This model population may be regarded as a random sample from the phenotype of healthy rabbit ventricular myocytes. Uni-variate and bi-variate joint marginal distributions of the estimated parameters are presented, and the parameter dependencies of several commonly utilised electrophysiological biomarkers are revealed. Parameter values are weakly correlated, while summary metrics such as the action potential duration are not strongly dependent on any single electrophysiological characteristic of the myocyte. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of accurately and efficiently fitting entire action potential waveforms at scale.
  Keywords: cellular excitability, rabbit ventricular myocytes, fluorescence voltage measurements, action potential waveform, parameter estimation in differential equations, noisy time series</description>

      <title>A Multi-Modal AI Copilot for Single-Cell Analysis with Instruction Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models excel at interpreting complex natural language instructions, enabling them to perform a wide range of tasks. In the life sciences, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data serves as the "language of cellular biology", capturing intricate gene expression patterns at the single-cell level. However, interacting with this "language" through conventional tools is often inefficient and unintuitive, posing challenges for researchers. To address these limitations, we present InstructCell, a multi-modal AI copilot that leverages natural language as a medium for more direct and flexible single-cell analysis. We construct a comprehensive multi-modal instruction dataset that pairs text-based instructions with scRNA-seq profiles from diverse tissues and species. Building on this, we develop a multi-modal cell language architecture capable of simultaneously interpreting and processing both modalities. InstructCell empowers researchers to accomplish critical tasks-such as cell type annotation, conditional pseudo-cell generation, and drug sensitivity prediction-using straightforward natural language commands. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that InstructCell consistently meets or exceeds the performance of existing single-cell foundation models, while adapting to diverse experimental conditions. More importantly, InstructCell provides an accessible and intuitive tool for exploring complex single-cell data, lowering technical barriers and enabling deeper biological insights.</description>
