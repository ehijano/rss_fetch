      <title>Cylindrical cavity expansion analysis under partially drained conditions for normalisation of excess water pressure in CPTU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cone tip resistance and excess water pressure (EWP) measured by piezocone penetration tests (CPTU) may be significantly affected by the partially drained effect in soils with intermediate permeability. To capture this effect, the paper proposes a straightforward, hydro-mechanical coupling solution for cylindrical cavity expansion under partially drained conditions. The mechanical behaviour of soils is modelled using the elastoplastic Tresca model and water flow within porous soils is assumed to obey Darcys law. Two partial differential equations (PDEs) are established in the elastic and plastic zones, respectively, transforming the cavity expansion analysis into a typical Stefan problem with dynamic boundary conditions (i.e. a moving boundary at the elastoplastic interface). An approximate solution for the PDEs is derived by leveraging the variable transformation method. Based on the new solution, a novel normalised penetration rate is defined considering the rigidity index of soils, with which a unique backbone curve for CPTU is found. Finally, the backbone curve is compared with a database comprising 109 in-situ experimental tests, 101 centrifuge modelling tests, and numerical simulation results. The proposed solution may provide a useful theoretical tool for interpreting the consolidation coefficient of fine-grained soils from the penetration stage of multi-rate CPTU, which can enhance the interpretation reliability for CPTU dissipation tests.</description>

      <title>Bolide infrasound signal morphology and yield estimates: A case study of two events detected by a dense acoustic sensor network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two bolides (2 June 2016 and 4 April 2019) were detected at multiple regional infrasound stations with many of the locations receiving multiple detections. Analysis of the received signals was used to estimate the yield, location and trajectory, and the type of shock that produced the received signal. The results from the infrasound analysis were compared with ground truth information that was collected through other sensing modalities. This multi-modal framework offers an expanded perspective on the processes governing bolide shock generation and propagation. The majority of signal features showed reasonable agreement between the infrasound-based interpretation and the other observational modalities, though the yield estimate from the 2019 bolide was significantly lower using the infrasound detections. There was also evidence suggesting that one of the detections was from a cylindrical shock that was initially propagating upward, which is unusual though not impossible.</description>

      <title>A Neural Operator-Based Emulator for Regional Shallow Water Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coastal regions are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of rising sea levels and extreme weather events. Accurate real-time forecasting of hydrodynamic processes in these areas is essential for infrastructure planning and climate adaptation. In this study, we present the Multiple-Input Temporal Operator Network (MITONet), a novel autoregressive neural emulator that employs dimensionality reduction to efficiently approximate high-dimensional numerical solvers for complex, nonlinear problems that are governed by time-dependent, parameterized partial differential equations. Although MITONet is applicable to a wide range of problems, we showcase its capabilities by forecasting regional tide-driven dynamics described by the two-dimensional shallow-water equations, while incorporating initial conditions, boundary conditions, and a varying domain parameter. We demonstrate MITONet's performance in a real-world application, highlighting its ability to make accurate predictions by extrapolating both in time and parametric space.</description>
