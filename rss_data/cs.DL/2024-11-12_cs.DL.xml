      <title>Diamond open access and open infrastructures have shaped the Canadian scholarly journal landscape since the start of the digital era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scholarly publishing involves multiple stakeholders having various types of interest. In Canada, the implication of universities, the presence of societies and the availability of governmental support for periodicals seem to have contributed to a rather diverse ecosystem of journals. This study presents in detail the current state of these journals, in addition to past trends and transformations during the 20th century and, in particular, the digital era. To this effect, we created a new dataset, including a total of 1256 journals, 944 of which appeared to be active today, specifically focusing on the supporting organizations behind the journals, the types of (open) access, disciplines, geographic origins, languages of publication and hosting platforms and tools. The main overarching traits across Canadian scholarly journals are an important presence of Diamond open access, which has been adopted by 62% of the journals, a predominance of the Social Sciences and Humanities disciplines and a scarce presence of the major commercial publishers. The digital era allowed for the development of open infrastructures, which contributed to the creation of a new generation of journals that massively adopted Diamond open access, often supported by university libraries. However, journal cessation also increased, especially among the recently founded journals. These results provide valuable insights for the design of tailored practices and policies that cater to the needs of different types of periodicals and that take into account the evolving practices across the Canadian scholarly journal landscape.</description>

      <title>Two scholarly publishing cultures? Open access drives a divergence in European academic publishing practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current system of scholarly publishing is often criticized for being slow, expensive, and not transparent. The rise of open access publishing as part of open science tenets, promoting transparency and collaboration, together with calls for research assesment reforms are the results of these criticisms. The emergence of new open access publishers presents a unique opportunity to empirically test how universities and countries respond to shifts in the academic publishing landscape. These new actors challenge traditional publishing models, offering faster review times and broader accessibility, which could influence strategic publishing decisions.
  Our findings reveal a clear division in European publishing practices, with countries clustering into two groups distinguished by the ratio of publications in new open access journals with accelerated review times versus legacy journals. This divide underscores a broader shift in academic culture, highlighting new open access publishing venues as a strategic factor influencing national and institutional publishing practices, with significant implications for research accessibility and collaboration across Europe.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Accessibility in Special Libraries: A Study on AI-Powered Assistive Technologies for Patrons with Disabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study seeks to identify the potential role of AI-driven assistive technologies in enhancing access to libraries for persons with varying degrees of challenges. Traditional libraries pose a problem to many users with vision and mobility, among other conditions related to physical and infirmities. This mixed-methods research approach will examine ways in which AI-powered assistive tools and applications associated with text-to-speech, navigation systems, and personalized assistants are revolutionizing library services through a literature review, survey methods, interviews, and case studies. Our findings suggest that these technologies greatly increase the autonomy and participation of people with physical disabilities, providing personalized support and access to a wide range of resources. From this, some key findings have been deduced from the research, showing a strong impact on user experience and efficiency in services, while at the same time bringing out important considerations related to privacy and ethical implementation. This study highlights the central role of AI in making library settings more inclusive, thereby allowing equal access to knowledge and participation in the community. Such insight thus serves professionals working in libraries, policymakers, and technology developers for innovations to occur uninterruptedly, with future research directions proposed that would refine such technologies, especially toward the special needs of diverse populations. By adopting AI, libraries could uphold their mission of providing equal access to knowledge through full and equal participation of all persons, regardless of any type of physical ability, in the learning and community activities carried out by the library. This study paves the way for future innovations in creating more accessible and inclusive library spaces.</description>

      <title>ChemDFM: A Large Language Foundation Model for Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14818v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has played an increasingly important role in chemical research. However, most models currently used in chemistry are specialist models that require training and tuning for specific tasks. A more generic and efficient solution would be an AI model that could address many tasks and support free-form dialogue in the broad field of chemistry. In its utmost form, such a generalist AI chemist could be referred to as Chemical General Intelligence. Large language models (LLMs) have recently logged tremendous success in the general domain of natural language processing, showing emerging task generalization and free-form dialogue capabilities. However, domain knowledge of chemistry is largely missing when training general-domain LLMs. The lack of such knowledge greatly hinders the performance of generalist LLMs in the field of chemistry. To this end, we develop ChemDFM, a pioneering LLM for chemistry trained on 34B tokens from chemical literature and textbooks, and fine-tuned using 2.7M instructions. As a result, it can understand and reason with chemical knowledge in free-form dialogue. Quantitative evaluations show that ChemDFM significantly surpasses most representative open-source LLMs. It outperforms GPT-4 on a great portion of chemical tasks, despite the substantial size difference. We have open-sourced the inference codes, evaluation datasets, and model weights of ChemDFM on Huggingface (https://huggingface.co/OpenDFM/ChemDFM-v1.0-13B).</description>

      <title>Usefulness of LLMs as an Author Checklist Assistant for Scientific Papers: NeurIPS'24 Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) represent a promising, but controversial, tool in aiding scientific peer review. This study evaluates the usefulness of LLMs in a conference setting as a tool for vetting paper submissions against submission standards. We conduct an experiment at the 2024 Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) conference, where 234 papers were voluntarily submitted to an "LLM-based Checklist Assistant." This assistant validates whether papers adhere to the author checklist used by NeurIPS, which includes questions to ensure compliance with research and manuscript preparation standards. Evaluation of the assistant by NeurIPS paper authors suggests that the LLM-based assistant was generally helpful in verifying checklist completion. In post-usage surveys, over 70% of authors found the assistant useful, and 70% indicate that they would revise their papers or checklist responses based on its feedback. While causal attribution to the assistant is not definitive, qualitative evidence suggests that the LLM contributed to improving some submissions. Survey responses and analysis of re-submissions indicate that authors made substantive revisions to their submissions in response to specific feedback from the LLM. The experiment also highlights common issues with LLMs: inaccuracy (20/52) and excessive strictness (14/52) were the most frequent issues flagged by authors. We also conduct experiments to understand potential gaming of the system, which reveal that the assistant could be manipulated to enhance scores through fabricated justifications, highlighting potential vulnerabilities of automated review tools.</description>
