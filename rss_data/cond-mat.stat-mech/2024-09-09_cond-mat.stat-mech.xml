      <title>Stochastic Scovil--Schulz-DuBois machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three types of cycles are identified in the quantum jump trajectories of the Scovil--Schulz-DuBois (SSDB) machine: an R-cycle as refrigeration, an H-cycle as a heat engine, and an N-cycle in which the machine is neutral. The statistics of these cycles are investigated via a semi-Markov process method. We find that in the large time limit, whether the machine operates as a heat engine or refrigerator depends on a balance between the numbers of R-cycles and H-cycles per unit time. Further increasing the hot bath temperature above a certain threshold does not increase the machine's power output. The cause is that, in this situation, the N-cycle has a greater probability than the H-cycle and R-cycle. Although the SSDB machine operates by randomly switching among these three cycles, at the level of a single quantum jump trajectory, its heat engine efficiency and the refrigerator's coefficient of performance remain constant.</description>

      <title>Re-entrant percolation in active Brownian hard disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium clustering and percolation are investigated in an archetypal model of two-dimensional active matter using dynamic simulations of self-propelled Brownian repulsive particles. We concentrate on the single-phase region up to moderate levels of activity, before motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) sets in. Weak activity promotes cluster formation and lowers the percolation threshold. However, driving the system further out of equilibrium partly reverses this effect, resulting in a minimum in the critical density for the formation of system-spanning clusters and introducing re-entrant percolation as a function of activity in the pre-MIPS regime. This non-monotonic behaviour arises from competition between activity-induced effective attraction (which eventually leads to MIPS) and activity-driven cluster breakup. Using an adapted iterative Boltzmann inversion method, we derive effective potentials to map weakly active cases onto a passive (equilibrium) model with conservative attraction, which can be characterised by Monte Carlo simulations. While the active and passive systems have practically identical radial distribution functions, we find decisive differences in higher-order structural correlations, to which the percolation threshold is highly sensitive. For sufficiently strong activity, no passive pairwise potential can reproduce the radial distribution function of the active system.</description>

      <title>Periodic systems have new classes of synchronization stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Master Stability Function is a robust and useful tool for determining the conditions of synchronization stability in a network of coupled systems. While a comprehensive classification exists in the case in which the nodes are chaotic dynamical systems, its application to periodic systems has been less explored. By studying several well-known periodic systems, we establish a comprehensive framework to understand and classify their properties of synchronizability. This allows us to define five distinct classes of synchronization stability, including some that are unique to periodic systems. Specifically, in periodic systems, the Master Stability Function vanishes at the origin, and it can therefore display behavioral classes that are not achievable in chaotic systems, where it starts, instead, at a strictly positive value. Moreover, our results challenge the widely-held belief that periodic systems are easily put in a stable synchronous state, showing, instead, the common occurrence of a lower threshold for synchronization stability.</description>

      <title>Dimensional crossover via confinement in the lattice Lorentz gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a lattice model in which a tracer particle moves in the presence of randomly distributed immobile obstacles. The crowding effect due to the obstacles interplays with the quasi-confinement imposed by wrapping the lattice onto a cylinder. We compute the velocity autocorrelation function and show that already in equilibrium the system exhibits a dimensional crossover from two- to one-dimensional as time progresses. A pulling force is switched on and we characterize analytically the stationary state in terms of the stationary velocity and diffusion coefficient. Stochastic simulations are used to discuss the range of validity of the analytic results. Our calculation, exact to first order in the obstacle density, holds for arbitrarily large forces and confinement size.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent dynamics in the confined lattice Lorentz gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a lattice model describing the non-equilibrium dynamics emerging from the pulling of a tracer particle through a disordered medium occupied by randomly placed obstacles. The model is considered in a restricted geometry pertinent for the investigation of confinement-induced effects. We analytically derive exact results for the characteristic function of the moments valid to first order in the obstacle density. By calculating the velocity autocorrelation function and its long-time tail we find that already in equilibrium the system exhibits a dimensional crossover. This picture is further confirmed by the approach of the drift velocity to its terminal value attained in the non-equilibrium stationary state. At large times the diffusion coefficient is affected by both the driving and confinement in a way that we quantify analytically. The force-induced diffusion coefficient depends sensitively on the presence of confinement. The latter is able to modify qualitatively the non-analytic behavior in the force observed for the unbounded model. We then examine the fluctuations of the tracer particle along the driving force. We show that in the intermediate regime superdiffusive anomalous behavior persists even in the presence of confinement. Stochastic simulations are employed in order to test the validity of the analytic results, exact to first order in the obstacle density and valid for arbitrary force and confinement.</description>

      <title>Neural Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the connection between deep learning and information theory through the paradigm of diffusion models. Using well-established principles from non-equilibrium thermodynamics we can characterize the amount of information required to reverse a diffusive process. Neural networks store this information and operate in a manner reminiscent of Maxwell's demon during the generative stage. We illustrate this cycle using a novel diffusion scheme we call the entropy matching model, wherein the information conveyed to the network during training exactly corresponds to the entropy that must be negated during reversal. We demonstrate that this entropy can be used to analyze the encoding efficiency and storage capacity of the network. This conceptual picture blends elements of stochastic optimal control, thermodynamics, information theory, and optimal transport, and raises the prospect of applying diffusion models as a test bench to understand neural networks.</description>

      <title>Higher-Rank Spin Liquids and Spin Nematics from Competing Orders in Pyrochlore Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pyrochlore magnets have proven to provide an excellent arena for the realization of a variety of many-body phenomena such as classical and quantum order-by-disorder, as well as spin liquid phases described by emergent gauge field theories. These phenomena arise from the competition between different symmetry-breaking magnetic orders. In this work, we consider a subspace of the most general bilinear nearest-neighbor Hamiltonian on the pyrochlore lattice, parameterized by the local interaction parameter $J_{z\pm}$, where three symmetry-breaking phases converge. We demonstrate that for small values of $|J_{z\pm}|$, a conventional $\mathbf q=0$ ordered phase is selected by a thermal order-by-disorder mechanism. For $|J_{z\pm}|$ above a certain finite threshold, a novel spin-nematic phase is stabilized at low temperatures. Instead of the usual Bragg peaks, the spin-nematic phase features lines of high intensity in the spin structure factor. At intermediate temperatures above the low-temperature orders, a rank-2 U(1) classical spin liquid is realized for all $J_{z\pm} \neq 0$. We fully characterize all phases using classical Monte-Carlo simulations and a self-consistent Gaussian approximation.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Brownian Barrier: Models and Manifestations of Molecular Diffusion in Complex Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over a century ago, Einstein formulated a precise mathematical model for describing Brownian motion. While this model adequately explains the diffusion of micron-sized particles in fluids, its limitations become apparent when applied to molecular self-diffusion in fluids. The foundational principles of Gaussianity and Markovianity, central to the Brownian diffusion paradigm, are insufficient for describing molecular diffusion, particularly in complex fluids characterized by intricate intermolecular interactions and hindered relaxation processes. This perspective delves into the nuanced behavior observed in diverse complex fluids, including molecular self-assembly, deep eutectic solvents, and ionic liquids, with a specific focus on modeling self-diffusion within these media. We explore the potential of extending diffusion models to incorporate non-Gaussian and non-Markovian effects by augmenting the Brownian model using non-local diffusion equations. Further, we validate the applicability of these models by utilizing them to describe results from quasielastic neutron scattering and MD simulations.</description>

      <title>Collective chemotactic search strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemotactic biological or synthetic active matter shapes its environment by secretions of chemical signals from its self-propelled constituents, like cells, organisms or active colloids. From this indirect interaction collective effects emerge that can be used by the agents to migrate collectively, to form patterns or to search for targets more efficiently. Here, we use paradigmatic models to study the efficiency of collective search strategies of a large group of motile agents that release during their movement repulsive auto-chemotactic signals forcing them to move away from high concentrations of the chemical clue. We show that the repulsive chemotactic interactions improve the search efficiency, measured by the mean first passage time to find a randomly located target, by orders of magnitude depending on the strength of the chemotactic coupling. The mechanism for this improvement relies on two factors: the increase of the persistence length due to the agent's self-interaction with its own chemotactic field and by a more homogeneous distribution of the agents due to their mutual indirect repulsion mediated by the chemotactic field. At stronger particle-field coupling the chemotactic searchers self-organize into ballistically moving bands reminiscent of search-chains formed in search and rescue operations, whose efficiency depends on the number of searchers involved. Our comprehensive study of collective search strategies of large groups of interacting agents is not only relevant for chemotactic active matter but also for a wide range of fields like ethology, information engineering, robotics, and social engineering.</description>

      <title>Geometrical Approach to Logical Qubit Fidelities of Neutral Atom CSS Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Encoding quantum information in a quantum error correction (QEC) code enhances protection against errors. Imperfection of quantum devices due to decoherence effects will limit the fidelity of quantum gate operations. In particular, neutral atom quantum computers will suffer from correlated errors because of the finite lifetime of the Rydberg states that facilitate entanglement. Predicting the impact of such errors on the performance of topological QEC codes is important in understanding and characterising the fidelity limitations of a real quantum device. Mapping a QEC code to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with disorder allows us to use Monte Carlo techniques to calculate upper bounds on error rates without resorting to an optimal decoder. In this Article, we adopt this statistical mapping to predict error rate thresholds for neutral atom architecture, assuming radiative decay to the computational basis, leakage and atom loss as the sole error sources. We quantify this error rate threshold $p_\text{th}$ and bounds on experimental constraints, given any set of experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>Highly efficient path-integral molecular dynamics simulations with GPUMD using neuroevolution potentials: Case studies on thermal properties of materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations are crucial for accurately capturing nuclear quantum effects in materials. However, their computational intensity and reliance on multiple software packages often limit their applicability at large scales. Here, we present an integration of PIMD methods, including thermostatted ring-polymer molecular dynamics (TRPMD), into the open-source GPUMD package, combined with highly accurate and efficient machine-learned neuroevolution potential (NEP) models. This approach achieves almost the accuracy of first-principles calculations with the computational efficiency of empirical potentials, enabling large-scale atomistic simulations that incorporate nuclear quantum effects. We demonstrate the efficacy of the combined NEP-PIMD approach by examining various thermal properties of diverse materials, including lithium hydride (LiH), three porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and elemental aluminum. For LiH, our NEP-PIMD simulations successfully capture the isotope effect, reproducing the experimentally observed dependence of the lattice parameter on the reduced mass. For MOFs, our results reveal that achieving good agreement with experimental data requires consideration of both nuclear quantum effects and dispersive interactions. For aluminum, the TRPMD method effectively captures thermal expansion and phonon properties, aligning well with quantum mechanical predictions. This efficient NEP-PIMD approach opens new avenues for exploring complex material properties influenced by nuclear quantum effects, with potential applications across a broad range of materials.</description>

      <title>Universal energy and magnetisation distributions in the Blume-Capel and Baxter-Wu models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the probability distribution functions of the energy and magnetisation of the two-dimensional Blume-Capel and Baxter-Wu models with spin values $S \in \{1/2,1, 3/2\}$ in the presence of a crystal field $\Delta$. By employing extensive single-spin flip Monte Carlo simulations and a recently developed method of studying the zeros of the energy probability distribution we are able to probe, with a good numerical accuracy, several critical characteristics of the transitions. Additionally, the universal aspects of these transitions are scrutinised by computing the corresponding probability distribution functions. The energy distribution has been underutilised in the literature when compared to that of the magnetisation. Somewhat surprisingly, however, the former appears to be more robust in characterising the universality class for both models upon varying the crystal field $\Delta$ than the latter. Finally, our analysis suggests that in contrast to the Blume-Capel ferromagnet, the Baxter-Wu model appears to suffer from strong finite-size effects, especially upon increasing $\Delta$ and $S$, that obscure the application of traditional finite-size scaling approaches.</description>

      <title>Element-wise and Recursive Solutions for the Power Spectral Density of Biological Stochastic Dynamical Systems at Fixed Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19890v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochasticity plays a central role in nearly every biological process, and the noise power spectral density (PSD) is a critical tool for understanding variability and information processing in living systems. In steady-state, many such processes can be described by stochastic linear time-invariant (LTI) systems driven by Gaussian white noise, whose PSD is a complex rational function of the frequency that can be concisely expressed in terms of their Jacobian, dispersion, and diffusion matrices, fully defining the statistical properties of the system's dynamics at steady-state. Here, we arrive at compact element-wise solutions of the rational function coefficients for the auto- and cross-spectrum that enable the explicit analytical computation of the PSD in dimensions n=2,3,4. We further present a recursive Leverrier-Faddeev-type algorithm for the exact computation of the rational function coefficients. Crucially, both solutions are free of matrix inverses. We illustrate our element-wise and recursive solutions by considering the stochastic dynamics of neural systems models, namely Fitzhugh-Nagumo (n=2), Hindmarsh-Rose (n=3), Wilson-Cowan (n=4), and the Stabilized Supralinear Network (n=22), as well as an evolutionary game-theoretic model with mutations (n=5, 31). We extend our approach to derive a recursive method for calculating the coefficients in the power series expansion of the integrated covariance matrix for interacting spiking neurons modeled as Hawkes processes on arbitrary directed graphs.</description>

      <title>Quest for optimal quantum resetting: protocols for a particle on a chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09150v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the classical context, it is well known that, sometimes, if the search does not find its target, it is better to start the process anew again, known as resetting. The quantum counterpart of resetting also indicates speeding up the detection process by eliminating the dark states, i.e., situations where the particle avoids detection. In this work, we introduce the most probable position resetting(MPR) protocol in which, at a given resetting step, resets are done with certain probabilities to the set of possible peak positions (where the probability of finding the particle is maximum) that could occur because of the previous resets and followed by uninterrupted unitary evolution, irrespective of which path was taken by the particle in previous steps. In a tight-binding lattice model, there exists a 2-fold degeneracy (left and right) of the positions of maximum probability. The survival probability with optimal restart rate approaches zero (detection probability approaches one) when the particle is reset with equal probability on both sides path independently. This protocol significantly reduces the optimal mean first-detected-passage time (FDT) and performs better even if the detector is far apart compared to the usual resetting protocols where the particle is brought back to the initial position. We propose a modified protocol, an adaptive two-stage MPR, by making the associated probabilities of going to the right and left a function of steps. In this protocol, we see a further reduction of the optimal mean FDT and improvement in the search process when the detector is far apart.</description>

Abstract: Quasiperiodic systems extend the concept of the Anderson transition to quasi-random and low-dimensional realms and have garnered widespread attention. Here, we propose the asymptotic quasiperiodic two-dimensional systems characterized by a sequence of rational magnetic fluxes, which have an irrational limit, and predict exotic universal wave-packet dynamics and transport phenomena associated with the asymptotic quasiperiodicity (AQP). The predictions unveil a class of multiple metal-insulator transitions driven by a novel interplay effect between AQP, relaxation, and finite temperature, which further reveals a unified and profound mechanism. Specifically, all the transport phenomena, including the wave-packet dynamics, the bulk and edge transport, are unified in the universal scaling laws unveiled in the asymptotic quasiperiodic regime, which demonstrate a nontrivial asymptotic connection to quantum phases in the quasiperiodic limit. Our work enriches the universal quantum transport phenomena, adds to the basic mechanisms underlying metal-insulator transitions, and opens up an avenue to study the exotic transport physics with AQP in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Boundary Time Crystals as AC sensors: enhancements and constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06273</link>

Abstract: We investigate the use of a boundary time crystals (BTCs) as sensors of AC fields. Boundary time crystals are non-equilibrium phases of matter in contact to an environment, for which a macroscopic fraction of the many-body system breaks the time translation symmetry. We find an enhanced sensitivity of the BTC when its spins are resonant with the applied AC field, as quantified by the quantum Fisher information (QFI). The QFI dynamics in this regime is shown to be captured by a relatively simple ansatz consisting of an initial power-law growth and late-time exponential decay. We study the scaling of the ansatz parameters with resources (encoding time and number of spins) and identify a moderate quantum enhancement in the sensor performance through comparison with classical QFI bounds. Investigating the precise source of this performance, we find that despite of its long coherence time and multipartite correlations (advantageous properties for quantum metrology), the entropic cost of the BTC (which grows indefinitely in the thermodynamic limit) hinders an optimal decoding of the AC field information. This result has implications for future candidates of quantum sensors in open system and we hope it will encourage future study into the role of entropy in quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in quenched extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with anomalous dynamical quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on topological models unveils fascinating physics, especially in the realm of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs). However, the understanding of entanglement structures and properties near DQPT in models with longer-range hoppings is far from complete. In this work, we study DQPTs in the quenched extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Anomalous DQPTs, where the number of critical momenta exceeds the winding number differences between the pre-quench and post-quench phases, are observed. We find that the entanglement exhibits local maximum (minimum) around the anomalous DQPTs, in line with the level crossings (separations) around the middle of the correlation matrix spectrum. We further categorize the phases in the equilibrium model into two classes and distinctive features in the time evolution of the entanglement involving quenches within and across the two classes are identified. The findings pave the way to a better understanding of topological models with longer-range hoppings in the out-of-equilibrium regime.</description>
