      <title>Differentially Private Online Distributed Aggregative Games With Time-Varying and Non-Identical Communication and Feedback Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates online distributed aggregative games with time-varying cost functions, where agents are interconnected through an unbalanced communication graph. Due to the distributed and noncooperative nature of the game, some curious agents may wish to steal sensitive information from neighboring agents during parameter exchanges. Additionally, communication delays arising from network congestion, particularly in wireless settings, as well as feedback delays, can hinder the convergence of agents to a Nash equilibrium. Although a recent work addressed both communication and feedback delays in aggregative games, it is based on the unrealistic assumption that the delays are fixed over time and identical across agents. Hence, the case of time-varying and non-identical delays across agents has never been considered in aggregative games. In this work, we address the combined challenges of privacy leakage with time-varying and non-identical communication and feedback delays for the first time. We propose an online distributed dual averaging algorithm that simultaneously tackles these challenges while achieving a provably low regret bound. Our simulation result shows that the running average of each client's local action converges over time.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous AlphaZero: Extending Tree Search to Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous AlphaZero extends the AlphaZero framework to multistep, two-player zero-sum deterministic Markov games with simultaneous actions. At each decision point, joint action selection is resolved via matrix games whose payoffs incorporate both immediate rewards and future value estimates. To handle uncertainty arising from bandit feedback during Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), Simultaneous AlphaZero incorporates a regret-optimal solver for matrix games with bandit feedback. Simultaneous AlphaZero demonstrates robust strategies in a continuous-state discrete-action pursuit-evasion game and satellite custody maintenance scenarios, even when evaluated against maximally exploitative opponents.</description>

      <title>Generative AI as Digital Representatives in Collective Decision-Making: A Game-Theoretical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) enables digital representatives to make decisions on behalf of team members in collaborative tasks, but faces challenges in accurately representing preferences. While supplying GenAI with detailed personal information improves representation fidelity, feasibility constraints make complete information access impractical. We bridge this gap by developing a game-theoretic framework that models strategic information revelation to GenAI in collective decision-making. The technical challenges lie in characterizing members' equilibrium behaviors under interdependent strategies and quantifying the imperfect preference learning outcomes by digital representatives. Our contribution includes closed-form equilibrium characterizations that reveal how members strategically balance team decision preference against communication costs. Our analysis yields an interesting finding: Conflicting preferences between team members drive competitive information revelation, with members revealing more information than those with aligned preferences. While digital representatives produce aggregate preference losses no smaller than direct participation, individual members may paradoxically achieve decisions more closely aligned with their preferences when using digital representatives, particularly when manual participation costs are high or when GenAI systems are sufficiently advanced.</description>

      <title>A Direct Second-Order Method for Solving Two-Player Zero-Sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce, to our knowledge, the first direct second-order method for computing Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum games. To do so, we construct a Douglas-Rachford-style splitting formulation, which we then solve with a semi-smooth Newton (SSN) method. We show that our algorithm enjoys local superlinear convergence. In order to augment the fast local behavior of our SSN method with global efficiency guarantees, we develop a hybrid method that combines our SSN method with the state-of-the-art first-order method for game solving, Predictive Regret Matching$^+$ (PRM$^+$). Our hybrid algorithm leverages the global progress provided by PRM$^+$, while achieving a local superlinear convergence rate once it switches to SSN near a Nash equilibrium. Numerical experiments on matrix games demonstrate order-of-magnitude speedups over PRM$^+$ for high-precision solutions.</description>

      <title>Fair Coordination in Strategic Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a scheduling problem of strategic agents representing jobs of different weights. Each agent has to decide on one of a finite set of identical machines to get their job processed. In contrast to the common and exclusive focus on makespan minimization, we want the outcome to be fair under strategic considerations of the agents. Two natural properties are credibility, which ensures that the assignment is a Nash equilibrium and equality, requiring that agents with equal-weight jobs are assigned to machines of equal load. We combine these two with a hierarchy of fairness properties based on envy-freeness together with several relaxations based on the idea that envy seems more justified towards agents with a higher weight. We present a complete complexity landscape for satisfiability and decision versions of these properties, alone or in combination, and study them as structural constraints under makespan optimization. For our positive results, we develop a unified algorithmic approach, where we achieve different properties by fine-tuning key subroutines.</description>

      <title>Distributed Places and Safe Net Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Being able to find small Petri nets with the same behaviour as formal specifications of concurrent systems benefits both effective verification and practical implementation of such systems. This paper considers specifications given in the form of compositionally defined safe nets.
  The paper discusses a novel concept of distributed place which implements the behaviour of an individual net place. It is shown that if distributed places cover a safe Petri net, then it is possible to delete some places without changing the behaviour. Crucially, the reduction is both static and local, making it computationally feasible in practice.
  The resulting reduction technique is then applied to an algebra of safe Petri nets (boxes) derived compositionally from process (box) expressions. Though the original derivation can yield exponentially large boxes, prior research demonstrated that if a box expression does not involve cyclic behaviours, the exponential number of places can be reduced down to polynomial (quadratic). In this paper, using distributed places, it is show that similar optimisation can also be achieved in the case of process expressions with iteration.</description>

      <title>AI-Generated Compromises for Coalition Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06837v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The challenge of finding compromises between agent proposals is fundamental to AI subfields such as argumentation, mediation, and negotiation. Building on this tradition, Elkind et al. (2021) introduced a process for coalition formation that seeks majority-supported proposals preferable to the status quo, using a metric space where each agent has an ideal point. A crucial step in this process involves identifying compromise proposals around which agent coalitions can unite. How to effectively find such compromise proposals remains an open question. We address this gap by formalizing a model that incorporates agent bounded rationality and uncertainty, and by developing AI methods to generate compromise proposals. We focus on the domain of collaborative document writing, such as the democratic drafting of a community constitution. Our approach uses natural language processing techniques and large language models to induce a semantic metric space over text. Based on this space, we design algorithms to suggest compromise points likely to receive broad support. To evaluate our methods, we simulate coalition formation processes and show that AI can facilitate large-scale democratic text editing, a domain where traditional tools are limited.</description>

      <title>Mirror Mode in Fire Emblem: Beating Players at their own Game with Imitation and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enemy strategies in turn-based games should be surprising and unpredictable. This study introduces Mirror Mode, a new game mode where the enemy AI mimics the personal strategy of a player to challenge them to keep changing their gameplay. A simplified version of the Nintendo strategy video game Fire Emblem Heroes has been built in Unity, with a Standard Mode and a Mirror Mode. Our first set of experiments find a suitable model for the task to imitate player demonstrations, using Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning: combining Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning, Behavioral Cloning, and Proximal Policy Optimization. The second set of experiments evaluates the constructed model with player tests, where models are trained on demonstrations provided by participants. The gameplay of the participants indicates good imitation in defensive behavior, but not in offensive strategies. Participant's surveys indicated that they recognized their own retreating tactics, and resulted in an overall higher player-satisfaction for Mirror Mode. Refining the model further may improve imitation quality and increase player's satisfaction, especially when players face their own strategies.

      <title>Hypergame Rationalisability: Solving Agent Misalignment In Strategic Play</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differences in perception, information asymmetries, and bounded rationality lead game-theoretic players to derive a private, subjective view of the game that may diverge from the underlying ground-truth scenario and may be misaligned with other players' interpretations. While typical game-theoretic assumptions often overlook such heterogeneity, hypergame theory provides the mathematical framework to reason about mismatched mental models. Although hypergames have recently gained traction in dynamic applications concerning uncertainty, their practical adoption in multi-agent system research has been hindered by the lack of a unifying, formal, and practical representation language, as well as scalable algorithms for managing complex hypergame structures and equilibria. Our work addresses this gap by introducing a declarative, logic-based domain-specific language for encoding hypergame structures and hypergame solution concepts. Leveraging answer-set programming, we develop an automated pipeline for instantiating hypergame structures and running our novel hypergame rationalisation procedure, a mechanism for finding belief structures that justify seemingly irrational outcomes. The proposed language establishes a unifying formalism for hypergames and serves as a foundation for developing nuanced, belief-based heterogeneous reasoners, offering a verifiable context with logical guarantees. Together, these contributions establish the connection between hypergame theory, multi-agent systems, and strategic AI.</description>

      <title>Towards Secure Decentralized Applications and Consensus Protocols in Blockchains (on Selfish Mining, Undercutting Attacks, DAG-Based Blockchains, E-Voting, Cryptocurrency Wallets, Secure-Logging, and CBDC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of cryptocurrencies, many new applications built on decentralized blockchains have emerged. Blockchains are full-stack distributed systems where multiple sub-systems interact. While many deployed blockchains and decentralized applications need better scalability and performance, security is also critical. Due to their complexity, assessing blockchain and DAPP security requires a more holistic view than for traditional distributed or centralized systems.
  In this thesis, we summarize our contributions to blockchain and decentralized application security. We propose a security reference architecture to support standardized vulnerability and threat analysis. We study consensus security in single-chain Proof-of-Work blockchains, including resistance to selfish mining, undercutting, and greedy transaction selection, as well as related issues in DAG-based systems. We contribute to wallet security with a new classification of authentication schemes and a two-factor method based on One-Time Passwords. We advance e-voting with a practical boardroom voting protocol, extend it to a scalable version for millions of participants while preserving security and privacy, and introduce a repetitive voting framework that enables vote changes between elections while avoiding peak-end effects. Finally, we improve secure logging using blockchains and trusted computing through a centralized ledger that guarantees non-equivocation, integrity, and censorship evidence, then build on it to propose an interoperability protocol for central bank digital currencies that ensures atomic transfers.</description>

      <title>No Screening is More Efficient with Multiple Objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study efficient mechanism design for allocating multiple heterogeneous objects. The aim is to maximize the residual surplus, the total value generated from an allocation minus the costs of screening. We discover a robust trend indicating that no-screening mechanisms, such as serial dictatorship with exogenous priority order, tend to perform better as the variety of goods increases. We analyze the underlying reasons by characterizing asymptotically efficient mechanisms in a stylized environment. We also apply an automated mechanism design approach to numerically derive efficient mechanisms and validate the trend in general environments. Building on these implications, we propose the \emph{register-invite-book system} (RIB) as an efficient system for scheduling vaccination against pandemic diseases.</description>

      <title>Learning and Computation of $\Phi$-Equilibria at the Frontier of Tractability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\Phi$-equilibria -- and the associated notion of $\Phi$-regret -- are a powerful and flexible framework at the heart of online learning and game theory, whereby enriching the set of deviations $\Phi$ begets stronger notions of rationality. Recently, Daskalakis, Farina, Fishelson, Pipis, and Schneider (STOC '24) -- abbreviated as DFFPS -- settled the existence of efficient algorithms when $\Phi$ contains only linear maps under a general, $d$-dimensional convex constraint set $\mathcal{X}$. In this paper, we significantly extend their work by resolving the case where $\Phi$ is $k$-dimensional; degree-$\ell$ polynomials constitute a canonical such example with $k = d^{O(\ell)}$. In particular, positing only oracle access to $\mathcal{X}$, we obtain two main positive results: i) a $\text{poly}(n, d, k, \text{log}(1/\epsilon))$-time algorithm for computing $\epsilon$-approximate $\Phi$-equilibria in $n$-player multilinear games, and ii) an efficient online algorithm that incurs average $\Phi$-regret at most $\epsilon$ using $\text{poly}(d, k)/\epsilon^2$ rounds.
  We also show nearly matching lower bounds in the online learning setting, thereby obtaining for the first time a family of deviations that captures the learnability of $\Phi$-regret.
  From a technical standpoint, we extend the framework of DFFPS from linear maps to the more challenging case of maps with polynomial dimension. At the heart of our approach is a polynomial-time algorithm for computing an expected fixed point of any $\phi : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{X}$ based on the ellipsoid against hope (EAH) algorithm of Papadimitriou and Roughgarden (JACM '08). In particular, our algorithm for computing $\Phi$-equilibria is based on executing EAH in a nested fashion -- each step of EAH itself being implemented by invoking a separate call to EAH.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish Nash equilibrium learning in large populations of noncooperative, strategic agents. Our analysis considers the broadest class to date of payoff mechanisms with first-order modifications, capable of modeling bounded rationality and anticipatory effects, averaging, or Pad\'{e} delay approximations. We propose a framework that, for the first time, combines two nonstandard system-theoretic passivity notions. Our results hold for discontinuous best response dynamics alongside continuous learning rules, significantly extending prior work.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Collusion is Algorithm Orchestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a fresh `meta-game' perspective on the problem of algorithmic collusion in pricing games a la Bertrand. Economists have interpreted the fact that algorithms can learn to price collusively as tacit collusion. We argue instead that the co-parametrization of algorithms, in ways as are necessary to obtain algorithmic collusion, typically requires algorithm designers to engage in some form of explicit collusion or `algorithm orchestration.' In our model, the algorithm designers play a meta-game of parametrizing their algorithms, which then play repeated Bertrand competition. The strategic analysis at the meta-level reveals new equilibrium and collusion phenomena. (JEL: C62, C63, D43, L13)</description>
