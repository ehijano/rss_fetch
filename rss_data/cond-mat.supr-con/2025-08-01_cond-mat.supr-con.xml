      <title>Exceptional Andreev spectrum and supercurrent in p-wave non-Hermitian Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spectrum of Andreev bound states and supercurrent in a $p$-wave non-Hermitian Josephson junction (NHJJ) in one dimension. The studied NHJJ is composed of two topological $p$-wave superconductors connected by a non-Hermitian dissipative junction. Starting from the effective non-Hermitian Bogoliubov-de Gennes bulk Hamiltonian, we find that a pair of exceptional points emerge in the complex spectrum of Andreev quasi-bound states. The two exceptional points locate symmetrically with respect to phase difference $\phi=\pi$ at zero real energy. Their separation is tunable by the non-Hermitian dissipation strength. By analyzing the non-Hermitian scattering process at the junction, we explicitly demonstrate the loss of quasiparticles through the decay of scattering amplitude probabilities. Furthermore, we obtain the supercurrent directly by the inelastic Andreev reflection amplitudes, which provides a more intuitive interpretation of transport properties in NHJJs. The supercurrent varies continuously as a function of $\phi$ across the exceptional points. No enhancement of critical current is observed. We also generalize our analysis to mixed $s$-$p$ wave NHJJ.</description>

      <title>Effect of quasiparticles on the parameters of a gap-engineered transmon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the quasiparticle contribution to the frequency shift and relaxation rates of a transmon with the Josephson junctions connecting superconductors that have unequal energy gaps. The gap difference substantially affects the transmon characteristics. We investigate their dependence on the density and effective temperature of the quasiparticles, and on the nominal (unperturbed by the quasiparticles) transmon frequency. At temperatures low compared to the qubit frequency, the gap difference can induce an anomalous positive frequency shift, resulting in a non-monotonic temperature dependence of the transmon frequency. The qubit relaxation rate exhibits a resonance when the qubit frequency matches the gap difference; the shape of the resonance is strongly temperature-dependent. We propose to use these effects to access the details of the quasiparticle energy distribution.</description>

      <title>In-plane and interlayer magnetoresistance in FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report measurements of the in-plane and interlayer magnetoresistance on FeSe. The in-plane magnetoresistance $\Delta \rho_{ab}/\rho_{ab}(0)$ for $B \parallel c$ is positive below $T_s$ and grows with decreasing temperature, exceeding 2.5 at $T$ = 10 K and $B$ = 14 T. The field-direction dependence indicates that the in-plane magnetoresistance is basically determined by the $c$-axis component of the magnetic field. The interlayer magnetoresistance $\Delta \rho_{c}/\rho_{c}(0)$ is negative below $T_s$ but turns positive below $\sim$18 K, which is probably due to the contamination of the large in-plane magnetoresistance. The field-direction dependence of the interlayer magnetoresistance can approximately be described by a standard formula for quasi-two-dimensional electron systems except near $B \parallel ab$. The experimental magnetoresistance near $B \parallel ab$ is larger than the formula, which can be attributed to the so-called interlayer coherence peak. The large width of the peak indicates the correspondingly large interlayer transfer energy.</description>

      <title>Superconducting coherence boosted by outer-layer metallic screening in multilayered cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multilayered high-Tc cuprates with three or more CuO2 layers per unit cell, the inner CuO2 planes (IPs) are spatially separated from the dopant layers and thus remain cleaner than the outer planes (OPs). While both interlayer coupling and the presence of clean IPs have been proposed as key factors enhancing superconductivity, their individual roles have been difficult to disentangle, as IPs and OPs typically become superconducting simultaneously. Here we investigate five-layer (Cu,C)Ba2Ca4Cu5Oy (Cu1245) with Tc = 78 K and three-layer Ba2Ca2Cu3O6(F,O)2 (F0223) with Tc = 100 K using ARPES, and uncover an unprecedented situation, in which only the IPs become superconducting while the OPs remain metallic at low temperatures. Model calculations indicate that more than 95% of the OP wavefunction remains confined to OP itself, with minimal hybridization from the superconducting IPs. In particular, we experimentally realize an ideal configuration: a single superconducting CuO2 layer sandwiched between heavily overdoped metallic outer layers, which screen disorder originating from the dopant layers. Strikingly, this clean CuO2 layer exhibits the largest superconducting gap among all known cuprates and coherent Bogoliubov peaks extending beyond the antiferromagnetic zone boundary -- long regarded as the boundary beyond which coherence vanishes in heavily underdoped cuprates. Furthermore, a widely extended coherent flat band emerges at the Brillouin zone edge, overcoming the pseudogap damping effect. Our results introduce a new physical parameter, the degree of screening, to investigate the competition between superconductivity and the pseudogap, potentially shedding new light on its origin. The nearly disorder-free superconducting CuO2 layers offer a model platform for bridging the gap between disordered real materials and idealized theoretical models, which generally neglect disorder effects.</description>

      <title>AC/DC spin current in ferromagnet/superconductor/normal metal trilayer systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin pumping with superconductors has been extensively studied, particularly in double-layer systems. In this study, we investigate spin pumping in a trilayer system comprising a ferromagnetic insulator (FMI), a superconductor (SC), and a normal metal (NM). We derive the AC and DC spin currents in the NM layer induced by spin motion in the FMI under circularly polarized microwave irradiation. If we treat the spin motion as classical, the AC spin current is expressed. On the other hand, if we treat the spin motion as quantum quasiparticles, the DC spin current is derived. After these derivations, while the computational cost of evaluating the spin current is extremely high, we mitigate this using the Quantics Tensor Cross Interpolation (QTCI) method. We present numerical results showing the dependence of the spin current on temperature, microwave frequency, and superconductor layer thickness. Notably, the temperature dependence of AC and DC spin currents exhibits a coherence peak. Furthermore, we have discovered a transition structure in the dependence of the spin current on the thickness of the superconductor layer, where the dependence changes after a particular frequency.</description>

      <title>Sextets in four-terminal Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiterminal superconducting junctions have revitalized the investigation of the Josephson effect. One of the most interesting aspects of these hybrid systems is the occurrence of multi-Cooper pair tunneling processes that have no analog in two-terminal devices. Such correlated tunneling events are also intimately connected to the Andreev bound states (ABSs) supported by these structures. Josephson junctions with four superconducting terminals have attracted special attention because they are predicted to support ABSs with nontrivial topological properties. Here, we present a theoretical study of sextets, which are correlated tunneling processes involving three Cooper pairs and four different superconducting terminals. We investigate how sextets can be identified from the analysis of the current-phase relation, we show how sextets are connected to the hybridization of ABSs, and we discuss their existence in recent experiments on four-terminal devices realized in hybrid Al/InAs heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Unveiling In-Gap States and Majorana Zero Modes in Superconductor-Topological Insulator Bilayer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfaces between topological insulators and superconductors are promising platforms for realizing Majorana zero modes (MZMs) via the superconducting proximity effect. We introduce a bilayer model consisting of the surface states of a three-dimensional topological insulator (3DTI) coupled to an $s$-wave superconductor and systematically study the role of interlayer tunneling strength ($t_\perp$). We find that increasing $t_\perp$ shifts the proximity-induced (PrI) gap minima away from the $\Gamma$-point, giving rise to momentum-selective interference patterns that manifest as spatial oscillations in the in-gap states. By introducing an antidot with a magnetic vortex in the SC layer, we investigate the nature of in-gap states including MZMs and Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) modes. With increasing hybridization strength, the energy separation between MZMs and CdGM states increases, enhancing the isolation of MZMs. Importantly, in the strong hybridization limit, the leading CdGM separation remains large inspite of the decrease in the PrI gap. Spin- and spatial-resolved wavefunction analysis reveals angular momentum asymmetries absent in conventional $s$-wave systems. A direct comparison with a standalone $s$-wave superconductor confirms the emergence of distinct $p$-wave-like features in the bilayer geometry. Our results provide experimentally relevant predictions for tuning the stability of MZMs and their differentiation from the CdGM modes in SC-3DTI heterostructures and offer a theoretical framework for probing unconventional superconductivity in engineered topological systems.</description>

      <title>Spin-Polaron Mediated Superconductivity in Doped Chern Antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of interacting topological bands with a tunable bandwidth offers a unique platform to study the interplay of intertwined orders and emergent non-electronic excitations. Here we design a time-reversal symmetric and sign-problem-free electronic model with tunable Chern bands carrying valley-contrasting Chern number, interacting via competing (anti-)ferromagnetic interactions. Using numerically exact quantum Monte-Carlo computations, we analyze the many-body phase-diagram as a function of temperature and band filling fractions over a wide range of electronic bandwidth, interaction anisotropy, and an Ising spin-orbit coupling. At a commensurate filling of the Chern bands, the ground state hosts intra-valley ferromagnetic coherence and inter-valley antiferomagnetism, thus realizing an insulating Chern antiferromagnet (CAF). Upon doping, the ground-state develops superconductivity, but where the low-energy charged quasiparticles are composite objects -- electrons dressed by multiple spin-flip excitations. These spin-polaron (or skyrmion) excitations persist in the presence of a weak spin-orbit coupling. In a companion article, we address the emergent symmetries and low-energy field-theoretic aspects of the problem and reveal the proximity to a deconfined quantum critical point. We end by providing a general outlook towards building microscopic connections with models of interacting moir\'e materials, including twisted bilayer graphene, where many of the ingredients considered here are naturally present.</description>

      <title>Discovery of spontaneous mesoscopic strain waves in nematic domains using dark-field X-ray microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic nematic order is a correlated phase of matter in which low-energy electronic states spontaneously break a discrete rotational symmetry of a crystal lattice. Bilinear coupling between the electronic nematic and strains of the same symmetry yields a single pseudoproper ferroelastic phase transition at which both the nematic and lattice strain onset concurrently. To minimize elastic energy, the crystal forms structural twin domains, each with a distinct orientation of the nematic director (i.e. each with a specific sign of the induced shear strain). While the effects of externally induced strains on these domains are well established, the intrinsic behavior of spontaneous strain fields within individual domains has been hitherto unexplored, largely due to the lack of appropriate experimental tools. Here, we report the discovery of spontaneous mesoscopic strain waves within individual nematic domains of an underdoped iron-based superconductor, observed using dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM). This technique combines high spatial and reciprocal-space resolution with full-field, bulk-sensitive imaging, enabling direct visualization of subdomain strain modulations emerging concurrently with the onset of nematic order. The elastic compatibility relations that govern inhomogeneous strains in continuous solids provide a natural mechanism for the emergent strain waves that we observe. Our findings reveal a broadly relevant form of strain self-organization and position DFXM as a powerful tool for probing the local interplay between lattice strain and electronic order.</description>

      <title>Compatible Instability: Gauge Constraints of Elasticity Inherited by Electronic Nematic Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic nematicity is widely observed in quantum materials with varying degrees of electronic correlation, manifesting through charge, spin, orbital, or superconducting degrees of freedom. A phenomenological model capable of describing this broad set of systems must also account for nemato-elasticity, by which nematic and elastic degrees of freedom become intertwined. However, being a tensor gauge field theory, elasticity must satisfy the compatibility relations which guarantee the integrability of lattice deformations. Here, we develop a formalism for nemato-elasticity that manifestly respects the elastic compatibility relations. We show that these constraints bifurcate the phase space of nematic fluctuations into two orthogonal sectors: one compatible and thus critical, the other incompatible and therefore gapped. The suppression of the latter leads to universal direction-selective nematic criticality in any crystal lattice. Moreover, the critical nematic modes are protected from pinning effects induced by microscopic defect strains, which necessarily induce both longitudinal and transverse correlated random fields. Finally, our results also reconcile seemingly contradictory nematic phenomena, such as the mean-field character of the nematic transition and the widespread presence of domain formation.</description>

      <title>Theory of Electronic Nematic Criticality Constrained by Elastic Compatibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The defining property of electronic nematicity -- the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry -- implies an unavoidable coupling between the nematic order parameter and elastic strain fields, known as nemato-elasticity. While both quantities are rank-2 tensors, the strain tensor is constrained through the Saint Venant compatibility relations. These three coupled second-order partial differential equations arise from the lattice displacement vector's role as a potential field, and they reflect the underlying gauge invariance of geometric deformations which are violated only in the presence of crystalline defects. In this work, we develop a theory of nemato-elasticity that incorporates elastic compatibility explicitly through a co-rotating helical basis. With our formalism, we show elasticity bestows tensor compatibility upon the nematic order parameter by suppressing incompatible nematic fluctuations. As a result, nemato-elasticity is markedly different from bare nematicity. In ideal media devoid of defects, we show the suppression of incompatible nematicity underlies direction-selective criticality, even in the absence of crystalline anisotropy. In systems with defects, meanwhile, we show that elastic pinning fields emanate from quenched defects, generating random longitudinal and transverse conjugate fields for the local nematic order parameter. The coexistence of direction-selective nematic criticality with pinning effects from random fields is explained within our theory from the transformation to the helical basis, implying that local experimental probes of nematicity will be influenced by a linear -- but nonlocal -- combination of long-ranged and short-ranged helical nematic modes. Because the compatibility relations are gauge constraints endowed in the isotropic medium, our results constitute universal features of nemato-elastic criticality present in all crystalline systems.</description>

      <title>Projected branes as platforms for crystalline, superconducting, and higher-order topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Projected branes are constituted by only a small subset of sites of a higher-dimensional crystal, otherwise placed on a hyperplane oriented at an irrational or a rational slope therein, for which the effective Hamiltonian is constructed by systematically integrating out the sites of the parent lattice that fall outside such branes [Commun. Phys. 5, 230 (2022)]. Specifically, when such a brane is constructed from a square lattice, it gives rise to an aperiodic Fibonacci quasi-crystal or its rational approximant in one dimension. In this work, starting from square lattice-based models for topological crystalline insulators, protected by the discrete four-fold rotational ($C_4$) symmetry, we show that the resulting one-dimensional projected topological branes encode all the salient signatures of such phases in terms of robust endpoint zero-energy modes, quantized local topological markers, and mid-gap modes bound to dislocation lattice defects, despite such linear branes being devoid of the $C_4$ symmetry of the original lattice. Furthermore, we show that such branes can also feature all the hallmarks of two-dimensional strong and weak topological superconductors through Majorana zero-energy bound states residing near their endpoints and at the core of dislocation lattice defects, besides possessing suitable quantized local topological markers. Finally, we showcase a successful incarnation of a square lattice-based second-order topological insulator with the characteristic corner-localized zero modes in its geometric descendant one-dimensional quasi-crystalline or crystalline branes that feature a quantized localizer index and endpoint zero-energy modes only when one of its end points passes through a corner of the parent crystal. Possible designer quantum and meta material-based platforms to experimentally harness our theoretically proposed topological branes are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically predict the in-plane magnetic field-induced orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting states in twisted WSe$_2$ homobilayers (tWSe$_2$), focusing on its dependence on layer polarization and Fermi surface geometry. For unpolarized layers, finite-momentum pairing emerges only at low temperatures and above a critical field $B_{c1,\parallel}$. When layer symmetry is broken, finite-momentum pairing is stabilized at any nonzero field, with a critical temperature higher than that of the zero-momentum state. Notably, we identify a phase transition, which separates two distinct FFLO phases, when there are two separate Fermi pockets residing in the two moir\'e mini-valleys associated with opposite layers. We further discuss the effects of twist angles and applied field directions. Our findings establish tWSe$_2$ as a promising platform for realizing and manipulating FFLO states via twist angle, displacement field, and filling factor.</description>

Abstract: The thermal Hall conductivity of the trilayer cuprate HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Hg1223) - the superconductor with the highest critical temperature $T_c$ at ambient pressure - was measured at temperatures down to 2 K for three dopings in the underdoped regime ($p$ = 0.09, 0.10, 0.11). By combining a previously introduced simple model and prior theoretical results, we derive a formula for the inverse mean free path, $1 / \ell$, which allows us to estimate the mean free path of $d$-wave quasiparticles in Hg1223 below $T_c$. We find that $1 / \ell$ grows as $T^3$, in agreement with the theoretical expectation for a clean $d$-wave superconductor. Measurements were also conducted on the single layer mercury-based cuprate HgBa$_2$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ (Hg1201), revealing that the mean free path in this compound is roughly half that of its three-layered counterpart at the same doping ($p$ = 0.10). This observation can be attributed to the protective role of the outer planes in Hg1223, which results in a more pristine inner plane. We also report data in an ultraclean crystal of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ (YBCO) with full oxygen content $p$ = 0.18, believed to be the cleanest of any cuprate, and find that $\ell$ is not longer than in Hg1223.</description>

      <title>Multi-Gap superconductivity in HgS under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mercury chalcogenides is a class of materials that exhibit diverse structural phases under pressure, hosting exotic physical properties, including topological phases and chiral phonons. In particular, recent experimental results on HgS reports a new superconducting phase at 21 GPa, whose origin is unknown. In this letter we theoretically investigate the pressure-induced structural phase transition in HgS and the emergence of superconductivity in the rock salt phase. Remarkably, we discover that the rock salt phase hosts a two-gap superconducting phase originating from distinct Fermi surfaces. The unusually high critical temperature of 11 K emerges naturally within this multiband scenario, highlighting the role of interband coupling beyond isotropic approximation. These results place HgS among the few systems where multiband superconductivity is observed.</description>
