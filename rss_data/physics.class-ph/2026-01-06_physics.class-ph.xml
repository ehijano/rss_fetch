      <title>Electrostatics of a finite-thickness conducting cylindrical shell: coupled elliptic-kernel integral equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an exact electrostatic formulation for a finite-length conducting cylindrical shell of finite thickness separating two dielectric media with arbitrary permittivity contrast. The boundary-value problem is reduced to a coupled system of singular integral equations with elliptic kernels governing the induced surface-charge densities on the inner and outer faces. High-accuracy numerical solutions are combined with a systematic asymptotic analysis that elucidates the interplay between geometry, thickness, and dielectric contrast. All classical limiting regimes are recovered, including the slender-body limit, the short-cylinder (ring-like) asymptote, and the thick-shell regime dominated by the outer surface. We demonstrate that the logarithmic short-cylinder behavior of zero-thickness models is a singular feature, which is regularized for any finite thickness, giving rise instead to a finite capacitance plateau. The asymptotic structure of the coupled equations explains both the electrostatic decoupling of the inner cavity in the thick-shell limit and the redistribution of charge between the two surfaces. The results provide exact benchmarks for finite cylindrical conductors, bridging classical analytical treatments and modern numerical approaches, and furnish a high-accuracy reference solution for the validation of axisymmetric electrostatic solvers.</description>

      <title>How localized nonlinear losses condition the acoustical design of a self-sustained oscillator: the clarinet and its register hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The register tube marks the invention of the clarinet in the early eighteenth century, tripling the range of its ancestor, the chalumeau, and giving it the widest range among wind instruments. Opening this narrow tube causes the fundamental frequency of the played note to increase by a factor of three, from the first to the second register of the resonator. The geometry and location of the register hole condition not only this mode selection mechanism, but also the global tuning of the second register. However, existing self-sustained nonlinear models of reed instruments fail to predict whether a register transition can occur, limiting optimization of the register hole geometry. Here, we introduce a sparse self-oscillating clarinet model that includes localized nonlinear acoustic losses in the register hole. This nonlinear mechanism is shown to be necessary to reproduce register transitions observed experimentally. Using systematic exploration of the control and design parameter spaces, we identify combinations of register hole diameter, position, and chimney length that ensure reliable register transitions. We show that the competing demands of playability and tuning are only satisfied by a long and narrow tube. Our findings provide a predictive tool for instrument making, assisting manufacturers in refining clarinets as well as other reed instruments, including oboes, bassoons, and saxophones.</description>

      <title>Ion Clustering Regulated by Extreme Nanoconfinement Enables Mechanosensitive Nanochannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanosensitive ion nanochannels regulate transport by undergoing conformational changes within nanopores. However, achieving precise control over these conformational states remains a major challenge for both artificial soft or solid pores. Here, we propose an alternative mechanism that modulates the charge carrier density inside nanopores, inspired by transistors in solid-state electronics. This strategy leverages a novel phenomenon of confinement-regulated ion clustering in two-dimensional extremely confined nanochannels, revealed by extensive $\mu$s-scale enhanced-sampling molecular simulations based on an \emph{ab initio}-refined force field and nucleation theory. The resulting \emph{force-ion transistor} enables mechanically gated control of ion transport and provides a conceptual foundation for designing ionic mechanical logic gates. Our findings offer new insights into piezochannel mechanosensing and electromechanical coupling in biosystems beyond conformational signaling, opening pathways to integrate artificial ion channels with neuromorphic devices for processing mechanical stimuli.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-based Terahertz Three-dimensional Holography Enabled by Physics-Informed Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence, an emerging, powerful and efficient computational tool, has played a crucial role in the design of optical devices. For the design of holographic metasurfaces, traditional algorithms require multiple iterations between the metasurface and target planes, resulting in excessive computation time. Here, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) is proposed for the fast design of terahertz three-dimensional (3D) holographic metasurfaces. Trained in a self-supervised manner, the PINN eliminates the need for paired input-label datasets. After training, the PINN enables end-to-end mapping between the target holographic patterns and metasurface structures. Both simulation and experimental results of single-plane and 3D multi-plane holography demonstrate that metasurfaces designed by PINN offer higher imaging quality than traditional iterative algorithms. Moreover, the PINN can find approximate solutions of metasurface structures even in physically counterintuitive scenarios, where the holographic patterns of two parallel imaging planes are completely distinct. Furthermore, the inference process of PINN typically takes less than 1 second, much faster than the traditional algorithms requiring iterative computation. Notably, the PINN simultaneously accounts for both phase and amplitude modulation, thereby outperforming traditional phase-only modulation algorithms in handling complex physical scenarios and offering superior imaging quality. This end-to-end design approach has the potential to pave the way for the realization of high-quality, real-time, and large-scale terahertz 3D holographic display technology.</description>

      <title>Broadband quasistatic passive cloaking: bounds and limitations in the near-field regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider here several aspects of the following challenging question: is it possible to use a passive cloak to make invisible a dielectric inclusion on a finite frequency interval in the quasistatic regime of Maxwell's equations for an observer close to the object? In this work, by considering the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map, we not only answer negatively this question, but we go further and provide some quantitative bounds on this map that provide fundamental limits to both cloaking as well as approximate cloaking. These bounds involve the following physical parameters: the length and center of the frequency interval, the volume of the cloaking device, the volume of the obstacle, and the relative permittivity of the object. Our approach is based on two key tools: i) variational principles from the abstract theory of composites and ii) the analytic approach to deriving bounds from sum rules for passive systems. To use i), we prove a new representation theorem for the DtN map which allows us to interpret this map as an effective operator in the abstract theory of composites. One important consequence of this representation is that it allows one to incorporate the broad and deep results from the theory of composites, such as variational principles, and to apply the bounds derived from them to the DtN map. These results could be useful in other contexts other than cloaking. Next, to use ii), we show that the passivity assumption allows us to connect the DtN map (as function of the frequency) with two important classes of analytic functions, namely, Herglotz and Stieltjes functions. The sum rules for these functions, combined with the variational approach, allows us to derive new inequalities on the DtN map which impose fundamental limitations on passive cloaking, both exact and approximate, over a frequency interval. We consider both cases of lossy and lossless cloaks.</description>

      <title>Merry-go-round and time-dependent symplectic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the merry-go-round fictitious forces are acting like centrifugal force and Coriolis force. Like the Lorentz force Coriolis force is velocity dependent and, following Arnold, can be modeled by twisting the symplectic form. If the merry-go-round is accelerated an additional fictitious force shows up, the Euler force.
  In this article we explain how one deals symplectically with the Euler force by considering time-dependent symplectic forms. It will turn out that to treat the Euler force one also needs time-dependent primitives of the time-dependent symplectic forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analytically solve Poisson's equation for the magnetic scalar potential generated by a uniformly magnetized rectangular prism and determine a closed-form solution for the magnetic scalar potential given only in terms of arctan and natural logarithmic functions. We show that the magnetic scalar potential can be written as a demagnetization vector, containing all the geometric information, multiplied with the magnetization, analogous to demagnetization tensors. We validate the derived analytical expression for the magnetic scalar potential by comparing with a finite element simulation and show that these agree perfectly. We finally extend the concept of the demagnetization vector and tensor, which contains the geometric information for the source generating the potential, to gravitational objects.</description>

      <title>Register jumps on the clarinet: numerical and in-vitro investigation into basins of attraction and phase-tipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03875v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When playing the clarinet, opening the register hole allows for a transition from the first to the second register, producing a twelfth interval. On an artificial player system, the blowing pressure range where the second register remains stable can be determined by gradually varying the blowing pressure while keeping the register hole open. However, when the register hole is opened while the instrument is already producing the first register, the range of blowing pressures that lead to a stable second register is narrower than the full stability zone of the second register. This phenomenon is investigated numerically by performing multiple hole openings at different times, for various values of the blowing pressure and the embouchure parameter. In some narrow regions of the control parameters space, the success of a register transition depends on the phase at which the hole is opened. This illustrates an instance of phase-tipping, where the limit cycle of the closed-hole regime may intersect multiple basins of attraction associated with the open-hole regimes. Furthermore, to assess the robustness of the basins of attraction, random noise is introduced to the control parameters before the register hole is opened. Results indicate that the equilibrium regime is more robust to noise than the other oscillating regimes. Finally, long-lasting transient quasiperiodics are investigated. The phase at which the hole is opened influences both the transient duration and the resulting stable regime.</description>

      <title>Momentum-Transfer Framework Unifies High-Velocity Impact and Failure Across Materials, Geometries, and Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials that dissipate energy efficiently under high-speed impacts, from micrometeoroid strikes on spacecraft to ballistic penetration in protective systems, are essential for maintaining structural integrity in extreme environments. Yet, despite decades of study, predicting and comparing impact performance across materials, geometries, and length scales remains challenging because conventional projectile-impact models often rely on conservation-based or empirically partitioned descriptions that assume the projectile-target interaction is a closed system. Here, we relax this assumption and directly observe the momentum and energy transferred out of the projectile during impact. We find that the momentum transferred to the target consistently reaches its maximum at the ballistic-limit velocity, demonstrated through a coordinated suite of micro-projectile impact experiments spanning varied projectile diameters, target thicknesses, and impact velocities, and further supported by targeted macroscale tests. This behavior is reinforced across a broad range of independent studies encompassing metals, polymers, composites, sandwich panels, and reinforced concrete, with thicknesses ranging from nanometers to hundreds of millimeters and projectiles of spherical, blunt, ogive, and conical shape, under both normal and oblique impacts. Together, these observations reveal a consistent impact behavior across all available data: maximum momentum transfer occurs at the ballistic limit. Extending this bound into the energy absorption landscape addresses an entrenched misconception in the field by revealing that specific energy absorption inherently inflates the performance of thinner targets due to geometric normalization, rather than reflecting genuine material enhancement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09355v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate and study a generalized virial theorem for contact Hamiltonian systems. Such systems describe mechanical systems in the presence of simple dissipative forces such as Rayleigh friction, or the vertical motion of a particle falling through a fluid (quadratic drag) under the action of constant gravity. We find a generalized virial theorem for contact Hamiltonian systems which is distinct from that obtained earlier for the symplectic case. The `contact' generalized virial theorem is shown to reduce to the earlier result on symplectic manifolds as a special case. Various examples of dissipative mechanical systems are discussed. We also formulate a generalized virial theorem in the contact Lagrangian framework.</description>

      <title>Invariant measures for some dissipative systems from the Jacobi last multiplier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian dynamics describing conservative systems naturally preserves the standard notion of phase-space volume, a result known as the Liouville's theorem which is central to the formulation of classical statistical mechanics. In this paper, we obtain explicit expressions for invariant phase-space measures for certain (generally dissipative) mechanical systems, namely, systems described by conformal vector fields on symplectic manifolds that are cotangent bundles, contact Hamiltonian systems, and systems of the Li\'enard class. The latter class of systems can be described by certain generalized conformal vector fields on the cotangent bundle of the configuration space. The computation of the invariant measures is achieved by making use of the formalism of Jacobi last multipliers.</description>
