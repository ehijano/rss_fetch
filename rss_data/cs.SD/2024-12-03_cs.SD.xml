      <title>Raw Audio Classification with Cosine Convolutional Neural Network (CosCovNN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the field of audio classification from raw waveform using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a method that eliminates the need for extracting specialised features in the pre-processing step. Unlike recent trends in literature, which often focuses on designing frontends or filters for only the initial layers of CNNs, our research introduces the Cosine Convolutional Neural Network (CosCovNN) replacing the traditional CNN filters with Cosine filters. The CosCovNN surpasses the accuracy of the equivalent CNN architectures with approximately $77\%$ less parameters. Our research further progresses with the development of an augmented CosCovNN named Vector Quantised Cosine Convolutional Neural Network with Memory (VQCCM), incorporating a memory and vector quantisation layer VQCCM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across five different datasets in comparison with existing literature. Our findings show that cosine filters can greatly improve the efficiency and accuracy of CNNs in raw audio classification.</description>

      <title>Improving speaker verification robustness with synthetic emotional utterances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A speaker verification (SV) system offers an authentication service designed to confirm whether a given speech sample originates from a specific speaker. This technology has paved the way for various personalized applications that cater to individual preferences. A noteworthy challenge faced by SV systems is their ability to perform consistently across a range of emotional spectra. Most existing models exhibit high error rates when dealing with emotional utterances compared to neutral ones. Consequently, this phenomenon often leads to missing out on speech of interest. This issue primarily stems from the limited availability of labeled emotional speech data, impeding the development of robust speaker representations that encompass diverse emotional states.
  To address this concern, we propose a novel approach employing the CycleGAN framework to serve as a data augmentation method. This technique synthesizes emotional speech segments for each specific speaker while preserving the unique vocal identity. Our experimental findings underscore the effectiveness of incorporating synthetic emotional data into the training process. The models trained using this augmented dataset consistently outperform the baseline models on the task of verifying speakers in emotional speech scenarios, reducing equal error rate by as much as 3.64% relative.</description>

      <title>MusicGen-Chord: Advancing Music Generation through Chord Progressions and Interactive Web-UI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MusicGen is a music generation language model (LM) that can be conditioned on textual descriptions and melodic features. We introduce MusicGen-Chord, which extends this capability by incorporating chord progression features. This model modifies one-hot encoded melody chroma vectors into multi-hot encoded chord chroma vectors, enabling the generation of music that reflects both chord progressions and textual descriptions. Furthermore, we developed MusicGen-Remixer, an application utilizing MusicGen-Chord to generate remixes of input music conditioned on textual descriptions. Both models are integrated into Replicate's web-UI using cog, facilitating broad accessibility and user-friendly controllable interaction for creating and experiencing AI-generated music.</description>

      <title>Sample adaptive data augmentation with progressive scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data augmentation is a widely adopted technique utilized to improve the robustness of automatic speech recognition (ASR). Employing a fixed data augmentation strategy for all training data is a common practice. However, it is important to note that there can be variations in factors such as background noise, speech rate, etc. among different samples within a single training batch. By using a fixed augmentation strategy, there is a risk that the model may reach a suboptimal state. In addition to the risks of employing a fixed augmentation strategy, the model's capabilities may differ across various training stages. To address these issues, this paper proposes the method of sample-adaptive data augmentation with progressive scheduling(PS-SapAug). The proposed method applies dynamic data augmentation in a two-stage training approach. It employs hybrid normalization to compute sample-specific augmentation parameters based on each sample's loss. Additionally, the probability of augmentation gradually increases throughout the training progression. Our method is evaluated on popular ASR benchmark datasets, including Aishell-1 and Librispeech-100h, achieving up to 8.13% WER reduction on LibriSpeech-100h test-clean, 6.23% on test-other, and 5.26% on AISHELL-1 test set, which demonstrate the efficacy of our approach enhancing performance and minimizing errors.</description>

      <title>Personal Sound Zones and Shielded Localized Communication through Active Acoustic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a time domain extension of our strategy on manipulating radiated scalar Helmholtz fields and discuss two important applied scenarios, namely (1) creating personal sound zones inside a bounded domain and (2) shielded localized communication. Our strategy is based on the authors' previous works establishing the possibility and stability of controlling acoustic fields using an array of almost non-radiating coupling sources and presents a detailed Fourier synthesis approach towards a time-domain effect. We require that the array of acoustic sources creates the desired fields on the control regions while maintaining a zero field beyond a larger circumscribed sphere. This paper recalls the main theoretical results then presents the underlying Fourier synthesis paradigm and show, through relevant simulations, the performance of our strategy.</description>

      <title>From Audio Deepfake Detection to AI-Generated Music Detection -- A Pathway and Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies continue to evolve, their use in generating realistic, contextually appropriate content has expanded into various domains. Music, an art form and medium for entertainment, deeply rooted into human culture, is seeing an increased involvement of AI into its production. However, the unregulated use of AI music generation (AIGM) tools raises concerns about potential negative impacts on the music industry, copyright and artistic integrity, underscoring the importance of effective AIGM detection. This paper provides an overview of existing AIGM detection methods. To lay a foundation to the general workings and challenges of AIGM detection, we first review general principles of AIGM, including recent advancements in deepfake audios, as well as multimodal detection techniques. We further propose a potential pathway for leveraging foundation models from audio deepfake detection to AIGM detection. Additionally, we discuss implications of these tools and propose directions for future research to address ongoing challenges in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Audio Atlas, an interactive web application for visualizing audio data using text-audio embeddings. Audio Atlas is designed to facilitate the exploration and analysis of audio datasets using a contrastive embedding model and a vector database for efficient data management and semantic search. The system maps audio embeddings into a two-dimensional space and leverages DeepScatter for dynamic visualization. Designed for extensibility, Audio Atlas allows easy integration of new datasets, enabling users to better understand their audio data and identify both patterns and outliers. We open-source the codebase of Audio Atlas, and provide an initial implementation containing various audio and music datasets.</description>

      <title>Complexity boosted adaptive training for better low resource ASR performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the entire training process of the ASR model, the intensity of data augmentation and the approach of calculating training loss are applied in a regulated manner based on preset parameters. For example, SpecAugment employs a predefined strength of augmentation to mask parts of the time-frequency domain spectrum. Similarly, in CTC-based multi-layer models, the loss is generally determined based on the output of the encoder's final layer during the training process. However, ignoring dynamic characteristics may suboptimally train models. To address the issue, we present a two-stage training method, known as complexity-boosted adaptive (CBA) training. It involves making dynamic adjustments to data augmentation strategies and CTC loss propagation based on the complexity of the training samples. In the first stage, we train the model with intermediate-CTC-based regularization and data augmentation without any adaptive policy. In the second stage, we propose a novel adaptive policy, called MinMax-IBF, which calculates the complexity of samples. We combine the MinMax-IBF policy to data augmentation and intermediate CTC loss regularization to continue training. The proposed CBA training approach shows considerable improvements, up to 13.4% and 14.1% relative reduction in WER on the LibriSpeech 100h test-clean and test-other dataset and also up to 6.3% relative reduction on AISHELL-1 test set, over the Conformer architecture in Wenet.</description>

      <title>FreeCodec: A disentangled neural speech codec with fewer tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural speech codecs have gained great attention for their outstanding reconstruction with discrete token representations.
  It is a crucial component in generative tasks such as speech coding and large language models (LLM).
  However, most works based on residual vector quantization perform worse with fewer tokens due to low coding efficiency for modeling complex coupled information.
  In this paper, we propose a neural speech codec named FreeCodec which employs a more effective encoding framework by decomposing intrinsic properties of speech into different components:
  1) a global vector is extracted as the timbre information,
  2) a prosody encoder with a long stride level is used to model the prosody information,
  3) the content information is from a content encoder.
  Using different training strategies, FreeCodec achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction and disentanglement scenarios.
  Results from subjective and objective experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods.</description>

      <title>The Codec Language Model-based Zero-Shot Spontaneous Style TTS System for CoVoC Challenge 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the zero-shot spontaneous style TTS system for the ISCSLP 2024 Conversational Voice Clone Challenge (CoVoC). We propose a LLaMA-based codec language model with a delay pattern to achieve spontaneous style voice cloning. To improve speech intelligibility, we introduce the Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) strategy in the language model to strengthen conditional guidance on token prediction. To generate high-quality utterances, we adopt effective data preprocessing operations and fine-tune our model with selected high-quality spontaneous speech data. The official evaluations in the CoVoC constrained track show that our system achieves the best speech naturalness MOS of 3.80 and obtains considerable speech quality and speaker similarity results.</description>

      <title>Reject Threshold Adaptation for Open-Set Model Attribution of Deepfake Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open environment oriented open set model attribution of deepfake audio is an emerging research topic, aiming to identify the generation models of deepfake audio. Most previous work requires manually setting a rejection threshold for unknown classes to compare with predicted probabilities. However, models often overfit training instances and generate overly confident predictions. Moreover, thresholds that effectively distinguish unknown categories in the current dataset may not be suitable for identifying known and unknown categories in another data distribution. To address the issues, we propose a novel framework for open set model attribution of deepfake audio with rejection threshold adaptation (ReTA). Specifically, the reconstruction error learning module trains by combining the representation of system fingerprints with labels corresponding to either the target class or a randomly chosen other class label. This process generates matching and non-matching reconstructed samples, establishing the reconstruction error distributions for each class and laying the foundation for the reject threshold calculation module. The reject threshold calculation module utilizes gaussian probability estimation to fit the distributions of matching and non-matching reconstruction errors. It then computes adaptive reject thresholds for all classes through probability minimization criteria. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ReTA in improving the open set model attributes of deepfake audio.</description>

      <title>Generative AI-based data augmentation for improved bioacoustic classification in noisy environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 1. Obtaining data to train robust artificial intelligence (AI)-based models for species classification can be challenging, particularly for rare species. Data augmentation can boost classification accuracy by increasing the diversity of training data and is cheaper to obtain than expert-labelled data. However, many classic image-based augmentation techniques are not suitable for audio spectrograms. 2. We investigate two generative AI models as data augmentation tools to synthesise spectrograms and supplement audio data: Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks (ACGAN) and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). The latter performed particularly well in terms of both realism of generated spectrograms and accuracy in a resulting classification task. 3. Alongside these new approaches, we present a new audio data set of 640 hours of bird calls from wind farm sites in Ireland, approximately 800 samples of which have been labelled by experts. Wind farm data are particularly challenging for classification models given the background wind and turbine noise. 4. Training an ensemble of classification models on real and synthetic data combined gave 92.6% accuracy (and 90.5% with just the real data) when compared with highly confident BirdNET predictions. 5. Our approach can be used to augment acoustic signals for more species and other land-use types, and has the potential to bring about a step-change in our capacity to develop reliable AI-based detection of rare species. Our code is available at https://github.com/gibbona1/ SpectrogramGenAI.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Recent Advances and Challenges in Deep Audio-Visual Correlation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-visual correlation learning aims to capture and understand natural phenomena between audio and visual data. The rapid growth of Deep Learning propelled the development of proposals that process audio-visual data and can be observed in the number of proposals in the past years. Thus encouraging the development of a comprehensive survey. Besides analyzing the models used in this context, we also discuss some tasks of definition and paradigm applied in AI multimedia. In addition, we investigate objective functions frequently used and discuss how audio-visual data is exploited in the optimization process, i.e., the different methodologies for representing knowledge in the audio-visual domain. In fact, we focus on how human-understandable mechanisms, i.e., structured knowledge that reflects comprehensible knowledge, can guide the learning process. Most importantly, we provide a summarization of the recent progress of Audio-Visual Correlation Learning (AVCL) and discuss the future research directions.</description>

      <title>High-precision medical speech recognition through synthetic data and semantic correction: UNITED-MEDASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems in the clinical domain face significant challenges, notably the need to recognise specialised medical vocabulary accurately and meet stringent precision requirements. We introduce United-MedASR, a novel architecture that addresses these challenges by integrating synthetic data generation, precision ASR fine-tuning, and advanced semantic enhancement techniques. United-MedASR constructs a specialised medical vocabulary by synthesising data from authoritative sources such as ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision), MIMS (Monthly Index of Medical Specialties), and FDA databases. This enriched vocabulary helps finetune the Whisper ASR model to better cater to clinical needs. To enhance processing speed, we incorporate Faster Whisper, ensuring streamlined and high-speed ASR performance. Additionally, we employ a customised BART-based semantic enhancer to handle intricate medical terminology, thereby increasing accuracy efficiently. Our layered approach establishes new benchmarks in ASR performance, achieving a Word Error Rate (WER) of 0.985% on LibriSpeech test-clean, 0.26% on Europarl-ASR EN Guest-test, and demonstrating robust performance on Tedlium (0.29% WER) and FLEURS (0.336% WER). Furthermore, we present an adaptable architecture that can be replicated across different domains, making it a versatile solution for domain-specific ASR systems.</description>

Abstract: Ensuring accurate call prioritisation is essential for optimising the efficiency and responsiveness of mental health helplines. Currently, call operators rely entirely on the caller's statements to determine the priority of the calls. It has been shown that entirely subjective assessment can lead to errors. Furthermore, it is a missed opportunity not to utilise the voice properties readily available during the call to aid in the evaluation. Incorrect prioritisation can result in delayed assistance for high-risk individuals, resource misallocation, increased mental health deterioration, loss of trust, and potential legal consequences. It is vital to address these risks to guarantee the reliability and effectiveness of mental health services. This study delves into the potential of using machine learning, a branch of Artificial Intelligence, to estimate call priority from the callers' voices for users of mental health phone helplines. After analysing 459 call records from a mental health helpline, we achieved a balanced accuracy of 92\%, showing promise in aiding the call operators' efficiency in call handling processes and improving customer satisfaction.</description>

      <title>Circumventing shortcuts in audio-visual deepfake detection datasets with unsupervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Good datasets are essential for developing and benchmarking any machine learning system. Their importance is even more extreme for safety critical applications such as deepfake detection - the focus of this paper. Here we reveal that two of the most widely used audio-video deepfake datasets suffer from a previously unidentified spurious feature: the leading silence. Fake videos start with a very brief moment of silence and based on this feature alone, we can separate the real and fake samples almost perfectly. As such, previous audio-only and audio-video models exploit the presence of silence in the fake videos and consequently perform worse when the leading silence is removed. To circumvent latching on such unwanted artifact and possibly other unrevealed ones we propose a shift from supervised to unsupervised learning by training models exclusively on real data. We show that by aligning self-supervised audio-video representations we remove the risk of relying on dataset-specific biases and improve robustness in deepfake detection.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of LLM-based ASR and Whisper in Low Resource and Code Switching Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased exceptional performance across diverse NLP tasks, and their integration with speech encoder is rapidly emerging as a dominant trend in the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) field. Previous works mainly concentrated on leveraging LLMs for speech recognition in English and Chinese. However, their potential for addressing speech recognition challenges in low resource settings remains underexplored. Hence, in this work, we aim to explore the capability of LLMs in low resource ASR and Mandarin-English code switching ASR. We also evaluate and compare the recognition performance of LLM-based ASR systems against Whisper model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLM-based ASR yields a relative gain of 12.8\% over the Whisper model in low resource ASR while Whisper performs better in Mandarin-English code switching ASR. We hope that this study could shed light on ASR for low resource scenarios.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Approach for Identification and Compensation of Nonlinear Distortions in Parametric Array Loudspeakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compared to traditional electrodynamic loudspeakers, the parametric array loudspeaker (PAL) offers exceptional directivity for audio applications but suffers from significant nonlinear distortions due to its inherent intricate demodulation process. The Volterra filter-based approaches have been widely used to reduce these distortions, but the effectiveness is limited by its inverse filter's capability. Specifically, its pth-order inverse filter can only compensate for nonlinearities up to the pth order, while the higher-order nonlinearities it introduces continue to generate lower-order harmonics. In contrast, this paper introduces the modern deep learning methods for the first time to address nonlinear identification and compensation for PAL systems. Specifically, a feedforward variant of the WaveNet neural network, recognized for its success in audio nonlinear system modeling, is utilized to identify and compensate for distortions in a double sideband amplitude modulation-based PAL system. Experimental measurements from 250 Hz to 8 kHz demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly reduces both total harmonic distortion and intermodulation distortion of audio sound generated by PALs, achieving average reductions to 4.55% and 2.47%, respectively. This performance is notably superior to results obtained using the current state-of-the-art Volterra filter-based methods. Our work opens new possibilities for improving the sound reproduction performance of PALs.</description>

      <title>OmniFlow: Any-to-Any Generation with Multi-Modal Rectified Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce OmniFlow, a novel generative model designed for any-to-any generation tasks such as text-to-image, text-to-audio, and audio-to-image synthesis. OmniFlow advances the rectified flow (RF) framework used in text-to-image models to handle the joint distribution of multiple modalities. It outperforms previous any-to-any models on a wide range of tasks, such as text-to-image and text-to-audio synthesis. Our work offers three key contributions: First, we extend RF to a multi-modal setting and introduce a novel guidance mechanism, enabling users to flexibly control the alignment between different modalities in the generated outputs. Second, we propose a novel architecture that extends the text-to-image MMDiT architecture of Stable Diffusion 3 and enables audio and text generation. The extended modules can be efficiently pretrained individually and merged with the vanilla text-to-image MMDiT for fine-tuning. Lastly, we conduct a comprehensive study on the design choices of rectified flow transformers for large-scale audio and text generation, providing valuable insights into optimizing performance across diverse modalities. The Code will be available at https://github.com/jacklishufan/OmniFlows.</description>

      <title>Memory-Efficient Training for Deep Speaker Embedding Learning in Speaker Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent speaker verification (SV) systems have shown a trend toward adopting deeper speaker embedding extractors. Although deeper and larger neural networks can significantly improve performance, their substantial memory requirements hinder training on consumer GPUs. In this paper, we explore a memory-efficient training strategy for deep speaker embedding learning in resource-constrained scenarios. Firstly, we conduct a systematic analysis of GPU memory allocation during SV system training. Empirical observations show that activations and optimizer states are the main sources of memory consumption. For activations, we design two types of reversible neural networks which eliminate the need to store intermediate activations during back-propagation, thereby significantly reducing memory usage without performance loss. For optimizer states, we introduce a dynamic quantization approach that replaces the original 32-bit floating-point values with a dynamic tree-based 8-bit data type. Experimental results on VoxCeleb demonstrate that the reversible variants of ResNets and DF-ResNets can perform training without the need to cache activations in GPU memory. In addition, the 8-bit versions of SGD and Adam save 75% of memory costs while maintaining performance compared to their 32-bit counterparts. Finally, a detailed comparison of memory usage and performance indicates that our proposed models achieve up to 16.2x memory savings, with nearly identical parameters and performance compared to the vanilla systems. In contrast to the previous need for multiple high-end GPUs such as the A100, we can effectively train deep speaker embedding extractors with just one or two consumer-level 2080Ti GPUs.</description>

      <title>Linear stimulus reconstruction works on the KU Leuven audiovisual, gaze-controlled auditory attention decoding dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, we presented the KU Leuven audiovisual, gaze-controlled auditory attention decoding (AV-GC-AAD) dataset, in which we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) signals of participants attending to one out of two competing speakers under various audiovisual conditions. The main goal of this dataset was to disentangle the direction of gaze from the direction of auditory attention, in order to reveal gaze-related shortcuts in existing spatial AAD algorithms that aim to decode the (direction of) auditory attention directly from the EEG. Various methods based on spatial AAD do not achieve significant above-chance performances on our AV-GC-AAD dataset, indicating that previously reported results were mainly driven by eye gaze confounds in existing datasets. Still, these adverse outcomes are often discarded for reasons that are attributed to the limitations of the AV-GC-AAD dataset, such as the limited amount of data to train a working model, too much data heterogeneity due to different audiovisual conditions, or participants allegedly being unable to focus their auditory attention under the complex instructions. In this paper, we present the results of the linear stimulus reconstruction AAD algorithm and show that high AAD accuracy can be obtained within each individual condition and that the model generalizes across conditions, across new subjects, and even across datasets. Therefore, we eliminate any doubts that the inadequacy of the AV-GC-AAD dataset is the primary reason for the (spatial) AAD algorithms failing to achieve above-chance performance when compared to other datasets. Furthermore, this report provides a simple baseline evaluation procedure (including source code) that can serve as the minimal benchmark for all future AAD algorithms evaluated on this dataset.</description>

      <title>SongBsAb: A Dual Prevention Approach against Singing Voice Conversion based Illegal Song Covers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Singing voice conversion (SVC) automates song covers by converting a source singing voice from a source singer into a new singing voice with the same lyrics and melody as the source, but sounds like being covered by the target singer of some given target singing voices. However, it raises serious concerns about copyright and civil right infringements. We propose SongBsAb, the first proactive approach to tackle SVC-based illegal song covers. SongBsAb adds perturbations to singing voices before releasing them, so that when they are used, the process of SVC will be interfered, leading to unexpected singing voices. Perturbations are carefully crafted to (1) provide a dual prevention, i.e., preventing the singing voice from being used as the source and target singing voice in SVC, by proposing a gender-transformation loss and a high/low hierarchy multi-target loss, respectively; and (2) be harmless, i.e., no side-effect on the enjoyment of protected songs, by refining a psychoacoustic model-based loss with the backing track as an additional masker, a unique accompanying element for singing voices compared to ordinary speech voices. We also adopt a frame-level interaction reduction-based loss and encoder ensemble to enhance the transferability of SongBsAb to unknown SVC models. We demonstrate the prevention effectiveness, harmlessness, and robustness of SongBsAb on five diverse and promising SVC models, using both English and Chinese datasets, and both objective and human study-based subjective metrics. Our work fosters an emerging research direction for mitigating illegal automated song covers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in speech generation with text prompt providing control over speech style, voice attributes in synthesized speech remain elusive and challenging to control. This paper introduces a novel task: voice attribute editing with text prompt, with the goal of making relative modifications to voice attributes according to the actions described in the text prompt. To solve this task, VoxEditor, an end-to-end generative model, is proposed. In VoxEditor, addressing the insufficiency of text prompt, a Residual Memory (ResMem) block is designed, that efficiently maps voice attributes and these descriptors into the shared feature space. Additionally, the ResMem block is enhanced with a voice attribute degree prediction (VADP) block to align voice attributes with corresponding descriptors, addressing the imprecision of text prompt caused by non-quantitative descriptions of voice attributes. We also establish the open-source VCTK-RVA dataset, which leads the way in manual annotations detailing voice characteristic differences among different speakers. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed method in terms of both objective and subjective metrics. The dataset and audio samples are available on the website.</description>

      <title>I2TTS: Image-indicated Immersive Text-to-speech Synthesis with Spatial Perception</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling the style and characteristics of speech synthesis is crucial for adapting the output to specific contexts and user requirements. Previous Text-to-speech (TTS) works have focused primarily on the technical aspects of producing natural-sounding speech, such as intonation, rhythm, and clarity. However, they overlook the fact that there is a growing emphasis on spatial perception of synthesized speech, which may provide immersive experience in gaming and virtual reality. To solve this issue, in this paper, we present a novel multi-modal TTS approach, namely Image-indicated Immersive Text-to-speech Synthesis (I2TTS). Specifically, we introduce a scene prompt encoder that integrates visual scene prompts directly into the synthesis pipeline to control the speech generation process. Additionally, we propose a reverberation classification and refinement technique that adjusts the synthesized mel-spectrogram to enhance the immersive experience, ensuring that the involved reverberation condition matches the scene accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves high-quality scene and spatial matching without compromising speech naturalness, marking a significant advancement in the field of context-aware speech synthesis.

      <title>CoDiff-VC: A Codec-Assisted Diffusion Model for Zero-shot Voice Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-shot voice conversion (VC) aims to convert the original speaker's timbre to any target speaker while keeping the linguistic content. Current mainstream zero-shot voice conversion approaches depend on pre-trained recognition models to disentangle linguistic content and speaker representation. This results in a timbre residue within the decoupled linguistic content and inadequacies in speaker representation modeling. In this study, we propose CoDiff-VC, an end-to-end framework for zero-shot voice conversion that integrates a speech codec and a diffusion model to produce high-fidelity waveforms. Our approach involves employing a single-codebook codec to separate linguistic content from the source speech. To enhance content disentanglement, we introduce Mix-Style layer normalization (MSLN) to perturb the original timbre. Additionally, we incorporate a multi-scale speaker timbre modeling approach to ensure timbre consistency and improve voice detail similarity. To improve speech quality and speaker similarity, we introduce dual classifier-free guidance, providing both content and timbre guidance during the generation process. Objective and subjective experiments affirm that CoDiff-VC significantly improves speaker similarity, generating natural and higher-quality speech.</description>

Abstract: Language-queried audio source separation (LASS) is a new paradigm for computational auditory scene analysis (CASA). LASS aims to separate a target sound from an audio mixture given a natural language query, which provides a natural and scalable interface for digital audio applications. Recent works on LASS, despite attaining promising separation performance on specific sources (e.g., musical instruments, limited classes of audio events), are unable to separate audio concepts in the open domain. In this work, we introduce AudioSep, a foundation model for open-domain audio source separation with natural language queries. We train AudioSep on large-scale multimodal datasets and extensively evaluate its capabilities on numerous tasks including audio event separation, musical instrument separation, and speech enhancement. AudioSep demonstrates strong separation performance and impressive zero-shot generalization ability using audio captions or text labels as queries, substantially outperforming previous audio-queried and language-queried sound separation models. For reproducibility of this work, we will release the source code, evaluation benchmark and pre-trained model at: https://github.com/Audio-AGI/AudioSep.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Supervised Hierarchical Graph Clustering for Speaker Diarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speaker diarization, the task of segmenting an audio recording based on speaker identity, constitutes an important speech pre-processing step for several downstream applications.The conventional approach to diarization involves multiple steps of embedding extraction and clustering, which are often optimized in an isolated fashion. While end-to-end diarization systems attempt to learn a single model for the task, they are often cumbersome to train and require large supervised datasets. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end supervised hierarchical clustering algorithm based on graph neural networks (GNN), called End-to-end Supervised HierARchical Clustering (E-SHARC). The embedding extractor is initialized using a pre-trained x-vector model while the GNN model is trained initially using the x-vector embeddings from the pre-trained model. Finally, the E-SHARC model uses the front-end mel-filterbank features as input and jointly optimizes the embedding extractor and the GNN clustering module, performing representation learning, metric learning, and clustering with end-to-end optimization. Further, with additional inputs from an external overlap detector, the E-SHARC approach is capable of predicting the speakers in the overlapping speech regions. The experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets like AMI, Voxconverse and DISPLACE, illustrates that the proposed E-SHARC framework provides competitive diarization results using graph based clustering methods.</description>

      <title>Soundscape Captioning using Sound Affective Quality Network and Large Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We live in a rich and varied acoustic world, which is experienced by individuals or communities as a soundscape. Computational auditory scene analysis, disentangling acoustic scenes by detecting and classifying events, focuses on objective attributes of sounds, such as their category and temporal characteristics, ignoring their effects on people, such as the emotions they evoke within a context. To fill this gap, we propose the soundscape captioning task, which enables automated soundscape analysis, thus avoiding labour-intensive subjective ratings and surveys in conventional methods. With soundscape captioning, context-aware descriptions are generated for soundscape by capturing the acoustic scene, event information, and the corresponding human affective qualities (AQs). To this end, we propose an automatic soundscape captioner (SoundSCaper) system composed of an acoustic model, i.e. SoundAQnet, and a large language model (LLM). SoundAQnet simultaneously models multi-scale information about acoustic scenes, events, and perceived AQs, while the LLM describes the soundscape with captions by parsing the information captured with SoundAQnet. The soundscape caption's quality is assessed by a jury of 16 audio/soundscape experts. The average score (out of 5) of SoundSCaper-generated captions is lower than the score of captions generated by two soundscape experts by 0.21 and 0.25, respectively, on the evaluation set and the model-unknown mixed external dataset with varying lengths and acoustic properties, but the differences are not statistically significant. Overall, the proposed SoundSCaper shows promising performance, with captions generated being comparable to those annotated by soundscape experts. The code of models, LLM scripts, human assessment data and instructions, and expert evaluation statistics are all publicly available.</description>

      <title>TTSDS -- Text-to-Speech Distribution Score</title>

Abstract: Many recently published Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems produce audio close to real speech. However, TTS evaluation needs to be revisited to make sense of the results obtained with the new architectures, approaches and datasets. We propose evaluating the quality of synthetic speech as a combination of multiple factors such as prosody, speaker identity, and intelligibility. Our approach assesses how well synthetic speech mirrors real speech by obtaining correlates of each factor and measuring their distance from both real speech datasets and noise datasets. We benchmark 35 TTS systems developed between 2008 and 2024 and show that our score computed as an unweighted average of factors strongly correlates with the human evaluations from each time period.</description>

      <title>Scaling Speech-Text Pre-training with Synthetic Interleaved Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech language models (SpeechLMs) accept speech input and produce speech output, allowing for more natural human-computer interaction compared to text-based large language models (LLMs). Traditional approaches for developing SpeechLMs are constrained by the limited availability of unsupervised speech data and parallel speech-text data, which are significantly less abundant than text pre-training data, thereby limiting their scalability as LLMs. We propose a novel approach to scaling speech-text pre-training by leveraging large-scale synthetic interleaved data derived from text corpora, eliminating the need for parallel speech-text datasets. Our method efficiently constructs speech-text interleaved data by sampling text spans from existing text corpora and synthesizing corresponding speech spans using a text-to-token model, bypassing the need to generate actual speech. We also employ a supervised speech tokenizer derived from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model by incorporating a vector-quantized bottleneck into the encoder. This supervised training approach results in discrete speech tokens with strong semantic preservation even at lower frame rates (e.g. 12.5Hz), while still maintaining speech reconstruction quality. Starting from a pre-trained language model and scaling our pre-training to 1 trillion tokens (with 600B synthetic interleaved speech-text data), we achieve state-of-the-art performance in speech language modeling and spoken question answering, improving performance on spoken questions tasks from the previous SOTA of 13% (Moshi) to 31%. We further demonstrate that by fine-tuning the pre-trained model with speech dialogue data, we can develop an end-to-end spoken chatbot that achieves competitive performance comparable to existing baselines in both conversational abilities and speech quality, even operating exclusively in the speech domain.</description>
