      <title>GAN-based Generator of Adversarial Attack on Intelligent End-to-End Autoencoder-based Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have been applied in wireless communications system to intelligently adapt to dynamically changing channel conditions, while the users are still under the threat of the malicious attacks due to the broadcasting property of wireless channels. However, most attack models require the knowledge of the target details, which is difficult to be implemented in real systems. Our objective is to develop an attack model with no requirement for the target information, while enhancing the block error rate. In our design, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) based attack architecture, which exploits the property of deep learning models being vulnerable to perturbations induced by dynamically changing channel conditions. In the proposed generator, the attack network is composed of convolution layer, convolution transpose layer and linear layer. Then we present the training strategy and the details of the training algorithm. Subsequently, we propose the validation strategy to evaluate the performance of the generator. Simulations are conducted and the results show that our proposed adversarial attack generator achieve better block error rate attack performance than that of benchmark schemes over Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel, Rayleigh channel and High-Speed Railway channel.</description>

      <title>Sum Rate Maximization for NOMA-Assisted Uplink Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an uplink communication scenario in which multiple users communicate with an access point (AP) employing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). A pinching antenna, which can be activated at an arbitrary point along a dielectric waveguide, is deployed at the AP to dynamically reconfigure user channels. The objective is to maximize the system sum rate by jointly optimizing the pinching-antenna's position and the users' transmit powers. The formulated optimization problem is non-convex, and addressed using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. For performance benchmarking, two time division multiple access (TDMA) schemes are considered: one based on the pinching antenna individually activated for each user, and the other based on the single-pinching-antenna configuration serving all users. Numerical results demonstrate that the use of the pinching antenna significantly enhances the system sum rate compared to conventional antenna architectures. Moreover, the NOMA-based scheme outperforms the TDMA-based scheme with a single pinching antenna but is outperformed by the TDMA-based approach when the pinching antenna is adaptively configured for each user. Finally, the proposed PSO-based method is shown to achieve near-optimal performance for both NOMA and TDMA with a common pinching-antenna configuration.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Consistent Low Complexity Tests for Outlier Hypothesis Testing with Distribution Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the outlier hypothesis testing (OHT) problem of Li et al. (TIT 2024) and propose exponentially consistent tests when there is distribution uncertainty for both nominal samples and outliers. In original OHT, one is given a list of sequences, most of which are generated i.i.d. from a distribution called the nominal distribution while the rest are generated i.i.d. from another distribution named the anomalous distribution. The task of OHT is to identify outliers when both the nominal and anomalous distributions are unknown. Motivated by the study for classification with distribution uncertainty by Hsu and Wang (ISIT 2020), we consider OHT with distribution uncertainty, where each nominal sample is generated from a distribution centered around the unknown nominal distribution and each outlier is generated from a distribution centered around the unknown anomalous distribution. With a further step towards practical applications, in the spirit of Bu et al. (TSP 2019), we propose low-complexity tests when the number of outliers is known and unknown, and show that our proposed tests are exponentially consistent. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there is a penalty for not knowing the number of outliers in the error exponent when outliers exist. Our results strengthen Bu et al. in three aspects: i) our tests allow distribution uncertainty and reveal the impact of distribution uncertainty on the performance of low-complexity tests; ii) when the number of outliers is known and there is no distribution uncertainty, our test achieves the same asymptotic performance with lower complexity; and iii) when the number of outliers is unknown, we characterize the tradeoff among the three error probabilities, while two of these error probabilities were not analyzed by Bu et al. even when there is no distribution uncertainty. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical results using numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Error Exponents for Oblivious Relaying and Connections to Source Coding with a Helper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The information bottleneck channel, also known as oblivious relaying, is a two-hop channel where a transmitter sends messages to a remote receiver via an intermediate relay node. A codeword sent by the transmitter passes through a discrete memoryless channel to reach the relay, and then the relay processes the noisy channel output and forwards it to the receiver through a noiseless rate-limited link. The relay is oblivious, in the sense that it has no knowledge of the channel codebook used in transmission. Past works on oblivious relaying are focused on characterizing achievable rates. In this work, we study error exponents and explore connections to loseless source coding with a helper, also known as the Wyner-Ahlswede-K\"orner (WAK) problem. We first establish an achievable error exponent for oblivious relaying under constant compositions codes. A key feature of our analysis is the use of the type covering lemma to design the relay's compress-forward scheme. We then show that employing constant composition code ensembles does not improve the rates achieved with their IID counterparts. We also derive a sphere packing upper bound for the error exponent. In the second part of this paper, we establish a connection between the information bottleneck channel and the WAK problem. We show that good codes for the latter can be produced through permuting codes designed for the former. This is accomplished by revisiting Ahlswede's covering lemma, and extending it to achieve simultaneous covering of a type class by several distinct sets using the same sequence of permutations. We then apply our approach to attain the best known achievable error exponent for the WAK problem, previously established by Kelly and Wagner. As a byproduct of our derivations, we also establish error exponents and achievable rates under mismatched decoding rules.</description>

      <title>RIS Partitioning and User Clustering for Resilient Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has emerged as a promising solution for enhancing connectivity in future wireless networks. This paper designs well-connected and resilient UAV networks by deploying and virtually partitioning multiple RISs to create multiple RIS-aided links, focusing on a link-layer perspective. The RIS-aided links are created to connect user equipment (UE) to blocked and reliable UAVs, where multiple UEs can transmit to same UAV via RIS using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), granting access to UEs and maximizing network connectivity. We first derive exact and approximated closed-form expressions for signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) based on aligned and non-aligned RIS-aided beams. Then, we propose to formulate the problem of maximizing network connectivity that jointly considers (i) UE NOMA clustering, (ii) RIS-aided link selection, and (ii) virtual RIS partitioning. This problem is a computationally expensive combinatorial optimization. To tackle this problem, a two-step iterative approach, called RIS-aided NOMA, is proposed. In the first step, the UEs are clustered to the RISs according to their channel gains, while UAVs are associated to those generated clusters based on their reliability, which measures the criticality of UAVs. The second step optimally partitions the RISs to support each of the cluster members. In this step, we derive the closed-form equations for the optimal partitioning of RISs within the clusters. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RIS-aided NOMA yields a gain of 30% to 40%, respectively, compared to UAV traditional scheme. The finding emphasizes the potential of integrating RIS with UAV communications as a robust and reliable connectivity solution for future wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>AI-based CSI Feedback with Digital Twins: Real-World Validation and Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has shown great potential for enhancing channel state information (CSI) feedback in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, a subject currently under study by the 3GPP standards body. Digital twins (DTs) have emerged as an effective means to generate site-specific datasets for training DL-based CSI feedback models. However, most existing studies rely solely on simulations, leaving the effectiveness of DTs in reducing DL training costs yet to be validated through realistic experimental setups. This paper addresses this gap by establishing a real-world (RW) environment and corresponding virtual channels using ray tracing with replicated 3D models and accurate antenna properties. We evaluate whether models trained in DT environments can effectively operate in RW scenarios and quantify the benefits of online learning (OL) for performance enhancement. Results show that a dedicated DT remains essential even with OL to achieve satisfactory performance in RW scenarios.</description>

      <title>Toward Practical Quantum Machine Learning: A Novel Hybrid Quantum LSTM for Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel hybrid quantum-classical neural network architecture for fraud detection that integrates a classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with a variational quantum circuit. By leveraging quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement, our model enhances the feature representation of sequential transaction data, capturing complex non-linear patterns that are challenging for purely classical models. A comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline is employed to clean, encode, balance, and normalize a credit card fraud dataset, ensuring a fair comparison with baseline models. Notably, our hybrid approach achieves per-epoch training times in the range of 45-65 seconds, which is significantly faster than similar architectures reported in the literature, where training typically requires several minutes per epoch. Both classical and quantum gradients are jointly optimized via a unified backpropagation procedure employing the parameter-shift rule for the quantum parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrate competitive improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score relative to a conventional LSTM baseline. These results underscore the promise of hybrid quantum-classical techniques in advancing the efficiency and performance of fraud detection systems.

      <title>Q Cells in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a given set of transmitters such as cellular base stations or WiFi access points, is it possible to analytically characterize the set of locations that are "covered" in the sense that users at these locations experience a certain minimum quality of service? In this paper, we affirmatively answer this question, by providing explicit simple outer bounds and estimates for the coverage manifold. The key geometric elements of our analytical method are the Q cells, defined as the intersections of a small number of disks. The Q cell of a transmitter is an outer bound to the service region of the transmitter, and, in turn, the union of Q cells is an outer bound to the coverage manifold. In infinite networks, connections to the meta distribution of the signal-to-interference ratio allow for a scaling of the Q cells to obtain accurate estimates of the coverage manifold.</description>

Abstract: We consider two-dimensional $(\lambda_1, \lambda_2)$-constacyclic codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ of area $M N$, where $q$ is some power of prime $p$ with $\gcd(M,p)=1$ and $\gcd(N,p)=1$. With the help of common zero (CZ) set, we characterize 2-D constacyclic codes. Further, we provide an algorithm to construct an ideal basis of these codes by using their essential common zero (ECZ) sets. We describe the dual of 2-D constacyclic codes. Finally, we provide an encoding scheme for generating 2-D constacyclic codes. We present an example to illustrate that 2-D constacyclic codes can have better minimum distance compared to their cyclic counterparts with the same code area and code rate.</description>

      <title>The Redundancy of Non-Singular Channel Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Channel simulation is an alternative to quantization and entropy coding for performing lossy source coding. Recently, channel simulation has gained significant traction in both the machine learning and information theory communities, as it integrates better with machine learning-based data compression algorithms and has better rate-distortion-perception properties than quantization. As the practical importance of channel simulation increases, it is vital to understand its fundamental limitations. Recently, Sriramu and Wagner provided an almost complete characterisation of the redundancy of channel simulation algorithms. In this paper, we complete this characterisation. First, we significantly extend a result of Li and El Gamal, and show that the redundancy of any instance of a channel simulation problem is lower bounded by the channel simulation divergence. Second, we give two proofs that the asymptotic redundancy of simulating iid non-singular channels is lower-bounded by $1/2$: one using a direct approach based on the asymptotic expansion of the channel simulation divergence and one using large deviations theory.</description>

      <title>Rate Distortion Approach to Joint Communication and Sensing With Markov States: Open Loop Case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a joint communication and sensing (JCAS) framework in which a transmitter concurrently transmits information to a receiver and estimates a state of interest based on noisy observations. The state is assumed to evolve according to a known dynamical model. Past state estimates may then be used to inform current state estimates. We show that Bayesian filtering constitutes the optimal sensing strategy. We analyze JCAS performance under an open loop encoding strategy with results presented in terms of the tradeoff between asymptotic communication rate and expected per-block distortion of the state. We illustrate the general result by specializing the analysis to a beam-pointing model with mobile state tracking. Our results shed light on the relative performance of two beam control strategies, beam-switching and multi-beam.</description>

      <title>On the Source Model Key Agreement Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the source model key agreement problem involving two legitimate parties and an eavesdropper who observe n i.i.d. samples of X, Y, and Z, respectively. In this paper, we focus on one of the simplest instances where the key capacity remains open, specifically when X and Y are binary random variables and Z is a function of the pair (X, Y). The best-known upper bound on the key capacity is characterized by an inf-max optimization problem that generally lacks a closed-form solution. We provide general conditions under which the upper bound reduces to I(X;Y). As an example, we consider the XOR setting in which X and Y are binary, and Z is the XOR of X and Y. The upper bound reduces to I(X;Y) for this source. Next, we conjecture that the rate I(X;Y) is not achievable for the XOR source and provide some ideas that might be useful for developing a new upper bound on the source model problem.</description>

      <title>On the Reliability of Information Retrieval From MDS Coded Data in DNA Storage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a theoretical analysis of the probability of successfully retrieving data encoded with MDS codes (e.g., Reed-Solomon codes) in DNA storage systems. We study this probability under independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) substitution errors, focusing on a common code design strategy that combines inner and outer MDS codes. Our analysis demonstrates how this probability depends on factors such as the total number of sequencing reads, their distribution across strands, the rates of the inner and outer codes, and the substitution error probabilities. These results provide actionable insights into optimizing DNA storage systems under reliability constraints, including determining the minimum number of sequencing reads needed for reliable data retrieval and identifying the optimal balance between the rates of inner and outer MDS codes.</description>

Abstract: As semantic communication (SemCom) emerges as a promising communication paradigm, ensuring the security of semantic information over open wireless channels has become crucial. Traditional encryption methods introduce considerable communication overhead, while existing learning-based secure SemCom schemes often rely on a channel capacity advantage for the legitimate receiver, which is challenging to guarantee in practice. In this paper, we propose a coding-enhanced jamming approach that eliminates the need to transmit a secret key by utilizing shared knowledge between the legitimate receiver and the transmitter. We generate private codebooks with neural network (NN)-based encoders, using them to encode data into a sequence Y1, which is then superposed with a sequence Y2 drawn from the private codebook. By optimizing the power allocation between the two sequences, the legitimate receiver can successfully decode the data, while the eavesdropper' s performance is significantly degraded, potentially to the point of random guessing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves comparable security to state-of-the-art approaches while significantly improving the reconstruction performance of the legitimate receiver by more than 1 dB across varying channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and compression ratios.</description>

      <title>SNR-aware Semantic Image Transmission with Deep Learning-based Channel Estimation in Fading Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communications (SCs) play a central role in shaping the future of the sixth generation (6G) wireless systems, which leverage rapid advances in deep learning (DL). In this regard, end-to-end optimized DL-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) has been adopted to achieve SCs, particularly in image transmission. Utilizing vision transformers in the encoder/decoder design has enabled significant advancements in image semantic extraction, surpassing traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this paper, we propose a new JSCC paradigm for image transmission, namely Swin semantic image transmission (SwinSIT), based on the Swin transformer. The Swin transformer is employed to construct both the semantic encoder and decoder for efficient image semantic extraction and reconstruction. Inspired by the squeezing-and-excitation (SE) network, we introduce a signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR)-aware module that utilizes SNR feedback to adaptively perform a double-phase enhancement for the encoder-extracted semantic map and its noisy version at the decoder. Additionally, a CNN-based channel estimator and compensator (CEAC) module repurposes an image-denoising CNN to mitigate fading channel effects. To optimize deployment in resource-constrained IoT devices, a joint pruning and quantization scheme compresses the SwinSIT model. Simulations evaluate the SwinSIT performance against conventional benchmarks demonstrating its effectiveness. Moreover, the model's compressed version substantially reduces its size while maintaining favorable PSNR performance.</description>

      <title>Fast Sign Retrieval via Sub-band Convolution: An Elementary Extension of Binary Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To efficiently compress the sign information of images, we address a sign retrieval problem for the block-wise discrete cosine transformation (DCT): reconstruction of the signs of DCT coefficients from their amplitudes. To this end, we propose a fast sign retrieval method on the basis of binary classification machine learning. We first introduce 3D representations of the amplitudes and signs, where we pack amplitudes/signs belonging to the same frequency band into a 2D slice, referred to as the sub-band block. We then retrieve the signs from the 3D amplitudes via binary classification, where each sign is regarded as a binary label. We implement a binary classification algorithm using convolutional neural networks, which are advantageous for efficiently extracting features in the 3D amplitudes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves accurate sign retrieval with an overwhelmingly low computation cost.</description>

      <title>Self-restricting Noise and Exponential Relative Entropy Decay Under Unital Quantum Markov Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.03745v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: States of open quantum systems often decay continuously under environmental interactions. Quantum Markov semigroups model such processes in dissipative environments. It is known that finite-dimensional quantum Markov semigroups with GNS detailed balance universally obey complete modified logarithmic Sobolev inequalities (CMLSIs), yielding exponential decay of relative entropy to a subspace of fixed point states. We analyze continuous processes that combine dissipative with Hamiltonian time-evolution, precluding this notion of detailed balance. First, we find counterexamples to CMLSI-like decay for these processes and determine conditions under which it fails. In contrast, we prove that despite its absence at early times, exponential decay re-appears for unital, finite-dimensional quantum Markov semigroups at finite timescales. Finally, we show that when dissipation is much stronger than Hamiltonian time-evolution, the rate of eventual, exponential decay toward the semigroup's decoherence-free subspace is bounded inversely in the decay rate of the dissipative part alone. Dubbed self-restricting noise, this inverse relationship arises when strong damping suppresses effects that would otherwise spread noise beyond its initial subspace.</description>

      <title>Omitted Labels Induce Nontransitive Paradoxes in Causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06840v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore "omitted label contexts," in which training data is limited to a subset of the possible labels. This setting is standard among specialized human experts or specific, focused studies. By studying Simpson's paradox, we observe that ``correct'' adjustments sometimes require non-exchangeable treatment and control groups. A generalization of Simpson's paradox leads us to study networks of conclusions drawn from different contexts, within which a paradox of nontransitivity arises. We prove that the space of possible nontransitive structures in these networks exactly corresponds to structures that form from aggregating ranked-choice votes.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient Quantum State Tomography for Structured Quantum States in One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While quantum state tomography (QST) remains the gold standard for benchmarking and verifying quantum devices, it requires an exponentially large number of measurements and classical computational resources for generic quantum many-body systems, making it impractical even for intermediate-size quantum devices. Fortunately, many physical quantum states often exhibit certain low-dimensional structures that enable the development of efficient QST. A notable example is the class of states represented by matrix product operators (MPOs) with a finite matrix/bond dimension, which include most physical states in one dimension and where the number of independent parameters describing the states only grows linearly with the number of qubits. Whether a sample efficient quantum state tomography protocol, where the number of required state copies scales only linearly as the number of parameters describing the state, exists for a generic MPO state still remains an important open question.
  In this paper, we answer this fundamental question affirmatively by using a class of informationally complete positive operator-valued measures (IC-POVMs) -- including symmetric IC-POVMs (SIC-POVMs) and spherical $t$-designs -- focusing on sample complexity while not accounting for the implementation complexity of the measurement settings. For SIC-POVMs and (approximate) spherical 2-designs, we show that the number of state copies to guarantee bounded recovery error of an MPO state with a constrained least-squares estimator depends on the probability distribution of the MPO under the POVM but scales only linearly with $n$ when the distribution is approximately uniform. For spherical $t$-designs with $t\geq 3$, we prove that only a number of state copies proportional to the number of independent parameters in the MPO is sufficient for a guaranteed recovery of any state represented by an MPO.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of tempered stable processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find the information geometry of tempered stable processes. Beginning with the derivation of $\alpha$-divergence between two tempered stable processes, we obtain the corresponding Fisher information matrices and the $\alpha$-connections on their statistical manifolds. Furthermore, we explore statistical applications of this geometric framework. Various tempered stable processes such as generalized tempered stable processes, classical tempered stable processes, and rapidly-decreasing tempered stable processes are presented as illustrative examples.</description>
