      <title>Deeply nonlinear magnon-photon hybrid excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the microwave-power dependence of magnon-photon coupling in a yttrium iron garnet-sphere/split-ring-resonator hybrid system at room temperature and demonstrate that nonlinear spin-wave interactions suppress the coupling through power-induced dissipation of magnetostatic modes. At low microwave power, the modes exhibit pronounced level repulsion, evidencing strong coupling to the microwave field. As the power increases, however, magnon linewidth broadening progressively weakens the coupling and ultimately suppresses it entirely below a threshold external magnetic field. We show that this behavior originates from Suhl's first-order instability: magnetostatic modes, which couple to the resonator, parametrically excites two counter-propagating magnons at half its frequency, causing modes below the threshold external magnetic field to vanish. In contrast, magnon modes above the threshold field remain robust even at high power, as the instability criterion is not satisfied in that regime. These results reveal a well-defined nonlinear boundary for magnon-photon coupled systems and highlight a favorable regime for exploiting nonlinear magnonics for frequency conversion, switching, and other functional magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Time Crystal Clock and its Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding different aspects of time is at the core of many areas in theoretical physics. Minimal models of continuous stochastic and quantum clocks have been proposed to explore fundamental limitations on the performance of timekeeping devices. Owing to the level of complexity in the clock structure and its energy consumption, such devices show trade-offs whose characterization remains an open challenge. Indeed, even conceptual designs for thermodynamically efficient quantum clocks are not yet well understood. In condensed matter theory, time-crystals were found as an exciting new phase of matter, featuring oscillations in (pseudo)-equilibrium with first experimental observations appearing recently. This naturally prompts the question: can time crystals be used as quantum clocks and what is their performance from a thermodynamic perspective? We answer this question and find that quantum time crystals are indeed genuine quantum clocks with a performance enhanced by the spontaneous breaking of time-translation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Establishing Atomic Coherence in Twisted Oxide Membranes Containing Volatile Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twisted oxide membranes represent a promising platform for exploring moire physics and emergent quantum phenomena. However, the presence of amorphous interfacial dead layers in conventional oxide heterostructures impedes coherent coupling and suppresses moire-induced interactions. While high-temperature thermal treatments can facilitate interfacial bonding, additional care is needed for materials containing volatile elements, where elevated temperatures may cause elemental loss. This study demonstrates the realization of atomically coherent, chemically bonded interface in twisted NaNbO3 heterostructures through controlled oxygen-annealing treatment. Atomic-resolution imaging and spectroscopy reveal ordered perovskite registry accompanied by systematic lattice contraction and modified electronic structure at the twisted interface, providing signatures of chemical reconstruction rather than physical adhesion. This reconstructed interface mediates highly asymmetric strain propagation in which the bottom membrane remains nearly relaxed while the top membrane accommodates substantial shear strain, thereby establishing a strain gradient that enables long-range electromechanical coupling throughout the twisted oxide membranes. By resolving the nature of the reconstructed interface, these findings establish a robust pathway for achieving coherent and strain-tunable oxide moire superlattices, opening pathways to engineer emergent ferroic and electronic functionalities.</description>
