      <title>Modeling and Simulation of Virtual Rigid Body Formations and Their Applications Using Multiple Air Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents thorough mathematical modeling, control law development, and simulation of virtual structure formations which are inspired by the characteristics of rigid bodies. The stable constraint forces that establish the rigidity in the formation are synthesized by utilizing d'Alembert's principle of virtual work, constraint sensitivities (Lagrange multipliers) and constraint stabilization using Baumgarte stabilization. The governing equations of motion of a multiagent system are derived via Newton's and Euler's equations to include these constraint forces and to enable inputs regarding the formation as if it were an independent rigid body. The performance of this framework is evaluated under multiple cases including waypoint following missions, and using different number of agents.</description>

      <title>Least-Squares Multi-Step Koopman Operator Learning for Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MPC is widely used in real-time applications, but practical implementations are typically restricted to convex QP formulations to ensure fast and certified execution. Koopman-based MPC enables QP-based control of nonlinear systems by lifting the dynamics to a higher-dimensional linear representation. However, existing approaches rely on single-step EDMD. Consequently, prediction errors may accumulate over long horizons when the EDMD operator is applied recursively. Moreover, the multi-step prediction loss is nonconvex with respect to the single-step EDMD operator, making long-horizon model identification particularly challenging. This paper proposes a multi-step EDMD framework that directly learns the condensed multi-step state-control mapping required for Koopman-MPC, thereby bypassing explicit identification of the lifted system matrices and subsequent model condensation. The resulting identification problem admits a convex least-squares formulation. We further show that the problem decomposes across prediction horizons and state coordinates, enabling parallel computation and row-wise $\ell_1$-regularization for automatic dictionary pruning. A non-asymptotic finite-sample analysis demonstrates that, unlike one-step EDMD, the proposed method avoids error compounding and yields error bounds that depend only on the target multi-step mapping. Numerical examples validate improved long-horizon prediction accuracy and closed-loop performance.</description>

      <title>Structured {\mu}-Synthesis for Nanopositioners under Payload-Induced Uncertainties: Minimising Conservatism for Robust Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most systems exhibit significant variability in their dynamics, including variations in system parameters and large high-frequency dynamic uncertainties. Traditional uncertainty modelling techniques consolidate all such variations into a single uncertainty block, often yielding overly conservative representations of the true plant behaviour. This paper introduces an uncertainty modelling framework that employs multiple structured and unstructured uncertainty blocks to reduce this conservatism. The methodology is evaluated for an industrial piezoelectric nanopositioner subject to payload-induced variations, using uncertainty models of differing complexity. A bandpass controller is synthesised via structured mixed-{\mu} synthesis, and the resulting designs are compared in terms of conservatism of the uncertainty model, robust performance, and computational effort.</description>

      <title>A Constraint Programming Model for the Super-Agile Earth Observation Satellite Imaging Scheduling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11967v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the dependence on satellite imaging continues to grow, modern satellites have become increasingly agile, with the new generation, namely super-agile Earth observation satellites (SAEOS), providing unprecedented imaging flexibility. The highly dynamic capabilities of these satellites introduce additional challenges to the scheduling of observation tasks, as existing approaches for conventional agile satellites do not account for variable observation durations and multiple imaging directions. Although some efforts have been made in this regard, the SAEOS imaging scheduling problem (SAEOS-ISP) remains largely unexplored, and no exact approaches have yet been proposed. In this context, this study presents the first exact Constraint Programming formulation for the SAEOS-ISP, considering flexible observation windows, multiple pointing directions and sequence-dependent transition times across multiple satellites. Computational experiments on a newly generated benchmark set demonstrate that the model can be solved efficiently and within very short computational times. Moreover, the results also show that the proposed approach has the potential to achieve higher computational performance compared to the non-exact approaches that are currently considered state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Motion and Resonant Damping Control for High-Bandwidth and Cross-Coupling Reduction in MIMO Nanopositioners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piezoelectric nanopositioning systems are widely used in precision applications that require nanometer accuracy and high-speed motion; however, lightly damped resonances and pronounced cross-axis coupling severely limit bandwidth and disturbance rejection. This paper presents a decentralized dual-loop control strategy for a two-axis nanopositioner, combining an inner non-minimum-phase resonant damping controller with an outer motion controller on each axis. The dominant diagonal resonance is actively damped to enable closed-loop bandwidths beyond the first structural mode, while a parallel band-pass damping path is specifically tuned to a higher-order resonance that predominantly affects the cross-coupling channels. Experimental results demonstrate that this targeted band-pass damping substantially reduces cross-axis coupling and enhances disturbance rejection, without compromising tracking accuracy.</description>

      <title>Profit Maximization for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Using Multiagent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) are increasingly integrated into power grids, offering economic and environmental benefits but introducing challenges due to uncoordinated charging. This study addresses the profit maximization problem for multiple EV charging stations (EVCSs) equipped with energy storage systems (ESS) and renewable energy sources (RES), with the capability for energy trading. We propose a Double Hypernetwork QMIX-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to optimize cooperative energy management under uncertainty in EV demand, renewable generation, and real-time electricity prices. The framework mitigates overestimation bias in value estimation, enables distributed decision-making, and incorporates an internal energy trading mechanism. Numerical experiments using real-world data demonstrate that, compared to standard QMIX, the proposed method achieves approximately 5.3% and 12.7% higher total profit for the two regions, respectively, highlighting its economic and operational efficiency. Additionally, the approach maintains robust performance under varying levels of EV demand uncertainty and renewable energy fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Reachability Guarantees for Energy Arbitrage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a unified framework for battery energy arbitrage under uncertain market prices that integrates chance-constrained terminal state-of-charge requirements with online threshold policies. We first cast the multi-interval arbitrage problem as a stochastic dynamic program enhanced by a probabilistic end-of-horizon state-of-charge (SoC) constraint, ensuring with high confidence that the battery terminates within a prescribed energy band. We then apply a $k$-search algorithm to derive explicit charging (buying) and discharging (selling) thresholds with provable worst-case competitive ratio, and compute the corresponding action probabilities over the decision horizon. To compute exact distributions under operational limits, we develop a probability redistribution pruning method and use it to quantify the likelihood of meeting the terminal SoC band. Leveraging the resulting SoC distribution, we estimate the minimum stopping-time required to satisfy the SoC chance constraint. Computational experiments on historical real price data demonstrate that the proposed framework substantially improves the estimation of SoC evolution and supports chance-constraint satisfaction.</description>

      <title>Solvability of The Output Corridor Control Problem by Pulse-Modulated Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of maintaining the output of a positive time-invariant single-input single-output system within a predefined corridor of values is treated. For third-order plants possessing a certain structure, it is proven that the problem is always solvable under stationary conditions by means of pulse-modulated feedback. The obtained result is utilized to assess the feasibility of patient-specific pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models with respect to patient safety. A population of Wiener models capturing the dynamics of a neuromuscular blockade agent is studied to investigate whether or not they can be driven into the desired output corridor by clinically acceptable sequential drug doses (boluses). It is demonstrated that low values of a parameter in the nonlinear pharmacodynamic part lie behind the detected model infeasibility.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Impact of EV Battery Charging on the Distribution Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many countries are rapidly adopting electric vehicles (EVs) due to their meager running cost and environment-friendly nature. EVs are likely to dominate the internal combustion (IC) engine cars entirely over the next few years. With the rise in popularity of EVs, adverse effects of EV charging loads on the grid system have been observed. Since the distribution system (DS) does not cope with the high overloading capacity, the negative impact of EV charging load on the distribution network (DN) cannot be neglected. A high level of EV penetration with uncoordinated charging is the primary cause of voltage instability, increased peak load demand, and reliability issues of the DN. In this paper, a detailed overview of all the notable impacts of EV charging on voltage profile, power quality, and DS performance is discussed. This work also reviews the different topologies of EV chargers and the issues introduced by power converters on the utility grid. Finally, the strategies for improving the charging of EVs proposed in the literature to consider the random nature of EVs charging, the management of peak loads, and bidirectional power flow are summarized.</description>

      <title>Worst-case Nonlinear Regression with Error Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an active-learning approach to worst-case nonlinear regression with deterministic error guarantees. Given a known nonlinear function defined over a compact set, we compute a surrogate model, such as a feedforward neural network, by minimizing the maximum absolute approximation error. To address the nonsmooth nature of the resulting minimax problem, we introduce a smooth approximation of the $L_\infty$-type loss that enables efficient gradient-based training. We iteratively enrich the training set by actively learning points of largest approximation error through global optimization. The resulting models admit certified worst-case error bounds, either constant or input-dependent, over the entire input domain. The approach is demonstrated through approximations of nonlinear functions and nonconvex sets, as well as through the derivation of uncertain models of more complex nonlinear dynamics within a given model class, and the approximation of explicit model predictive control laws.</description>

      <title>HERMES: A Unified Open-Source Framework for Realtime Multimodal Physiological Sensing, Edge AI, and Intervention in Closed-Loop Smart Healthcare Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent assistive technologies are increasingly recognized as critical daily-use enablers for people with disabilities and age-related functional decline. Longitudinal studies, curation of quality datasets, live monitoring in activities of daily living, and intelligent intervention devices, share the largely unsolved need in reliable high-throughput multimodal sensing and processing. Streaming large heterogeneous data from distributed sensors, historically closed-source environments, and limited prior works on realtime closed-loop AI methodologies, inhibit such applications. To accelerate the emergence of clinical deployments, we deliver HERMES - an open-source high-performance Python framework for continuous multimodal sensing and AI processing at the edge. It enables synchronized data collection, and realtime streaming inference with user PyTorch models, on commodity computing devices. HERMES is applicable to fixed-lab and free-living environments, of distributed commercial and custom sensors. It is the first work to offer a holistic methodology that bridges cross-disciplinary gaps in real-world implementation strategies, and guides downstream AI model development. Its application on the closed-loop intelligent prosthesis use case illustrates the process of suitable AI model development from the generated constraints and trade-offs. Validation on the use case, with 4 synchronized hosts cooperatively capturing 18 wearable and off-body modalities, demonstrates performance and relevance of HERMES to the trajectory of the intelligent healthcare domain.</description>

      <title>Allocating Corrective Control to Mitigate Multi-agent Safety Violations Under Private Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework that computes the corrective control efforts to ensure joint safety in multi-agent dynamical systems. This framework efficiently distributes the required corrective effort without revealing individual agents' private preferences. Our framework integrates high-order control barrier functions (HOCBFs), which enforce safety constraints with formal guarantees of safety for complex dynamical systems, with a privacy-preserving resource allocation mechanism based on the progressive second price (PSP) auction. When a joint safety constraint is violated, agents iteratively bid on new corrective efforts via 'avoidance credits' rather than explicitly solving for feasible corrective efforts that remove the safety violation. The resulting correction, determined via a second price payment rule, coincides with the socially optimal safe distribution of corrective actions. Critically, the bidding process achieves this optimal allocation efficiently and without revealing private preferences of individual agents. We demonstrate this method through multi-robot hardware experiments on the Robotarium platform.</description>

      <title>Resilient Interval Observer-Based Control for Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control under FDI Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connectivity in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) introduces vulnerability to cyber threats such as false data injection (FDI) attacks, which can compromise system reliability and safety. To ensure resilience, this paper proposes a control framework combining a nonlinear controller with an interval observer for robust state estimation under measurement noise. The observer bounds leader's states, while a neural network-based estimator estimates the unknown FDI attacks in real time. These estimates are then used to mitigate FDI attack effects maintaining safe inter-vehicle spacing. The proposed approach leverages an idea of interval observer-based estimation and merges model-based and learning-based methods to achieve accurate estimations and real-time performance. MATLAB/Simulink results confirm resilient tracking, precise FDI attack estimation, and robustness to noise, demonstrating potential for real-world CACC applications under cyberattacks, disturbance, and bounded measurement noise.</description>

Abstract: Grid resilience is crucial in light of power interruptions caused by increasingly frequent extreme weather events. Well-designed energy management systems (EMS) have made progress in improving microgrid resilience through the coordination of distributed energy resources (DERs), but still face significant challenges in addressing the uncertainty of load demand caused by extreme weather. The integration of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) into EMS design enables optimized microgrid control strategies for coordinating DERs. Building on this, we proposed a cooperative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based EMS framework to provide flexible scalability for microgrids, enhance resilience and reduce operational costs during power outages. Specifically, the gated recurrent unit with a gating mechanism was introduced to extract features from temporal data, which enables the EMS to coordinate DERs more efficiently. Next, the proposed MADRL method incorporating action masking techniques was evaluated in the IEEE 33-Bus system using real-world data on renewable generation and power load. Finally, the numerical results demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method in reducing operating costs as well as the effectiveness in enhancing microgrid resilience during power interruptions.</description>

      <title>Network Slicing Resource Management in Uplink User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12687v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the joint optimization of per-user equipment (UE) bandwidth allocation and UE-access point (AP) association to maximize weighted sum-rate while satisfying heterogeneous quality-of-service (QoS) requirements across enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) slices in the uplink of a network slicing-enabled user-centric cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system. The formulated problem is NP-hard, rendering global optimality computationally intractable. To address this challenge, it is decomposed into two sub-problems, each solved by a computationally efficient heuristic scheme, and jointly optimized through an alternating optimization framework. We then propose (i) a bandwidth allocation scheme that balances UE priority, spectral efficiency, and minimum bandwidth demand under limited resources to ensure fair QoS distribution, and (ii) a priority-based UE-AP association assignment approach that balances UE service quality with system capacity constraints. Together, these approaches provide a practical and computationally efficient solution for resource-constrained network slicing scenarios, where QoS feasibility is often violated under dense deployments and limited bandwidth, necessitating graceful degradation and fair QoS preservation rather than solely maximizing the aggregate sum-rate. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves up to 52% higher weighted sum-rate, 140% and 58% higher QoS success rates for eMBB and URLLC slices, respectively, while reducing runtime by up to 97% compared to the considered benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Priority-Based Bandwidth Allocation in Network Slicing-Enabled Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12689v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses joint admission control and per-user equipment (UE) bandwidth allocation to maximize weighted sum-rate in network slicing-enabled user-centric cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems when aggregate quality-of-service (QoS) demand may exceed available bandwidth. Specifically, we optimize bandwidth allocation while satisfying heterogeneous QoS requirements across enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) slices in the uplink. The formulated problem is NP-hard, rendering global optimality computationally intractable. We decompose it into two sub-problems and solve them via computationally efficient heuristics within a sequential framework. We propose (i) a hierarchical admission control scheme that selectively admits UEs under bandwidth scarcity, prioritizing URLLC to ensure latency-sensitive QoS compliance, and (ii) an iterative gradient-based bandwidth allocation scheme that transfers bandwidth across slices guided by marginal utility and reallocates resources within slices. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves near-optimal performance, deviating from an interior point solver-based benchmark by at most 2.2% in weighted sum-rate while reducing runtime by 99.7%, thereby enabling practical real-time deployment. Compared to a baseline round-robin scheme without admission control, the proposed approach achieves up to 1085% and 7% higher success rates for eMBB and URLLC slices, respectively, by intentionally sacrificing sum-rate to guarantee QoS. Sensitivity analysis further reveals that the proposed solution adapts effectively to diverse eMBB/URLLC traffic compositions, maintaining 47-51% eMBB and 93-94% URLLC success rates across varying load scenarios, confirming its robustness for resource-constrained large-scale deployments.</description>

      <title>Closed-loop Uplink Radio Resource Management in CF-O-RAN Empowered 5G Aerial Corridor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12694v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the uplink (UL) radio resource management for 5G aerial corridors with an open-radio access network (O-RAN)-enabled cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system. Our objective is to maximize the minimum spectral efficiency (SE) by jointly optimizing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-open radio unit (O-RU) association and UL transmit power under quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Owing to its NP-hard nature, the formulated problem is decomposed into two tractable sub-problems solved via alternating optimization (AO) using two computationally efficient algorithms. We then propose (i) a QoS-driven and multi-connectivity-enabled association algorithm incorporating UAV-centric and O-RU-centric criteria with targeted refinement for weak UAVs, and (ii) a bisection-guided fixed-point power control algorithm achieving global optimality with significantly reduced complexity, hosted as xApp at the near-real-time (near-RT) RAN intelligent controller (RIC) of O-RAN. Solving the resource-allocation problem requires global channel state information (CSI), which incurs substantial measurement and signaling overhead. To mitigate this, we leverage a channel knowledge map (CKM) within the O-RAN non-RT RIC to enable efficient environment-aware CSI inference. Simulation results show that the proposed framework achieves up to 440% improvement in minimum SE, 100% QoS satisfaction and fairness, while reducing runtime by up to 99.7% compared to an interior point solver-based power allocation solution, thereby enabling O-RAN compliant real-time deployment.</description>

      <title>From Noise to Knowledge: System Identification with Systematic Polytope Construction via Cyclic Reformulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-based control requires accurate mathematical models to guarantee control performance and stability. However, obtaining accurate models is challenging due to process and sensor noise. This paper proposes a novel identification algorithm that derives polytopic uncertainty models by interpreting noise-induced parameter fluctuations as intrinsic uncertainty. The method applies cyclic reformulation with period N to linear time-invariant systems, yielding N parameter sets with slight variations that serve as polytope vertices. This enables systematic polytopic model construction from a single identification experiment. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements: the proposed method achieves higher parameter estimation accuracy and reduces prediction errors by approximately half compared to conventional approaches. The vertex count N provides systematic control over the precision of uncertainty representation.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Limited Control of Noiseless Linear Systems Under Nonlinear Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the fundamental information-theoretic limits for the control and sensing of noiseless linear dynamical systems subject to a broad class of nonlinear observations. We analyze the interactions between the control and sensing components by characterizing the minimum information flow required for stability. Specifically, we derive necessary conditions for mean-square observability and stabilizability, demonstrating that the average directed information rate from the state to the observations must exceed the intrinsic expansion rate of the unstable dynamics. Furthermore, to address the challenges posed by non-Gaussian distributions inherent to nonlinear observation channels, we establish sufficient conditions by imposing regularity assumptions, specifically log-concavity, on the system's probabilistic components. We show that under these conditions, the divergence of differential entropy implies the convergence of the estimation error, thereby closing the gap between information-theoretic bounds and estimation performance. By establishing these results, we unveil the fundamental performance limits imposed by the sensing layer, extending classical data-rate constraints to the more challenging regime of nonlinear observation models.</description>

      <title>Lessons Learned from Structural Design and Vibration Testing of 50-kg Microsatellites Deployed from the International Space Station</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hokkaido University and Tohoku University have been developing and operating a constellation of 50-cm-class microsatellites for Earth observation. DIWATA-1, launched in 2016, was deployed into a circular orbit at an altitude of approximately 400 km from the International Space Station (ISS). For the subsequent satellite developed in 2021, the structural design and vibration test campaign were optimized to meet a strict one-year development schedule. This paper summarizes how the structural design of the previous satellite was reviewed and updated, and how the vibration test was successfully completed in a single trial to minimize schedule and technical risks. These lessons learned provide valuable insights, as there are only a limited number of reported cases of 50-kg-class microsatellites deployed from the ISS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the system design methodology derived from the development and evaluation tests of deployable solar panels to be mounted on a 3U CubeSat. The study mainly includes structural analysis, thermal analysis, and a review of vibration test results. Hokkaido University is developing the 3U CubeSat HOKUSHIN-1 in collaboration with Tohoku University and Muroran Institute of Technology. Deployable solar panels are a key technology for future planned lunar exploration missions, as they enable power-intensive communication and propulsion required for orbit control. The satellite also demonstrates a newly developed compact and efficient propulsion system. The satellite has dimensions of approximately 10x10x34 cm, a mass of 3.99 kg, and will be deployed into a circular orbit at an altitude of about 400 km with an orbital inclination of 51.6 degrees from the International Space Station.</description>

Abstract: Since the launch of its first satellite in 2009, Tohoku University has continuously developed and operated Earth observation satellites and engineering demonstration satellites in the 50cm-class and CubeSat-class (up to 3U). The 50cm-class satellite launched into operation in 2021 enabled efficient operations through cloud-based management functions for both the satellite and ground stations, including automatic command generation. By 2022, up to eight operational satellites were simultaneously managed on a daily basis using three ground stations (Sendai, Hakodate, and Sweden).

      <title>From Vertices to Convex Hulls: Certifying Set-Wise Compatibility for CBF Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops certificates that propagate compatibility of multiple control barrier function (CBF) constraints from sampled vertices to their convex hull. Under mild concavity and affinity assumptions, we present three sufficient feasibility conditions under which feasible inputs over the convex hull can be obtained per coordinate, with a common input, or via convex blending. We also describe the associated computational methods, based on interval intersections or an offline linear program (LP). Beyond certifying compatibility, we give conditions under which the quadratic-program (QP) safety filter is affine in the state. This enables explicit implementations via convex combinations of vertex-feasible inputs. Case studies illustrate the results.</description>

      <title>Guiding vector field-based guidance under wind disturbances applied to a tailsitter UAV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a guidance control law based on a parametric Guiding Vector Field (GVF) and integrates it with a state-of-the-art acceleration and attitude control architecture for tailsitters. The resulting framework enables a direct comparison between traditional trajectory-tracking guidance and GVF-based path-following guidance using a realistic tailsitter model operating under windy conditions. Through extensive simulations, it is shown that for agile flight scenarios with wind and small initial position error, both guidance strategies achieve comparable tracking performance, indicating that the additional complexity introduced by the GVF formulation is not always justified. However, the GVF-based approach exhibits an advantage when initial deviation from the path is present, yielding smooth and well-behaved convergence toward the desired path. Two additional contributions support this evaluation. First, a modification of the parametric GVF is proposed that guarantees exponential stability of the tracking error dynamics for a single integrator system. Second, the differential flatness transform of a tailsitter vehicle is extended to account for explicit knowledge of the wind velocity vector.</description>

      <title>Feedforward-Feedback Integration in Flight Control: Reinforcement Learning with Sliding Mode Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based controllers leverage nonlinear couplings and enhance transients but seldom offer guarantees under tight input constraints. Robust feedback like sliding-mode control (SMC) provides these guarantees but is conservative in isolation. This paper creates a learning-augmented framework where a deep reinforcement learning policy produces feedforward commands and an SMC law imposes actuator limits, bounds learned authority, and guarantees robustness. The policy is modeled as a matched, bounded input, and Lyapunov-based conditions link SMC gains to the admissible feedforward bound, guaranteeing stability under saturation. This formulation is applicable to nonlinear, underactuated plants with hard constraints. To illustrate the methodology, the method is applied to a six-degree-of-freedom aircraft model and compared with Reinforcement Learning and isolated SMC. Simulation results show that the hybrid controller improves transient behavior and reduces control oscillations compared to standalone RL and SMC controllers, while preserving robustness under modeling uncertainties and disturbances. Even using it with partially trained policies, SMC component of the control stabilizes transients, whereas fully trained policies provide faster convergence, reduced constraint violations, and robustness. These results illustrate that learning-augmented control offers superior performance with robustness guarantees under tight input constraints.</description>

      <title>Convex Model Predictive Control for Safe Output Consensus of Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamics and safety constraints typically result in a nonlinear programming problem when applying model predictive control to achieve safe output consensus. To avoid the heavy computational burden of solving a nonlinear programming problem directly, this paper proposes a novel Convex Model Predictive Control (CMPC) approach based on a Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) scheme. The core of our method lies in transforming the nonlinear constraints into linear forms: we linearize the system dynamics and convexify the discrete-time high-order control barrier functions using a proposed tangent-line projection method. Consequently, the original problem is reduced to a quadratic program that can be iteratively solved within the SQP scheme at each time step of CMPC. Furthermore, we provide the formal guarantee of the convergence of the SQP scheme, and subsequently guarantee the recursive feasibility and stability of CMPC. Simulations on multi-agent systems with unicycle dynamics demonstrate a 35-52 times reduction in computation time compared with baseline methods, confirming the suitability of the proposed approach for real-time safe output consensus control.</description>

      <title>Stability of Information-Based Routing in Dynamic Transportation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies on transportation networks have shown that real-time route guidance can inadvertently induce congestion or oscillatory traffic patterns. Nevertheless, such technologies also offer a promising opportunity to manage traffic non-intrusively by shaping the information delivered to users, thereby mitigating congestion and enhancing network stability. A key step toward this goal is to identify information signals that ensure the existence of an equilibrium with desirable stability and convergence properties. This challenge is particularly relevant when traffic density and routing dynamics evolve concurrently, as increasingly occurs with digital signaling and real-time navigation technologies. To address this, we analyze a parallel-path transportation network with a single origin-destination pair, incorporating joint traffic density and logit-based routing dynamics that evolve at the same timescale. We characterize a class of density-dependent traffic information that guarantees a unique equilibrium in the free-flow regime, ensures its asymptotic stability, and keeps traffic densities within the free-flow region for all time. The theoretical results are complemented by a numerical case study demonstrating how the framework can inform the design of traffic information that reduces total travel time without compromising credibility.</description>

      <title>QoS-Aware Energy Optimization via Cell Switching in Heterogeneous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for mobile data services in dense urban areas has intensified the need for energy-efficient radio access networks (RANs) in future 6G systems. In this context, one promising strategy is cell switching (CS), which dynamically deactivates underutilized small base stations (SBSs) to reduce power consumption. However, while previous research explored CS primarily based on traffic load, ensuring user quality of service (QoS) under realistic channel conditions remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization-driven CS framework that jointly minimizes network power consumption and guarantees user QoS by enforcing a minimum received power threshold as part of offloading decisions. In contrast to prior load-based or learning-based approaches, our method explicitly integrates channel-aware information into the CS process, thus ensuring reliable service quality for offloaded users. Furthermore, flexibility of the proposed framework enables operators to adapt system behavior between energy-saving and QoS-preserving modes by tuning a single design parameter. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves up to 30% power savings as compared to baseline methods while fully maintaining QoS under diverse network conditions. Scalability and robustness of the proposed method in realistic heterogeneous networks (HetNets) further highlight its potential as a practical solution for sustainable 6G deployments.</description>

      <title>Emissions and cost tradeoffs of time-matched clean electricity procurement under inter-annual weather variability: case study of hydrogen production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-matching requirements (TMRs) for clean electricity procurement are increasingly adopted in voluntary corporate sustainability initiatives and regulatory frameworks. While prior research has evaluated cost and emissions impacts of hourly vs. annual TMR, these studies typically rely on single-year weather scenarios that do not capture inter-annual variability in variable renewable energy (VRE) generation. We use a capacity expansion model to assess how inter-annual weather variability affects procurement-driven infrastructure investments, costs, and emissions for a grid-connected hydrogen producer under both annual and hourly time-matching strategies. Using a Texas case study, we compare deterministic (single weather scenario) and stochastic (nine weather scenarios) modeling approaches. Both procurement investments and cost and emissions outcomes are sensitive to weather scenario, with annual matching exhibiting greater sensitivity than hourly matching. Stochastic modeling finds higher cost premiums for hourly versus annual matching compared to deterministic modeling, though emissions trends remain directionally consistent. Demand flexibility through H2 storage is critical for lowering hourly matching cost premiums under weather-driven VRE variability. Partial hourly matching (e.g., 80-90% compliance) can modestly reduce costs while maintaining minimal emissions impacts. Finally, we examine how grid-level renewable portfolio standards (RPS) affect additionality and emissions. When stringent additionality is achieved via binding RPS constraints on non-H2 electricity demand, annual matching can produce emissions reductions comparable to hourly matching at lower cost.</description>

      <title>Safe Navigation in Cluttered Environments Via Spline-Based Harmonic Potential Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a complete motion-planning mechanism that ensures target tracking and obstacle avoidance in a cluttered environment. For a given polyhedral decomposition of the feasible space, we adopt a novel procedure that constrains the agent to move only through a prescribed sequence of cells via a suitable control policy.
  For each cell, we construct a harmonic potential surface induced by a Dirichlet boundary condition given as a cardinal B-spline curve. A detailed analysis of the curve behavior (periodicity, support) and of the associated control point selection allows us to explicitly compute these harmonic potential surfaces, from which we subsequently derive the corresponding control policy. We illustrate that the resulting construction funnels the agent safely along the chain of cells from the starting point to the target.</description>

      <title>Outage Identification from Electricity Market Data: Quickest Change Detection Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power system outages expose market participants to significant financial risk unless promptly detected and hedged. We develop an outage identification method from public market signals grounded in the parametric quickest change detection (QCD) theory. Parametric QCD operates on stochastic data streams, distinguishing pre- and post-change regimes using the ratio of their respective probability density functions. To derive the density functions for normal and post-outage market signals, we exploit multi-parametric programming to decompose complex market signals into parametric random variables with a known density. These densities are then used to construct a QCD-based statistic that triggers an alarm as soon as the statistic exceeds an appropriate threshold. Numerical experiments on a stylized PJM testbed demonstrate rapid line outage identification from public streams of electricity demand and price data.</description>

      <title>Resilient Hierarchical Power Control for Hybrid GFL/GFM Microgrids Under Mixed Cyber-Attacks and Physical Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid microgrids integrating Grid-Following (GFL) and Grid-Forming (GFM) inverters present complex control challenges arising from the decoupling between long-term economic dispatch and real-time dynamic regulation, as well as the distinct physical limitations of heterogeneous inverters under cyber uncertainties. This paper proposes a Resilient Hierarchical Power Control (RHPC) strategy to unify these conflicting requirements within a cohesive framework. A standardized power increment mechanism is developed to bridge the tertiary and secondary layers, ensuring that real-time load fluctuations are compensated strictly according to the optimal economic ratios derived from the tertiary layer. To address the strict active power saturation constraints of GFL units, a dynamic activation scheme coupled with projection operators is introduced, which actively isolates saturated nodes from the consensus loop to prevent integrator wind-up and preserve the stability of the GFM backbone. Furthermore, the proposed framework incorporates a multi-scale attention mechanism and LSTM-based predictors into the secondary control protocol, endowing the system with robustness against unbounded False Data Injection (FDI) attacks and packet losses. Rigorous theoretical analysis confirms that the system achieves Uniformly Ultimately Bounded (UUB) convergence, and simulations on a modified IEEE 33-bus system demonstrate that the proposed strategy significantly improves power sharing accuracy and operational resilience in both grid-connected and islanded modes compared to conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Research on Adaptive Inertial Control in Synchronization Systems: Based on Variational Optimization Methods and Their Applications in the Stability of Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13753v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aiming at the core problem that it is difficult for a fixed inertia coefficient to balance transient disturbance suppression and long-term stability in complex network synchronization systems, an adaptive inertia control strategy based on variational optimization is proposed. Taking the Kuramoto model with inertia as the research carrier, the analytical expression of the time-varying inertia coefficient M(t) is strictly derived by the functional variational method, and a hierarchical control structure of "benchmark inertia + disturbance feedback" is constructed to achieve the organic unity of minimizing the vulnerability performance function H(T) and stability constraints. A multimodal decoupling control strategy based on Laplacian eigenvector projection is designed to enhance the feedback strength of the dominant mode by eigenvalue weighting, improving the control accuracy and dynamic response speed. Simulation verification is carried out in complex network systems, and the control performance of regular networks (RG), random networks (ER), small-world networks (SW), scale-free networks (SF) and spider webs (SP) under three typical disturbances of pulses, monotonic decays and oscillatory decays is systematically analyzed. The results show that the proposed strategy reduces H(T) of the five networks by 19%-25%, shortens the relaxation time by 15%-24%, and the real parts of all system eigenvalues are less than -0.25s^-1 , meeting the asymptotic stability criterion. This study provides a new theoretical framework and engineering implementation scheme for the stability control of complex network synchronization systems, which can be widely applied to fields such as power grids, communication networks, and neural networks.</description>

      <title>Linear viscoelastic rheological FrBD models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [1], a new modeling paradigm for developing rate-and-state-dependent, control-oriented friction models was introduced. The framework, termed Friction with Bristle Dynamics (FrBD), combines nonlinear analytical expressions for the friction coefficient with constitutive equations for bristle-like elements. Within the FrBD framework, this letter introduces two novel formulations based on the two most general linear viscoelastic models for solids: the Generalized Maxwell (GM) and Generalized Kelvin-Voigt (GKV) elements. Both are analyzed in terms of boundedness and passivity, revealing that these properties are satisfied for any physically meaningful parametrization. An application of passivity for control design is also illustrated, considering an example from robotics. The findings of this letter systematically integrate rate-and-state dynamic friction models with linear viscoelasticity.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communication for Low-Altitude Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dense concentration of low-altitude, slow-speed, and small-size targets in the complex low-altitude environment poses significant security challenges, including failures in continuous wide-area sensing and ambiguous target intent, which existing regulatory frameworks struggle to address. Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), a hallmark of next-generation mobile communication, offers a transformative approach to low-altitude security governance. By leveraging existing cellular infrastructure and spectrum resources, ISAC enables the construction of a seamless wide-area sensing network, supports intelligent feature extraction and intent inference, facilitates real-time collaborative decision-making, and establishes a dynamic trust authentication framework. This article systematically reviews the technical system, analyzes the security challenges, forecasts the enabling value of ISAC, and discusses the resulting open problems and challenges, thereby laying a foundation for future research and industrial implementation.</description>

      <title>Base Station Sleeping Strategy Based on Load Sharing in Ultra-Dense Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the issues of high operational costs and low energy efficiency (EE) caused by the dense deployment of small base stations (s-BSs) in 5G ultra-dense networks (UDNs), this paper first constructs a multi-objective mathematical optimization model targeting maximizing EE and minimizing the number of active BSs. The model incorporates key constraints including BS operational state, user equipment (UE)-BS connection relationship, and load threshold, laying a theoretical foundation for the coordinated optimization of energy conservation and quality of service. Based on this model, an integrated solution combining UE-BS initial connection optimization and load-sharing based BS sleeping is proposed. In the initial connection phase, with communication quality and BS load as dual constraints, efficient matching between UEs and optimal BSs is achieved through three sequential steps: communication feasibility screening, redundant connection removal, and overload load redistribution. This resolves the problems of load imbalance and difficult identification of redundant BSs in UDNs arising from unordered initial connections. In the BS sleeping phase, a BS sleeping index, comprehensively considering UE transferability and backup BS resources, is innovatively introduced to quantify BS dormancy priority. Through a closed-loop process involving low-load BS screening, adjacent BS load evaluation, and load sharing by two takeover BSs based on their capacity, accurate dormancy of redundant BSs and collaborative load migration are realized. Simulation results in a typical UDNs scenario demonstrate that, compared with the traditional baseline scheme, the proposed solution exhibits significant advantages in convergence speed, optimization of the number of active BSs, and EE improvement.</description>

      <title>Small Models, Big Impact: Tool-Augmented AI Agents for Wireless Network Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT promise revolutionary capabilities for Sixth-Generation (6G) wireless networks but their massive computational requirements and tendency to generate technically incorrect information create deployment barriers. In this work, we introduce MAINTAINED: autonomous artificial intelligence agent for wireless network deployment. Instead of encoding domain knowledge within model parameters, our approach orchestrates specialized computational tools for geographic analysis, signal propagation modeling, and network optimization. In a real-world case study, MAINTAINED outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs including ChatGPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and DeepSeek-R1 by up to 100-fold in verified performance metrics while requiring less computational resources. This paradigm shift, moving from relying on parametric knowledge towards externalizing domain knowledge into verifiable computational tools, eliminates hallucination in technical specifications and enables edge-deployable Artificial Intelligence (AI) for wireless communications.</description>

      <title>Where to Place a Heavy Payload on a Multirotor UAV for Best Control Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the impact of rigidly attached heavy payload placement - where the payload mass significantly influences the UAV's dynamics - on the stability and control performance of a multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In particular, we focus on how the position of such a payload relative to the vehicle's Center of Gravity (CoG) affects the stability and control performance at an arbitrary point of interest on the UAV, such as the payload position, and on how this position can be optimized. Our conclusions are based on two key contributions. First, we analyze the stability of the zero-dynamics of a complete nonlinear model of the UAV with payload. We demonstrate that the stability of the zero dynamics depends on the vertical signed distance in the body-fixed frame between the controlled output position and the combined CoG of the UAV with payload. Specifically, positioning the output below the CoG yields unstable zero dynamics, while the linearized zero dynamics are marginally stable when placing it above, indicating reduced sensitivity to input disturbances. Second, we analyze the performance of the linearized UAV model with payload by providing an analytical expression for the H2-norm, from which we can quantify the system's attenuation to white noise input disturbances. We conclude that less control authority leads to a higher optimal position of the controlled output with respect to the CoG for closed-loop white-noise disturbance rejection capabilities, also when the heavy payload is the controlled output. The results are illustrated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Safe Output Regulation of Strict-Feedback Linear Systems with Input Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a data-driven safe control framework for linear systems possessing a known strict-feedback structure, but with most plant parameters, external disturbances, and input delay being unknown. By leveraging Koopman operator theory, we utilize Krylov dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to extract the system dynamics from measured data, enabling the reconstruction of the system and disturbance matrices. Concurrently, the batch least-squares identification (BaLSI) method is employed to identify other unknown parameters in the input channel. Using control barrier functions (CBFs) and backstepping, we first develop a full-state safe controller. Based on this, we build an output-feedback controller by performing system identification using only the output data and actuation signals as well as constructing an observer to estimate the unmeasured plant states. The proposed approach achieves: 1) finite-time identification of a substantial set of unknown system quantities, and 2) exponential convergence of the output state (the state furthest from the control input) to a reference trajectory while rigorously ensuring safety constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a safe vehicle platooning application.</description>

      <title>A flexible language model-assisted electronic design automation framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming electronic design automation (EDA) by enhancing design stages such as schematic design, simulation, netlist synthesis, and place-and-route. Existing methods primarily focus these optimisations within isolated open-source EDA tools and often lack the flexibility to handle multiple domains, such as analogue, digital, and radio-frequency design. In contrast, modern systems require to interface with commercial EDA environments, adhere to tool-specific operation rules, and incorporate feedback from design outcomes while supporting diverse design flows. We propose a versatile framework that uses LLMs to generate files compatible with commercial EDA tools and optimise designs using power-performance-area reports. This is accomplished by guiding the LLMs with tool constraints and feedback from design outputs to meet tool requirements and user specifications. Case studies on operational transconductance amplifiers, microstrip patch antennas, and FPGA circuits show that the framework is effective as an EDA-aware assistant, handling diverse design challenges reliably.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Interference Cognition on the Reliability and Capacity of Industrial Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interference significantly impacts the performance of industrial wireless networks, particularly n severe interference environments with dense networks reusing spectrum resources intensively. Although delicate interference information is often unavailable in conventional networks, emerging interference cognition techniques can compensate this critical problem with possibly different precision. This paper investigates the relationship between precision of interference cognition and system performance. We propose a novel performance analysis framework that quantifies the impact of varying interference information precision on achievable rate.
  Specifically, leveraging the Nakagami-$\mathbf{m}$ fading channel model, we analytically and asymptotically analyze the average achievable rate in the finite blocklength regime for different precision levels of signal and interference information. Our findings reveal the critical importance of identifying per-link interference information for achieving optimal performance. Additionally, obtaining instantaneous information is more beneficial for signal links.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A core abstraction in early Unix systems was the principle that 'everything is a file', enabling heterogeneous devices and kernel resources to be manipulated via uniform read/write interfaces. This paper explores how an analogous unification is emerging in contemporary agentic AI. We trace the evolution from Unix to DevOps, Infrastructure-as-Code, and finally autonomous software agents, highlighting how file-like abstractions and code-based specifications collapse diverse resources into consistent, composable interfaces. The resulting perspective suggests that adopting file- and code-centric interaction models may enable agentic systems that are more maintainable, auditable, and operationally robust.</description>

Abstract: In a time-slotted system, we study the problem of scheduling multipartite entanglement requests in a quantum switch with a finite number of quantum memory registers. Specifically, we consider probabilistic link-level entanglement (LLE) generation for each user, probabilistic entanglement swapping, and one-slot decoherence. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheduling policies, we introduce a novel age-based metric, coined age of entanglement establishment (AoEE). We consider two families of low-complexity policies for which we obtain closed-form expressions for their corresponding AoEE performance. Optimizing over each family, we obtain two policies. Further, we propose one more low-complexity policy and provide its performance guarantee. Finally, we numerically compare the performance of the proposed policies.</description>

      <title>Optimal Thruster Configuration for 6-DOF Control of a Small Satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing deployment of small satellites (such as CubeSats, Nanosats, Picosats, and Femtosats) in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) for targeted applications like imaging, communication, data storage, and rendezvous-docking mission, there is increasing attention on orbit maintenance and attitude control. A common approach for active orbit control involves the use of multiple thrusters, which, when properly arranged, can also generate the required torque for attitude control. Starting from a 24-thruster configuration, this paper presents a set of thruster configurations (referred to as a viable configuration group) that enable full six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) control. Further, configuration group that requires minimum total thrust to achieve 6-DOF commands are found among the viable configuration group. One configuration from each of these groups is further evaluated for its attitude control performance through a representative rendezvous-docking mission, demonstrating that even with a reduced thruster count, sufficient maneuverability can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Three Dimensional Hydrodynamic Flow-Based Collision Avoidance for UAV Formations Facing Emergent Dynamic Obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a three-dimensional, hydrodynamics-inspired collision avoidance framework for uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) formations operating in dynamic environments. When moving obstacles enter a UAV's sensing region, they are modeled as three dimensional doublets or ellipsoids that generate local velocity fields, guiding nearby UAVs to execute smooth, collision-free maneuvers without trajectory discontinuities or explicit trajectory replanning. This flow-based approach enables real-time operation and interpretable behavior by leveraging the nature of fluid flow around obstacles via the harmonic properties of Laplace's equation, inherently avoiding local minima common in traditional potential field methods. To establish and maintain coordination among the UAVs, a Virtual Rigid Body (VRB) formation strategy is integrated, ensuring that formation geometry and trajectory tracking are preserved. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of the method for both individual and multi-UAV scenarios with multiple formation geometries encountering moving obstacles. The proposed approach achieves safe, smooth, and computationally efficient avoidance maneuvers suitable for real-time and practical applications.</description>

      <title>AI for Green Spaces: Leveraging Autonomous Navigation and Computer Vision for Park Litter Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are 50 billion pieces of litter in the U.S. alone. Grass fields contribute to this problem because picnickers tend to leave trash on the field. We propose building a robot that can autonomously navigate, identify, and pick up trash in parks. To autonomously navigate the park, we used a Spanning Tree Coverage (STC) algorithm to generate a coverage path the robot could follow. To navigate this path, we successfully used Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS, which provides a centimeter-level reading every second. For computer vision, we utilized the ResNet50 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which detects trash with 94.52% accuracy. For trash pickup, we tested multiple design concepts. We select a new pickup mechanism that specifically targets the trash we encounter on the field. Our solution achieved an overall success rate of 80%, demonstrating that autonomous trash pickup robots on grass fields are a viable solution.</description>

      <title>Kernel-Based Learning of Safety Barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid integration of AI algorithms in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and healthcare is raising significant concerns about the ability to meet stringent safety standards. Traditional tools for formal safety verification struggle with the black-box nature of AI-driven systems and lack the flexibility needed to scale to the complexity of real-world applications. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach for safety verification and synthesis of black-box systems with discrete-time stochastic dynamics. We employ the concept of control barrier certificates, which can guarantee safety of the system, and learn the certificate directly from a set of system trajectories. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data from the system into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and construct an RKHS ambiguity set that can be inflated to robustify the result to out-of-distribution behavior. We provide the theoretical results on how to apply the approach to general classes of temporal logic specifications beyond safety. For the data-driven computation of safety barriers, we leverage a finite Fourier expansion to cast a typically intractable semi-infinite optimization problem as a linear program. The resulting spectral barrier allows us to leverage the fast Fourier transform to generate the relaxed problem efficiently, offering a scalable yet distributionally robust framework for verifying safety. Our work moves beyond restrictive assumptions on system dynamics and uncertainty, as demonstrated on two case studies including a black-box system with a neural network controller.</description>

      <title>Robust Verification of Concurrent Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12003v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous systems often operate in multi-agent settings and need to make concurrent, strategic decisions, typically in uncertain environments. Verification and control problems for these systems can be tackled with concurrent stochastic games (CSGs), but this model requires transition probabilities to be precisely specified - an unrealistic requirement in many real-world settings. We introduce *robust CSGs* and their subclass *interval CSGs* (ICSGs), which capture epistemic uncertainty about transition probabilities in CSGs. We propose a novel framework for *robust* verification of these models under worst-case assumptions about transition uncertainty. Specifically, we develop the underlying theoretical foundations and efficient algorithms, for finite- and infinite-horizon objectives in both zero-sum and nonzero-sum settings, the latter based on (social-welfare optimal) Nash equilibria. We build an implementation in the PRISM-games model checker and demonstrate the feasibility of robust verification of ICSGs across a selection of large benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Feedback for Handheld Tool Guidance: Combining Wrist-Based Haptics with Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how vibrotactile wrist feedback can enhance spatial guidance for handheld tool movement in optical see-through augmented reality (AR). While AR overlays are widely used to support surgical tasks, visual occlusion, lighting conditions, and interface ambiguity can compromise precision and confidence. To address these challenges, we designed a multimodal system combining AR visuals with a custom wrist-worn haptic device delivering directional and state-based cues. A formative study with experienced surgeons and residents identified key tool maneuvers and preferences for reference mappings, guiding our cue design. In a cue identification experiment (N=21), participants accurately recognized five vibration patterns under visual load, with higher recognition for full-actuator states than spatial direction cues. In a guidance task (N=27), participants using both AR and haptics achieved significantly higher spatial precision (5.8 mm) and usability (SUS = 88.1) than those using either modality alone, despite having modest increases in task time. Participants reported that haptic cues provided reassuring confirmation and reduced cognitive effort during alignment. Our results highlight the promise of integrating wrist-based haptics into AR systems for high-precision, visually complex tasks such as surgical guidance. We discuss design implications for multimodal interfaces supporting confident, efficient tool manipulation.</description>

      <title>Automated Angular Received-Power Characterization of Embedded mmWave Transmitters Using Geometry-Calibrated Spatial Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an automated measurement methodology for angular received-power characterization of embedded millimeter-wave transmitters using geometry-calibrated spatial sampling. Characterization of integrated mmWave transmitters remains challenging due to limited angular coverage and alignment variability in conventional probe-station techniques, as well as the impracticality of anechoic-chamber testing for platform-mounted active modules. To address these challenges, we introduce RAPTAR, an autonomous measurement system for angular received-power acquisition under realistic installation constraints. A collaborative robot executes geometry-calibrated, collision-aware hemispherical trajectories while carrying a calibrated receive probe, enabling controlled and repeatable spatial positioning around a fixed device under test. A spectrum-analyzer-based receiver chain acquires amplitude-only received power as a function of angle and distance following quasi-static pose stabilization. The proposed framework enables repeatable angular received-power mapping and power-domain comparison against idealized free-space references derived from full-wave simulation. Experimental results for a 60-GHz radar module demonstrate a mean absolute received-power error below 2 dB relative to simulation-derived references and a 36.5 % reduction in error compared to manual probe-station measurements, attributed primarily to reduced alignment variability and consistent spatial sampling. The proposed method eliminates the need for coherent field measurements and near-field transformations, enabling practical power-domain characterization of embedded mmWave modules. It is well suited for angular validation in real-world platforms where conventional anechoic measurements are impractical.</description>

      <title>Resource-Conscious RL Algorithms for Deep Brain Stimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has proven to be a promising treatment of Parkinson's Disease (PD). DBS involves stimulating specific regions of the brain's Basal Ganglia (BG) using electric impulses to alleviate symptoms of PD such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Although most clinical DBS approaches today use a fixed frequency and amplitude, they suffer from side effects (such as slurring of speech) and shortened battery life of the implant. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been used in recent research to perform DBS in a more adaptive manner to improve overall patient outcome. These RL algorithms are, however, too complex to be trained in vivo due to their long convergence time and requirement of high computational resources.
  We propose a new Time &amp; Threshold-Triggered Multi-Armed Bandit (T3P MAB) RL approach for DBS that is more effective than existing algorithms. Further, our T3P agent is lightweight enough to be deployed in the implant, unlike current deep-RL strategies, and even forgoes the need for an offline training phase. Additionally, most existing RL approaches have focused on modulating only frequency or amplitude, and the possibility of tuning them together remains greatly unexplored in the literature. Our RL agent can tune both frequency and amplitude of DBS signals to the brain with better sample efficiency and requires minimal time to converge. We implement an MAB agent for DBS for the first time on hardware to report energy measurements and prove its suitability for resource-constrained platforms. Our T3P MAB algorithm is deployed on a variety of microcontroller unit (MCU) setups to show its efficiency in terms of power consumption as opposed to other existing RL approaches used in recent work.</description>

      <title>Spatial-VLN: Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation With Explicit Spatial Perception and Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in generalization but suffer from insufficient spatial perception. Focusing on complex continuous environments, we categorize key perceptual bottlenecks into three spatial challenges: door interaction,multi-room navigation, and ambiguous instruction execution, where existing methods consistently suffer high failure rates. We present Spatial-VLN, a perception-guided exploration framework designed to overcome these challenges. The framework consists of two main modules. The Spatial Perception Enhancement (SPE) module integrates panoramic filtering with specialized door and region experts to produce spatially coherent, cross-view consistent perceptual representations. Building on this foundation, our Explored Multi-expert Reasoning (EMR) module uses parallel LLM experts to address waypoint-level semantics and region-level spatial transitions. When discrepancies arise between expert predictions, a query-and-explore mechanism is activated, prompting the agent to actively probe critical areas and resolve perceptual ambiguities. Experiments on VLN-CE demonstrate that Spatial VLN achieves state-of-the-art performance using only low-cost LLMs. Furthermore, to validate real-world applicability, we introduce a value-based waypoint sampling strategy that effectively bridges the Sim2Real gap. Extensive real-world evaluations confirm that our framework delivers superior generalization and robustness in complex environments. Our codes and videos are available at https://yueluhhxx.github.io/Spatial-VLN-web/.</description>

      <title>Imitation learning-based spacecraft rendezvous and docking method with Expert Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing spacecraft rendezvous and docking control methods largely rely on predefined dynamic models and often exhibit limited robustness in realistic on-orbit environments. To address this issue, this paper proposes an Imitation Learning-based spacecraft rendezvous and docking control framework (IL-SRD) that directly learns control policies from expert demonstrations, thereby reducing dependence on accurate modeling. We propose an anchored decoder target mechanism, which conditions the decoder queries on state-related anchors to explicitly constrain the control generation process. This mechanism enforces physically consistent control evolution and effectively suppresses implausible action deviations in sequential prediction, enabling reliable six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) rendezvous and docking control. To further enhance stability, a temporal aggregation mechanism is incorporated to mitigate error accumulation caused by the sequential prediction nature of Transformer-based models, where small inaccuracies at each time step can propagate and amplify over long horizons. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed IL-SRD framework achieves accurate and energy-efficient model-free rendezvous and docking control. Robustness evaluations further confirm its capability to maintain competitive performance under significant unknown disturbances.

      <title>Exploiting Light To Enhance The Endurance and Navigation of Lighter-Than-Air Micro-Drones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micro-Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are rapidly expanding into tasks from inventory to environmental sensing, yet their short endurance and unreliable navigation in GPS-denied spaces limit deployment. Lighter-Than-Air (LTA) drones offer an energy-efficient alternative: they use a helium envelope to provide buoyancy, which enables near-zero-power drain during hovering and much longer operation. LTAs are promising, but their design is complex, and they lack integrated solutions to enable sustained autonomous operations and navigation with simple, low-infrastructure.
  We propose a compact, self-sustaining LTA drone that uses light for both energy harvesting and navigation. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a high-fidelity simulation framework to analyze LTA aerodynamics and select a stable, efficient configuration; (ii) a framework to integrate solar cells on the envelope to provide net-positive energy; and (iii) a point-and-go navigation system with three light-seeking algorithms operating on a single light beacon.
  Our LTA-analysis, together with the integrated solar panels, not only saves energy while flying, but also enables sustainable operation: providing 1 minute of flying time for every 4 minutes of energy harvesting, under illuminations of 80klux. We also demonstrate robust single-beacon navigation towards a light source that can be up to 7m away, in indoor and outdoor environments, even with moderate winds. The resulting system indicates a plausible path toward persistent, autonomous operation for indoor and outdoor monitoring. More broadly, this work provides a practical pathway for translating the promise of LTA drones into a persistent, self-sustaining aerial system.</description>

Abstract: Intent-based networks (IBNs) are gaining prominence as an innovative technology that automates network operations through high-level request statements, defining what the network should achieve. In this work, we introduce IntAgent, an intelligent intent LLM agent that integrates NWDAF analytics and tools to fulfill the network operator's intents. Unlike previous approaches, we develop an intent tools engine directly within the NWDAF analytics engine, allowing our agent to utilize live network analytics to inform its reasoning and tool selection. We offer an enriched, 3GPP-compliant data source that enhances the dynamic, context-aware fulfillment of network operator goals, along with an MCP tools server for scheduling, monitoring, and analytics tools. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework through two practical use cases: ML-based traffic prediction and scheduled policy enforcement, which validate IntAgent's ability to autonomously fulfill complex network intents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a financial liquidity policy sharing method for firm-to-firm supply networks, introducing a scalable autonomous control function for viable complex adaptive supply networks. Cooperation and competition in supply chains is reconciled through overlapping collaborative sets, making firms interdependent and enabling distributed risk governance. How cooperative range - visibility - affects viability is studied using dynamic complex adaptive systems modelling. We find that viability needs cooperation; visibility and viability grow together in scale-free supply networks; and distributed control, where firms only have limited partner information, outperforms centralised control. This suggests that policy toward network viability should implement distributed supply chain financial governance, supporting interfirm collaboration, to enable autonomous control.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Navigation at the Nano-Scale: Algorithms, Architectures, and Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous navigation for nano-scale unmanned aerial vehicles (nano-UAVs) is governed by extreme Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constraints (with the weight &lt; 50 g and sub-100 mW onboard processor), distinguishing it fundamentally from standard robotic paradigms. This review synthesizes the state-of-the-art in sensing, computing, and control architectures designed specifically for these sub- 100mW computational envelopes. We critically analyse the transition from classical geometry-based methods to emerging "Edge AI" paradigms, including quantized deep neural networks deployed on ultra-low-power System-on-Chips (SoCs) and neuromorphic event-based control. Beyond algorithms, we evaluate the hardware-software co-design requisite for autonomy, covering advancements in dense optical flow, optimized Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), and learning-based flight control. While significant progress has been observed in visual navigation and relative pose estimation, our analysis reveals persistent gaps in long-term endurance, robust obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments, and the "Sim-to-Real" transfer of reinforcement learning policies. This survey provides a roadmap for bridging these gaps, advocating for hybrid architectures that fuse lightweight classical control with data-driven perception to enable fully autonomous, agile nano-UAVs in GPS-denied environments.</description>

      <title>On the Relation of State Space Models and Hidden Markov Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are foundational frameworks for modeling sequential data with latent variables and are widely used in signal processing, control theory, and machine learning. Despite their shared temporal structure, they differ fundamentally in the nature of their latent states, probabilistic assumptions, inference procedures, and training paradigms. Recently, deterministic state space models have re-emerged in natural language processing through architectures such as S4 and Mamba, raising new questions about the relationship between classical probabilistic SSMs, HMMs, and modern neural sequence models.
  In this paper, we present a unified and systematic comparison of HMMs, linear Gaussian state space models, Kalman filtering, and contemporary NLP state space models. We analyze their formulations through the lens of probabilistic graphical models, examine their inference algorithms -- including forward-backward inference and Kalman filtering -- and contrast their learning procedures via Expectation-Maximization and gradient-based optimization. By highlighting both structural similarities and semantic differences, we clarify when these models are equivalent, when they fundamentally diverge, and how modern NLP SSMs relate to classical probabilistic models. Our analysis bridges perspectives from control theory, probabilistic modeling, and modern deep learning.</description>

      <title>Distribution-Free Confidence Ellipsoids for Ridge Regression with PAC Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linearly parametrized models are widely used in control and signal processing, with the least-squares (LS) estimate being the archetypical solution. When the input is insufficiently exciting, the LS problem may be unsolvable or numerically unstable. This issue can be resolved through regularization, typically with ridge regression. Although regularized estimators reduce the variance error, it remains important to quantify their estimation uncertainty. A possible approach for linear regression is to construct confidence ellipsoids with the Sign-Perturbed Sums (SPS) ellipsoidal outer approximation (EOA) algorithm. The SPS EOA builds non-asymptotic confidence ellipsoids under the assumption that the noises are independent and symmetric about zero. This paper introduces an extension of the SPS EOA algorithm to ridge regression, and derives probably approximately correct (PAC) upper bounds for the resulting region sizes. Compared with previous analyses, our result explicitly show how the regularization parameter affects the region sizes, and provide tighter bounds under weaker excitation assumptions. Finally, the practical effect of regularization is also demonstrated via simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Control policies for a two-stage queueing system with parallel and single server options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a two-stage tandem service queue attended by two servers. Each job-server pair must complete both service phases together, with the server unable to begin a new job until the current one is fully processed after two stages. Immediately after the first phase of service, the server decides whether to send the job/customer to a downstream station that allows parallel processing or to a single-service facility that offers faster or higher-quality service but handles only one job at a time. This choice determines whether the second phase commences immediately or (potentially) after waiting in a queue for the single-service facility to become available.
  The decision-making scenario is modeled via a Markov decision process formulation, of a clearing system with holding costs at each station. We fully characterize the structural properties of an optimal control policy based on the relationship between the service rates at the downstream stations. A numerical study highlights the significance of optimal control by comparing its performance against several natural heuristic policies.</description>

      <title>Balancing Independent and Collaborative Service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a two-type server queueing system where flexible Type-I servers, upon their initial interaction with jobs, decide in real time whether to process them independently or in collaboration with dedicated Type-II servers. Independent processing begins immediately, as does collaborative service if a Type-II server is available. Otherwise, the job and its paired Type-I server wait in queue for collaboration. Type-I servers are non-preemptive and cannot engage with new jobs until their current job is completed.
  We provide a complete characterization of the structural properties of the optimal policy for the clearing system. In particular, an optimal control is shown to follow a threshold structure based on the number of jobs in the queue before a Type-I first interaction and on the number of jobs in either independent or collaborative service.
  We propose simple threshold heuristics, based on linear approximations, for real-time decision-making. In much of the parameter and state spaces, we establish theoretical bounds that compare the thresholds proposed by our heuristics to those of optimal policies and identify parameter configurations where these bounds are attained. Outside of these regions, the optimal thresholds are infinite. Numerical experiments further demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our heuristics, particularly when the initial queue length is high. Our proposed heuristics achieve costs within 0.5% of the optimal policy on average and significantly outperform benchmark policies that exhibit extreme sensitivity to system parameters, sometimes incurring costs exceeding 100% of the optimal.</description>

      <title>Distributed Coverage Control on Poriferous Surface via Poly-Annulus Conformal Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inherent non-convexity of poriferous surfaces typically entraps agents in local minima and complicates workload distribution. To resolve this, we propose a distributed diffeomorphic coverage control framework for the multi-agent system (MAS) in such surfaces. First, we establish a distributed poly-annulus conformal mapping that transforms arbitrary poriferous surfaces into a multi-hole disk. Leveraging this topological equivalence, a collision-free sectorial partition mechanism is designed in the multi-hole disk, which rigorously induces strictly connected subregions and workload balance on the poriferous surfaces. This mechanism utilizes a buffer-based sequence mechanism to ensure strict topological safety when bypassing obstacles. Furthermore, a pull-back Riemannian metric is constructed to define the length metric that encodes safety constraints. Based on this metric, a distributed gradient-based control law is synthesized to drive agents toward optimal configurations, ensuring simultaneous obstacle avoidance and coverage optimization. Theoretical analyses guarantee the Input-to-State Stability (ISS) of the partition dynamics and the asymptotic convergence of the closed-loop system. Numerical simulations confirm the reachability and robustness of the proposed coverage algorithm, offering a scalable solution for distributed coverage in poriferous surfaces.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the flexible RIM Hand, a biomimetic robotic hand that precisely replicates the carpometacarpal (CMC) joints and employs superelastic Nitinol wires throughout its skeletal framework. By modeling the full carpal-to-metacarpal anatomy, the design enables realistic palm deformation through tendon-driven fingers while enhancing joint restoration and supports skeletal structure with Nitinol-based dorsal extensors. A flexible silicone skin further increases contact friction and contact area, enabling stable grasps for diverse objects. Experiments show that the palm can deform up to 28%, matching human hand flexibility, while achieving more than twice the payload capacity and three times the contact area compared to a rigid palm design. The RIM Hand thus offers improved dexterity, compliance, and anthropomorphism, making it promising for prosthetic and service-robot applications.</description>

      <title>A Blockchain-Oriented Software Engineering Architecture for Carbon Credit Certification Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon credit systems have emerged as a policy tool to incentivize emission reductions and support the transition to clean energy. Reliable carbon-credit certification depends on mechanisms that connect actual, measured renewable-energy production to verifiable emission-reduction records. Although blockchain and IoT technologies have been applied to emission monitoring and trading, existing work offers limited support for certification processes, particularly for small and medium-scale renewable installations. This paper introduces a blockchain-based carbon-credit certification architecture, demonstrated through a 100 kWp photovoltaic case study, that integrates real-time IoT data collection, edge-level aggregation, and secure on-chain storage on a permissioned blockchain with smart contracts. Unlike approaches focused on trading mechanisms, the proposed system aligns with European legislation and voluntary carbon-market standards, clarifying the practical requirements and constraints that apply to photovoltaic operators. The resulting architecture provides a structured pathway for generating verifiable carbon-credit records and supporting third-party verification.</description>

      <title>Optimal Calibration of the endpoint-corrected Hilbert Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate, low-latency estimates of the instantaneous phase of oscillations are essential for closed-loop sensing and actuation, including (but not limited to) phase-locked neurostimulation and other real-time applications. The endpoint-corrected Hilbert transform (ecHT) reduces boundary artefacts of the Hilbert transform by applying a causal narrow-band filter to the analytic spectrum. This improves the phase estimate at the most recent sample. Despite its widespread empirical use, the systematic endpoint distortions of ecHT have lacked a principled, closed-form analysis. In this study, we derive the ecHT endpoint operator analytically and demonstrate that its output can be decomposed into a desired positive-frequency term (a deterministic complex gain that induces a calibratable amplitude/phase bias) and a residual leakage term setting an irreducible variance floor. This yields (i) an explicit characterisation and bounds for endpoint phase/amplitude error, (ii) a mean-squared-error-optimal scalar calibration (c-ecHT), and (iii) practical design rules relating window length, bandwidth/order, and centre-frequency mismatch to residual bias via an endpoint group delay. The resulting calibrated ecHT achieves near-zero mean phase error and remains computationally compatible with real-time pipelines.

      <description>arXiv:2601.14075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Query-based sampling has become an increasingly popular technique for monitoring Markov sources in pull-based update systems. However, most of the contemporary literature on this assumes an exponential distribution for query delay and often relies on the assumption that the feedback or replies to the queries are instantaneous. In this work, we relax both of these assumptions and find optimal sampling policies for monitoring continuous-time Markov chains (CTMC) under generic delay distributions. In particular, we show that one can obtain significant gains in terms of mean binary freshness (MBF) by employing a waiting based strategy for query-based sampling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel safety filter framework that ensures both safety and the preservation of the legacy control action within a nominal region. This modular design allows the safety filter to be integrated into the control hierarchy without compromising the performance of the existing legacy controller during nominal operation. For a control-affine system, this is accomplished by formulating multiple Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and Control Lyapunov-like Functions (CLFs) conditions, alongside a forward invariance condition for the legacy controller, as sum-of-squares constraints. Additionally, the state-dependent inequality constraints of the resulting Quadratic Program (QP) -- encoding the CBF and CLF conditions -- are designed to remain inactive within the nominal region, ensuring preservation of the legacy control action and performance. Our safety filter design is also the first to include quadratic input constraints, and does not need an explicit specification of the attractor, as it is implicitly defined by the legacy controller. To avoid the chattering effect and guarantee the uniqueness and Lipschitz continuity of solutions, the state-dependent inequality constraints of the Quadratic Program are selected to be regular. Finally, we demonstrate the method in a detailed case study involving the control of a three-phase ac/dc power converter.</description>

      <title>Barrier Integral Control for Global Asymptotic Tracking of Uncertain Nonlinear Systems under State and Input Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of asymptotic tracking for high-order control-affine MIMO nonlinear systems with unknown dynamic terms subject to input and transient state constraints. We introduce Barrier Integral Control (BRIC), a novel algorithm designed to confine the system's state within a predefined funnel, ensuring adherence to the transient state constraints, and asymptotically drive it to a given reference trajectory from any initial condition. The algorithm leverages the innovative integration of a reciprocal barrier function and error-integral terms, featuring smooth feedback control. We further develop an extension of the algorithm, entailing continuous feedback, that uses a reference-modification technique to account for the input-saturation constraints. Notably, BRIC operates without relying on any information or approximation schemes for the (unknown) dynamic terms, which, unlike a large class of previous works, are not assumed to be bounded or to comply with globally Lipschitz/growth conditions. Additionally, the system's trajectory and asymptotic performance are decoupled from the uncertain model, control-gain selection, and initial conditions. Finally, comparative simulation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Online Smoother with Closed-Form Solutions and Information-Theoretic Lag Selection for Conditional Gaussian Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) combines partial observations with dynamical models to improve state estimation. Filter-based DA uses only past and present data and is the prerequisite for real-time forecasts. Smoother-based DA exploits both past and future observations. It aims to fill in missing data, provide more accurate estimations, and develop high-quality datasets. However, the standard smoothing procedure requires using all historical state estimations, which is storage-demanding, especially for high-dimensional systems. This paper develops an adaptive-lag online smoother for a large class of complex dynamical systems with strong nonlinear and non-Gaussian features, which has important applications to many real-world problems. The adaptive lag allows the utilization of observations only within a nearby window, thus reducing computational complexity and storage needs. Online lag adjustment is essential for tackling turbulent systems, where temporal autocorrelation varies significantly over time due to intermittency, extreme events, and nonlinearity. Based on the uncertainty reduction in the estimated state, an information criterion is developed to systematically determine the adaptive lag. Notably, the mathematical structure of these systems facilitates the use of closed analytic formulae to calculate the online smoother and adaptive lag, avoiding empirical tunings as in ensemble-based DA methods. The adaptive online smoother is applied to studying three important scientific problems. First, it helps detect online causal relationships between state variables. Second, the advantage of reduced computational storage expenditure is illustrated via Lagrangian DA, a high-dimensional nonlinear problem. Finally, the adaptive smoother advances online parameter estimation with partial observations, emphasizing the role of the observed extreme events in accelerating convergence.</description>

      <title>The value of hedging against energy storage uncertainties when designing energy parks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15416v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy storage is needed to match renewable generation to industrial loads in energy parks. However, the future performance of bulk storage technologies is currently highly uncertain. Due to the urgency of decarbonization targets, energy park projects must be designed and begun now. But, as uncertainty in storage performance reduces, a different technology than identified during initial design may turn out cheaper. Enabling flexibility so that design adaptations can be made as better information becomes available would lower the cost of decarbonizing industry. But having this flexibility is itself costly. This raises the question, "Is it worth it?"
  This study quantifies the benefit of retaining flexibility to adapt energy park designs and optionality over storage technology choice as uncertainty reduces, to determine whether it is economically worthwhile. It applies the Value of Information analysis framework to the sizing of wind, solar, and storage in an illustrative energy park model based on a real-world proposal near Rotterdam, considering uncertainty in storage efficiency, lifetime, and capital cost.
  Updating asset sizings after storage uncertainty reduced is found to reduce total costs by 18% on average. Having the option to switch storage technology choice as well reduces costs by a further 13%, which is substantially greater than the cost of providing storage optionality. Using two storage technologies in the energy park reduces costs by 14%, and in this case storage optionality is not worthwhile. These results are robust to the level of uncertainty reduction in storage performance, and the risk aversion of the system designer.</description>

      <title>Tube-Based Robust Control Strategy for Vision-Guided Autonomous Vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A robust control strategy for autonomous vehicles can improve system stability, enhance riding comfort, and prevent driving accidents. This paper presents a novel interpolation-tube-based constrained iterative linear quadratic regulator (itube-CILQR) algorithm for autonomous computer-vision-based vehicle lane-keeping. The goal of the algorithm is to enhance robustness during high-speed cornering on tight turns. Compared with standard tube-based approaches, the proposed itube-CILQR algorithm reduces system conservatism and exhibits higher computational speed. Numerical simulations and vision-based experiments were conducted to examine the feasibility of using the proposed algorithm for controlling autonomous vehicles. The results indicated that the proposed algorithm achieved superior vehicle lane-keeping performance to variational CILQR-based methods and model predictive control (MPC) approaches involving the use of a classical interior-point optimizer. Specifically, itube-CILQR required an average runtime of 3.45 ms to generate a control signal for guiding a self-driving vehicle. By comparison, itube-MPC typically required a 4.32 times longer computation time to complete the same task. Moreover, the influence of conservatism on system behavior was investigated by exploring the variations in the interpolation variables derived using the proposed itube-CILQR algorithm during lane-keeping maneuvers.</description>

      <title>Stabilization by Controllers Having Integer Coefficients</title>

Abstract: The system property of ``having integer coefficients,'' that is, a transfer function has an integer monic polynomial as its denominator, is significant in the field of encrypted control as it is required for a dynamic controller to be realized over encrypted data. This paper shows that there always exists a controller with integer coefficients stabilizing a given discrete-time linear time-invariant plant. A constructive algorithm to obtain such a controller is provided, along with numerical examples. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to converting a pre-designed controller to have integer coefficients, while the original performance is preserved in the sense that the transfer function of the closed-loop system remains unchanged.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Bidirectional Inverter Equivalent Circuit Model for Distribution Grid Steady-State Analysis and Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03430v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a \textit{physics-based} steady-state equivalent circuit model of a two-stage bidirectional inverter. These inverters connect distributed energy resources (DERs), such as photovoltaic (PV) and battery systems, to distribution grids. Existing inverter models have technical gaps on three fronts: i) inadequate modeling of inverter losses; ii) use of mathematical abstractions for bidirectional flow of power; and iii) inability to integrate different control modes into nonlinear solvers without loss of generality. We propose a physics-first model that explicitly captures losses in passive circuit components based on circuit-level principles. We enable bidirectional power flow without binary or complementarity constraints by formulating loss terms as smooth, sign-aware expressions of current. We introduce and parameterize controlled current sources with twice-differentiable continuous functions to enable inverter control modes without loss of generality. We integrate DERs with the proposed inverter model at the load buses of distribution networks to perform power flow and optimization studies on real-world distribution networks with over 20,000 nodes. We demonstrate that the proposed model is more accurate, integrates seamlessly with various control modes without loss of generality, and scales robustly to large optimization problems.
  Index Terms: bidirectional inverter model, circuit-based modeling, DERs, inverter efficiency, power control, steady-state analysis.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Hybrid Modeling: Incremental Identification and Model Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mathematical models are crucial for optimizing and controlling chemical processes, yet they often face significant limitations in terms of computational time, algorithm complexity, and development costs. Hybrid models, which combine mechanistic models with data-driven models (i.e. models derived via the application of machine learning to experimental data), have emerged as a promising solution to these challenges. However, the identification of dynamic hybrid models remains difficult due to the need to integrate data-driven models within mechanistic model structures.
  We present an incremental identification approach for dynamic hybrid models that decouples the mechanistic and data-driven components to overcome computational and conceptual difficulties. Our methodology comprises four key steps: (1) regularized dynamic parameter estimation to determine optimal time profiles for flux variables, (2) correlation analysis to evaluate relationships between variables, (3) data-driven model identification using advanced machine learning techniques, and (4) hybrid model integration to combine the mechanistic and data-driven components. This approach facilitates early evaluation of model structure suitability, accelerates the development of hybrid models, and allows for independent identification of data-driven components.
  Three case studies are presented to illustrate the robustness, reliability, and efficiency of our incremental approach in handling complex systems and scenarios with limited data.</description>

      <title>A predictive modular approach to constraint satisfaction under uncertainty -- with application to glycosylation in continuous monoclonal antibody biosimilar production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16803v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper proposes a modular-based approach to constraint handling in process optimization and control. This is partly motivated by the recent interest in learning-based methods, e.g., within bioproduction, for which constraint handling under uncertainty is a challenge. The proposed constraint handler, called predictive filter, is combined with an adaptive constraint margin and a constraint violation cost monitor to minimize the cost of violating soft constraints due to model uncertainty and disturbances. The module can be combined with any controller and is based on minimally modifying the controller output, in a least squares sense, such that constraints are satisfied within the considered horizon. The proposed method is computationally efficient and suitable for real-time applications. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated through a realistic case study of glycosylation constraint satisfaction in continuous monoclonal antibody biosimilar production using Chinese hamster ovary cells, employing a metabolic network model consisting of 23 extracellular metabolites and 126 reactions. In the case study, the average constraint-violation cost is reduced by more than 60% compared to the case without the proposed constraint-handling method.</description>

      <title>Safe Navigation under State Uncertainty: Online Adaptation for Robust Control Barrier Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurements and state estimates are often imperfect in control practice, posing challenges for safety-critical applications, where safety guarantees rely on accurate state information. In the presence of estimation errors, several prior robust control barrier function (R-CBF) formulations have imposed strict conditions on the input. These methods can be overly conservative and can introduce issues such as infeasibility, high control effort, etc. This work proposes a systematic method to improve R-CBFs, and demonstrates its advantages on a tracked vehicle that navigates among multiple obstacles. A primary contribution is a new optimization-based online parameter adaptation scheme that reduces the conservativeness of existing R-CBFs. In order to reduce the complexity of the parameter optimization, we merge several safety constraints into one unified numerical CBF via Poisson's equation. We further address the dual relative degree issue that typically causes difficulty in vehicle tracking. Experimental trials demonstrate the overall performance improvement of our approach over existing formulations.</description>

      <title>Accurate Small-Signal Modeling of Digitally Controlled Buck Converters with ADC-PWM Synchronization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00943v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital control has become increasingly widespread in modern power electronic converters. When acquiring feedback signals such as the inductor current, synchronizing the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with the digital pulse-width modulator (DPWM) is commonly employed to accurately track their steady-state average. However, the small-signal implications of such synchronization have not been investigated. This paper presents an exact small-signal model for digitally controlled buck converters operating in forced continuous-conduction mode (FCCM) under constant-frequency current-mode control, explicitly accounting for DPWM-ADC synchronization. Using a sampled-data framework, the proposed model captures all sideband effects introduced by the sampling process, yielding precise predictions of both analog and digital loop gains, even at frequencies beyond the switching and sampling frequencies. Both asymmetrical and symmetrical carrier modulations are considered. Furthermore, the digital loop gain is derived in closed form using the modified z-transform, enabling low-complexity compensator design and stability assessment. Within this framework, the analog loop gain can be directly obtained from the digital loop gain, thereby eliminating the need for computationally intensive infinite series evaluations. The validity of the proposed model is confirmed through both simulation and experimental results.</description>

      <title>Blockage-Aware Multi-RIS WSR Maximization via Per-RIS Indexed Synchronization Sequences and Closed-Form Riemannian Updates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) multi-user MIMO systems are highly vulnerable to blockage, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have been proposed as a remedy. However, RIS links may themselves be blocked, while most prior works assume ideal RIS availability. We propose an end-to-end blockage-aware multi-RIS weighted sum-rate (WSR) optimization framework. The BS transmits short per-RIS indexed synchronization signals, enabling each user to identify blocked panels through a simple energy detection test. Based on the detected feasible sets, we jointly optimize the BS precoder and RIS phases via a Closed-form Riemannian Phase Alignment (CRPA) algorithm. CRPA provides unit-modulus-preserving closed-form updates, requiring no projection or line search, and ensures monotone ascent. Simulations validate reliable blockage detection and notable WSR and convergence gains over existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Retail electricity costs and emissions incentives are misaligned for commercial and industrial power consumers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrification is contributing to substantial growth in U.S. commercial and industrial loads, but the cost and Scope 2 carbon emission implications of this load growth are opaque for both power consumers and utilities. This work describes a unique spatiotemporally resolved data set of U.S. electricity costs and emissions and applies time series approximation methods to quantify the alignment of electricity cost and emission incentives for large commercial and industrial consumers. We present a comprehensive spatiotemporal dataset of U.S. price-based demand response (i.e., tariff) and incentive-based demand response programs, enabling direct comparison to previously published marginal emission factor, average emission factor, and day-ahead market prices. We resolved the structural incompatibility and fragmentation of these datasets by developing time series approximations of discrete data and unifying geospatially heterogeneous datasets. Analysis of these datasets reveals significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in cost and carbon emissions incentives for demand-side energy flexibility, underscoring the importance of site selection as a key factor influencing power costs and Scope 2 emissions. Analysis also reveals broad misalignment of economic and emissions incentives under existing electricity tariff structures, meaning tariffs are incentivizing consumption of more carbon-intensive electricity, and highlighting potential barriers to electrification delivering carbon savings.</description>

Abstract: The highly anticipated 'Battle of the Water Networks' is back with a new challenge for the water community. This competition will be hosted at the 4th International Joint Conference on Water Distribution Systems Analysis and Computing and Control in the Water Industry (WDSA/CCWI 2026), taking place in Paphos, Cyprus, from May 18-21, 2026. This competition embodies the core mission of Water-Futures and the theme for WDSA/CCWI 2026: "Designing the next generation of urban water (and wastewater) systems."
  The objective is to design and operate a water distribution system over a long-term horizon under deep uncertainty, with interventions applied in stages. For the first time, this challenge features a staged-design approach, unobservable and unknown uncertainties, and incorporates elements of policymaking and artificial intelligence. The solutions will be assessed using a transparent and inspectable open-source evaluation framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control is a sampling-based optimization method that has recently attracted attention, particularly in the robotics and reinforcement learning communities. MPPI has been widely applied as a GPU-accelerated random search method to deterministic direct single-shooting optimal control problems arising in model predictive control (MPC) formulations. MPPI offers several key advantages, including flexibility, robustness, ease of implementation, and inherent parallelizability. However, its performance can deteriorate in high-dimensional settings since the optimal control problem is solved via Monte Carlo sampling. To address this limitation, this paper proposes an enhanced MPPI method that incorporates a Jacobian reconstruction technique and the second-order Generalized Gauss-Newton method. This novel approach is called \textit{Gauss-Newton accelerated MPPI}. The numerical results show that the Gauss-Newton accelerated MPPI approach substantially improves MPPI scalability and computational efficiency while preserving the key benefits of the classical MPPI framework, making it a promising approach even for high-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>Formation and Investigation of Cooperative Platooning at the Early Stage of Connected and Automated Vehicles Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperative platooning, enabled by cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC), is a cornerstone technology for connected automated vehicles (CAVs), offering significant improvements in safety, comfort, and traffic efficiency over traditional adaptive cruise control (ACC). This paper addresses a key challenge in the initial deployment phase of CAVs: the limited benefits of cooperative platooning due to the sparse distribution of CAVs on the road. To overcome this limitation, we propose an innovative control framework that enhances cooperative platooning in mixed traffic environments. Two techniques are utilized: (1) a mixed cooperative platooning strategy that integrates CACC with unconnected vehicles (CACCu), and (2) a strategic lane-change decision model designed to facilitate safe and efficient lane changes for platoon formation. Additionally, a surrounding vehicle identification system is embedded in the framework to enable CAVs to effectively identify and select potential platooning leaders. Simulation studies across various CV market penetration rates (MPRs) show that incorporating CACCu systems significantly improves safety, comfort, and traffic efficiency compared to existing systems with only CACC and ACC systems, even at CV penetration as low as 10%. The maximized platoon formation increases by up to 24%, accompanied by an 11% reduction in acceleration and a 7% decrease in fuel consumption. Furthermore, the strategic lane-change model enhances CAV performance, achieving notable improvements between 6% and 60% CV penetration, without adversely affecting overall traffic flow.</description>

      <title>Validation methodology on real data of reversible Kalman Filter for state estimation with Manifold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work extends a previous study that introduced an algorithm for state estimation on manifolds within the framework of the Kalman filter. Its objective is to address the limitations of the earlier approach. The reversible Kalman filter was designed to provide a methodology for evaluating the accuracy of existing Kalman filter variants with arbitrary precision on synthetic data. It has favorable numerical properties on synthetic data, achieving arbitrary precision without relying on the small-velocity assumption and depending only on sensor noise. However, its application to real data encountered difficulties related to measurement noise, which was mitigated using a heuristic. In particular, the heuristic involved an event detection step switching between reversible Kalman filter and classical Kalman variant at chosen moments. In the present work, we propose a study of this detection step and propose a methodology to prove at which moment the reversible Kalman approach improves on classical multiplicative variant.</description>

      <title>Conditioning Aircraft Trajectory Prediction on Meteorological Data with a Physics-Informed Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate aircraft trajectory prediction (TP) in air traffic management systems is confounded by a number of epistemic uncertainties, dominated by uncertain meteorological conditions and operator specific procedures. Handling this uncertainty necessitates the use of probabilistic, machine learned models for generating trajectories. However, the trustworthiness of such models is limited if generated trajectories are not physically plausible. For this reason we propose a physics-informed approach in which aircraft thrust and airspeed are learned from data and are used to condition the existing Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) model, which is physics-based and enforces energy-based constraints on generated trajectories. A set of informative features are identified and used to condition a probabilistic model of aircraft thrust and airspeed, with the proposed scheme demonstrating a 20% improvement in skilfulness across a set of six metrics, compared against a baseline probabilistic model that ignores contextual information such as meteorological conditions.</description>

      <title>Current and temperature imbalances in parallel-connected grid storage battery modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key challenge with large battery systems is heterogeneous currents and temperatures in modules with parallel-connected cells. Although extreme currents and temperatures are detrimental to the performance and lifetime of battery cells, there is not a consensus on the scale of typical imbalances within grid storage modules. Here, we quantify these imbalances through simulations and experiments on an industrially representative grid storage battery module consisting of prismatic lithium iron phosphate cells, elucidating the evolution of current and temperature imbalances and their dependence on individual cell and module parameter variations. Using a sensitivity analysis, we find that varying contact resistances and cell resistances contribute strongly to temperature differences between cells, from which we define safety thresholds on cell-to-cell variability. Finally, we investigate how these thresholds change for different applications, to outline a set of robustness metrics that show how cycling at lower C-rates and narrower SOC ranges can mitigate failures.</description>

      <title>Invertibility Conditions for the Admittance Matrices of Balanced Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.04087v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The admittance matrix encodes the network topology and electrical parameters of a power system in order to relate the current injection and voltage phasors. Since admittance matrices are central to many power engineering analyses, their characteristics are important subjects of theoretical studies. This paper focuses on the key characteristic of \emph{invertibility}. Previous literature has presented an invertibility condition for admittance matrices. This paper first identifies and fixes a technical issue in the proof of this previously presented invertibility condition. This paper then extends this previous work by deriving new conditions that are applicable to a broader class of systems with lossless branches and transformers with off-nominal tap ratios.</description>

      <title>3D UAV Trajectory Design for Fair and Energy-Efficient Communication: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In different situations, like disaster communication and network connectivity for rural locations, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could indeed be utilized as airborne base stations to improve both the functionality and coverage of communication networks. Ground users can employ mobile UAVs to establish communication channels and deliver packages. UAVs, on the other hand, have restricted transmission capabilities and fuel supplies. They can't always cover the full region or continue to fly for a long time, especially in a huge territory. Controlling a swarm of UAVs to yield a relatively long communication coverage while maintaining connectivity and limiting energy usage is so difficult. We use modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for UAV connectivity to provide an innovative and extremely energy-efficient DRL-based algorithm. The proposed method: 1) enhances novel energy efficiency while taking into account communications throughput, energy consumption, fairness, and connectivity; 2) evaluates the environment and its dynamics; and 3) makes judgments using strong deep neural networks. For performance evaluation, we have performed comprehensive simulations. In terms of energy consumption and fairness, simulation results show that the DRL-based algorithm consistently outperforms two commonly used baseline techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, it is shown that every polynomial function is mixed monotone globally with a polynomial decomposition function. For univariate polynomials, the decomposition functions can be constructed from the Gram matrix representation of polynomial functions. The tightness of polynomial decomposition functions is discussed. Several examples are provided. An example is provided to show that polynomial decomposition functions, in addition to being global decomposition functions, can be much tighter than local decomposition functions constructed using local Jacobian bounds. Furthermore, an example is provided to demonstrate the application to reachable set over-approximation.</description>

      <title>Virtual Holonomic and Nonholonomic Constraints on Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a geometric framework for virtual constraints on Lie groups, with emphasis on mechanical systems modeled as affine connection systems. Virtual holonomic and virtual nonholonomic constraints, including linear and affine nonholonomic constraints, are formulated directly at the level of the Lie algebra and characterized as feedback--invariant manifolds. For each class of constraint, we establish existence and uniqueness conditions for enforcing feedback laws and show that the resulting closed--loop trajectories evolve as the dynamics of mechanical systems endowed with induced constrained connections, generalizing classical holonomic and nonholonomic reductions. Beyond stabilization, the framework enables the systematic generation of low--dimensional motion primitives on Lie groups by enforcing invariant, possibly affine, manifolds and shaping nontrivial dynamical regimes. The approach is illustrated through representative examples, including quadrotor UAVs and a rigid body with an internal rotor, where classical control laws are recovered as special cases and affine constraint--induced motion primitives are obtained.</description>

      <title>Fusion of Quadratic Time-Frequency Analysis and Convolutional Neural Networks to Diagnose Bearing Faults Under Time-Varying Speeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diagnosis of bearing faults is paramount to reducing maintenance costs and operational breakdowns. Bearing faults are primary contributors to machine vibrations, and analyzing their signal morphology offers insights into their health status. Unfortunately, existing approaches are optimized for controlled environments, neglecting realistic conditions such as time-varying rotational speeds and the vibration's non-stationary nature. This paper presents a fusion of time-frequency analysis and deep learning techniques to diagnose bearing faults under time-varying speeds and varying noise levels. First, we formulate the bearing fault-induced vibrations and discuss the link between their non-stationarity and the bearing's inherent and operational parameters. We also elucidate quadratic time-frequency distributions and validate their effectiveness in resolving distinctive dynamic patterns associated with different bearing faults. Based on this, we design a time-frequency convolutional neural network (TF-CNN) to diagnose various faults in rolling-element bearings. Our experimental findings undeniably demonstrate the superior performance of TF-CNN in comparison to recently developed techniques. They also assert its versatility in capturing fault-relevant non-stationary features that couple with speed changes and show its exceptional resilience to noise, consistently surpassing competing methods across various signal-to-noise ratios and performance metrics. Altogether, the TF-CNN achieves substantial accuracy improvements up to 15%, in severe noise conditions.</description>

      <title>Distribution Steering for Discrete-Time Uncertain Ensemble Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensemble systems appear frequently in many engineering applications and, as a result, they have become an important research topic in control theory. These systems are best characterized by the evolution of their underlying state distribution. Despite the work to date, few results exist dealing with the problem of directly modifying (i.e., ``steering'') the distribution of an ensemble system. In addition, in most existing results, the distribution of the states of an ensemble of discrete-time systems is assumed to be Gaussian. However, in case the system parameters are uncertain, it is not always realistic to assume that the distribution of the system follows a Gaussian distribution, thus complicating the solution of the overall problem. In this paper, we address the general distribution steering problem for first-order discrete-time ensemble systems, where the distributions of the system parameters and the states are arbitrary with finite first few moments. Linear system dynamics are considered using the method of power moments to transform the original infinite-dimensional problem into a finite-dimensional one. We also propose a control law for the ensuing moment system, which allows us to obtain the power moments of the desired control inputs. Finally, we solve the inverse problem to obtain the feasible control inputs from their corresponding power moments. We provide a numerical example to validate our theoretical developments.</description>

      <title>Towards a constructive framework for control theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a framework for control theory based on constructive analysis to account for discrepancy between mathematical results and their implementation in a computer, also referred to as computational uncertainty. In control engineering, the latter is usually either neglected or considered submerged into some other type of uncertainty, such as system noise, and addressed within robust control. However, even robust control methods may be compromised when the mathematical objects involved in the respective algorithms fail to exist in exact form and subsequently fail to satisfy the required properties. For instance, in general stabilization using a control Lyapunov function, computational uncertainty may distort stability certificates or even destabilize the system despite robustness of the stabilization routine with regards to system, actuator and measurement noise. In fact, battling numerical problems in practical implementation of controllers is common among control engineers. Such observations indicate that computational uncertainty should indeed be addressed explicitly in controller synthesis and system analysis. The major contribution here is a fairly general framework for proof techniques in analysis and synthesis of control systems based on constructive analysis which explicitly states that every computation be doable only up to a finite precision thus accounting for computational uncertainty. A series of previous works is overviewed, including constructive system stability and stabilization, approximate optimal controls, eigenvalue problems, Caratheodory trajectories, measurable selectors. Additionally, a new constructive version of the Danskin's theorem, which is crucial in adversarial defense, is presented.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Signal Detection with Unknown Bandwidths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09342v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Signal detection in environments with unknown signal bandwidth and time intervals is a fundamental problem in adversarial and spectrum-sharing scenarios. This paper addresses the problem of detecting signals occupying unknown degrees of freedom from non-coherent power measurements, where the signal is constrained to an interval in one dimension or a hyper-cube in multiple dimensions. A GLRT is derived, resulting in a straightforward metric involving normalized average signal energy for each candidate signal set. We present bounds on false alarm and missed detection probabilities, demonstrating their dependence on SNR and signal set sizes. To overcome the inherent computational complexity of exhaustive searches, we propose a computationally efficient binary search method, reducing the complexity from O(N^2) to O(N) for one-dimensional cases. Simulations indicate that the method maintains performance near exhaustive searches and achieves asymptotic consistency, with interval-of-overlap converging to one under constant SNR as measurement size increases. The simulation studies also demonstrate superior performance and reduced complexity compared to contemporary neural network-based approaches, specifically outperforming custom-trained U-Net models in spectrum detection tasks.</description>

      <title>$k$-Inductive and Interpolation-Inspired Barrier Certificates for Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce two new types of barrier certificates that are based on multiple functions rather than a single one. A conventional barrier certificate for a stochastic dynamical system is a nonnegative real-valued function whose expected value does not increase as the system evolves. This requirement guarantees that the barrier certificate forms a nonnegative supermartingale and can be used to derive a lower bound on the probability that the system remains safe. A key advantage of such certificates is that they can be automatically searched for using tools such as optimization programs instantiated with a fixed template. When this search is unsuccessful, the common practice is to modify the template and attempt the synthesis again. Drawing inspiration from logical interpolation, we first propose an alternative framework that uses a collection of functions to jointly serve as a barrier certificate. We refer to this construct as an interpolation-inspired barrier certificate. Nonetheless, we observe that these certificates still require one function in the collection to satisfy a supermartingale condition. Motivated by recent work in the literature, we next combine k-induction with interpolation-inspired certificates to relax this supermartingale constraint. We develop a general and more flexible notion of barrier certificates, which we call k-inductive interpolation-inspired barrier certificates. This formulation encompasses multiple ways of integrating interpolation-inspired barrier certificates with k-induction. We highlight two specific instantiations among these possible combinations. For polynomial systems, we employ sum-of-squares (SOS) programming to synthesize the corresponding set of functions. Finally, through our case studies, we show that the proposed methods enable the use of simpler templates and yield tighter lower bounds on the safety probability.</description>

      <title>AI-Native Open RAN for Non-Terrestrial Networks: An Overview</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11935v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-terrestrial network (NTN) is envisioned as a critical component of Sixth Generation (6G) networks by enabling ubiquitous services and enhancing network resilience. However, the inherent mobility and high-altitude operation of NTN pose significant challenges throughout the development and operations (DevOps) lifecycle. To address these challenges, integrating NTNs with the Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) is a promising approach, since ORAN can offer disaggregation, openness, virtualization, and embedded intelligence. Despite extensive literature on ORAN and NTN, a holistic view of ORAN-based NTN frameworks is still lacking, particularly regarding how ORAN can effectively address the existing challenges of NTN. Furthermore, although artificial intelligence native (AI-Native) capabilities have the potential to enhance intelligence network control and optimization, their practical realization in NTNs has not yet been sufficiently investigated. Therefore, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive and structured overview of AI-Native ORAN for NTN. This paper commences with an in-depth review of the existing literature and subsequently introduces the necessary background about ORAN, NTN, and AI-Native for communication. After analyzing the DevOps challenges for NTN, we propose the orchestrated AI-Native ORAN-based NTN framework and discuss its key technological enablers. Finally, we present the representative use cases and outline the prospective future research directions of this study.</description>

      <title>An Analytical and Experimental Study of Distributed Uplink Beamforming in the Presence of Carrier Frequency Offsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realizing distributed multi-user beamforming (D-MUBF) in time division duplex (TDD)-based multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) systems faces significant challenges. One of the most fundamental challenges is achieving accurate over-the-air (OTA) timing and frequency synchronization among distributed access points (APs), particularly due to residual frequency offsets caused by local oscillator (LO) drifts. Despite decades of research on synchronization for MU-MIMO, there are only a few experimental studies that evaluate D-MUBF techniques under imperfect frequency synchronization among distributed antennas. This paper presents an analytical and experimental assessment of D-MUBF methods in the presence of frequency synchronization errors. We provide closed-form expressions for signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) as a function of channel characteristics and statistical properties of carrier frequency offset (CFO) among AP antennas. In addition, through experimental evaluations conducted with the RENEW massive MIMO testbed, we collected comprehensive datasets across various experimental scenarios. These datasets comprise uplink pilot samples for channel and CFO estimation, in addition to uplink multi-user data intended for analyzing D-MUBF techniques. By examining these datasets, we assess the performance of D-MUBF in the presence of CFO and compare the analytical predictions with empirical measurements. Furthermore, we make the datasets publicly available and provide insights on utilizing them for future research endeavors.</description>

      <title>Can the Waymo Open Motion Dataset Support Realistic Behavioral Modeling? A Validation Study with Naturalistic Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for data-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its validity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary post-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of trajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately captures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations. Leveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV operations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across three representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized intersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging analysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure negligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we apply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically estimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to quantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show that behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably, WOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings suggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically underestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving. Caution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without proper validation against independently collected data.</description>

      <title>Robustness of quantum algorithms: Worst-case fidelity bounds and implications for design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Errors occurring on noisy hardware pose a key challenge to reliable quantum computing. Existing techniques such as error correction, mitigation, or suppression typically separate the error handling from the algorithm analysis and design. In this paper, we develop an alternative, algorithm-centered framework for understanding and improving the robustness against errors. For a given quantum algorithm and error model, we derive worst-case fidelity bounds which can be efficiently computed to certify the robustness. We consider general error models including coherent and (Markovian) incoherent errors and allowing for set-based error descriptions to address uncertainty or time-dependence in the errors. Our results give rise to guidelines for robust algorithm design and compilation by optimizing our theoretical robustness measure. We demonstrate the practicality of the framework with numerical results on algorithm analysis and robust optimization, including the robustness analysis of a 50-qubit modular adder circuit.</description>

      <title>Message passing-based inference in an autoregressive active inference agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the design of an autoregressive active inference agent in the form of message passing on a factor graph. Expected free energy is derived and distributed across a planning graph. The proposed agent is validated on a robot navigation task, demonstrating exploration and exploitation in a continuous-valued observation space with bounded continuous-valued actions. Compared to a classical optimal controller, the agent modulates action based on predictive uncertainty, arriving later but with a better model of the robot's dynamics.</description>

      <title>Anti-Jamming based on Beam-Steering Antennas and Intelligent UAV Swarm Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have brought a new true revolution to military tactics. While UAVs already constitute an advantage when operating alone, multi-UAV swarms expand the available possibilities, allowing the UAVs to collaborate and support each other as a team to carry out a given task. This entails the capability to exchange information related with situation awareness and action coordination by means of a suitable wireless communication technology. In such scenario, the adversary is expected to disrupt communications by jamming the communication channel. The latter becomes the Achilles heel of the swarm. While anti-jamming techniques constitute a well covered topic in the literature, the use of intelligent swarm behaviors to leverage those techniques is still an open research issue.
  This paper explores the use of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to jointly optimize UAV swarm formation, beam-steering antennas and traffic routing in order to mitigate the effect of jamming in the main coordination channel, under the assumption that a more robust and low data rate channel is used for formation management signaling. Simulation results show the effectiveness of proposed approach. However, the significant computational cost paves the way for further research.</description>

      <title>System Availability Optimization: Integrating Quantity Discounts and Delivery Lead Time Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: The model allocates the system components orders to the suppliers to minimize the parts price and the system construction delay penalties and maximize the system availability during its use. It considers the quantity-based discount and variation of delivery lead time by ordering similar components. The model also reflects the prerequisite relationships between construction activities and calculates the delay penalty resulting from parts delivery lead time. Design/methodology/approach: This research presents a model for selecting suppliers of components of an industrial series-parallel multi-state system. A nonlinear binary mathematical program uses the Markov process results to select system components. It minimizes the total system construction phase costs, including the components' price, and the system construction delay penalty, and the system exploitation phase costs, including the system shutdown and working at half capacity. Findings: The model allocates the optimal orders for a typical industrial system's components, composing four elements. The proposed approach combines the nonlinear binary program and the Markov process results to optimize the system life cycle parameters, including the system construction cost and operational availability. Originality/value: Using the Markov chain results in binary nonlinear mathematical programming, this study attempts to strike the right balance between the construction phase's objectives and an industrial unit's operation phase.</description>
