      <title>Anisotropic Anharmonicity Dictates the Thermal Conductivity of Gallium Oxide ($\beta-Ga_2O_3$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\beta-Ga_2O_3$ is a promising material candidate for next-generation high power devices even as its low thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) limits utilization due to an inability to sufficiently dissipate heat. Despite its importance, a significant discrepancy persists between experimental results and computational models regarding $\beta-Ga_2O_3$'s anisotropic thermal conductivity. Specifically, computational results are within experimental error bounds for $\kappa_{100}$ and $\kappa_{001}$ while underpredicting $\kappa_{010}$, suggesting that the bare phonon models used in literature are missing essential physics related to the anisotropic thermal transport. In response, we compute the anisotropic $\kappa$ using first-principles and the Pierels-Boltzmann transport equation (PBTE) under different approximations. For the simplest model, we consider the heat carriers to be harmonic phonons with scattering rates obtained perturbatively. These results are then compared to those obtained by including phonon renormalization and four-phonon scattering. Our results show that accounting for phonon renormalization resolves the discrepancy between experiment and theory. This is because phonon renormalization leads to an anisotropic $\kappa$ enhancement caused by directionally-dependent changes in the phonon group velocities accompanied by a general increase in phonon lifetime. Owing to the crucial role of these anharmonic interactions in accurately describing anisotropic thermal transport, we also explore the anharmonicity of individual atoms and show that the octahedrally-coordinated gallium atom is the most anharmonic and thus most likely responsible for the failure of the harmonic phonon model to describe thermal transport in this material. Finally, we demonstrate that atomic anharmonicities could be used as a useful metric to guide the tailoring of vibrational properties.</description>

      <title>Ferroaxial phonons in chiral and polar NiCo2TeO6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perfect circular dichroism has been observed in the Raman scattering by the optical phonons in single chiral domain NiCo2TeO6 crystals. The selection rules for the optical phonons are determined by the combination of the chiral structure C and the electric polarization P along the c-axis. These two symmetry operations are equivalent to the ferroaxial order (C dot P) = A, so the observed optical phonons are referred to as "ferroaxial". For a given Raman scattering geometry the observed effect may also be described as a complete non-reciprocal propagation of the optical phonons, whose preferable vector direction is determined by the sign of C dot P. The combination of Raman scattering and polarization plane rotation of the transmitted white light allows for identification of the direction of electric polarization P in mono domain chiral crystals.</description>

      <title>Instability of quadratic band degeneracies and the emergence of Dirac points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the Schr\"{o}dinger operator $H = -\Delta + V$, where the potential $V$ is real, $\mathbb{Z}^2$-periodic, and additionally invariant under the symmetry group of the square. We show that, under typical small linear deformations of $V$, the quadratic band degeneracy points occurring over the high-symmetry quasimomentum $\boldsymbol{M}$ (see [27, 28]) each split into two separated degeneracies over perturbed quasimomenta $\boldsymbol{D}^+$ and $\boldsymbol{D}^-$, and that these degeneracies are Dirac points. The local character of the degenerate dispersion surfaces about the emergent Dirac points are tilted, elliptical cones. Correspondingly, the dynamics of wavepackets spectrally localized near either $\boldsymbol{D}^+$ or $\boldsymbol{D}^-$ are governed by a system of Dirac equations with an advection term. Symmetry-breaking perturbations and induced band topology are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Gibbs Sampling gives Quantum Advantage at Constant Temperatures with O(1)-Local Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01516v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling from Gibbs states -- states corresponding to system in thermal equilibrium -- has recently been shown to be a task for which quantum computers are expected to achieve super-polynomial speed-up compared to classical computers, provided the locality of the Hamiltonian increases with the system size (Bergamaschi et al., arXiv: 2404.14639). We extend these results to show that this quantum advantage still occurs for Gibbs states of Hamiltonians with O(1)-local interactions at constant temperature by showing classical hardness-of-sampling and demonstrating such Gibbs states can be prepared efficiently using a quantum computer. In particular, we show hardness-of-sampling is maintained even for 5-local Hamiltonians on a 3D lattice. We additionally show that the hardness-of-sampling is robust when we are only able to make imperfect measurements.</description>
