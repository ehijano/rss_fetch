      <title>Theoretical and Empirical Validation of Heston Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on the application of the Heston model to option pricing, employing both theoretical derivations and empirical validations. The Heston model, known for its ability to incorporate stochastic volatility, is derived and analyzed to evaluate its effectiveness in pricing options. For practical application, we utilize Monte Carlo simulations alongside market data from the Crude Oil WTI market to test the model's accuracy. Machine learning based optimization methods are also applied for the estimation of the five Heston parameters. By calibrating the model with real-world data, we assess its robustness and relevance in current financial markets, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical finance models and their practical implementations.</description>

      <title>A Multi-agent Market Model Can Explain the Impact of AI Traders in Financial Markets -- A New Microfoundations of GARCH model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AI traders in financial markets have sparked significant interest in their effects on price formation mechanisms and market volatility, raising important questions for market stability and regulation. Despite this interest, a comprehensive model to quantitatively assess the specific impacts of AI traders remains undeveloped. This study aims to address this gap by modeling the influence of AI traders on market price formation and volatility within a multi-agent framework, leveraging the concept of microfoundations. Microfoundations involve understanding macroeconomic phenomena, such as market price formation, through the decision-making and interactions of individual economic agents. While widely acknowledged in macroeconomics, microfoundational approaches remain unexplored in empirical finance, particularly for models like the GARCH model, which captures key financial statistical properties such as volatility clustering and fat tails. This study proposes a multi-agent market model to derive the microfoundations of the GARCH model, incorporating three types of agents: noise traders, fundamental traders, and AI traders. By mathematically aggregating the micro-structure of these agents, we establish the microfoundations of the GARCH model. We validate this model through multi-agent simulations, confirming its ability to reproduce the stylized facts of financial markets. Finally, we analyze the impact of AI traders using parameters derived from these microfoundations, contributing to a deeper understanding of their role in market dynamics.</description>

      <title>Market Simulation under Adverse Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the effects of fill probabilities and adverse fills on the trading strategy simulation process. We specifically focus on a stochastic optimal control market-making problem and test the strategy on ES (E-mini S&amp;P 500), NQ (E-mini Nasdaq 100), CL (Crude Oil) and ZN (10-Year Treasury Note), which are some of the most liquid futures contract listed on the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange). We provide empirical evidence which shows how fill probabilities and adverse fills can significantly effect performance, and propose a more prudent simulation framework for dealing with this. Many previous works aim to measure different types of adverse selection in the limit order book, however, they often simulate price processes and market orders independently. This has the ability to largely inflate the performance of a short-term style trading strategy. Our studies show that using more realistic fill probabilities, and tracking adverse fills, in the strategy simulation process, more accurately portrays how these types of trading strategies would perform in reality.</description>

      <title>Concentrated Liquidity with Leverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concentrated liquidity (CL) provisioning is a way how to improve the capital efficiency of Automated Market Makers (AMM). Allowing liquidity providers to use leverage is a step towards even higher capital efficiency. A number of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols implement this technique in conjunction with overcollateralized lending. However, the properties of leveraged CL positions have not been formalized and are poorly understood in practice. This article describes the principles of a leveraged CL provisioning protocol, formally models the notions of margin level, assets, and debt, and proves that within this model, leveraged LP positions possess several properties that make them safe to use.</description>

      <title>Statistical Learning of Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.06476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of a two-step approach to learn a conditional value-at-risk (VaR) and a conditional expected shortfall (ES) using Rademacher bounds, in a non-parametric setup allowing for heavy-tails on the financial loss. Our approach for the VaR is extended to the problem of learning at once multiple VaRs corresponding to different quantile levels. This results in efficient learning schemes based on neural network quantile and least-squares regressions. An a posteriori Monte Carlo procedure is introduced to estimate distances to the ground-truth VaR and ES. This is illustrated by numerical experiments in a Student-$t$ toy model and a financial case study where the objective is to learn a dynamic initial margin.</description>

      <title>Fast and General Simulation of L\'evy-driven OU processes for Energy Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: L\'evy-driven Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes represent an intriguing class of stochastic processes that have garnered interest in the energy sector for their ability to capture typical features of market dynamics. However, in the current state of play, Monte Carlo simulations of these processes are not straightforward for two main reasons: i) algorithms are available only for some specific processes within this class; ii) they are often computationally expensive. In this paper, we introduce a new simulation technique designed to address both challenges. It relies on the numerical inversion of the characteristic function, offering a general methodology applicable to all L\'evy-driven OU processes. Moreover, leveraging FFT, the proposed methodology ensures fast and accurate simulations, providing a solid basis for the widespread adoption of these processes in the energy sector. Lastly, the algorithm allows an optimal control of the numerical error. We apply the technique to the pricing of energy derivatives, comparing the results with the existing benchmarks. Our findings indicate that the proposed methodology is at least one order of magnitude faster than the existing algorithms, while maintaining an equivalent level of accuracy.</description>
