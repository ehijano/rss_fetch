      <title>SMP Challenge: An Overview and Analysis of Social Media Prediction Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social Media Popularity Prediction (SMPP) is a crucial task that involves automatically predicting future popularity values of online posts, leveraging vast amounts of multimodal data available on social media platforms. Studying and investigating social media popularity becomes central to various online applications and requires novel methods of comprehensive analysis, multimodal comprehension, and accurate prediction.
  SMP Challenge is an annual research activity that has spurred academic exploration in this area. This paper summarizes the challenging task, data, and research progress. As a critical resource for evaluating and benchmarking predictive models, we have released a large-scale SMPD benchmark encompassing approximately half a million posts authored by around 70K users. The research progress analysis provides an overall analysis of the solutions and trends in recent years. The SMP Challenge website (www.smp-challenge.com) provides the latest information and news.</description>

      <title>MMoFusion: Multi-modal Co-Speech Motion Generation with Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The body movements accompanying speech aid speakers in expressing their ideas. Co-speech motion generation is one of the important approaches for synthesizing realistic avatars. Due to the intricate correspondence between speech and motion, generating realistic and diverse motion is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose MMoFusion, a Multi-modal co-speech Motion generation framework based on the diffusion model to ensure both the authenticity and diversity of generated motion. We propose a progressive fusion strategy to enhance the interaction of inter-modal and intra-modal, efficiently integrating multi-modal information. Specifically, we employ a masked style matrix based on emotion and identity information to control the generation of different motion styles. Temporal modeling of speech and motion is partitioned into style-guided specific feature encoding and shared feature encoding, aiming to learn both inter-modal and intra-modal features. Besides, we propose a geometric loss to enforce the joints' velocity and acceleration coherence among frames. Our framework generates vivid, diverse, and style-controllable motion of arbitrary length through inputting speech and editing identity and emotion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms current co-speech motion generation methods including upper body and challenging full body.</description>

      <title>Picking watermarks from noise (PWFN): an improved robust watermarking model against intensive distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital watermarking is the process of embedding secret information by altering images in an undetectable way to the human eye. To increase the robustness of the model, many deep learning-based watermarking methods use the encoder-noise-decoder architecture by adding different noises to the noise layer. The decoder then extracts the watermarked information from the distorted image. However, this method can only resist weak noise attacks. To improve the robustness of the decoder against stronger noise, this paper proposes to introduce a denoise module between the noise layer and the decoder. The module aims to reduce noise and recover some of the information lost caused by distortion. Additionally, the paper introduces the SE module to fuse the watermarking information pixel-wise and channel dimensions-wise, improving the encoder's efficiency. Experimental results show that our proposed method is comparable to existing models and outperforms state-of-the-art under different noise intensities. In addition, ablation experiments show the superiority of our proposed module.</description>

      <title>AsCL: An Asymmetry-sensitive Contrastive Learning Method for Image-Text Retrieval with Cross-Modal Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The image-text retrieval task aims to retrieve relevant information from a given image or text. The main challenge is to unify multimodal representation and distinguish fine-grained differences across modalities, thereby finding similar contents and filtering irrelevant contents. However, existing methods mainly focus on unified semantic representation and concept alignment for multi-modalities, while the fine-grained differences across modalities have rarely been studied before, making it difficult to solve the information asymmetry problem. In this paper, we propose a novel asymmetry-sensitive contrastive learning method. By generating corresponding positive and negative samples for different asymmetry types, our method can simultaneously ensure fine-grained semantic differentiation and unified semantic representation between multi-modalities. Additionally, a hierarchical cross-modal fusion method is proposed, which integrates global and local-level features through a multimodal attention mechanism to achieve concept alignment. Extensive experiments performed on MSCOCO and Flickr30K, demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.</description>
