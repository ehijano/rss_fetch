      <title>Nondegenerate Akhmediev breathers and abnormal frequency jumping in multicomponent nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear stage of higher-order modulation instability (MI) phenomena in the frame of multicomponent nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (NLSEs) are studied analytically and numerically. Our analysis shows that the $N$-component NLSEs can reduce to $N-m+1$ components, when $m(\leq N)$ wavenumbers of the plane wave are equal. As an example, we study systematically the case of three-component NLSEs which cannot reduce to the one- or two-component NLSEs. We demonstrate in both focusing and defocusing regimes, the excitation and existence diagram of a class of nondegenerate Akhmediev breathers formed by nonlinear superposition between several fundamental breathers with the same unstable frequency but corresponding to different eigenvalues. The role of such excitation in higher-order MI is revealed by considering the nonlinear evolution starting with a pair of unstable frequency sidebands. It is shown that the spectrum evolution expands over several higher harmonics and contains several spectral expansion-contraction cycles. In particular, abnormal unstable frequency jumping over the stable gaps between the instability bands are observed in both defocusing and focusing regimes. We outline the initial excitation diagram of abnormal frequency jumping in the frequency-wavenumber plane. We confirm the numerical results by exact solutions of multi-Akhmediev breathers of the multi-component NLSEs.</description>

      <title>Multi-hump Collapsing Solutions in the Nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger Problem: Existence, Stability and Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we examine multi-hump solutions of the nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation in the blowup regime of the one-dimensional model with power law nonlinearity, bearing a suitable exponent of $\sigma&gt;2$. We find that families of such solutions exist for arbitrary pulse numbers, with all of them bifurcating from the critical case of $\sigma=2$. Remarkably, all of them involve ``bifurcations from infinity'', i.e., the pulses come inward from an infinite distance as the exponent $\sigma$ increases past the critical point. The position of the pulses is quantified and the stability of the waveforms is also systematically examined in the so-called ``co-exploding frame''. Both the equilibrium distance between the pulse peaks and the point spectrum eigenvalues associated with the multi-hump configurations are obtained as a function of the blowup rate $G$ theoretically, and these findings are supported by detailed numerical computations. Finally, some prototypical dynamical scenarios are explored, and an outlook towards such multi-hump solutions in higher dimensions is provided.</description>

      <title>Optimal control for phase locking of synchronized oscillator populations via dynamical reduction techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for controlling the collective phase of a system of coupled oscillators described by the Kuramoto model under the influence of a periodic external input by combining the methods of dynamical reduction and optimal control. We employ the Ott-Antonsen ansatz and phase-amplitude reduction theory to derive a pair of one-dimensional equations for the collective phase and amplitude of mutually synchronized oscillators. We then use optimal control theory to derive the optimal input for controlling the collective phase based on the phase equation and evaluate the effect of the control input on the degree of mutual synchrony using the amplitude equation. We set up an optimal control problem for the system to quickly resynchronize with the periodic input after a sudden phase shift in the periodic input, a situation similar to jet lag, and demonstrate the validity of the framework through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem for random sets of solitons of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a random configuration of $N$ soliton solutions $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})$ of the cubic focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (fNLS) equation in one space dimension. The $N$ soliton solutions are parametrized by a $N$-dimension complex vector $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ whose entries are the eigenvalues of the Zakharov-Shabat linear spectral problem and by $N$ nonzero complex norming constants. The randomness is obtained by choosing the complex eigenvalues i.i.d. random variables sampled from a probability distribution with compact support on the complex plane. The corresponding norming constants are interpolated by a smooth function of the eigenvalues. Then we consider the Zakharov-Shabat linear problem for the expectation of the random measure associated to the spectral data. We denote the corresponding solution of the fNLS equation by $\psi_\infty(x,t)$. This solution can be interpreted as a soliton gas solution. We prove a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the differences $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})-\psi_\infty(x,t)$ and $|\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})|^2-|\psi_\infty(x,t)|^2$ when $(x,t)$ are in a compact set of $\mathbb R \times \mathbb R^+$; we additionally compute the correlation functions.</description>
