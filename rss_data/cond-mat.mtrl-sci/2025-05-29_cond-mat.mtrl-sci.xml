      <title>Curvature-Guided Mechanics and Design of Spinodal and Shell-Based Architected Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additively manufactured (AM) architected materials have enabled unprecedented control over mechanical properties of engineered materials. While lattice architectures have played a key role in these advances, they suffer from stress concentrations at sharp joints and bending-dominated behavior at high relative densities, limiting their mechanical efficiency. Additionally, high-resolution AM techniques often result in low-throughput or costly fabrication, restricting manufacturing scalability of these materials. Aperiodic spinodal architected materials offer a promising alternative by leveraging low-curvature architectures that can be fabricated through techniques beyond AM. Enabled by phase separation processes, these architectures exhibit tunable mechanical properties and enhanced defect tolerance by tailoring their curvature distributions. However, the relation between curvature and their anisotropic mechanical behavior remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to quantify the role of curvature in governing the anisotropic stiffness and strength of shell-based spinodal architected materials. We introduce geometric metrics that predict the distribution of stretching and bending energies under different loading conditions, bridging the gap between curvature in doubly curved shell-based morphologies and their mechanical anisotropy. We validate our framework through finite element simulations and microscale experiments, demonstrating its utility in designing mechanically robust spinodal architectures. This study provides fundamental insights into curvature-driven mechanics, guiding the optimization of next-generation architected materials for engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Neel temperature and unusual thermal expansion in flux-grown FeCrAs crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report results from our experimental investigation of the distorted-kagome compound FeCrAs. For this work, we developed a procedure using tin metal as a flux to produce needlelike crystals. The crystals were characterized by single crystal x-ray diffraction as well as measurements of magnetization, electrical transport, and heat capacity. The physical behaviors are generally similar to published results on crystals grown from a stoichiometric melt with two notable exceptions. The Sommerfeld coefficient is found to be 18 mJ/K2/mol, a little more than half of the previously reported value, and the Neel temperature is found to be 150 K, about 25K higher than in previous reports. The reason for these discrepancies are uncertain, but they may be related to differences in stoichiometry or disorder; it is expected that the Cr/Fe ratio has some variability in this compound. In addition, we find unusual thermal expansion behavior, with an anomaly at the Neel temperature and nearly temperature independent thermal expansion along the hexagonal c-axis above this transition. This suggests significant spin-lattice coupling, which may provide insight into non-metallic transport properties that have been associated with anomalous charge carrier scattering.</description>

      <title>Stoichiometry control and epitaxial growth of AgCrSe2 thin films by pulsed-laser deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on epitaxial growth in thin-film synthesis of a polar magnetic semiconductor AgCrSe2 on lattice-matched yttria-stabilized zirconia (111) substrate by pulsed-layer deposition (PLD). By using Ag-rich PLD target to compensate for Ag deficiency in thin films, the nucleation of impurity phases is suppressed, resulting in the c-axis-oriented and single-phase AgCrSe2 thin film. Structural analysis using x-ray diffraction and cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals epitaxial growth with the presence of both twisted and polar domains. Optical absorbance spectrum and magnetization measurements show absorption edge at around 0.84 eV and magnetic transition temperature at 41 K, respectively. These values are consistent with the reported values of direct bandgap and N\'eel temperature of bulk AgCrSe2, reflecting a single-phase and stoichiometric feature of the obtained film. Our demonstration of epitaxial thin-film growth of AgCrSe2 serves as a bedrock for exploration of its potential thermoelectric and spintronic functionalities at surface or heterointerfaces.</description>

      <title>Systematic generation of electron models for Second-Principles Density Functional Theory Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic, quasi-automated methodology for generating electronic models in the framework of second-principles density functional theory (SPDFT). This approach enables the construction of accurate and computationally efficient models by deriving all necessary parameters from first-principles calculations on a carefully designed training set. A key feature of our method is the enforcement of space group symmetries, which reduces both the number of independent parameters and the required computational effort. The formalism includes improved treatments of one-electron Hamiltonians, electron-lattice coupling-through both linear and quadratic terms-and electron-electron interactions, enabling accurate modeling of structural and electronic responses. We apply the methodology to SrTiO$_{3}$ and LiF, materials representative of transition-metal perovskites and wide-band-gap insulators, respectively. In both cases, the resulting models reproduce DFT reference data with high fidelity across various atomic configurations and charge states. Our results validate the robustness of the approach and highlight its potential for simulating complex phenomena such as polarons and excitons. This work lays the foundation for extending SPDFT to real-time simulations of optoelectronic properties and further integration with machine-learning methods.</description>

      <title>The experimental determination of exchange mass terms in surface states on both terminations of MnBi4Te7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic antiferromagnetic topological insulators in the Mn-Bi-Te family, composed of superlattice-like MnBi2Te4/(Bi2Te3)n (n = 0, 1, 2, 3...) layered structure, present intriguing states of matter such as quantum anomalous Hall effect and the axion insulator. However, the surface state gap, which is the prerequisite for the observation of these states, remains elusive. Here by molecular beam epitaxy, we obtain two types of MnBi4Te7 films with the exclusive Bi2Te3 (BT) or MnBi2Te4 (MBT) terminations. By scanning tunneling spectroscopy, the mass terms in the surface states are identified on both surface terminations. Experimental results reveal the existence of a hybridization gap of approximately 23 meV in surface states on the BT termination. This gap comes from the hybridization between the surface states and the spin-split states in the adjacent MBT layer. On the MBT termination, an exchange mass term of about 30 meV in surface states is identified by taking magnetic-field-dependent Landau level spectra as well as theoretical simulations. In addition, the mass term varies with the field in the film with a heavy BiMn doping level in the Mn layers. These findings demonstrate the existence of mass terms in surface states on both types of terminations in our epitaxial MnBi4Te7 films investigated by local probes.</description>

      <title>Influence of thickness on magnetic properties of RF-sputtered amorphous CoNbZr thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphous sputtered Co-based thin films are widely used as soft magnetic materials in applications such as sensors, inductors and magnetic flux concentrators. The magnetic properties of these films can be controlled by deposition parameters like film thickness, argon pressure, deposition rate and others. In this study, we present a detailed investigation of the magnetic properties of RF-sputtered Co$_{91}$Nb$_7$Zr$_2$ films with thicknesses ranging from 52 nm to 1040 nm. These amorphous films exhibit an average saturation magnetisation of 1.01(4) MA/m. As the film thickness increases, there is a significant decrease in coercivity, remanent-to-saturation magnetisation ratio M$_r$/M$_s$, and maximum permeability. The change in macroscopic magnetic properties is also reflected by the domain structure. At a thickness of 52 nm, the remanent domain state shows irregular domains, while films thicknesses above 208 nm exhibit flux-closure domain structures instead. The thickness-dependent modifications are attributed to the transition between N\'eel and Bloch type domain walls, which is expected to occur at approximately 84 nm.</description>

      <title>Modulation of Polarization and Metallicity in Janus Sliding Ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sliding ferroelectricity is emerging as a distinct and promising mechanism for realizing ferroelectricity in low-dimensional systems, offering new design principles beyond the conventional ferroelectric mechanism. Further, the coexistence of the out-of-plane polarization with in-plane conductivity induced by electrostatic charge doping makes these systems strong candidates for realizing ferroelectric metals. Using density functional theory calculations, we analyze the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) based Janus sliding ferroelectric bilayers XMY (M = Mo, W; X, Y = S, Se, Te; X $\neq$ Y). In addition to exhibiting switchable interlayer polarization, Janus sliding ferroelectrics possess an intrinsic electric field within each monolayer, arising from the electronegativity difference between the chalcogen atoms. We discover that the intrinsic electric field of the monolayers can be used to modulate the interlayer ferroelectric polarization and the electronic band structure. We identify the decrease in the interlayer distance due to a particular stacking of the Janus bilayers as a major contributor to increasing polarization and reducing the bandgap. The direction of the intrinsic electric field within the Janus monolayers plays a significant role in the modulation of layer-wise contribution in the valence and conduction bands, which influences the polarization reduction due to extrinsic charge dopants. Extending this concept to Janus trilayers, we observe further enhancement in polarization and additional bandgap reduction compared to their bilayer counterparts. These results highlight the tunability of TMD-based Janus sliding ferroelectrics and suggest a pathway for designing low bandgap ferroelectrics and potential ferroelectric metals.</description>

      <title>Indirect Magnetoelectric Coupling via Skew Scattering by Orbital Angular Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental observations of exchange bias in the La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$/LaAlO$_{3}$/SrTiO$_{3}$ heterostructure, which lacks an intrinsic antiferromagnetic layer, have sparked theoretical investigations into the underlying mechanisms. While traditional theories suggest that exchange bias in spin valve structures is mediated by conduction electrons in metallic spacers, the transport properties of LaAlO$3$ are dominated by its valence electrons, raising new questions about the origin of this phenomenon. In this work, we propose a theoretical model where the electronic band structure of LaAlO$_3$ is treated as a valence band perturbed by skew scattering, which is sensitive to orbital angular momentum. Our analysis reveals a significant magnetoelectric effect at the La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$/LaAlO$_3$ interface, which induces a coupling between the interface magnetization and the electric field from two dimensional electron gas at LaAlO$_{3}$/SrTiO$_{3}$ interface. This magnetoelectric coupling is found to drive the observed exchange bias, highlighting the role of electric polarization in influencing the magnetic properties of the heterostructure.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Diverse Topological States in Ge Doped MnBi2Te4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an ideal platform for studying interplays between symmetry, topology and magnetism, the magnetic topological insulator (MTI) MnBi2Te4 has attracted extensive attentions. However, its strong n-type intrinsic defects hinder the realizations of exotic phenomena. Stimulated by recent discoveries that Ge doping can efficiently tune the position of Fermi level, here we systematically investigate the band evolution and topological phase diagram with doping concentration from MTI MnBi2Te4 to strong topological insulator GeBi2Te4. Different from magnetically doped Bi2Se3, the topology here is determined by competition of two band inversions arising from band folding of two time-reversal invariant momenta between antiferromagnetic and nonmagnetic/ferromagnetic unit cells. By employing a band momentum mapping method, besides the known MTI phase, remarkably, we find two classes of magnetic Dirac semimetal phases at antiferromagnetic state, two classes of Weyl semimetal phases at ferromagnetic state, and an intermediate trivial state at different doping regions. Interestingly, the trivial state can be tuned into a Weyl phase with two coexisting band inversions and extraordinarily long Fermi arcs by a small strain. Our work reveals diverse topological states with intrinsic quantum phenomena can be achieved with great potential for designing future electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Weak valley-layer coupling and valley polarization in centrosymmetric $\mathrm{FeCl_2}$ monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the valley degree of freedom as a carrier of information for storage and processing, valley polarization plays a crucial role. A variety of mechanisms for valley polarization have been proposed, among which the valley-layer coupling mechanism involves the induction of valley polarization by an out-of-plane electric field. Here, through first-principles calculations, it is found that the weak valley-layer coupling can exist in centrosymmetric $\mathrm{FeCl_2}$ monolayer. It is crucial to note that valley-layer coupling only occurs with out-of-plane magnetization and vanishes with in-plane magnetization. Compared to monolayers with strong valley-layer coupling, $\mathrm{FeCl_2}$ requires an extremely strong electric field to achieve the same magnitude of valley splitting. Valley polarization switching can be achieved by manipulating the directions of magnetization and electric field. Reversing only one of these directions switches the valley polarization, whereas reversing both simultaneously leaves it unchanged. Moreover, the simply stacked bilayer $\mathrm{FeCl_2}$, as a $PT$-antiferromagnet, can spontaneously achieve valley polarization without an external electric field, highlighting its potential for miniaturization, ultradensity, and ultrafast performance. Our work provides guidelines for identifying materials with weak valley-layer coupling, and further enables the regulation of valley polarization through electric field and stacking engineering.</description>

      <title>Structural Hole Traps in III-V Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-toxic III-V quantum dots (QDs) are plagued with a higher density of performance-limiting trap states than II-VI and IV-VI QDs. Such trap states are generally understood to arise from under-coordinated atoms on the QD surface. Here, we present computational evidence for, and an exploration of, trap states in InP and GaP QDs that arise from fully-coordinated atoms with distorted geometries, denoted here as structural traps. In particular, we focus on the properties of anion-centered hole traps, which we show to be relatively insensitive to the choice of the (typically cation-coordinating) ligand. Through interpolation of trap center cutouts, we arrive at a simple molecular orbital (MO) argument for the existence of structural traps, finding two main modalities: bond stretches and angular distortion to a see-saw-like geometry. These structural trap states will be important for understanding the low performance of III-V QDs, as even core-shell passivation may not remove these defects unless they can rigidify the structure. Moreover, they may lead to interesting dynamical properties as distorted structures could form transiently.</description>

Abstract: Using time-resolved X-ray magnetic linear dichroism in reflection, we provide a direct probe of the N\'eel vector dynamics in TmFeO$_3$ on a ultrafast timescale. Our measurements reveal that, following optical excitation, the N\'eel vector undergoes a spin reorientation transition primarily within the a-c plane, completing a full 90{\deg} rotation within approximately 20 ps. This study highlights the ability to probe dynamics of antiferromagnets at its intrinsic timescale in reflection geometry, paving the way for investigations of a wide range of antiferromagnets grown on application relevant substrates.</description>

      <title>Raman Optical Activity Induced by Ferroaxial Order in $\textrm{NiTiO}_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Raman optical activity (ROA) -- the dependence of Raman scattered light intensity on the circular polarization of incident and scattered light -- has traditionally been associated with chiral molecules and magnetic materials. In this study, we demonstrate that ROA can also arise in ferroaxial materials that possess spatial inversion and time-reversal symmetries. Using circularly polarized Raman spectroscopy on single-crystalline $\textrm{NiTiO}_3$, we observed a pronounced ROA signal in the cross-circular polarization configuration, which correlates with the ferroaxial domain structure. Our symmetry analysis and tight-binding model calculations reveal that the natural ROA (NROA) originates from the ferroaxial order and persists even within the electric dipole approximation. These results establish ROA as a powerful probe of ferroaxial order in centrosymmetric systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced thermopower in two-dimensional ruthenium dichalcogenides $RuX_2$ (X = S, Se): a first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have garnered attention for their potential in thermoelectric applications due to their unique electronic properties and tunable bandgaps. In this study, we systematically explore the electronic and thermoelectric properties of $T^{\prime}-RuX_2$ (X = S, Se) using first-principles calculations and semi-classical Boltzmann transport equations. Our findings confirm that $T^{\prime}-RuX_2$ is energetically and mechanically stable, with high thermopower values such that $T^{\prime}-RuS_2$ exhibits a Seebeck coefficient of $2685~\mu V/K$ for hole doping and $2585~\mu V/K$ for electron doping, while $T^{\prime}-RuSe_2$ shows values of $1515~\mu V/K$ and $1533~\mu V/K$ for hole and electron doping, respectively. Both materials exhibit reasonable power factors and $ZT$ values, with p-type $T^{\prime}-RuS_2$ and $T^{\prime}-RuSe_2$ achieving maximum ZT values of 0.85 and 0.87, respectively, at 1200~K along the y-direction. These results highlight $T^{\prime}$-$RuS_2$ and $T^{\prime}$-$RuSe_2$ as promising candidates for high-temperature TMD-based thermoelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Observation of Coherent Ferrons</title>

Abstract: Excitation of ordered phases produces quasiparticles and collective modes, as exemplified by magnons that emerge from magnetic order, with applications in information transmission and quantum interconnects. Extending this paradigm to ferroelectric materials suggests the existence of ferrons, i.e. fundamental quanta of the collective excitation of ferroelectric order5 developed theoretically by Bauer and coworkers. While coherent magnons are observed in a broad range of experiments, coherent ferrons have eluded experimental detection. This discrepancy is particularly intriguing given that electric dipole interactions (FE) are inherently stronger than their magnetic counterparts. Here, we report the generation and transport of coherent ferrons in the van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectric material NbOI2. By launching collective oscillations of the ferroelectric dipoles using a short laser pulse, we identify coherent ferrons from intense and narrow-band terahertz (THz) emission and observe their propagations along the polar direction at extremely hypersonic velocities exceeding 10^5 m/s. The THz emission is a second-order nonlinear process that requires ferroelectric order, as is confirmed in the structurally related ferroelectric WO2Br2 and non-ferroelectric TaOBr2. The discovery of coherent ferrons paves the way for numerous applications, including narrow-band THz emission, ferronic information processing, and quantum interconnects.</description>

      <title>Lattice Compatibility and Energy Barriers in Intercalation Compounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a continuum model for symmetry-breaking phase transformations in intercalation compounds, based on Ericksen's multi-well energy formulation. The model predicts the nucleation and growth of crystallographic microstructures in Li$_{2}$Mn$_{2}$O$_{4}$ -- a representative intercalation compound -- with twin boundary orientations and volume fractions that closely match experimental observations. Our chemo-mechanically coupled model not only generates geometrically accurate microstructures through energy minimization, but also reveals a subtle interplay between twinned domains and electro-chemo-mechanical behavior. A key finding is that intercalation compounds satisfying specific compatibility conditions (e.g., $\lambda_{2} = 1$ or $|\det \mathbf{U} - 1| = 0)$ show lower elastic energy barriers, require smaller driving forces, and display narrower voltage hysteresis loops. Furthermore, we show that twinned domains act as conduits for fast Li-diffusion. These results establish quantitative design guidelines for intercalation compounds, which focuses on tailoring lattice deformations (rather than suppressing them) and reducing energy barriers to mitigate structural degradation and enhance the electrochemical performance of battery electrodes.</description>

      <title>Iterative Corpus Refinement for Materials Property Prediction Based on Scientific Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery and optimization of materials for specific applications is hampered by the practically infinite number of possible elemental combinations and associated properties, also known as the `combinatorial explosion'. By nature of the problem, data are scarce and all possible data sources should be used. In addition to simulations and experimental results, the latent knowledge in scientific texts is not yet used to its full potential. We present an iterative framework that refines a given scientific corpus by strategic selection of the most diverse documents, training Word2Vec models, and monitoring the convergence of composition-property correlations in embedding space. Our approach is applied to predict high-performing materials for oxygen reduction (ORR), hydrogen evolution (HER), and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions for a large number of possible candidate compositions. Our method successfully predicts the highest performing compositions among a large pool of candidates, validated by experimental measurements of the electrocatalytic performance in the lab. This work demonstrates and validates the potential of iterative corpus refinement to accelerate materials discovery and optimization, offering a scalable and efficient tool for screening large compositional spaces where reliable data are scarce or non-existent.</description>

      <title>Robust and Symmetric Magnetic Field Dependency of Superconducting Diode Effect in Asymmetric Dirac Semimetal SQUIDs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent demonstration of the superconducting diode effect (SDE) has generated renewed interests in superconducting electronics in which devices such as compact superconducting diodes that can perform signal rectification where low-energy operations are needed. In this article, we present our results of robust and symmetric-in-magnetic-field SDE in asymmetric superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) realized in high-quality Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 thin film grown by the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) technique. Consistent with previous work, a zero magnetic field SDE is observed. Furthermore, the difference in switching current is independent of the strength and polarity of an out-plane magnetic field in the range of -10 mT and 10 mT. We speculate that this robust symmetric-in-field SDE in our Dirac semimetal SQUIDs is due to the formation of helical spin texture, theoretically predicted in Dirac semimetals.</description>

      <title>Dual-Polarization SHG Interferometry for Imaging Antiparallel Domains and Stacking Angles of 2D Heterocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical second-harmonic generation (SHG) enables orientational polarimetry for crystallographic analysis and domain imaging of various materials. However, conventional intensity polarimetry, which neglects phase information, fails to resolve antiparallel domains and to describe two-dimensional heterostructures, which represent a new class of van der Waals-bound composite crystals. In this work, we report dual-polarization spectral phase interferometry (DP-SPI) and establish a generalized SHG superposition model that incorporates the observables of DP-SPI. Antiparallel domains of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) were successfully imaged with distinction, validating the interferometric polarimetry. From DP interferograms of TMD heterobilayers, the orientation of each layer could be determined, enabling layer-resolved probing. By employing the superposition model, we also demonstrate the photonic design and fabrication of ternary TMD heterostructures for circularly polarized SHG. These methods, providing comprehensive SHG measurements and theoretical description, can be extended to heterostructures consisting of more than two constituent layers and are not limited to TMDs or 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Modified Transfer Matrix Method for the Extraction of Material Properties via Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy is a powerful technique for extracting the low-frequency optical properties of materials. However, the optical constants are difficult to determine directly from the experimental transfer function, such that various numerical approximations must be implemented to describe specific conditions. Here, we introduce a modified Transfer Matrix Method that uses a genetic algorithm for optimization to determine the refractive index of materials in the THz regime. We show that this approach is generally applicable across a wide range of refractive indices, structures, and frequency ranges. Our method is intuitive and yields accurate results compared to leading methods across a wide spectral range (1-15 THz).</description>

Abstract: Ferromagnetic Weyl semimetals with Kagome lattice structures exhibit a strong coupling between magnetism and topological band features. Co3Sn2S2 is a prime example, showing a giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE) driven by Berry curvature from the Weyl nodes. We investigated the temperature and angular dependence of Hall conductivity in thick Co3Sn2S2 crystals, aiming to distinguish between topological and conventional magnetic contributions. Our measurements reveal a robust Hall response even at low magnetic fields and temperatures above 77 K, suggesting a dominant topological origin and weak sensitivity to external conditions.</description>

Abstract: Electrons in polar liquids give rise to a polaron resonance at a terahertz (THz) frequency \nu_0 depending on electron concentration. The impact of this resonance on light propagation is studied in experiments, where a femtosecond pump pulse generates electrons via multiphoton ionization and a THz probe pulse propagated through the excited sample is detected in a phase-resolved way. We observe a behavior characteristic for epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials with strongly modified phase and group velocities around \nu_0, and a broadening of the THz pulse envelope below \nu_0. Calculations based on a local-field approach reproduce the ENZ behavior.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear time-reversal symmetry breaking in kagome spin ice HoAgGe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome spin ice is an intriguing class of spin systems constituted by in-plane Ising spins with ferromagnetic interaction residing on the kagome lattice, theoretically predicted to host a plethora of magnetic transitions and excitations. In particular, different variants of kagome spin ice models can exhibit different sequences of symmetry breaking upon cooling from the paramagnetic to the fully ordered ground state. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the frustrated intermetallic HoAgGe stands as a faithful solid-state realization of kagome spin ice. Here we use single crystal neutron diffuse scattering to map the spin ordering of HoAgGe at various temperatures more accurately and surprisingly find that the ordering sequence appears to be different from previously known scenarios: From the paramagnetic state, the system first enters a partially ordered state with fluctuating magnetic charges, in contrast to a charge-ordered paramagnetic phase before reaching the fully ordered state. Through state-of-the-art Monte Carlo simulations and scaling analyses using a quasi-2D model for the distorted Kagome spin ice in HoAgGe, we elucidate a single three-dimensional (3D) XY phase transition into the ground state with broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS). However, the 3D XY transition has a long crossover tail before the fluctuating magnetic charges fully order. More interestingly, we find both experimentally and theoretically that the TRS breaking phase of HoAgGe features an unusual, hysteretic response: In spite of their vanishing magnetization, the two time-reversal partners are distinguished and selected by a nonlinear magnetic susceptibility tied to the kagome ice rule. Our discovery not only unveils a new symmetry breaking hierarchy of kagome spin ice, but also demonstrates the potential of TRS-breaking frustrated spin systems for information technology applications.</description>

      <title>Prediction and Synthesis of Mg$_4$Pt$_3$H$_6$: A Metallic Complex Transition Metal Hydride Stabilized at Ambient Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-pressure stabilization of superconducting hydrides with high critical temperatures ($T_c$s) remains a significant challenge, and experimentally verified superconducting hydrides are generally constrained to a limited number of structural prototypes. Ternary transition-metal complex hydrides (hydrido complexes)-typically regarded as hydrogen storage materials-exhibit a large range of compounds stabilized at low pressure with recent predictions for high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Motivated by this class of materials, we investigated complex hydride formation in the Mg-Pt-H system, which has no known ternary hydride compounds. Guided by ab initio structural predictions, we successfully synthesized a novel complex transition-metal hydride, Mg$_4$Pt$_3$H$_6$, using laser-heated diamond anvil cells. The compound forms in a body-centered cubic structural prototype at moderate pressures between 8-25 GPa. Unlike the majority of known hydrido complexes, Mg$_4$Pt$_3$H$_6$ is metallic, with formal charge described as 4[Mg]$^{2+}$.3[PtH$_2$]$^{2-}$. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements obtained during decompression reveal that Mg$_4$Pt$_3$H$_6$ remains stable upon quenching to ambient conditions. Magnetic-field and temperature-dependent electrical transport measurements indicate ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_c$ (50%) = 2.9 K, in reasonable agreement with theoretical calculations. These findings clarify the phase behavior in the Mg-Pt-H system and provide valuable insights for transition-metal complex hydrides as a new class of hydrogen-rich superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14823v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to evaluate the Gibbs free energy from constant-volume first-principles phonon calculations. The volume integral of the pressure is performed by determining the volume and the bulk modulus in equilibrium at finite temperatures, where the pressure and its volume derivative are evaluated utilizing first-principles calculations of the Gr\"{u}neisen parameter without varying the volume. We validate our method for fcc Al by comparing with the conventional quasiharmonic approximation. Furthermore, we integrate our method with self-consistent phonon theory and apply it to calculations for bcc Ti, hcp Ti, and tetragonal ZrO$_2$. We demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of our method by comparing results with those obtained from directly volume-varied self-consistent phonon calculations. In all cases, our method accurately evaluates the free energy change due to thermal expansion using only constant-volume phonon calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of pressure to obtain new materials that can be recovered under ambient conditions is a central problem in high-pressure physics. Despite decades of research, this goal has only been achieved in the laboratory for a few notable examples, such as diamond and cubic boron nitride. An area of significant interest is the transformation under compression of light-element molecular compounds to extended covalent-bonded (polymeric) solids. Among them, CO$_2$ has been extensively studied because of its status as a prototypical simple molecular system with a rich phase diagram and due to its fundamental role in Earth's physics and chemistry. One of its polymeric crystalline phases, accessible at extreme pressures and temperatures, has been recently quenched to ambient pressure, but below room temperature. Here we report ab initio calculations predicting that isothermal compression of a carbon monoxide and oxygen mixture (CO+O$_2$), rather than the compound CO$_2$, lowers the onset of C-polymerization at room temperature from ~118 GPa to ~7 GPa (complete by ~23 GPa). Moreover, it leads to the formation of an intrinsically different polymer with enhanced metastability. We predict that this dense phase is an energetic material which can potentially be recovered to ambient pressure and temperature.</description>

      <title>Break-down of the relationship between {\alpha}-relaxation and equilibration in hydrostatically compressed metallic glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glasses encode the memory of any thermo-mechanical treatment applied to them. This ability is associated to the existence of a myriad of metastable amorphous states which can be probed through different pathways. It is usually assumed that the memory of a glass can be erased by heating the material in the supercooled liquid and that this process occurs on a time scale controlled by the {\alpha}-relaxation. We show, here, that this assumption is not fulfilled in hydrostatically compressed glasses. Applying pressure in the glass state can irreversibly modify the dynamics, thermodynamics and structure of a metallic glass-former, reducing the mobility and leading to important structural modifications resulting in a less stable state than in absence of pressure. When heated above their glass transition temperature, these compressed glasses do not convert into the pristine supercooled liquid, implying the existence of a different process, slower than the {\alpha}-relaxation controlling the equilibrium recovery.</description>

Abstract: Measuring nanoscale local temperatures, particularly in vertically integrated and multi-component systems, remains challenging. Spectroscopic techniques like X-ray absorption and core-loss electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) are sensitive to lattice temperature, but understanding thermal effects is nontrivial. This work explores the potential for nanoscale and element-specific core-loss thermometry by comparing the Si L2,3 edge's temperature-dependent redshift against plasmon energy expansion thermometry (PEET) in a scanning TEM. Using density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent DFT, and the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we ab initio model both the Si L2,3 and plasmon redshift. We find that the core-loss redshift occurs due to bandgap reduction from electron-phonon renormalization. Our results indicate that despite lower core-loss signal intensity compared to plasmon features, core-loss thermometry has key advantages and can be more accurate through standard spectral denoising. Specifically, we show that the Varshni equation easily interprets the core-loss redshift for semiconductors, which avoids plasmon spectral convolution for PEET in complex junctions and interfaces. We also find that core-loss thermometry is more accurate than PEET at modeling thermal lattice expansion in semiconductors, unless the specimen's temperature-dependent dielectric properties are fully characterized. Furthermore, core-loss thermometry has the potential to measure nanoscale heating in multi-component materials and stacked interfaces with elemental specificity at length scales smaller than the plasmon's wavefunction.</description>

      <title>Generator of Neural Network Potential for Molecular Dynamics: Constructing Robust and Accurate Potentials with Active Learning for Nanosecond-scale Simulations</title>

Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) enable large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of systems containing &gt;10,000 atoms with the accuracy comparable to ab initio methods and play a crucial role in material studies. Although NNPs are valuable for short-duration MD simulations, maintaining the stability of long-duration MD simulations remains challenging due to the uncharted regions of the potential energy surface (PES). Currently, there is no effective methodology to address this issue. To overcome this challenge, we developed an automatic generator of robust and accurate NNPs based on an active learning (AL) framework. This generator provides a fully integrated solution encompassing initial dataset creation, NNP training, evaluation, sampling of additional structures, screening, and labeling. Crucially, our approach uses a sampling strategy that focuses on generating unstable structures with short interatomic distances, combined with a screening strategy that efficiently samples these configurations based on interatomic distances and structural features. This approach greatly enhances the MD simulation stability, enabling nanosecond-scale simulations. We evaluated the performance of our NNP generator in terms of its MD simulation stability and physical properties by applying it to liquid propylene glycol (PG) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The generated NNPs enable stable MD simulations of systems with &gt;10,000 atoms for 20 ns. The predicted physical properties, such as the density and self-diffusion coefficient, show excellent agreement with the experimental values. This work represents a remarkable advance in the generation of robust and accurate NNPs for organic materials, paving the way for long-duration MD simulations of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Direct ab initio calculation of magnons in altermagnets: method, spin-space symmetry aspects, and application to MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We suggest the method for direct ab initio calculation of magnons in complex collinear magnets. The method is based on the density-functional-theory calculation under two different constraints: one constraint governs the change of the magnetization with respect to the ground state, and the other is the symmetry constraint responsible for the value of the magnon wave vector. The performance of the method is demonstrated by the application to an altermagnet MnTe. An important role in both the formulation and the application of the method play the aspects of generalized symmetry described by the spin-space groups. The symmetry analysis connects in one coherent picture the following three parts of the consideration: (i) the generalized translational symmetry of the magnons as a crucial condition for their efficient ab-initio calculation, (ii) altermagnetic spin-splitting of the electron states in the ground magnetic state, and (iii) chirality splitting of the magnon excitations. It is demonstrated that both the spin splitting of the electron states and the chirality splitting of the magnons have identical patterns in the corresponding wave vector spaces. Since the altermagnetism of MnTe is the consequence of the presence of the Te atoms, an adequate attention is devoted to the symmetry analysis and calculation results for the Te moments induced in the magnon states. The knowledge of the symmetry properties of the Te moments allows to accelerate the numerical convergence of the magnon states and serves as a test for the accuracy of the calculations. To expose the connection between electron band structures of the magnon states of the system and the chirality properties of these states we investigate the transformation of the electron structure in the transition from the collinear ground state to a noncollinear magnon state.</description>

Abstract: The 2025 Los Angeles wildfires caused widespread urban destruction and displacement, and severe economic losses, highlighting the urgent need for better fire retardants. Current fire suppression strategies rely heavily on water, chemical fire retardants, and water-enhancing gels, which use superabsorbent polymers to retain water and adhere to substrates, offering extended fire protection compared to water alone. However, their effectiveness is limited by evaporation and degradation under extreme heat and wind conditions. This study investigates the thermal properties, evaporation dynamics, and fire retardancy mechanisms of a novel polymer-particle (PP) hydrogel with aerogel-forming capabilities. The boiling-induced water vapor expansion and bubble nucleation drive the transformation of the hydrogel into a highly porous, foam-like fire-retardant coating upon rapid heat desiccation, enhancing thermal insulation. By evaluating the retardancy window across different evaporation stages under high heat and wind conditions, this study aims to determine the duration, effectiveness, and governing physical mechanisms of this unique retardant system. These findings provide a framework for designing the next generation of fire retardants with optimized thermal stability and extended protection for wildfire mitigation.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Potentials Predict Orientation- and Mode-Dependent Fracture in Refractory Diborides</title>

Abstract: Fracture toughness ($K_\mathrm{Ic}$) and fracture strength ($\sigma_\mathrm{f}$) are key criteria in the selection and design of reliable ceramics. However, their experimental characterization remains challenging -- especially for ceramic thin films, where size and interfacial effects hinder accurate and reproducible measurements. Here, machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained on \textit{ab initio} datasets of single crystal models deformed up to fracture are used to characterize transgranular cleavage in pre-cracked ceramic diboride TMB$_2$ (TM = Ti, Zr, Hf) lattices through stress intensity factor ($K$)-controlled loading. Mode-I simulations performed across distinct crack geometries show that fracture is primarily driven by straight crack extension along the original plane. The corresponding macroscale fracture-initiation properties ($K_\mathrm{Ic} \approx 1.7$-2.9 MPa$\cdot\sqrt{\text{m}}$, $\sigma_\mathrm{f} \approx 1.6$-2.4 GPa) are extrapolated using established scaling laws. Considering TiB$_2$ as a representative system, additional simulations explore loading conditions ranging from pure Mode-I (opening) to Mode-II (sliding). TiB$_2$ models containing prismatic cracks exhibit their lowest fracture resistance under mixed-mode conditions, where the crack deflects onto pyramidal planes--as confirmed by nanoindentation tests on TiB$_2$(0001) thin films. This study establishes $K$-controlled, MLIP-based simulations as predictive tools for orientation- and mode-dependent fracture in ceramics. The approach is readily extendable to finite temperatures for evaluating fracture behavior under conditions relevant to refractory applications.</description>

Abstract: Graphene functionalized with catalytic transition metals offers high-performance gas sensing by coupling graphene's exceptional electronic transport properties with the metal's catalytic activity, yet the atomistic relationships connecting synthesis parameters, morphological outcomes, and sensor performance remain elusive. We developed an equivariant machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) with near-DFT accuracy to perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Pt crystal growth on graphene and subsequent H$_2$-sensing. MD simulations validated by TEM show that Pt deposition begins with dispersed nuclei coalescing into polycrystalline nanoclusters with predominantly FCC interiors, while both MD and Raman spectroscopy reveal a predominantly non-covalent Pt-graphene interaction that induces moderate local strain and charge transfer yet preserves graphene's structural integrity. Reactive MD simulations confirm H$_2$ dissociative chemisorption exclusively on Pt, with negligible spillover onto pristine graphene. However, H adsorption on Pt attenuates the Pt-graphene interfacial binding, providing an indirect electronic pathway for H$_2$ sensing. Transient and steady-state kinetic analyses demonstrate that an intermediate Pt loading minimizes the limit of detection; lower loadings facilitate faster response and recovery kinetics and enhance signal transduction, whereas higher loadings increase the doping level of graphene. DFT charge analysis indicates that under-coordinated Pt clusters induce $n$-type doping in graphene, whereas continuous Pt films induce $p$-type doping, with both effects attenuated upon H adsorption. The developed machine-learned MD framework enables quantum-mechanically accurate modeling of metal crystal growth on graphene, elucidates the underlying H$_2$-sensing mechanism, and correlates several key sensing figures of merit with metal loading and morphology.</description>

Abstract: MXenes, a family of 2D transition metal compounds, have emerged as promising materials due to their unique electronic properties and tunable surface chemistry. However, the translation of these nanoscale properties into macroscopic devices is constrained by suitable cross-linking strategies that enable both processability and controlled inter flake charge transport. Herein, we demonstrate the tunability of interfaces and the inter-layer spacing between Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ MXene flakes through molecular cross-linking with homologous diamines. Oleylamine was first used to stabilize Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ MXene in chloroform, followed by diamine-mediated cross-linking to precisely tune interlayer spacing. Grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXRD/GIWAXS) confirmed the correlation between ligand chain length and inter-layer spacing, which was further supported by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Furthermore, we investigated the charge transport properties of thin films consisting of these diamine-crosslinked Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ MXenes and observed a strong dependence of the conductivity on the interlayer spacing. Finally, we probed chemiresistive vapor sensing properties of the MXene composites and observed a pronounced sensitivity and selectivity towards water vapor, highlighting their potential for use in humidity sensors. Insights into the molecular cross-linking of MXenes to form a hybrid inorganic/organic system and its implications for charge transport, this study opens avenues for developing next-generation MXene-based electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and characterization of boron-terminated tetravacancies in monolayer hBN using STEM, EELS and electron ptychography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tetravacancies in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with consistent edge termination (boron or nitrogen) form triangular nanopores with electrostatic potentials that can be leveraged for applications such as selective ion transport and neuromorphic computing. In order to quantitatively predict the properties of these structures, an atomic-level understanding of their local electronic and chemical environments is required. Moreover, robust methods for their precision manufacture are needed. Here were use electron irradiation in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) at high dose rate to drive the formation of boron-terminated tetravacancies in monolayer hBN. Characterization of the defects is achieved using aberration-corrected STEM, monochromated electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), and electron ptychography. Z-contrast in STEM and chemical fingerprinting by core-loss EELS enable identification of the edge terminations, while electron ptychography gives insight into structural relaxation of the tetravacancies and provides evidence of enhanced electron density around the defect perimeters indicative of bonding effects.</description>

      <title>The Role of Flexoelectric Coupling and Chemical Strains in the Emergence of Polar Chiral Nano-Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review examines the conditions that lead to the formation of flexo-sensitive chiral polar structures in thin films and core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles. It also analyzes possible mechanisms by which the flexoelectric effect impacts the polarization structure in core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles. Special attention is given to the role of the anisotropic flexoelectric effect in forming a unique type of polarization states with distinct chiral properties, referred to as "flexons". In the first part of the review, we study the influence of the flexoelectric coupling on the polarity, chirality and branching of metastable labyrinthine domain structures in uniaxial ferroelectric core-shell nanoparticles. We reveal that the transition from sinuous branched domain stripes to spiral-like domains occurs gradually as the flexoelectric coupling strength is increased. Our findings indicate that the joint action of flexoelectric effect and chemical strains, termed as "flexo-chemical" coupling, can significantly influence the effective Curie temperature, polarization distribution, domain morphology, and chirality in multiaxial ferroelectric core-shell nanoparticles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combination of flexo-chemical coupling and screening effects leads to the appearance and stabilization of a chiral polarization morphology in nanoflakes of van der Waals ferrielectrics. In the second part of the review, we discuss several advanced applications of flexo-sensitive chiral polar structures in core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles for nanoelectronics elements and cryptography. We underline the possibilities of the flexoelectric control of multiple-degenerated labyrinthine states, which may correspond to a differential negative capacitance (NC) state stabilized in the uniaxial ferroelectric core by the presence of a screening shell.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a system of two-dimensional electrons, a combination of broken symmetry, interactions, and nontrivial topology can conspire to give rise to a nonlinear transport regime, where electric current density scales as the square of electric field. This regime has become a venue for exciting discoveries such as the nonlinear Hall effect and diode-like nonreciprocal transport. However, interpretation of experimental data is challenging in the nonlinear regime as DC transport is described by a rank-3 conductivity tensor with 6 free parameters. Here, we resolve this challenge by analytically solving for the nonlinear potential distribution across the disk sample for an arbitrary linear and nonlinear conductivity tensors. This allows us to unambiguously extract all components of the nonlinear tensor from experimental measurement. Using this novel tool, we identify giant nonlinear Hall effect in Bernal bilayer graphene. Our methodology provides the first systematic framework for interpreting nonlinear transport and uncovers a new route towards understanding quasi-2D materials.</description>

      <title>ReGNet: Reciprocal Space-Aware Long-Range Modeling for Crystalline Property Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting properties of crystals from their structures is a fundamental yet challenging task in materials science. Unlike molecules, crystal structures exhibit infinite periodic arrangements of atoms, requiring methods capable of capturing both local and global information effectively. However, most current works fall short of capturing long-range interactions within periodic structures. To address this limitation, we leverage \emph{reciprocal space} to efficiently encode long-range interactions with learnable filters within Fourier transforms. We introduce Reciprocal Geometry Network (ReGNet), a novel architecture that integrates geometric GNNs and reciprocal blocks to model short-range and long-range interactions, respectively. Experimental results on JARVIS, Materials Project, and MatBench demonstrate that ReGNet achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy across a range of crystal property prediction tasks. Additionally, we explore a model extension that employs the mixture-of-experts for multi-property prediction with promising results and high computational efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of our model as a scalable and accurate solution for crystal property prediction. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.</description>

      <title>A local quantized marker for topological magnons from circular dichroism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The low-energy excitations of a spin system can display Bloch bands with non-trivial topological properties. While topological magnons can be identified through the detection of chiral propagating modes at the sample's edge, an intriguing approach would be to directly probe their topological nature via localized measurements deep within the bulk. In this work, we introduce a quantized topological marker suitable for topological spin systems, which can be experimentally accessed by combining a local driven-dissipative preparation scheme with a circular-dichroic measurement. Demonstrated on a 2D ferromagnetic Heisenberg spin system incorporating Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, this method effectively maps a local Chern marker with single-site resolution while inherently accounting for magnon losses. Our work offers a general strategy to access local topological markers in bosonic settings within a driven-dissipative framework.</description>

      <title>Quantum confinement theory of ultra-thin films: electronic, thermal and superconducting properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The miniaturization of electronic devices has led to the prominence, in technological applications, of ultra-thin films with a thickness ranging from a few tens of nanometers to just about 1-2 nanometers. While these materials are still effectively 3D in many respects, traditional theories as well as ab initio methods struggle to describe their properties as measured in experiments. In particular, standard approaches to quantum confinement rely on hard-wall boundary conditions, which neglect the unavoidable, ubiquitous, atomic-scale irregularities of the interface. Recently, a unified theoretical approach to quantum confinement has been proposed which is able to effectively take the real nature of the interface into account, and can efficiently be implemented in synergy with microscopic theories. Its predictions for the electronic properties such as electrical conductivity of semiconductor thin films or critical temperature of superconducting thin films, have been successfully verified in comparison with experimental data. The same confinement principles lead to new laws for the phonon density of states and for the heat capacity of thin films, again in agreement with the available experimental data.</description>
