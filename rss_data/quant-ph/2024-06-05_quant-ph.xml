      <title>Emergence of a second law of thermodynamics in isolated quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time. This appears to conflict with the reversible evolution of isolated quantum systems under the Schr\"odinger equation, which preserves the von Neumann entropy. Nonetheless, one finds that with respect to many observables, expectation values approach a fixed value -- their equilibrium value. This ultimately raises the question: in what sense does the entropy of an isolated quantum system increase over time? For classical systems, one introduces the assumption of a low entropy initial state along with the concept of ignorance about the microscopic details of the physical system, leading to a statistical interpretation of the second law. By considering the observables through which we examine quantum systems, both these assumptions can be incorporated, building upon recent studies of the equilibration on average of observables. While the statistical behavior of observable expectation values is well-established, a quantitative connection to entropy increase has been lacking so far. In deriving novel bounds for the equilibration of observables, and considering the entropy of the system relative to observables, we recover a variant of the second law: the entropy with respect to a given observable tends towards its equilibrium value in the course of the system's unitary evolution. These results also support recent findings which question the necessity of non-integrability for equilibration in quantum systems. We further illustrate our bounds using numerical results from the paradigmatic example of a quantum Ising model on a chain of spins. There, we observe entropy increasing up to equilibrium values, as well as fluctuations which expose the underlying reversible evolution in accordance with the derived bounds.</description>

      <title>Prethermal Time-Crystalline Corner Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of prethermal discrete time crystals whose sub-harmonic response is entirely localized to zero-dimensional corner modes. Within the exponentially long prethermal regime, we show that the robustness of these corner modes arises from two related, yet distinct mechanisms: the presence of a higher-order symmetry-protected topological phase in the effective Hamiltonian, or the emergence of a dynamical constraint that prevents the decay of the corner mode. While the first mechanism ensures the stability of the sub-harmonic response throughout the entirety of the prethermal regime, it is restricted to initial states in the ground state manifold of the effective Hamiltonian. By contrast, the second mechanism enables the observation of the prethermal time-crystalline order for arbitrary initial states, albeit with a time scale that is not only determined by the frequency of the drive, but also the relative energy scale across the system's sublattices. We characterize these two mechanisms by simulating the dynamics of a periodically driven two-dimensional spin model, and discuss natural extensions of our model to all other dimensions.</description>

      <title>Bit by Bit: Gravity Through the Lens of Quantum Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This dissertation reviews several recent advances at the intersection of quantum information and holography. In holography, properties of quantum systems admit a gravitational interpretation via the AdS/CFT correspondence. For holographic states, boundary entanglement entropy is dual to bulk geodesic areas, known as Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces. Furthermore, the viability to possess a holographic dual at all is constrained by entanglement structure. Accordingly, entanglement enables a coarse classification of states in a Hilbert space. Similarly, state transformation under operator groups also provides a classification on the Hilbert space. Stabilizer states, for example, are invariant under large sets of operations and consequently can be simulated on a classical computer. Cayley graphs offer a useful representation for a group of operators, where vertices represent group elements and edges represent generators. The orbit of a state under action of the group can also be represented as a "reachability graph", a quotient of the group Cayley graph. Reachability graphs can be dressed to encode entanglement information, making them a useful tool for studying entanglement dynamics. Quotienting a reachability graph by group elements that fix a state computable, e.g. entanglement entropy, builds a "contracted graph". Contracted graphs explicitly bound state parameter evolution in quantum circuits. In this thesis, an upper bound on entanglement entropy evolution in Clifford circuits is presented. Another important property of quantum systems is magic, which quantifies the difficulty of simulating a quantum state. Magic and entanglement play complementary roles when describing emergent phenomena in AdS/CFT. This work describes the interplay of entanglement and magic, offering holographic consequences for magic as cosmic brane back-reaction.</description>

      <title>Doubly minimized Petz Renyi mutual information: Properties and operational interpretation from direct exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The doubly minimized Petz Renyi mutual information of order $\alpha$ is defined as the minimization of the Petz divergence of order $\alpha$ of a fixed bipartite quantum state relative to any product state. In this work, we establish several properties of this type of Renyi mutual information, including its additivity for $\alpha\in [1/2,2]$. As an application, we show that the direct exponent of certain binary quantum state discrimination problems is determined by the doubly minimized Petz Renyi mutual information of order $\alpha\in (1/2,1)$. This provides an operational interpretation of this type of Renyi mutual information, and generalizes a previous result for classical probability distributions to the quantum setting.</description>

      <title>Snowflake: A Distributed Streaming Decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design Snowflake, a quantum error correction decoder that runs in a streaming fashion and is capable of a simple, local implementation. In doing so we propose a new method for general stream decoding that eliminates the processing overhead due to window overlap in existing windowing methods. As a first study, we test our local implementation of Snowflake on the surface code under circuit-level noise. It recovers roughly 2/3 the accuracy threshold of the Union-Find decoder adapted with a windowing method, with a better mean runtime scaling: subquadratic as opposed to cubic in code distance $d$. We discuss how Snowflake may be implemented on a 2D chip and decode not just quantum memory but lattice surgery-based computation.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Computing in Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commercially impactful quantum algorithms such as quantum chemistry and Shor's algorithm require a number of qubits and gates far beyond the capacity of any existing quantum processor. Distributed architectures, which scale horizontally by networking modules, provide a route to commercial utility and will eventually surpass the capability of any single quantum computing module. Such processors consume remote entanglement distributed between modules to realize distributed quantum logic. Networked quantum computers will therefore require the capability to rapidly distribute high fidelity entanglement between modules. Here we present preliminary demonstrations of some key distributed quantum computing protocols on silicon T centres in isotopically-enriched silicon. We demonstrate the distribution of entanglement between modules and consume it to apply a teleported gate sequence, establishing a proof-of-concept for T centres as a distributed quantum computing and networking platform.</description>

      <title>Quantifying nonclassicality of mixed Fock states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonclassical states of bosonic modes are important resources for quantum-enhanced technologies. Yet, quantifying nonclassicality of these states, in particular mixed states, can be a challenge. Here we present results of quantifying the nonclassicality of a bosonic mode in a mixed Fock state via the operational resource theory (ORT) measure [W. Ge, K. Jacobs, S. Asiri, M. Foss-Feig, and M. S. Zubairy, Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 023400 (2020)], which relates nonclassicality to metrological advantage. Generally speaking, evaluating the ORT measure for mixed states is challenging, since it involves finding a convex roof. However, we show that our problem can be reduced to a linear programming problem. By analyzing the results of numerical optimization, we are able to extract exact, analytical results for the case where three or four neighboring Fock states have nonzero population. Interestingly, we find that such a mode can be in distinct phases, depending on the populations. Lastly, we demonstrate how our method is generalizable to density matrices of higher ranks. Our findings suggests a viable method for evaluating nonclassicality of arbitrary mixed bosonic states and potentially for solving other convex roof optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Quantum speed limit of open quantum system models using the Wigner function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum speed limit time of open system models is explored using the Wasserstein-1-distance and the Wigner function. Use is made of the phase covariant and a two-qubit model interacting with a squeezed thermal bath via position-dependent coupling. The dependence of the coupling on the position of the qubits allowed the study of the dynamics in the collective regime, which is conducive to speeding up the evolution. The use of the Wigner function naturally allows the study of the quantumness of the systems studied. An interesting interplay is observed between non-Markovian behavior, quantumness, and the quantum speed limit time. The presence of quantum correlations is seen to speed up the evolution.</description>

      <title>Quantum optimization using a 127-qubit gate-model IBM quantum computer can outperform quantum annealers for nontrivial binary optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive quantum solver for binary combinatorial optimization problems on gate-model quantum computers that outperforms any published alternative and consistently delivers correct solutions for problems with up to 127 qubits. We provide an overview of the internal workflow, describing the integration of a customized ansatz and variational parameter update strategy, efficient error suppression in hardware execution, and overhead-free post-processing to correct for bit-flip errors. We benchmark this solver on IBM quantum computers for several classically nontrivial unconstrained binary optimization problems -- the entire optimization is conducted on hardware with no use of classical simulation or prior knowledge of the solution. First, we demonstrate the ability to correctly solve Max-Cut instances for random regular graphs with a variety of densities using up to 120 qubits, where the graph topologies are not matched to device connectivity. Next, we apply the solver to higher-order binary optimization and successfully search for the ground state energy of a 127-qubit spin-glass model with linear, quadratic, and cubic interaction terms. Use of this new quantum solver increases the likelihood of finding the minimum energy by up to $\sim1,500\times$ relative to published results using a DWave annealer, and it can find the correct solution when the annealer fails. Furthermore, for both problem types, the Q-CTRL solver outperforms a heuristic local solver used to indicate the relative difficulty of the problems pursued. Overall, these results represent the largest quantum optimizations successfully solved on hardware to date, and demonstrate the first time a gate-model quantum computer has been able to outperform an annealer for a class of binary optimization problems.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity remote entanglement of trapped atoms mediated by time-bin photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic interconnects between quantum processing nodes are likely the only way to achieve large-scale quantum computers and networks. The bottleneck in such an architecture is the interface between well-isolated quantum memories and flying photons. We establish high-fidelity entanglement between remotely separated trapped atomic qubit memories, mediated by photonic qubits stored in the timing of their pulses. Such time-bin encoding removes sensitivity to polarization errors, enables long-distance quantum communication, and is extensible to quantum memories with more than two states. Using a measurement-based error detection process and suppressing a fundamental source of error due to atomic recoil, we achieve an entanglement fidelity of 97% and show that fidelities beyond 99.9% are feasible.</description>

      <title>Provable Optimality of the Square-Tooth Atomic Frequency Comb Quantum Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic frequency comb (AFC) quantum memories are a promising technology for quantum repeater networks because they enable multi-mode, high-fidelity storage of photons with on-demand retrieval. The optimization of the retrieval efficiency of an AFC memory is important because it strongly impacts the entanglement generation rate in quantum networks. Despite initial theoretical analyses and recent experimental demonstrations, a rigorous proof of the universally optimal configuration for the highest AFC retrieval efficiency has not been presented. In this paper we offer a simple analytical proof which shows that the optimized square-tooth AFC provides the highest retrieval efficiency among all possible comb tooth shapes, under the physical constraint of maximal optical depth of an atomic ensemble. The optimality still holds even when the non-zero background absorption and the finite homogeneous broadening of atoms are considered. Our proof provides experimentalists with rigorous arguments how to create optimal AFC under realistic experimental conditions. Finally, we also identify other functional optimization problems where our proof technique is applicable, thus proving the optimality of the square function in more general scenarios.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of quantum systems interacting with environments requires addressing non-unitary dynamics, which significantly complicates computational approaches. In this work, we enhance an open quantum system (OQS) theory using density-matrix purification, enabling a unitary description of dynamics by entangling the system with an environment of equal dimension. We first establish the connection between density-matrix purification and conventional OQS methods. We then demonstrate the standalone applicability of purification theory by deriving system-environment interactions from fundamental design principles. Using model systems, we show that the purification approach extends beyond the complete positivity condition and effectively models both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. Finally, we implement density-matrix purification on a quantum simulator, illustrating its capability to map non-unitary OQS dynamics onto a unitary framework suitable for quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate optimized quantum state preparation for quantum metrology applications in noisy environments. We simulate a low-depth variational quantum circuit (VQC) composed of a sequence of global rotations and entangling operations applied to a chain of qubits that are subject to dephasing noise. The parameters controlling the VQC are numerically optimized to maximize the quantum Fisher information, which characterizes the ultimate metrological sensitivity of a quantum state, with respect to a global rotation. We find that regardless of the details of the entangling operation implemented in the VQC, the optimal quantum states can be broadly classified into a trio of qualitative regimes -- cat-like, squeezed-like, and product states -- associated with different dephasing rates. Our findings are relevant for designing optimal state-preparation strategies for next-generation quantum sensors exploiting entanglement, such as time and frequency standards and magnetometers, aimed at achieving state-of-the-art performance in the presence of noise and decoherence.</description>

      <title>Resource Optimized Quantum Squaring Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum squaring operation is a useful building block in implementing quantum algorithms such as linear regression, regularized least squares algorithm, order-finding algorithm, quantum search algorithm, Newton Raphson division, Euclidean distance calculation, cryptography, and in finding roots and reciprocals. Quantum circuits could be made fault-tolerant by using error correcting codes and fault-tolerant quantum gates (such as the Clifford + T-gates). However, the T-gate is very costly to implement. Two qubit gates (such as the CNOT-gate) are more prone to noise errors than single qubit gates. Consequently, in order to realize reliable quantum algorithms, the quantum circuits should have a low T-count and CNOT-count. In this paper, we present a novel quantum integer squaring architecture optimized for T-count, CNOT-count, T-depth, CNOT-depth, and $KQ_T$ that produces no garbage outputs. To reduce costs, we use a novel approach for arranging the generated partial products that allows us to reduce the number of adders by 50%. We also use the resource efficient logical-AND gate and uncomputation gate shown in [1] to further save resources. The proposed quantum squaring circuit sees an asymptotic reduction of 66.67% in T-count, 50% in T-depth, 29.41% in CNOT-count, 42.86% in CNOT-depth, and 25% in KQ T with respect to Thapliyal et al. [2]. With respect to Nagamani et al. [3] the design sees an asymptotic reduction of 77.27% in T-count, 68.75% in T-depth, 50% in CNOT-count, 61.90% in CNOT-depth, and 6.25% in the $KQ_T$.</description>

      <title>Dividing quantum circuits for time evolution of stochastic processes by orthogonal series density estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo integration (QMCI) is a quantum algorithm to estimate expectations of random variables, with applications in various industrial fields such as financial derivative pricing. When QMCI is applied to expectations concerning a stochastic process $X(t)$, e.g., an underlying asset price in derivative pricing, the quantum circuit $U_{X(t)}$ to generate the quantum state encoding the probability density of $X(t)$ can have a large depth. With time discretized into $N$ points, using state preparation oracles for the transition probabilities of $X(t)$, the state preparation for $X(t)$ results in a depth of $O(N)$, which may be problematic for large $N$. Moreover, if we estimate expectations concerning $X(t)$ at $N$ time points, the total query complexity scales on $N$ as $O(N^2)$, which is worse than the $O(N)$ complexity in the classical Monte Carlo method. In this paper, to improve this, we propose a method to divide $U_{X(t)}$ based on orthogonal series density estimation. This approach involves approximating the densities of $X(t)$ at $N$ time points with orthogonal series, where the coefficients are estimated as expectations of the orthogonal functions by QMCI. By using these approximated densities, we can estimate expectations concerning $X(t)$ by QMCI without requiring deep circuits. Our error and complexity analysis shows that to obtain the approximated densities at $N$ time points, our method achieves the circuit depth and total query complexity scaling as $O(\sqrt{N})$ and $O(N^{3/2})$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Can Entanglement-enhanced Quantum Kernels Improve Data Classification?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical machine learning, extensively utilized across diverse domains, faces limitations in speed, efficiency, parallelism, and processing of complex datasets. In contrast, quantum machine learning algorithms offer significant advantages, including exponentially faster computations, enhanced data handling capabilities, inherent parallelism, and improved optimization for complex problems. In this study, we used the entanglement-enhanced quantum kernel in quantum support vector machine to train complex respiratory data sets. Compared to classical algorithms, our findings reveal that QSVM performs better with 45% higher accuracy for complex respiratory data sets while maintaining comparable performance with linear datasets in contrast to their classical counterparts executed on a 2-qubit system. Through our study, we investigate the efficacy of the QSVM-Kernel algorithm in harnessing the enhanced dimensionality of the quantum Hilbert space for effectively training complex datasets.</description>

      <title>Experimental Validation of Enhanced Information Capacity by Quantum Switch in Accordance with Thermodynamic Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally probe the interplay of the quantum switch with the laws of thermodynamics. The quantum switch places two channels in a superposition of orders and may be applied to thermalizing channels. Quantum-switching thermal channels has been shown to give apparent violations of the second law. Central to these apparent violations is how quantum switching channels can increase the capacity to communicate information. We experimentally show this increase and how it is consistent with the laws of thermodynamics, demonstrating how thermodynamic resources are consumed. We use a nuclear magnetic resonance approach with coherently controlled interactions of nuclear spin qubits. We verify an analytical upper bound on the increase in capacity for channels that preserve energy and thermal states, and demonstrate that the bound can be exceeded for an energy-altering channel. We show that the switch can be used to take a thermal state to a state that is not thermal, whilst consuming free energy associated with the coherence of a control system. The results show how the switch can be incorporated into quantum thermodynamics experiments as an additional resource.</description>

      <title>Machine learning framework for predicting the entangling capability of parameterized quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, quantum devices face significant limitations. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are promising solutions, but their performance heavily depends on the parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) they utilize. The entanglement of PQCs is an important metric for constructing PQCs. This is because entanglement is not only a key property that distinguishes quantum from classical computing, but it also affects the computational performance of VQAs. However, due to the extensive quantum state sampling required, its computational cost is very high. To address this challenge, we propose a machine learning framework that utilizes a long short-term memory (LSTM) model and gate encoding technology to predict the entangling capability of PQCs. By encoding PQCs into matrix sequences via gate encoding technology and feeding them into an LSTM model at different time steps, our method effectively simulates quantum dynamic evolution. We trained the LSTM model on a dataset of random PQCs. For testing scenarios, our model achieved a pearson correlation coefficient (Pc) of 0.9791 and an root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.05, demonstrating high prediction accuracy and validating the framework's effectiveness. This approach significantly reduces the entanglement computational cost associated with sampling quantum states and provides a practical tool for designing PQC structures and theoretically analyzing the role of entanglement in PQCs.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the optical response of a duplicated two-level atomic medium submitted to a strong stationnary control field and a weak co-propagating probe field, orthogonally polarized to each other. We show that both reflected and transmitted components of the probe may be absorbed and amplified. Moreover, for low optical depths, reflection and transmission factors are controlled by the relative phase between control and probe fields, which makes the configuration we present here promising for the development of optical devices, such as phase-controlled switches.</description>

      <title>Experimental single-photon quantum key distribution surpassing the fundamental coherent-state rate limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon sources are essential for quantum networks, enabling applications ranging from quantum key distribution (QKD) to the burgeoning quantum internet. Despite the remarkable advancements, the current reliance of QKD on attenuated coherent (laser) light sources has imposed a fundamental limit on the secret key rate (SKR). This constraint is primarily attributable to the scarcity of single-photon components within coherent light, confined by an inherent upper bound of 1/e. Here, we report high-rate QKD using a high-efficiency single-photon source, enabling an SKR transcending the fundamental rate limit of coherent light. We developed an on-demand, bright semiconductor quantum-dot single-photon source with an efficiency of 0.71(2), exceeding the inherent bound of coherent light by approximately 2.87 dB. Implementing narrow-bandwidth filtering and random polarization modulation, we conducted a field QKD trial over a 14.6(1.1)-dB-loss free-space urban channel, achieving an SKR of 0.00108 bits per pulse. This surpasses the practical limit of coherent-light-based QKD by 2.53 dB. Our findings conclusively demonstrate the superior performance of nanotechnology-based single-photon sources over coherent light for QKD applications, marking a pivotal stride towards the realization of a global quantum internet.</description>

      <title>Multi-level quantum signal processing with applications to ground state preparation using fast-forwarded Hamiltonian evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preparation of the ground state of a Hamiltonian $H$ with a large spectral radius has applications in many areas such as electronic structure theory and quantum field theory. Given an initial state with a constant overlap with the ground state, and assuming that the Hamiltonian $H$ can be efficiently simulated with an ideal fast-forwarding protocol, we first demonstrate that employing a linear combination of unitaries (LCU) approach can prepare the ground state at a cost of $\mathcal{O}(\log^2(\|H\| \Delta^{-1}))$ queries to controlled Hamiltonian evolution. Here $\|H\|$ is the spectral radius of $H$ and $\Delta$ the spectral gap. However, traditional Quantum Signal Processing (QSP)-based methods fail to capitalize on this efficient protocol, and its cost scales as $\mathcal{O}(\|H\| \Delta^{-1})$. To bridge this gap, we develop a multi-level QSP-based algorithm that exploits the fast-forwarding feature. This novel algorithm not only matches the efficiency of the LCU approach when an ideal fast-forwarding protocol is available, but also exceeds it with a reduced cost that scales as $\mathcal{O}(\log(\|H\| \Delta^{-1}))$. Additionally, our multi-level QSP method requires only $\mathcal{O}(\log(\|H\| \Delta^{-1}))$ coefficients for implementing single qubit rotations. This eliminates the need for constructing the PREPARE oracle in LCU, which prepares a state encoding $\mathcal{O}(\|H\| \Delta^{-1})$ coefficients regardless of whether the Hamiltonian can be fast-forwarded.</description>

      <title>Investigating controlled teleportation capability of quantum states with respect to $k$-separability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum teleportation is an essential application of quantum entanglement. The examination of teleportation fidelity in two-party standard teleportation schemes reveals a critical threshold distinguishing separable and entangled states. For separable states, their teleportation fidelities cannot exceed the threshold, emphasizing the significance of entanglement. We extend this analysis to multi-party scenarios known as controlled teleportation. Our study provides thresholds that $N$-qudit $k$-separable states cannot exceed in a controlled teleportation scheme, where $N \ge 3$ and $2 \le k \le N$. This not only establishes a standard for utilizing a given quantum state as a resource in controlled teleportation but also enhances our understanding of the influence of the entanglement structure on controlled teleportation performance. In addition, we show that genuine multipartite entanglement is not a prerequisite for achieving a high controlled teleportation capability.</description>

      <title>Communication Complexity of Graph Isomorphism, Coloring, and Distance Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum information, nonlocal games are particularly useful for differentiating classical, quantum, and non-signalling correlations. An example of differentiation is given by the principle of no-collapse of communication complexity, which is often interpreted as necessary for a feasible physical theory. It is satisfied by quantum correlations but violated by some non-signalling ones.
  In this work, we investigate this principle in the context of three nonlocal games related to graph theory, starting from the well-known graph isomorphism and graph coloring games, and introducing a new game, the vertex distance game, with a parameter $D\in\mathbb N$, that generalizes the former two to some extent. For these three games, we prove that perfect non-signalling strategies collapse communication complexity under favorable conditions. We also define a refinement of fractional isomorphism of graphs, namely D-fractional isomorphisms, and we show that this characterizes perfect non-signalling strategies for the vertex distance game. Surprisingly, we observe that non-signalling strategies provide a finer distinction for the new game compared to classical and quantum strategies since the parameter D is visible only in the non-signalling setting.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the sensitivity of quantum fiber-optical gyroscopes via a non-Gaussian-state probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical scheme to enhance the sensitivity of a quantum fiber-optical gyroscope (QFOG) via a non-Gaussian-state probe based on quadrature measurements of the optical field. The non-Gaussian-state probe utilizes the product state comprising a photon-added coherent state (PACS) with photon excitations and a coherent state CS. We study the sensitivity of the QFOG, and find that it can be significantly enhanced through increasing the photon excitations in the PACS probe. We investigate the influence of photon loss on the performance of QFOG and demonstrate that the PACS probe exhibits robust resistance to photon loss. Furthermore, we compare the performance of the QFOG using the PACS probe against two Gaussian-state probes: the CS probe and the squeezed state (SS) probe and indicate that the PACS probe offers a significant advantage in terms of sensitivity, regardless of photon loss, under the constraint condition of the same total number of input photons. Particularly, it is found that the sensitivity of the PACS probe can be three orders of magnitude higher than that of two Gaussian-state probes for certain values of the measured parameter. The capabilities of the non-Gaussian state probe on enhancing the sensitivity and resisting photon loss could have a wide-ranging impact on future high-performance QFOGs.</description>

      <title>The Qudit ZH Calculus for Arbitrary Finite Fields: Universality and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the graphical ZH calculus to qudits of prime-power dimensions $q = p^t$, implementing field arithmetic in arbitrary finite fields. This is an extension of a previous result by Roy which implemented arithmetic of prime-sized fields; and an alternative to a result by de Beaudrap which extended the ZH to implement cyclic ring arithmetic in $\mathbb Z / q\mathbb Z$ rather than field arithmetic in $\mathbb F_q$. We show this generalized ZH calculus to be universal over matrices $\mathbb C^{q^n} \to \mathbb C^{q^m}$ with entries in the ring $\mathbb Z[\omega]$ where $\omega$ is a $p$th root of unity. As an illustration of the necessity of such an extension of ZH for field rather than cyclic ring arithmetic, we offer a graphical description and proof for a quantum algorithm for polynomial interpolation. This algorithm relies on the invertibility of multiplication, and therefore can only be described in a graphical language that implements field, rather than ring, multiplication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are essential in many variational quantum algorithms. Quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), which are structurally similar to classical convolutional neural networks, possess the capability to extract informative features and have shown significant effectiveness in image classification tasks. To achieve higher image classification accuracy and reduce the number of training parameters, modifications to the structure of PQCs or hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural network (HQCCNN) models are typically employed. The image datasets used in these learning models are usually RGB images. We investigate the effects of different color spaces to explore the potential for reducing the resources required for quantum computation. By utilizing a simple HQCCNN model with existing PQCs, we analyze the performance of each channel in various color space images. Experimental results reveal that two channels consistently exhibit higher classification accuracy in images from different color spaces than the third. Specifically, the L channel of LAB color space images achieves superior classification accuracy when employing a more complex PQC. Additionally, PQCs utilizing controlled rotation X-gates outperform those using controlled selection Z-gates in this classification task.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of superior communication through thermodynamically free channels in an optical quantum switch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The release of causal structure of physical events from a well-defined order to an indefinite one stimulates remarkable enhancements in various quantum information tasks. Some of these advantages, however, are questioned for the ambiguous role of the control system in the quantum switch that is an experimentally realized process with indefinite causal structure. In communications, for example, not only the superposition of alternative causal orders, but also the superposition of alternative trajectories can accelerate information transmissions. Here, we follow the proposal of Liu et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 230604 (2022)], and examine the information enhancement effect of indefinite causal orders with the toolkit of thermodynamics in a photonic platform. Specifically, we simulate the thermal interaction between a system qubit and two heat baths embedded in a quantum switch by implementing the corresponding switched thermal channels. Although its action on the system qubit only is thermally free, our results suggest that the quantum switch should be seen as a resource when the control qubit is also considered. Moreover, we characterize the non-Markovian property in this scenario by measuring the information backflows from the heat baths to the system qubit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the generation of steady-state entanglement between two atoms resulting from the fluctuation-mediated Casimir-Polder (CP) interactions near a surface. Starting with an initially separable state of the atoms, we analyze the atom-atom entanglement dynamics for atoms placed at distances in the range of $\sim25$~nm away from a planar medium, examining the effect of medium properties and geometrical configuration of the atomic dipoles. We show that perfectly conducting and superconducting surfaces yield an optimal steady-state concurrence value of approximately 0.5. Furthermore, although the generated entanglement decreases with medium losses for a metal surface, we identify an optimal distance from the metal surface that assists in the generation of entanglement by the surface. While fluctuation-mediated interactions are typically considered detrimental to the coherence of quantum systems at nanoscales, our results demonstrate a mechanism for leveraging such interactions for entanglement generation.</description>

      <title>Environment-induced Transitions in Many-body Quantum Teleportation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum teleportation is a phenomenon arising from entanglement, decisively distinguishing the classical and quantum worlds. The recent success of many-body quantum teleportation is even more surprising: although input information is initially dispersed and encoded into the many-body state in a complex way, the teleportation process can refocus this highly non-local information at the receiver's end. This success manifests intriguing capability of many-body systems in quantum information processing. Current studies indicate that information scrambling, a generic dynamic process in many-body systems, underlies the effectiveness of many-body quantum teleportation. However, this process is known to undergo a novel scrambling-dissipation transition in the presence of environments. How environments affect the quantum information processing capability of many-body systems calls for further investigation. In this work, we study many-body quantum teleportation in the presence of environments. We predict two emergent critical points that hallmark the transitions of the teleportation performance from the quantum regime to the classical regime, and finally to the no-signal regime as the system-environment coupling, quantified by $\gamma$, increases. In the quantum regime, teleportation can outperform its classical counterparts, while in the classical regime, it can be replaced by a classical channel. Our prediction is based on a generic argument harnessing the relationship between many-body quantum teleportation and information scrambling, corroborated by solvable Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipative systems with decoherence free subspaces, a.k.a. dark spaces (DSs), can be used to protect quantum information. At the same time, dissipation is expected to give rise to coherent information degradation outside the DS. Employed to support quantum information platforms, DSs can be adiabatically modified in a way that resembles adiabatic control of coherent systems. Here we study the slow evolution of a purely dissipative system with a spectral gap $\gamma$, characterized by a strong symmetry, under a cyclic protocol with period $T$. Non-adiabatic corrections to the state evolution give rise to decoherence: the evolution within the instantaneous DS is described by a time-local effective Liouvillian operator that leads to purity degradation over a period, of order $1/\gamma T$. We obtain a closed form of the latter to order $1/(\gamma T)^2$. Our analysis underlines speed limitations in quantum information processing in the absence of corrective measures.</description>

Abstract: Room-temperature (RT) two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets hold immense promise for next-generation spintronic devices for information storage and processing. To achieve high-density energy-efficient spintronic devices, it is essential to understand local magnetic properties of RT 2D vdW magnets. In this work, we realize noninvasive in situ magnetic detection in vdW-layered ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 using divacancy spins quantum sensor in silicon carbide (SiC) at RT. The structural features and magnetic properties of the Fe3GaTe2 are characterized utilizing Raman spectrum, magnetization and magneto-transport measurements. Further detailed analysis of temperature- and magnetic field-dependent optically detected magnetic resonances of the PL6 divacancy near the Fe3GaTe2 reveal that, the Curie temperature (Tc) of Fe3GaTe2 is ~360K, and the magnetization increases with external magnetic fields. Additionally, spin relaxometry technology is employed to probe the magnetic fluctuations of Fe3GaTe2, revealing a peak in the spin relaxation rate around Tc. These experiments give insights into the intriguing local magnetic properties of 2D vdW RT ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 and pave the way for the application of SiC quantum sensors in noninvasive in situ magnetic detection of related 2D vdW magnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is an essential feature of many-body systems that impacts both quantum information processing and fundamental physics. The growth of entanglement is a major challenge for classical simulation methods. In this work, we investigate the relationship between quantum entanglement and quantum simulation, showing that product-formula approximations can perform better for entangled systems. We establish a tighter upper bound for algorithmic error in terms of entanglement entropy and develop an adaptive simulation algorithm incorporating measurement gadgets to estimate the algorithmic error. This shows that entanglement is not only an obstacle to classical simulation, but also a feature that can accelerate quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Multifractality in monitored single-particle dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study multifractal properties in time evolution of a single particle subject to repeated measurements. For quantum systems, we consider circuit models consisting of local unitary gates and local projective measurements. For classical systems, we consider models for estimating the trajectory of a particle evolved under local transition processes by partially measuring particle occupations. In both cases, multifractal behaviors appear in the ensemble of wave functions or probability distributions conditioned on measurement outcomes after a sufficiently long time. While the nature of particle transport (diffusive or ballistic) qualitatively affects the multifractal properties, they are even quantitatively robust to the measurement rate or specific protocols. On the other hand, multifractality is generically lost by generalized measurements allowing erroneous outcomes or by postselection of the outcomes with no particle detection. We demonstrate these properties by numerical simulations and also propose several simplified models, which allow us to analytically obtain multifractal properties in the monitored single-particle systems.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Erasure Conversion in a Molecular Tweezer Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable optical tweezer arrays of molecules are an emerging platform for quantum simulation and quantum information science. For these applications, reducing and mitigating errors that arise during initial state preparation and subsequent evolution remain major challenges. In this paper, we present work on site-resolved detection of internal state errors and quantum erasures, which are qubit errors with known locations. First, using a new site-resolved detection scheme, we demonstrate robust and enhanced tweezer array preparation fidelities. This enables creating molecular arrays with low defect rates, opening the door to high-fidelity simulation of quantum many-body systems. Second, for the first time in molecules, we demonstrate mid-circuit detection of erasures using a composite detection scheme that minimally affects error-free qubits. We also demonstrate mid-circuit conversion of blackbody-induced errors into detectable erasures. Our demonstration of erasure conversion, which has been shown to significantly reduce overheads for fault-tolerant quantum error correction, could be useful for quantum information processing in molecular tweezer arrays.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of two-dimensional connectivity for a scalable error-corrected ion-trap quantum processor architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major hurdle for building a large-scale quantum computer is to scale up the number of qubits while maintaining connectivity between them. In trapped-ion devices, this connectivity can be provided by physically moving subregisters consisting of a few ions across the processor. The topology of the connectivity is given by the layout of the ion trap where one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrangements are possible. Here, we focus on an architecture based on a rectangular two-dimensional lattice, where each lattice site contains a subregister with a linear string of ions. We refer to this architecture as the Quantum Spring Array (QSA). Subregisters placed in neighboring lattice sites can be coupled by bringing the respective ion strings close to each other while avoiding merging them into a single trapping potential. Control of the separation of subregisters along one axis of the lattice, known as the axial direction, uses quasi-static voltages, while the second axis, the radial, requires control of radio frequency signals. In this work, we investigate key elements of the 2D lattice quantum computation architecture along both axes: We show that the coupling rate between neighboring lattice sites increases with the number of ions per site and the motion of the coupled system can be resilient to noise. The coherence of the coupling is assessed, and an entangled state of qubits in separate trapping regions along the radial axis is demonstrated. Moreover, we demonstrate control over radio frequency signals to adjust radial separation between strings, and thus tune their coupling rate. We further map the 2D lattice architecture to code primitives for fault-tolerant quantum error correction, providing a step towards a quantum processor architecture that is optimized for large-scale fault-tolerant operation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the two-qubit quantum Rabi model and found its dark state solutions with at most N photons. One peculiar case presents when $N=3$, which has constant eigenenergy in the whole coupling regime and leads to level crossings within the same parity subspace. We also discovered asymptotic solutions with at most $N=2i+3$ $(i=1,2,3,\dots)$ photons, and constant eigenenergy $N\hbar \omega$ when coupling $g$ becomes much larger than photon frequency $\omega$. Although generally all photon number states are involved in the two-qubit quantum Rabi model, such $N$-photon solutions exist and may have applications in quantum information processing with ultrastrong couplings.</description>

      <title>Bipartite entanglement of noisy stabilizer states through the lens of stabilizer codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stabilizer states are a prime resource for a number of applications in quantum information science, such as secret-sharing and measurement-based quantum computation. This motivates us to study the entanglement of noisy stabilizer states across a bipartition. We show that the spectra of the corresponding reduced states can be expressed in terms of properties of an associated stabilizer code. In particular, this allows us to show that the coherent information is related to the so-called syndrome entropy of the underlying code. We use this viewpoint to find stabilizer states that are resilient against noise, allowing for more robust entanglement distribution in near-term quantum networks. We specialize our results to the case of graph states, where the found connections with stabilizer codes reduces back to classical linear codes for dephasing noise. On our way we provide an alternative proof of the fact that every qubit stabilizer code is equivalent up to single-qubit Clifford gates to a graph code.</description>

      <title>Noise-adapted qudit codes for amplitude-damping noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) plays a critical role in preventing information loss in quantum systems and provides a framework for reliable quantum computation. Identifying quantum codes with nice code parameters for physically motivated noise models remains an interesting challenge. Going beyond qubit codes, here we propose a class of qudit error correcting codes tailored to protect against amplitude-damping noise. Specifically, we construct a class of four-qudit codes that satisfies the error correction conditions for all single-qudit and a few two-qudit damping errors up to the leading order in the damping parameter $\gamma$. We devise a protocol to extract syndromes that identify this set of errors unambiguously, leading to a noise-adapted recovery scheme that achieves a fidelity loss of $\cO(\gamma^{2})$. For the $d=2$ case, our QEC scheme is identical to the known example of the $4$-qubit code and the associated syndrome-based recovery.
  We also assess the performance of our class of codes using the Petz recovery map and note some interesting deviations from the qubit case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an architecture for neural quantum states for many-body quantum-mechanical systems, based on normalizing flows. The use of normalizing flows enables efficient uncorrelated sampling of configurations from the probability distribution defined by the wavefunction, mitigating a major cost of using neural states in simulation. We demonstrate the use of this architecture for both ground-state preparation (for self-interacting particles in a harmonic trap) and real-time evolution (for one-dimensional tunneling). Finally, we detail a procedure for obtaining rigorous estimates of the systematic error when using neural states to approximate quantum evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to significantly advance scientific discovery by finding solutions beyond human capabilities. However, these super-human solutions are often unintuitive and require considerable effort to uncover underlying principles, if possible at all. Here, we show how a code-generating language model trained on synthetic data can not only find solutions to specific problems but can create meta-solutions, which solve an entire class of problems in one shot and simultaneously offer insight into the underlying design principles. Specifically, for the design of new quantum physics experiments, our sequence-to-sequence transformer architecture generates interpretable Python code that describes experimental blueprints for a whole class of quantum systems. We discover general and previously unknown design rules for infinitely large classes of quantum states. The ability to automatically generate generalized patterns in readable computer code is a crucial step toward machines that help discover new scientific understanding -- one of the central aims of physics.</description>

      <title>Velocity Scanning Tomography for Room-Temperature Quantum Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulation offers an analog approach for exploring exotic quantum phenomena using controllable platforms, typically necessitating ultracold temperatures to maintain the quantum coherence. Superradiance lattices (SLs) have been harnessed to simulate coherent topological physics at room temperature, but the thermal motion of atoms remains a notable challenge in accurately measuring the physical quantities. To overcome this obstacle, we invent and validate a velocity scanning tomography technique to discern the responses of atoms with different velocities, allowing cold-atom spectroscopic resolution within room-temperature SLs. By comparing absorption spectra with and without atoms moving at specific velocities, we can derive the Wannier-Stark ladders of the SL across various effective static electric fields, their strengths being proportional to the atomic velocities. We extract the Zak phase of the SL by monitoring the ladder frequency shift as a function of the atomic velocity, effectively demonstrating the topological winding of the energy bands. Our research signifies the feasibility of room-temperature quantum simulation and facilitates their applications in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>The computational power of random quantum circuits in arbitrary geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical evidence for a gap between the computational powers of classical and quantum computers has been provided by experiments that sample the output distributions of two-dimensional quantum circuits. Many attempts to close this gap have utilized classical simulations based on tensor network techniques, and their limitations shed light on the improvements to quantum hardware required to frustrate classical simulability. In particular, quantum computers having in excess of $\sim 50$ qubits are primarily vulnerable to classical simulation due to restrictions on their gate fidelity and their connectivity, the latter determining how many gates are required (and therefore how much infidelity is suffered) in generating highly-entangled states. Here, we describe recent hardware upgrades to Quantinuum's H2 quantum computer enabling it to operate on up to $56$ qubits with arbitrary connectivity and $99.843(5)\%$ two-qubit gate fidelity. Utilizing the flexible connectivity of H2, we present data from random circuit sampling in highly connected geometries, doing so at unprecedented fidelities and a scale that appears to be beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art classical algorithms. The considerable difficulty of classically simulating H2 is likely limited only by qubit number, demonstrating the promise and scalability of the QCCD architecture as continued progress is made towards building larger machines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin-orbit coupling (SOC) affecting the center of mass of ultracold atoms can be simulated using a properly chosen periodic sequence of magnetic pulses. Yet such a method is generally accompanied by micro-motion which hinders a precise control of atomic dynamics and thus complicating practical applications. Here we show how to by-pass the micro-motion emerging in the magnetically induced SOC by switching on and off properly the oscillating magnetic fields at the initial and final times. We consider the exact dynamics of the system and demonstrate that the overall dynamics can be immune to the micro-motion. The exact dynamics is shown to agree well with the evolution of the system described by slowly changing effective Floquet Hamiltonian including the SOC term. The agreement is shown to be the best when the phase of the periodic driving takes a specific value for which the effect of the spin-orbit coupling is maximum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What can be measured by an observer in our universe? We address this question by constructing an algebra of gravitationally-dressed observables accessible to a comoving observer in FLRW spacetimes that are asymptotically de Sitter in the past, describing an inflationary epoch. An essential quantized degree of freedom is the zero-mode of the inflaton, which leads to fluctuations in the effective cosmological constant during inflation and prevents the existence of a maximum entropy state in the semiclassical limit. Due to the inaccessibility of measurements beyond our cosmological horizon, we demonstrate that all states are mixed with well-defined von Neumann entropy. For semiclassical states, the von Neumann entropy corresponds to the generalized entropy (up to a state-independent constant) of the observer's causal diamond, a fine-grained quantity that is sensitive to the initial conditions of the universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of quantum phases in moir\'e systems has drawn intense experimental and theoretical efforts. The realization of honeycomb symmetry has been a recent focus. The combination of strong interaction and honeycomb symmetry can lead to exotic electronic states such as fractional Chern insulator, unconventional superconductor, and quantum spin liquid. Accurate computations in such systems, with reliable treatment of strong long-ranged Coulomb interaction and approaching the large system sizes to extract thermodynamic phases, are mostly missing. We study the two-dimensional electron gas on a honeycomb moir\'e lattice at quarter filling, using fixed-phase diffusion Monte Carlo. The ground state phases of this important model are determined in the parameter regime relevant to current experiments. With increasing moir\'e potential, the systems transitions from a paramagnetic metal to an itinerant ferromagnetic semimetal and then a charge-density-wave insulator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper unites two research lines. The first involves finding categorical models of quantum programming languages and their type systems. The second line concerns the program of quantization of mathematical structures, which amounts to finding noncommutative generalizations (also called quantum generalizations) of these structures. Using a quantization method called discrete quantization, which essentially amounts to the internalization of structures in a category of von Neumann algebras and quantum relations, we find a noncommutative generalization of $\omega$-complete partial orders (cpos), called quantum cpos. Cpos are central in domain theory, and are widely used to construct categorical models of programming languages. We show that quantum cpos have similar categorical properties to cpos and are therefore suitable for the construction of categorical models for quantum programming languages, which is illustrated with some examples. For this reason, quantum cpos may form the backbone of a future quantum domain theory.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the concept of the quark quasi-fragmentation function (qFF) using an equal-time and spatially boosted form of the Collins-Soper fragmentation function (FF) where the out-meson fragment is replaced by the current asymptotic condition. We derive the qFF for a fermion in two-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED2) using the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian after a mapping onto spin qubits in a spatial lattice with open boundary conditions. This form is suitable for quantum computations. We compute the qFF by exact diagonalization of the spin Hamiltonian. The results are compared to the qFF following from the Drell-Levy-Yan (DLY) result for QED2, both at strong and weak coupling, and to two-dimensional quantum chromodynamics (QCD2) in the lowest Fock approximation.</description>

      <title>A table-top high-sensitivity gyroscope based on slow light and cavity enhanced photon drag</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A high-sensitivity gyroscope is vital for both investigation of the fundamental physics and monitor of the subtle variation of Earth's behaviors. However, it is challenge to realize a portable gyroscope with sensitivity approaching a small fraction of the Earth's rotation rate. Here, we theoretically propose a method for implementing a table-top gyroscope with remarkably high sensitivity based on photon drag in a rotating dielectric object. By inserting an $\text{Er}^{3+}$-doped glass rod in a Fabry-P\'{e}rot optical cavity with only 20 cm length, we theoretically show that the giant group refractive index and the narrowing cavity linewidth due to slow light can essentially increase the nonreciprocal phase shift due to the photon drag to achieve a rotation sensitivity of $26$ frad/s/$\sqrt{Hz}$. This work paves the way to accurately detect tiny variations of the Earth's rotation rate and orientation, and even can test the geodetic and frame-dragging effects predicted by the general relativity with a small-volume equipment.</description>

      <title>Gifts from long-range interaction: Emergent gapless topological behaviors in quantum spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topology in condensed matter physics is typically associated with a bulk energy gap. However, recent research has shifted focus to topological phases without a bulk energy gap, exhibiting nontrivial gapless topological behaviors. In this letter, we explore a cluster Ising chain with long-range antiferromagnetic interactions that decay as a power law with the distance. Using complementary numerical and analytical techniques, we demonstrate that long-range interactions can unambiguously induce an algebraic topological phase and a topological Gaussian universality, both of which exhibit nontrivial gapless topological behaviors. Our study not only provides a platform to investigate the fundamental physics of quantum many-body systems but also offers a novel route toward searching for gapless topological phases in realistic quantum simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a generalization of the quantum volume operator quantifying the volume in curved three-dimensional discrete geometries. In its standard form, the quantum volume operator is constructed from tetrahedra whose faces are endowed with irreducible representations of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$. Here, we show two equivalent constructions that allow general objects in fusion categories as degrees of freedom. First, we compute the volume operator for ribbon fusion categories. This includes the important class of modular tensor categories (such as quantum doubles), which are the building blocks of anyon models. Second, we further generalize the volume operator to spherical fusion categories by relaxing the categorical analog of the closure constraint (known as tetrahedral symmetry). In both cases, we obtain a volume operator that is Hermitian, provided that the input category is unitary. As an illustrative example, we consider the case of $\mathrm{SU}(2)_k$ and show that the standard $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ volume operator is recovered in the limit $k\rightarrow\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02127v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic energy-momentum and spin densities of relativistic spin hydrodynamics are obtained from the ensemble average of their respective microscopic definitions (quantum operators). These microscopic definitions suffer from ambiguities, meaning that, one may obtain different forms of symmetric energy-momentum tensor and spin tensor through pseudogauge transformations (or in other words Belinfante improvement procedure). However, this ambiguity can be removed if we obtain these currents using Noether's second theorem instead of widely used Noether's first theorem. In this article, we use Noether's second theorem to derive energy-momentum and spin currents without the need of pseudogauge transformations for free Dirac massive particles with spin one-half.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A collective spin model is used to describe two species of mutually interacting ultracold bosonic atoms confined to a toroidal trap. The system is modeled by a Hamiltonian that can be split into two components, a linear part and a quadratic part, which may be controlled independently. We show the linear component is an analog of a Zeeman Hamiltonian, and the quadratic component presents a macroscopic simulator for spin-orbit and hyperfine interactions. We determine a complete set of commuting observables for both the linear and quadratic Hamiltonians, and derive analytical expressions for their respective spectra and density of states. We determine the conditions for generating maximal entanglement between the two species of atoms with a view to applications involving quantum correlations among spin degrees of freedom, such as in the area of quantum information.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature entanglement of the nickel-radical molecular complex (Et3NH)[Ni(hfac)2L]</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bipartite entanglement is comprehensively investigated in the mononuclear molecular complex (Et3NH)[Ni(hfac)2L]L, where HL denotes 2-(2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-5-nitrophenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-3-oxide-1-oxyl and hfacH stands for hexafluoroacetylacetone. From the magnetic point of view, the molecular compound (Et3NH)[Ni(hfac)2L] consists of an exchange-coupled spin-1 Ni2+ magnetic ion and a spin-1/2 nitronyl-nitroxide radical substituted nitrophenol. The nickel-radical molecular complex affords an experimental realization of a mixed spin-(1/2, 1) Heisenberg dimer with a strong antiferromagnetic exchange coupling J/kB = 505 K and two distinct g-factors gRad=2.005 and gNi=2.275. By adopting this set of magnetic parameters we demonstrate that the Zeeman splitting of a quantum ferrimagnetic ground-state doublet due to a weak magnetic field may substantially reinforce the strength of bipartite entanglement at low temperatures. The molecular compound (Et3NH)[Ni(hfac)2L] maintains sufficiently strong thermal entanglement even at room temperature, vanishing only above 546 K. Specifically, the thermal entanglement in the nickel-radical molecular complex retains approximately 40% of the maximum value corresponding to perfectly entangled Bell states at room temperature, which implies that this magnetic compound provides suitable platform of a molecular qubit with potential implications for room-temperature quantum computation and quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents the Nordic-Estonian Quantum Computing e-Infrastructure Quest - NordIQuEst - an international collaboration of scientific and academic organizations from Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, working together to develop a hybrid High-Performance and Quantum Computing (HPC+QC) infrastructure. The project leverages existing and upcoming classical high-performance computing and quantum computing systems, facilitating the development of interconnected systems. Our effort pioneers a forward-looking architecture for both hardware and software capabilities, representing an early-stage development in hybrid computing infrastructure. Here, we detail the outline of the initiative, summarizing the progress since the project outset, and describing the framework established. Moreover, we identify the crucial challenges encountered, and potential strategies employed to address them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study bounce solutions and associated negative modes in the class of piecewise linear triangular-shaped potentials that may be viewed as approximations of smooth potentials. In these simple potentials, the bounce solution and action can be obtained analytically for a general spacetime dimension $D$. The eigenequations for the fluctuations around the bounce are universal and have the form of a Schr\"odinger-like equation with delta-function potentials. This Schr\"odinger equation is solved exactly for the negative modes whose number is confirmed to be one. The latter result may justify the usefulness of such piecewise linear potentials in the study of false vacuum decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear optics plays an important role in many areas of science and technology. The advance of nonlinear optics is empowered by the discovery and utilization of materials with growing optical nonlinearity. Here we demonstrate an indium gallium phosphide (InGaP) integrated photonics platform for broadband, ultra-efficient second-order nonlinear optics. The InGaP nanophotonic waveguide enables second-harmonic generation with a normalized efficiency of $128,000\%$/W/cm$^2$ at 1.55 $\mu$m pump wavelength, nearly two orders of magnitude higher than the state of the art in the telecommunication C band. Further, we realize an ultra-bright, broadband time-energy entangled photon source with a pair generation rate of 97 GHz/mW and a bandwidth of 115 nm centered at the telecommunication C band. The InGaP entangled photon source shows high coincidence-to-accidental counts ratio CAR $&gt;10^4$ and two-photon interference visibility $&gt;98\%$. The InGaP second-order nonlinear photonics platform will have wide-ranging implications for non-classical light generation, optical signal processing, and quantum networking.</description>

      <title>Toeplitz non-liquids and Toeplitz braiding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of $3$D non-liquid states called ``Toeplitz non-liquids''. These states consist of a stack of $2$D twisted $\mathbb{Z}_N$ topologically ordered layers along the $z$-direction; nearby layers are coupled while keeping translational symmetry along $z$. The effective field theory is described by infinite Chern-Simons (iCS) theory, with a coefficient matrix called ``$K$-matrix'' that is of block-tridiagonal Toeplitz matrix-type. With open boundary conditions (OBC) along the $z$-direction, certain $K$-matrices exhibit an exotic phenomenon called ``Toeplitz braiding'', where the mutual braiding statistical phase between two anyons at opposite boundaries oscillates and remains non-zero in the thermodynamic limit. As a necessary condition, this requires boundary zero modes in the $K$-matrix spectrum under OBC. A key example is the $K$-matrix resembling the Hamiltonian of the $1$D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger insulator. Since the gauge invariance of Chern-Simons theory guarantees integer quantized entries for $K$-matrices, no usual global symmetries are needed to protect these zero modes or Toeplitz braiding. In order to obtain the general theory, we categorize $K$-matrices that support Toeplitz braiding into three types and analyze the conditions for each. We further numerically study the analytical results for all types of $K$-matrices. For comparison, a trivial case is numerically shown, where the mutual statistical phase angle decays exponentially to zero in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of high-temperature superconducting materials by implementing strongly correlated fermionic models in optical lattices is one of the major objectives in the field of analog quantum simulation. Here we show that local control and optical bilayer capabilities create a versatile toolbox to study both nickelate and cuprate high-temperature superconductors. On the one hand, we present a scheme to implement a mixed-dimensional (mixD) bilayer model that has been proposed to capture the essential pairing physics of pressurized bilayer nickelates. This allows for the long-sought realization of a state with long-range superconducting order in current lattice quantum simulation machines. In particular, we show how coherent pairing correlations can be accessed in a partially particle-hole transformed and rotated basis. On the other hand, we demonstrate that control of local gates enables the observation of $d$-wave pairing order in the two-dimensional (single-layer) repulsive Fermi-Hubbard model through the simulation of a system with attractive interactions. Lastly, we introduce a scheme to measure momentum-resolved dopant densities, providing access to observables complementary to solid-state experiments -- which is of particular interest for future studies of the enigmatic pseudogap phase appearing in cuprates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.13557v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new scheme for quantum circuit design called controlled gate networks. Rather than trying to reduce the complexity of individual unitary operations, the new strategy is to toggle between all of the unitary operations needed with the fewest number of gates. We illustrate our approach using two examples. The first example is a variational subspace calculation for a two-qubit system. We demonstrate an approximately five-fold reduction in the number of two-qubit gates required for computing inner products and Hamiltonian matrix elements. The second example is estimating the eigenvalues of a two-qubit Hamiltonian via the Rodeo Algorithm using a specific class of controlled gate networks called controlled reversal gates. Again, a fivefold reduction in the number of two-qubit gates is demonstrated. We use the Quantinuum H1-2 and IBM Perth devices to realize the quantum circuits. Our work demonstrates that controlled gate networks are a useful tool for reducing gate complexity in quantum algorithms for quantum many-body problems.</description>

Abstract: Gate-set tomography (GST) characterizes the process matrix of quantum logic gates, along with measurement and state preparation errors in quantum processors. GST typically requires extensive data collection and significant computational resources for model estimation. We propose a more efficient GST approach for qudits, utilizing the qudit Hadamard and virtual Z gates to construct fiducials while assuming virtual Z gates are error-free. Our method reduces the computational costs of estimating characterization results, making GST more practical at scale. We experimentally demonstrate the applicability of this approach on a superconducting transmon qutrit.</description>

Abstract: Time-dependent linear differential equations are a common type of problem that needs to be solved in classical physics. Here we provide a quantum algorithm for solving time-dependent linear differential equations with logarithmic dependence of the complexity on the error and derivative. As usual, there is an exponential improvement over classical approaches in the scaling of the complexity with the dimension, with the caveat that the solution is encoded in the amplitudes of a quantum state. Our method is to encode the Dyson series in a system of linear equations, then solve via the optimal quantum linear equation solver. Our method also provides a simplified approach in the case of time-independent differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the regularized compressed double factorization (RC-DF) method to classically compute compressed representations of molecular Hamiltonians that enable efficient simulation with noisy intermediate scale (NISQ) and error corrected quantum algorithms. We find that already for small systems with 12 to 20 qubits, the resulting NISQ measurement scheme reduces the number of measurement bases by roughly a factor of three and the shot count to reach chemical accuracy by a factor of three to six compared to truncated double factorization (DF) and we see order of magnitude improvements over Pauli grouping schemes. We demonstrate the scalability of our approach by performing RC-DF on the CpdI species of cytochrome P450 with 58 orbitals and find that using the resulting compressed Hamiltonian cuts the run time of qubitization and truncated DF based error corrected algorithms almost in half and even outperforms the lambda parameters achievable with tensor hypercontraction (THC) while at the same time reducing the CCSD(T) energy error heuristic by an order of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: Quantum teleportation is a quantum communication primitive that allows a long-distance quantum channel to be built using pre-shared entanglement and one-way classical communication. However, the quality of the established channel crucially depends on the quality of the pre-shared entanglement. In this work, we revisit the problem of using noisy entanglement for the task of teleportation. We first show how this problem can be rephrased as a state discrimination problem. In this picture, a quantitative duality between teleportation and dense coding emerges in which every Alice-to-Bob teleportation protocol can be repurposed as a Bob-to-Alice dense coding protocol, and the quality of each protocol can be measured by the success probability in the same state discrimination problem. One of our main results provides a complete characterization of the states that offer no advantage in one-way teleportation protocols over classical states, thereby offering a new and intriguing perspective on the long-standing open problem of identifying such states. This also yields a new proof of the known fact that bound entangled states cannot exceed the classical teleportation threshold. Moreover, our established duality between teleportation and dense coding can be used to show that the exact same states are unable to provide a non-classical advantage for dense coding as well. We also discuss the duality from a communication capacity point of view, deriving upper and lower bounds on the accessible information of a dense coding protocol in terms of the fidelity of its associated teleportation protocol. A corollary of this discussion is a simple proof of the previously established fact that bound entangled states do not provide any advantage in dense coding.</description>

      <title>Complete positivity violation of the reduced dynamics in higher-order quantum adiabatic elimination</title>

Abstract: This paper discusses quantum adiabatic elimination, which is a model reduction technique for a composite Lindblad system consisting of a fast decaying sub-system coupled to another sub-system with a much slower timescale. Such a system features an invariant manifold that is close to the slow sub-system. This invariant manifold is reached subsequent to the decay of the fast degrees of freedom, after which the slow dynamics follow on it. By parametrizing invariant manifold, the slow dynamics can be simulated via a reduced model. To find the evolution of the reduced state, we perform the asymptotic expansion with respect to the timescale separation. So far, the second-order expansion has mostly been considered. It has then been revealed that the second-order expansion of the reduced dynamics is generally given by a Lindblad equation, which ensures complete positivity of the time evolution. In this paper, we present two examples where complete positivity of the reduced dynamics is violated with higher-order contributions. In the first example, the violation is detected for the evolution of the partial trace without truncation of the asymptotic expansion. The partial trace is not the only way to parametrize the slow dynamics. Concerning this non-uniqueness, it was conjectured in [R. Azouit, F. Chittaro, A. Sarlette, and P. Rouchon, Quantum Sci. Technol. 2, 044011 (2017)] that there exists a parameter choice ensuring complete positivity. With the second example, however, we refute this conjecture by showing that complete positivity cannot be restored in any choice of parametrization. We discuss these results in terms of unavoidable correlations, in the initial states on the invariant slow manifold, between the fast and the slow degrees of freedom.</description>

Abstract: There has been a growing interest in non-Hermitian quantum mechanics. The key concepts of quantum mechanics are quantum fluctuations. Quantum fluctuations of quantum fields confined in a finite-size system induce the zero-point energy shift. This quantum phenomenon, the Casimir effect, is one of the most striking phenomena of quantum mechanics in the sense that there are no classical analogs and has been attracting much attention beyond the hierarchy of energy scales, ranging from elementary particle physics to condensed matter physics, together with photonics. However, the non-Hermitian extension of the Casimir effect and the application to spintronics have not yet been investigated enough, although exploring energy sources and developing energy-efficient nanodevices are its central issues. Here we fill this gap. By developing a magnonic analog of the Casimir effect into non-Hermitian systems, we show that this non-Hermitian Casimir effect of magnons is enhanced as the Gilbert damping constant (i.e., the energy dissipation rate) increases. When the damping constant exceeds a critical value, the non-Hermitian Casimir effect of magnons exhibits an oscillating behavior, including a beating one, as a function of the film thickness and is characterized by the exceptional point. Our result suggests that energy dissipation serves as a key ingredient of Casimir engineering.</description>

      <title>Relating non-local quantum computation to information theoretic cryptography</title>

Abstract: Non-local quantum computation (NLQC) is a cheating strategy for position-verification schemes, and has appeared in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. Here, we connect NLQC to the wider context of information theoretic cryptography by relating it to a number of other cryptographic primitives. We show one special case of NLQC, known as $f$-routing, is equivalent to the quantum analogue of the conditional disclosure of secrets (CDS) primitive, where by equivalent we mean that a protocol for one task gives a protocol for the other with only small overhead in resource costs. We further consider another special case of position verification, which we call coherent function evaluation (CFE), and show CFE protocols induce similarly efficient protocols for the private simultaneous message passing (PSM) scenario. By relating position-verification to these cryptographic primitives, a number of results in the cryptography literature give new implications for NLQC, and vice versa. These include the first sub-exponential upper bounds on the worst case cost of $f$-routing of $2^{O(\sqrt{n\log n})}$ entanglement, the first example of an efficient $f$-routing strategy for a problem believed to be outside $P/poly$, linear lower bounds on entanglement for CDS in the quantum setting, linear lower bounds on communication cost of CFE, and efficient protocols for CDS in the quantum setting for functions that can be computed with quantum circuits of low $T$ depth.</description>

      <title>Probing multipartite entanglement through persistent homology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a study of multipartite entanglement through persistent homology, a tool used in topological data analysis. In persistent homology, a 1-parameter filtration of simplicial complexes called persistence complex is used to reveal persistent topological features of the underlying data set. This is achieved via the computation of homological invariants that can be visualized as a persistence barcode encoding all relevant topological information. In this work, we apply this technique to study multipartite quantum systems by interpreting the individual systems as vertices of a simplicial complex. To construct a persistence complex from a given multipartite quantum state, we use a generalization of the bipartite mutual information called the deformed total correlation. Computing the persistence barcodes of this complex yields a visualization or `topological fingerprint' of the multipartite entanglement in the quantum state. The barcodes can also be used to compute a topological summary called the integrated Euler characteristic of a persistence complex. We show that in our case this integrated Euler characteristic is equal to the deformed interaction information, another multipartite version of mutual information. When choosing the linear entropy as the underlying entropy, this deformed interaction information coincides with the $n$-tangle, a well-known entanglement measure. The persistence barcodes thus provide more fine-grained information about the entanglement structure than its topological summary, the $n$-tangle, alone, which we illustrate with examples of pairs of states with identical $n$-tangle but different barcodes. Furthermore, a variant of persistent homology computed relative to a fixed subset yields an interesting connection to strong subadditivity and entropy inequalities. We also comment on a possible generalization of our approach to arbitrary resource theories.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Variational Quantum Algorithms with Shifted Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given their potential to demonstrate near-term quantum advantage, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have been extensively studied. Although numerous techniques have been developed for VQA parameter optimization, it remains a significant challenge. A practical issue is that quantum noise is highly unstable and thus it is likely to shift in real time. This presents a critical problem as an optimized VQA ansatz may not perform effectively under a different noise environment. For the first time, we explore how to optimize VQA parameters to be robust against unknown shifted noise. We model the noise level as a random variable with an unknown probability density function (PDF), and we assume that the PDF may shift within an uncertainty set. This assumption guides us to formulate a distributionally robust optimization problem, with the goal of finding parameters that maintain effectiveness under shifted noise. We utilize a distributionally robust Bayesian optimization solver for our proposed formulation. This provides numerical evidence in both the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with hardware-efficient ansatz, indicating that we can identify parameters that perform more robustly under shifted noise. We regard this work as the first step towards improving the reliability of VQAs influenced by shifted noise from the parameter optimization perspective.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, a quantum computational framework for algebraic topology based on simplicial set theory is presented. This extends previous work, which was limited to simplicial complexes and aimed mostly to topological data analysis. The proposed set--up applies to any parafinite simplicial set and proceeds by associating with it a finite dimensional simplicial Hilbert space, whose simplicial operator structure is studied in some depth. It is shown in particular how the problem of determining the simplicial set's homology can be solved within the simplicial Hilbert framework. Further, the conditions under which simplicial set theoretic algorithms can be implemented in a quantum computational setting with finite resources are examined. Finally a quantum algorithmic scheme capable to compute the simplicial homology spaces and Betti numbers of a simplicial set combining a number of basic quantum algorithms is outlined.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the great success of classical generative models in machine learning, enthusiastic exploration of their quantum version has recently started. To depart on this journey, it is important to develop a relevant metric to evaluate the quality of quantum generative models; in the classical case, one such example is the (classical) inception score (cIS). In this paper, as a natural extension of cIS, we propose the quantum inception score (qIS) for quantum generators. Importantly, qIS relates the quality to the Holevo information of the quantum channel that classifies a given dataset. In this context, we show several properties of qIS. First, qIS is greater than or equal to the corresponding cIS, which is defined through projection measurements on the system output. Second, the difference between qIS and cIS arises from the presence of quantum coherence, as characterized by the resource theory of asymmetry. Third, when a set of entangled generators is prepared, there exists a classifying process leading to the further enhancement of qIS. Fourth, we harness the quantum fluctuation theorem to characterize the physical limitation of qIS. Finally, we apply qIS to assess the quality of the one-dimensional spin chain model as a quantum generative model, with the quantum convolutional neural network as a quantum classifier, for the phase classification problem in the quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional coherent spectrum of high-spin models via a quantum computing approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14035v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and benchmark a quantum computing approach to calculate the two-dimensional coherent spectrum (2DCS) of high-spin models. Our approach is based on simulating their real-time dynamics in the presence of several magnetic field pulses, which are spaced in time. We utilize the adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS) algorithm for the study due to its compact circuits, which enables simulations over sufficiently long times to achieve the required resolution in frequency space. Specifically, we consider an antiferromagnetic quantum spin model that incorporates Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and single-ion anisotropy. The obtained 2DCS spectra exhibit distinct peaks at multiples of the magnon frequency, arising from transitions between different eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian. By comparing the one-dimensional coherent spectrum with 2DCS, we demonstrate that 2DCS provides a higher resolution of the energy spectrum. We further investigate how the quantum resources scale with the magnitude of the spin using two different binary encodings of the high-spin operators: the standard binary encoding and the Gray code. At low magnetic fields both encodings require comparable quantum resources, but at larger field strengths the Gray code is advantageous. Numerical simulations for spin models with increasing number of sites indicate a polynomial system-size scaling for quantum resources. Lastly, we compare the numerical 2DCS with experimental results on a rare-earth orthoferrite system. The observed strength of the magnonic high-harmonic generation signals in the 2DCS of the quantum high-spin model aligns well with the experimental data, showing significant improvement over the corresponding mean-field results.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) method for optimizing quantum circuits using graph-theoretic simplification rules of ZX-diagrams. The agent, trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, employs Graph Neural Networks to approximate the policy and value functions. We demonstrate the capacity of our approach by comparing it against the best performing ZX-Calculus-based algorithm for the problem in hand. After training on small Clifford+T circuits of 5-qubits and few tenths of gates, the agent consistently improves the state-of-the-art for this type of circuits, for at least up to 80-qubit and 2100 gates, whilst remaining competitive in terms of computational performance. Additionally, we illustrate its versatility by targeting both total and two-qubit gate count reduction, conveying the potential of tailoring its reward function to the specific characteristics of each hardware backend. Our approach is ready to be used as a valuable tool for the implementation of quantum algorithms in the near-term intermediate-scale range (NISQ).</description>

Abstract: Studies of the dynamics of a quantum system coupled to baths are typically performed by utilizing the Nakajima-Zwanzig memory kernel (${\mathcal{K}}$) or the influence functions ($\mathbf{{I}}$), especially when the dynamics exhibit memory effects (i.e., non-Markovian). Despite their significance, the formal connection between the memory kernel and the influence functions has not been explicitly made. We reveal their relation by inspecting the system propagator for a broad class of problems where an $N$-level system is linearly coupled to Gaussian baths (bosonic, fermionic, and spin.) With this connection, we also show how approximate path integral methods can be understood in terms of approximate memory kernels. For a certain class of open quantum system problems, we devised a non-perturbative, diagrammatic approach to construct ${\mathcal{K}}$ from $\mathbf{{I}}$ for (driven) systems interacting with Gaussian baths without the use of any projection-free dynamics inputs required by standard approaches. Lastly, we demonstrate a Hamiltonian learning procedure to extract the bath spectral density from a set of reduced system trajectories obtained experimentally or by numerically exact methods, opening new avenues in quantum sensing and engineering. The insights we provide in this work will significantly advance the understanding of non-Markovian dynamics, and they will be an important stepping stone for theoretical and experimental developments in this area.</description>

Abstract: We report here on a major improvement of the control and characterization capabilities of 14N nuclear spin of single NV centers in diamond, as well as on a new method that we have devised for characterizing quantum states, i.e. quantum state tomography using Rabi experiments. Depending on whether we use amplitude information or phase information from Rabi experiments, we define two sub-methods namely Rabi amplitude quantum state tomography (RAQST) and Rabi phase quantum state tomography (RPQST). The advantage of Rabi-based tomography methods is that they lift the requirement of unitary operations used in other methods in general and standard methods in particular. On one hand, this does not increase the complexity of the tomography experiments in large registers, and on the other hand, it decreases the error induced by MW irradiation. We used RAQST and RPQST to investigate the quality of various two-qubit pure states in our setup. As expected, test quantum states show very high fidelity with the theoretical counterpart.</description>

Abstract: Embezzlement of entanglement refers to the counterintuitive possibility of extracting entangled quantum states from a reference state of an auxiliary system (the "embezzler") via local quantum operations while hardly perturbing the latter. We uncover a deep connection between the operational task of embezzling entanglement and the mathematical classification of von Neumann algebras. Our result implies that relativistic quantum fields are universal embezzlers: Any entangled state of any dimension can be embezzled from them with arbitrary precision. This provides an operational characterization of the infinite amount of entanglement present in the vacuum state of relativistic quantum field theories.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement-enhanced quantum metrology explores the utilization of quantum entanglement to enhance measurement precision. When particles in a probe are prepared into a quantum entangled state, they collectively accumulate information about the physical quantity to be measured, leading to an improvement in measurement precision beyond the standard quantum limit and approaching the Heisenberg limit. The rapid advancement of techniques for quantum manipulation and detection has enabled the generation, manipulation, and detection of multi-particle entangled states in synthetic quantum systems such as cold atoms and trapped ions. This article aims to review and illustrate the fundamental principles and experimental progresses that demonstrate multi-particle entanglement for quantum metrology, as well as discuss the potential applications of entanglement-enhanced quantum sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11751v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kinetic inductance traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (KI-TWPA) have a wide instantaneous bandwidth with near quantum-limited performance and a relatively high dynamic range. Because of this, they are suitable readout devices for cryogenic detectors and superconducting qubits and have a variety of applications in quantum sensing. This work discusses the design, fabrication, and performance of a KI-TWPA based on four-wave mixing in a NbTiN microstrip transmission line. This device amplifies a signal band from 4 to 8~GHz without contamination from image tones, which are produced in a separate higher frequency band. The 4 - 8~GHz band is commonly used to read out cryogenic detectors, such as microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs) and Josephson junction-based qubits. We report a measured maximum gain of over 20 dB using four-wave mixing with a 1-dB gain compression point of -58 dBm at 15 dB of gain over that band. The bandwidth and peak gain are tunable by adjusting the pump-tone frequency and power. Using a Y-factor method, we measure an amplifier-added noise of $ 0.5 \leq N_{added} \leq 1.5$ photons from 4.5 - 8 GHz.</description>

      <title>Quantum bounds for compiled XOR games and $d$-outcome CHSH games</title>

Abstract: Nonlocal games play a crucial role in quantum information theory and have numerous applications in certification and cryptographic protocols. Kalai et al. (STOC 2023) introduced a procedure to compile a nonlocal game into a single-prover interactive proof, using a quantum homomorphic encryption scheme, and showed that their compilation method preserves the classical bound of the game. Natarajan and Zhang (FOCS 2023) then showed that the quantum bound is preserved for the specific case of the CHSH game. Extending the proof techniques of Natarajan and Zhang, we show that the compilation procedure of Kalai et al. preserves the quantum bound for two classes of games: XOR games and d-outcome CHSH games. We also establish that, for any pair of qubit measurements, there exists an XOR game such that its optimal winning probability serves as a self-test for that particular pair of measurements.</description>

      <title>Entangled Photon-pair Generation in Nonlinear Thin-films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a fully vectorial and non-paraxial formalism to describe spontaneous parametric down-conversion in nonlinear thin films. The formalism is capable of treating slabs with a sub-wavelength thickness, describe the associated Fabry-P\'erot effects, and even treat absorptive nonlinear materials. With this formalism, we perform an in-depth study of the dynamics of entangled photon-pair generation in nonlinear thin films, to provide a needed theoretical understanding for such systems that have recently attracted much experimental attention as sources of photon pairs. As an important example, we study the far-field radiation properties of photon pairs generated from a high-refractive-index nonlinear thin-film with Zinc-Blende structure, that is deposited on a linear low-refractive-index substrate. In particular, we study the thickness-dependent effect of Fabry-P\'erot interferences on the far-field radiation pattern of the photon pairs. We also pay special attention to study of entanglement generation, and find the conditions under which maximally polarization-entangled photon pairs can be generated and detected in such nonlinear thin-films.</description>

      <title>Fusion of deterministically generated photonic graph states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement has evolved from an enigmatic concept of quantum physics to a key ingredient of quantum technology. It explains correlations between measurement outcomes that contradict classical physics, and has been widely explored with small sets of individual qubits. Multi-partite entangled states build up in gate-based quantum-computing protocols, and $\unicode{x2013}$ from a broader perspective $\unicode{x2013}$ were proposed as the main resource for measurement-based quantum-information processing. The latter requires the ex-ante generation of a multi-qubit entangled state described by a graph. Small graph states such as Bell or linear cluster states have been produced with photons, but the proposed quantum computing and quantum networking applications require fusion of such states into larger and more powerful states in a programmable fashion. Here we achieve this goal by employing an optical resonator containing two individually addressable atoms. Ring and tree graph states with up to eight qubits, with the names reflecting the entanglement topology, are efficiently fused from the photonic states emitted by the individual atoms. The fusion process itself employs a cavity-assisted gate between the two atoms. Our technique is in principle scalable to even larger numbers of qubits, and is the decisive step towards, for instance, a memory-less quantum repeater in a future quantum internet.</description>

      <title>Jaynes-Cummings atoms coupled to a structured environment: Leakage elimination operators and the Petz recovery maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model embedded in a structured environment, where the atom inside an optical cavity will be affected by a hierarchical environment consisting of the cavity and its environment. We propose several effective strategies to control and suppress the decoherence effects to protect the quantum coherence of the JC atom. We study the non-perturbative control of the system dynamics by means of the leakage elimination operators. We also investigate a full quantum state reversal scheme by engineering the system and its coupling to the bath via the Petz recovery map. Our findings conclude that, with the Petz recovery map, the dynamics of the JC atom can be fully recovered regardless of Markov or non-Markovian noises. Finally, we show that our quantum control and recovery methods are effective at protecting different aspects of the system coherence.</description>

      <title>Evaluating extractable work of quantum batteries via entropic uncertainty relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of entropic uncertainty relations (EURs) in discerning the energy variation in quantum batteries (QBs) modelled by battery-charger-field in the presence of bosonic and fermionic reservoirs. Our results suggest that the extractable works (exergy and ergotropy) have versatile characteristics in different scenarios, resulting in a complex relationship between tightness and extractable work. It is worth noting that the tightness of the lower bound of entropic uncertainty can be a good indicator for energy conversion efficiency in charging QBs. Furthermore, we disclose how the EUR including uncertainty and lower bound contributes to energy conversion efficiency in the QB system. It is believed that these findings will be beneficial for better understanding the role of quantum uncertainty in evaluating quantum battery performance.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-swapping in generalised probabilistic theories, and iterated CHSH games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While there exist theories that have states "more strongly entangled" than quantum theory, in the sense that they show CHSH values above Tsirelson's bound, all known examples of such theories have a strictly smaller set of measurements. Therefore, in tasks which require both bipartite states and measurements, they do not perform better than QM. One of the simplest information processing tasks involving both bipartite states and measurements is that of entanglement swapping. In this paper, we study entanglement swapping in generalised probabilistic theories (GPTs). In particular, we introduce the iterated CHSH game, which measures the power of a GPT to preserve non-classical correlations, in terms of the largest CHSH value obtainable after $n$ rounds of entanglement swapping. Our main result is the construction of a GPT that achieves a CHSH value of $4$ after an arbitrary number of rounds. This addresses a question about the optimality of quantum theory for such games recently raised in the literature. One challenge faced when treating this problem is that there seems to be no general framework for constructing GPTs in which entanglement swapping is a well-defined operation. Therefore, we introduce an algorithmic construction that turns a bipartite GPT into a multipartite GPT that supports entanglement swapping, if consistently possible.</description>

Abstract: The standard way to generate many-body quantum correlations is via a dynamical protocol: an initial product state is transformed by interactions that generate non-classical correlations at later times. Here, we show that many-body Bell correlations are inherently present in the eigenstates of a variety of spin-1/2 chains. In particular, we show that the eigenstates and thermal states of the collective Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model possess many-body Bell correlations. We demonstrate that the Bell correlations can take on quantized values that change discontinuously with variations in the total magnetization. Finally, we show that these many-body Bell correlations persist even in the presence of both diagonal and off-diagonal disorder.</description>

      <title>Learning topological states from randomized measurements using variational tensor network tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning faithful representations of quantum states is crucial to fully characterizing the variety of many-body states created on quantum processors. While various tomographic methods such as classical shadow and MPS tomography have shown promise in characterizing a wide class of quantum states, they face unique limitations in detecting topologically ordered two-dimensional states. To address this problem, we implement and study a heuristic tomographic method that combines variational optimization on tensor networks with randomized measurement techniques. Using this approach, we demonstrate its ability to learn the ground state of the surface code Hamiltonian as well as an experimentally realizable quantum spin liquid state. In particular, we perform numerical experiments using MPS ans\"atze and systematically investigate the sample complexity required to achieve high fidelities for systems of sizes up to $48$ qubits. In addition, we provide theoretical insights into the scaling of our learning algorithm by analyzing the statistical properties of maximum likelihood estimation. Notably, our method is sample-efficient and experimentally friendly, only requiring snapshots of the quantum state measured randomly in the $X$ or $Z$ bases. Using this subset of measurements, our approach can effectively learn any real pure states represented by tensor networks, and we rigorously prove that random-$XZ$ measurements are tomographically complete for such states.</description>

      <title>Application of ZX-calculus to Quantum Architecture Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to quantum architecture search by integrating the techniques of ZX-calculus with Genetic Programming (GP) to optimize the structure of parameterized quantum circuits employed in Quantum Machine Learning (QML). Recognizing the challenges in designing efficient quantum circuits for QML, we propose a GP framework that utilizes mutations defined via ZX-calculus, a graphical language that can simplify visualizing and working with quantum circuits. Our methodology focuses on evolving quantum circuits with the aim of enhancing their capability to approximate functions relevant in various machine learning tasks. We introduce several mutation operators inspired by the transformation rules of ZX-calculus and investigate their impact on the learning efficiency and accuracy of quantum circuits. The empirical analysis involves a comparative study where these mutations are applied to a diverse set of quantum regression problems, measuring performance metrics such as the percentage of valid circuits after the mutation, improvement of the objective, as well as circuit depth and width. Our results indicate that certain ZX-calculus-based mutations perform significantly better than others for Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) in all metrics considered. They suggest that ZX-diagram based QAS results in shallower circuits and more uniformly allocated gates than crude genetic optimization based on the circuit model.</description>

      <title>Quantized tensor networks for solving the Vlasov-Maxwell equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07756v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Vlasov-Maxwell equations provide an \textit{ab-initio} description of collisionless plasmas, but solving them is often impractical because of the wide range of spatial and temporal scales that must be resolved and the high dimensionality of the problem. In this work, we present a quantum-inspired semi-implicit Vlasov-Maxwell solver that utilizes the quantized tensor network (QTN) framework. With this QTN solver, the cost of grid-based numerical simulation of size $N$ is reduced from $\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(D))$, where $D$ is the ``rank'' or ``bond dimension'' of the QTN and is typically set to be much smaller than $N$. We find that for the five-dimensional test problems considered here, a modest $D=64$ appears to be sufficient for capturing the expected physics despite the simulations using a total of $N=2^{36}$ grid points, \edit{which would require $D=2^{18}$ for full-rank calculations}. Additionally, we observe that a QTN time evolution scheme based on the Dirac-Frenkel variational principle allows one to use somewhat larger time steps than prescribed by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) constraint. As such, this work demonstrates that the QTN format is a promising means of approximately solving the Vlasov-Maxwell equations with significantly reduced cost.</description>

      <title>Two dimensional quantum lattice models via mode optimized hybrid CPU-GPU density matrix renormalization group method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a hybrid numerical approach to simulate quantum many body problems on two spatial dimensional quantum lattice models via the non-Abelian ab initio version of the density matrix renormalization group method on state-of-the-art high performance computing infrastructures. We demonstrate for the two dimensional spinless fermion model and for the Hubbard model on torus geometry that altogether several orders of magnitude in computational time can be saved by performing calculations on an optimized basis and by utilizing hybrid CPU-multiGPU parallelization. At least an order of magnitude reduction in computational complexity results from mode optimization, while a further order of reduction in wall time is achieved by massive parallelization. Our results are measured directly in FLOP and seconds. A detailed scaling analysis of the obtained performance as a function of matrix ranks and as a function of system size up to $12\times 12$ lattice topology is discussed. Our CPU-multiGPU model also tremendously accelerates the calculation of the one- and two-particle reduced density matrices, which can be used to construct various order parameters and trace quantum phase transitions with high fidelity.</description>

      <title>Embezzlement of entanglement, quantum fields, and the classification of von Neumann algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum information theoretic task of embezzlement of entanglement in the setting of von Neumann algebras. Given a shared entangled resource state, this task asks to produce arbitrary entangled states using local operations without communication while perturbing the resource arbitrarily little. We quantify the performance of a given resource state by the worst-case error. States for which the latter vanishes are 'embezzling states' as they allow to embezzle arbitrary entangled states with arbitrarily small error. The best and worst performance among all states defines two algebraic invariants for von Neumann algebras. The first invariant takes only two values. Either it vanishes and embezzling states exist, which can only happen in type III, or no state allows for nontrivial embezzlement. In the case of factors not of finite type I, the second invariant equals the diameter of the state space. This provides a quantitative operational interpretation of Connes' classification of type III factors within quantum information theory. Type III$_1$ factors are 'universal embezzlers' where every state is embezzling. Our findings have implications for relativistic quantum field theory, where type III algebras naturally appear. For instance, they explain the maximal violation of Bell inequalities in the vacuum. Our results follow from a one-to-one correspondence between embezzling states and invariant probability measures on the flow of weights. We also establish that universally embezzling ITPFI factors are of type III$_1$ by elementary arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying complexity in quantum systems has witnessed a surge of interest in recent years, with Krylov-based measures such as Krylov complexity ($C_K$) and Spread complexity ($C_S$) gaining prominence. In this study, we investigate their interplay by considering the complexity of states represented by density matrix operators. After setting up the problem, we analyze a handful of analytical and numerical examples spanning generic two-dimensional Hilbert spaces, qubit states, quantum harmonic oscillators, and random matrix theories, uncovering insightful relationships. For generic pure states, our analysis reveals two key findings: (I) a correspondence between moment-generating functions (of Lanczos coefficients) and survival amplitudes, and (II) an early-time equivalence between $C_K$ and $2C_S$. Furthermore, for maximally entangled pure states, we find that the moment-generating function of $C_K$ becomes the Spectral Form Factor and, at late-times, $C_K$ is simply related to $NC_S$ for $N\geq2$ within the $N$-dimensional Hilbert space. Notably, we confirm that $C_K = 2C_S$ holds across all times when $N=2$. Through the lens of random matrix theories, we also discuss deviations between complexities at intermediate times and highlight subtleties in the averaging approach at the level of the survival amplitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recently developed dynamic mean-field theory for disordered spins (spinDMFT) is shown to capture the spin dynamics of nuclear spins very well. The key quantities are the spin autocorrelations. In order to compute the free induction decay (FID), pair correlations are needed in addition. They can be computed on spin clusters of moderate size which are coupled to the dynamic mean fields determined in a first step by spinDMFT. We dub this versatile approach non-local spinDMFT (nl-spinDMFT). It is a particular asset of nl-spinDMFT that one knows from where the contributions to the FID stem. We illustrate the strengths of nl-spinDMFT in comparison to experimental data for CaF$_2$. Furthermore, spinDMFT provides the dynamic mean fields explaining the FID of the nuclear spins of $^{13}$C in adamantane up to some static noise. The spin Hahn echo in adamantane is free from effects of static noise and agrees excellently with the spinDMFT results without further fitting.</description>

Abstract: There is currently significant interest in emulating the essential characteristics of black holes, such as their Hawking radiation or their optimal scrambling behavior, using condensed matter models. In this article, we investigate a chiral spin-chain, whose mean field theory effectively captures the behavior of Dirac fermions in the curved spacetime geometry of a black hole. We find that within the region of the chain that describe the interior of the black hole, strong correlations prevail giving rise to many-body chaotic dynamics. Employing out-of-time-order correlations as a diagnostic tool, we numerically compute the associated Lyapunov exponent. Intriguingly, we observe a linear increase in the Lyapunov exponent with temperature within the black hole's interior at low temperatures, indicative of optimal scrambling behavior. This contrasts with the quadratic temperature dependence exhibited by the spin-chain on the region outside the black hole. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the interplay between black hole geometry and quantum chaos, offering insights into fundamental aspects of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Interacting chiral fermions on the lattice with matrix product operator norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10285</link>

Abstract: We develop a Hamiltonian formalism for simulating interacting chiral fermions on the lattice while preserving unitarity and locality and without breaking the chiral symmetry. The fermion doubling problem is circumvented by constructing a Fock space endowed with a semi-definite norm. When projecting our theory on the the single-particle sector, we recover the framework of Stacey fermions, and we demonstrate that the scaling limit of the free model recovers the chiral fermion field. Technically, we make use of a matrix product operator norm to mimick the boundary of a higher dimensional topological theory. As a proof of principle, we consider a single Weyl fermion on a periodic ring with Hubbard-type nearest-neighbor interactions and construct a variational generalized DMRG code to demonstrate that the ground state for large system sizes can be determined efficiently. As our tensor network approach does not exhibit any sign problem, we can add a chemical potential and study real-time evolution.</description>
