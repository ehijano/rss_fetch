      <title>Theory of ab initio downfolding with arbitrary range electron-phonon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ab initio downfolding describes the electronic structure of materials within a low-energy subspace, often around the Fermi level. Typically starting from mean-field calculations, this framework allows for the calculation of one- and two-electron interactions, and the parametrization of a many-body Hamiltonian representing the active space of interest. The subsequent solution of such Hamiltonians can provide insights into the physics of strongly-correlated materials. While phonons can substantially screen electron-electron interactions, electron-phonon coupling has been commonly ignored within ab initio downfolding, and when considered this is done only for short-range interactions. Here we propose a theory of ab initio downfolding that accounts for all mechanisms of electron-phonon coupling on equal footing, regardless of the range of the interactions. Our practical computational implementation is readily compatible with current downfolding approaches. We apply our approach to polar materials MgO and GeTe, and we reveal the importance of both short-range and long-range electron-phonon coupling in determining the magnitude of electron-electron interactions. Our results show that in the static limit, phonons reduce the on-site repulsion between electrons by 40% for MgO, and by 79% for GeTe. Our framework also predicts that overall attractive nearest-neighbor interactions arise between electrons in GeTe, consistent with superconductivity in this material.</description>

      <title>Electrically induced negative differential resistance states mediated by oxygen octahedra coupling in manganites for neuronaldynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precipitous rise of consumer network applications reiterates the urgency to redefine computing hardware with low power footprint. Neuromorphic computing utilizing correlated oxides offers an energy-efficient solution. By designing anisotropic functional properties in LSMO on a twinned LAO substrate and driving it out of thermodynamic equilibrium, we demonstrate two distinct negative differential resistance states in such volatile memristors. These were harnessed to exhibit oscillatory dynamics in LSMO at different frequencies and an artificial neuron with leaky integrate-and-fire dynamics. A material based modelling incorporating bond angle distortions in neighboring perovskites and capturing the inhomogeneity of domain distribution and propagation explains both the NDR regimes. Our findings establish LSMO as an important material for neuromorphic computing hardware.</description>

      <title>Spin-reorientation driven topological Hall effect in Fe4GeTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iron-based van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets with relatively high ordering temperatures are a current research focus due to their significance in fundamental physics and potential applications in spintronics. Competing magnetic interactions and anisotropies can give rise to nontrivial spin textures in these materials, resulting in novel topological features. Fe4GeTe2 (F4GT) is a nearly room-temperature vdW ferromagnet, well known for hosting a spin-reorientation transition (SRT) arising from the interplay of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and shape anisotropy. In this work, we investigate the angle-dependent magneto-transport properties of F4GT single crystals. We report a large topological Hall effect (THE) in a multi-layer F4GT originating from the SRT-driven non-coplanar spin textures. The THE appears at the in-plane orientation of the external magnetic field and persists over a wide range of temperatures around SRT. Additionally, we find a thickness-sensitive THE signal for the c axis orientation of the magnetic field at a low-temperature regime which is associated with a reentrant Lifshitz transition.</description>

      <title>A combined statistical mechanical and ab initio approach to understanding H2O/CO2 co-adsorption in mmen-Mg2(dobpdc)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of H2O on CO2 adsorption in an amine-appended variant of the metal-organic framework Mg2(dobpdc), which is known to exhibit chaining behavior that presents in a step-shaped adsorption isotherm. We first show how the presence of different levels of local H2O affects this chaining behavior and the energetics of CO2 adsorption, based on a series of ab initio calculations, giving insight into the atomic-scale environment. In particular, we predict a novel adsorbed configuration, in which H2O and CO2 intertwine to make a braided chain down the MOF pore. We then show how an existing lattice model can be adapted to incorporate the effect of water, and predict the CO2 isotherms for the various water levels, observing a sharp shift the uptake at low partial pressures. In addition to the physical further work on this and related materials.</description>

      <title>First-principle study of surface structure estimation in $L1_0$-FePd(001)/graphene heterojunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a theoretical and computational investigation of the atomic-scale structure of the heterointerface formed between the (001) surface of $L1_0$-ordered iron palladium (FePd) alloy and graphene (Gr), namely, $L1_0$-FePd(001)/Gr. Using the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that the topmost surface layer consisting of Pd (Pd-terminated surface) becomes more energetically stable than Fe, and Pd-terminated surfaces are not conducive to Gr adsorption. On the other hand, under oxygen atmosphere conditions, our calculation suggests the presence of Fe-terminated surfaces with Gr-covered structures reproducing recent experimental observations; besides, the presence of Fe-O bonds by the surface oxidization is also consistent with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These findings are crucial for understanding the fabrication processes of interfaces in Fe-based $L1_0$ alloy materials.</description>

      <title>Efficient calculation of phonon dynamics through a low-rank solution of the Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exotic nondiffusive heat transfer regimes such as the second sound, where heat propagates as a damped wave at speeds comparable to those of mechanical disturbances, often occur at cryogenic temperatures (T) and nanosecond timescales in semiconductors. First-principles prediction of such rapid, low-T phonon dynamics requires finely-resolved temporal tracking of large, dense, and coupled linear phonon dynamical systems arising from the governing linearized Peierls-Boltzmann equation (LPBE). Here, we uncover a rigorous low-rank representation of these linear dynamical systems, derived from the spectral properties of the phonon collision matrix, that accelerates the first-principles prediction of phonon dynamics by a factor of over a million without compromising on the computational accuracy. By employing this low-rank representation of the LPBE, we predict strong amplification of the wave-like second sound regime upon isotopic enrichment in diamond - a finding that would have otherwise been computationally intractable using the conventional brute-force approaches. Our framework enables a rapid and accurate discovery of the conditions under which wave-like heat flow can be realized in common semiconductors.</description>

      <title>First-principles study of dielectric properties of ferroelectric perovskite oxides with on-site and inter-site Hubbard interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the atomic and electronic structures of ferroelectric perovskite oxides, BaTiO$_3$, LiNbO$_3$, and PbTiO$_3$ using ab initio extended Hubbard functionals in which the on-site and inter-site Hubbard interactions are determined self-consistently, adapted from the pseudohybrid density functional proposed by Agapito-Curtarolo-Buongiorno Nardelli. Band structures, ferroelectric distortions, polarization, Born effective charges, and switching barriers are calculated with extended Hubbard functionals, that are compared with those using local density approximation (LDA), generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and Hybrid (HSE06) functionals. The properties of all three compounds calculated by extended Hubbard functionals are in good agreement with experimental data. We find a substantial increase in band gaps due to the inter-site Coulomb interactions, which show better agreement with $GW$ results compared to those from LDA and GGA functionals. The crucial role of the inter-site Coulomb interactions in restoring the suppressed polar instability, which is computed when only the on-site Hubbard interactions are considered, is also highlighted. Overall, we find that the properties calculated using our extended Hubbard functionals exhibit trends similar to those obtained with the HSE06 functional, while reducing computational costs by over an order of magnitude. Thus, we propose that the current method is well-suited for high-throughput calculations for perovskite oxides, offering significantly improved accuracy in computing band gap and other related physical properties such as the shift current photovoltaic effect and band alignments in ferroelectric heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Cu Intercalation-stabilized 1T'-MoS2 with Electrical Insulating Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intercalated two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have attracted much attention for their designable structure and novel properties. Among this family, host materials with low symmetry such as 1T' phase TMDCs are particularly interesting because of their potentials in inducing unconventional phenomena. However, such systems typically have low quality and poor stability, hindering further study in the structure-property relationship and applications. In this work, we intercalated Cu into 1T' MoS2 with high crystallinity and high thermal stability up to ~300 oC. We identified the distribution and arrangement of Cu intercalators for the first time, and the results show that Cu occupy partial of the tetrahedral interstices aligned with Mo sites. The obtained Cu-1T' MoS2 exhibits an insulating hopping transport behavior with a large temperature coefficient of resistance reaching -4 ~ -2 % K-1. This work broadens the artificial intercalated structure library and promotes structure design and property modulation of layered materials.</description>

      <title>Revealing Spin and Spatial Symmetry Decoupling: New Insights into Magnetic Systems with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely accepted that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) generally locks spin and spatial degrees of freedom, as a result, the spin, despite being an axial vector, is fixed and cannot rotate independently, and the magnetic system should be described by magnetic space groups (MSGs). While as a new type of group, spin space groups (SSGs) have been introduced to approximately describe the symmetry of magnetic systems with negligible SOC, and received significant attention recently. In this work, we prove that in two cases of coplanar spin configurations, there are spin-only operations that strictly hold even with considerable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), and the symmetry of their spin models could be described by the spin-coplanar SSG. In addition, we also find that for spin-collinear cases, regardless the strength of DMI, the magnon systems within the framework of linear spin wave theory (LSWT) also preserve the decoupled spin and spatial rotations, but the symmetry does not belong to the conventional definitions of collinear spin groups. Finally, we discuss the potential realization of these novel symmetries for magnetic candidate materials in rod, layer, and three-dimensional (3D) space groups. Our work extends the applicability of SSGs to magnetic materials with heavy elements, and provides new avenues for exploring novel physical phenomena in magnon topology and transport.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Two-dimensional Cs2AgInCl6 Nanoplates as Building Blocks for Functional Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breaking crystal symmetry is essential for engineering emissive double perovskite metal halides. The goal is to overcome their inherently indirect and disallowed optical transitions. Here we introduce a synthesis for silver - Cs2AgInCl6 two-dimensional hybrid nanoplate products that break the symmetry in two ways, their shape and their heterointerfaces. A comparative study between Cs2AgInCl6 nanocubes and nanoplates is presented to emphasize the difference in optical properties. A modified colloidal synthesis for Cs2AgInCl6 yields high-quality nanoplates with small lateral dimensions very different from the symmetric cubes. Each nanoplate is decorated with metallic silver nanoparticles, with diameters on the scale of the thickness of the perovskite nanoplate, forming significant heterointerfaces that further break symmetry. The Cs2AgInCl6 two-dimensional nanoplates also demonstrate facile transformation into larger crystalline nanosheets once deposited on substrates. We thus highlight those nanoplates as potential building blocks for assemblies of functional surfaces.</description>

      <title>An Inorganic Liquid Crystalline Dispersion with 2D Ferroelectric Moieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electro-optical effect based liquid crystal devices have been extensively used in optical modulation techniques, in which the Kerr coefficient reflects the sensitivity of the liquid crystals and determines the strength of the device operational electric field. The Peterlin-Stuart theory and the O'Konski model jointly indicate that a giant Kerr coefficient could be obtained in a material with both a large geometrical anisotropy and an intrinsic polarization, but such a material is not yet reported. Here we reveal a ferroelectric effect in a monolayer two-dimensional mineral vermiculite. A large geometrical anisotropy factor and a large inherent electric dipole together raise the record value of Kerr coefficient by an order of magnitude, till $3.0\times 10^{-4}$ m V$^{-2}$. This finding enables an ultra-low operational electric field of $10^2$-$10^4$ V m$^{-1}$ and the fabrication of electro-optical devices with an inch-level electrode separation, which is not practical previously. Because of its high ultraviolet stability (decay &lt;1% under ultraviolet exposure of 1000 hours), large-scale, and energy-efficiency, prototypical displayable billboards have been fabricated for outdoor interactive scenes. The work provides new insights for both liquid crystal optics and two-dimensional ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Transition Metal-Vacancy Point Defects in Zinc Oxide as Deep-Level Spin Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a promising candidate for hosting point defects as spin qubits for quantum information applications, due to its wide band gap, low spin-orbit coupling, and dilute nuclear spin environment. Previously shallow impurities in ZnO were mostly proposed for spin qubit candidates, but deep-level spin defect studies in ZnO are rather sparse, which may be ideally decoupled from the host materials for stable operation. In this work, we theoretically search for deep-level point defects in ZnO with optimal physical properties suitable for optically-addressable spin qubits in the solid-state. Using first-principles calculations for the search, we have predicted the Mo vacancy defect in ZnO owning promising spin and optical properties, including spin-triplet ground state, optical transition in the visible to near-infrared range with high quantum yield, allowed intersystem crossings with a large optically-detected magnetic resonance contrast, and long spin $T_2$ and $T_2^*$. Notably, we found the Huang-Rhys factor of the defect to be around 5, which is much smaller than those at 10-30 of the most-known defects in ZnO. We also proposed a new protocol for initializing and reading spin qubits, which could be applied in other systems with forbidden longitudinal intersystem crossing. Finally, we compared the spin decoherence driven by the nuclear spin bath and by paramagnetic impurity baths. We found that the paramagnetic impurities are very effective in causing spin decoherence even with very low concentrations, implying that the spin decoherence in ZnO can be likely dominated by them even after isotopic purification.</description>

      <title>Light-induced reorientation transition in an antiferromagnetic semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the lack of a net magnetic moment, antiferromagnets possess a unique robustness to external magnetic fields and are thus predicted to play an important role in future magnetic technologies. However, this robustness also makes them quite difficult to control, and the development of novel methods to manipulate these systems with external stimuli is a fundamental goal of antiferromagnetic spintronics. In this work, we report evidence for a metastable reorientation of the order parameter in an antiferromagnetic semiconductor triggered by an ultrafast quench of the equilibrium order via photoexcitation above the band gap. The metastable state forms less than 10 ps after the excitation pulse, and persists for longer than 150 ps before decaying to the ground state via thermal fluctuations. Importantly, this transition cannot be induced thermodynamically, and requires the system to be driven out of equilibrium. Broadly speaking, this phenomenology is ultimately the result of large magnetoelastic coupling in combination with a relatively low symmetry of the magnetic ground state. Since neither of these properties are particularly uncommon in magnetic materials, the observations presented here imply a generic path toward novel device technology enabled by ultrafast dynamics in antiferromagnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon-assisted optical absorption in semiconductors is crucial for understanding and optimizing optoelectronic devices, yet its accurate simulation remains a significant challenge in computational materials science. We present an efficient approach that combines deep learning tight-binding (TB) and potential models to efficiently calculate the phonon-assisted optical absorption in semiconductors with $ab$ $initio$ accuracy. Our strategy enables efficient sampling of atomic configurations through molecular dynamics and rapid computation of electronic structure and optical properties from the TB models. We demonstrate its efficacy by calculating the temperature-dependent optical absorption spectra and band gap renormalization of Si and GaAs due to electron-phonon coupling over a temperature range of 100-400 K. Our results show excellent agreement with experimental data, capturing both indirect and direct absorption processes, including subtle features like the Urbach tail. This approach offers a powerful tool for studying complex materials with high accuracy and efficiency, paving the way for high-throughput screening of optoelectronic materials.</description>

      <title>Tuning the surface energy of fluorinated diamond-like carbon coatings via plasma immersion ion implantation plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition with 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate an environmentally friendly and scalable method to create fluorine-doped diamond-like carbon (F-DLC) coatings using plasma immersion ion implantation plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PIII-PECVD) with 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane. F-DLC films tend to have low wettability and good mechanical flexibility, which make them suitable for applications in biomedical devices and antibiofouling surfaces. We report on the effects of fluorine incorporation on the surface chemistry, surface energy, and morphology of these coatings, showing that our method is effective in increasing the fluorine content in the F-DLC up to 40%. We show that the addition of fluorine leads to a decrease in surface energy, which is consistent with a reduction in surface wettability.</description>

      <title>Superlubric Motion of Wave-like Domain Walls in Sliding Ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sliding ferroelectrics constructed from stacked nonpolar monolayers enable out-of-plane polarization in two dimensions with exceptional properties, including ultrafast switching speeds and fatigue-free behavior. However, the widely accepted switching mechanism, which posits synchronized long-distance in-plane translation of entire atomic layers driven by an out-of-plane electric field, has shown inconsistencies with experimental observations. We demonstrate that this spinodal decomposition-like homogeneous switching process violates Neumann's principle and is unlikely to occur due to symmetry constraint. Instead, symmetry-breaking domain walls (DWs) and the tensorial nature of Born effective charges are critical for polarization reversal, underscoring the quantum nature of sliding ferroelectrics. Using the Bernal-stacked $h$-BN bilayer as a model system, we discover that the coherent propagation of wide, wave-like domain walls is the key mechanism for ferroelectric switching. This mechanism fundamentally differs from the layer-by-layer switching associated with narrow domain walls, which has been established for over sixty years in perovskite ferroelectrics. Moreover, these wave-like DWs exhibit superlubric dynamics, achieving ultrahigh velocities of approximately 4000 m/s at room temperature and displaying an anomalous cooling-promoted switching speed. The unexpected emergence of DW superlubricity in sliding ferroelectrics presents new avenues for enhancing key performance metrics and offers exciting opportunities for applications in cryogenic environments.</description>

      <title>Designing Bimetallic Nanoparticle Catalysts via Tailored Surface Segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bimetallic nanoparticles serve as a vital class of catalysts with tunable properties suitable for diverse catalytic reactions, yet a comprehensive understanding of their structural evolution under operational conditions as well as their optimal design principles remains elusive. In this study, we unveil a prevalent surface segregation phenomenon in approximately 100 platinum-group-element-based bimetallic nanoparticles through molecular dynamics simulations and derive a thermodynamic descriptor to predict this behavior. Building on the generality and predictability of surface segregation, we propose leveraging this phenomenon to intentionally enrich the nanoparticle surface with noble-metal atoms, thereby significantly reducing their usage while maintaining high catalytic activity and stability. To validate this strategy, we investigate dozens of platinum-based bimetallic nanoparticles for propane dehydrogenation catalysis using first-principles calculations. Through a systematic examination of the catalytic sites on nanoparticle surfaces, we eventually identify several candidates featuring with stable Pt-enriched surface and superior catalytic activity, confirming the feasibility of this approach.</description>

      <title>Phase dependence of the Thermal Memory Effect in Polycrystalline Ribbon and Bulk Ni55Fe19Ga26 Heusler Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01222v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal memory effect, TME, has been studied in Ni55Fe19Ga26 shape memory alloys, fabricated as ribbons via melt-spinning and as pellets via arc-melting, to evaluate its dependence on the martensitic structure and the macrostructure of the samples. When the reverse martensitic transformation is interrupted, a kinetic delay in the subsequent complete transformation is only evident in the ribbon samples, where the 14M modulated structure is the dominant phase. In contrast, degradation of the modulated structure or the presence of the gamma-phase significantly reduces the observed TME. In such cases, the magnitude of the TME approaches the detection limits of commercial calorimeters, and only high-resolution calorimeter at very low heating rate (40 mK h-1) can show the effect. Following the kinetic arrest and subsequent cooling, the reverse martensitic transformation was completed at several heating rates to confirm the athermal nature of the phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Polarizing altermagnets by ultrafast asymmetric spin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser pulses are known to induce symmetric demagnetization; equal loss of magnetic moments in the identical sublattices of antiferromagnets and ferromagnets at ultrashort timescale. This is due to their identical local electronic structures guided by the underlying symmetries. Using time-dependent density functional theory, we demonstrate that laser pulses can drive asymmetric demagnetization dynamics of identical sublattices in the d-wave altermagnet RuO2, resulting in a photo-induced ferrimagnetic state with a net moment of ~0.2 {\mu}B per unit cell. This polarization arises from the momentum-dependent spin splitting, which is unique to altermagnets, and which induces a momentum-dependent optical intersite spin transfer effect. Furthermore, the ferrimagnetic polarization is highly controllable; depends on the direction of the linear polarized laser. The excitation along the spin-polarized planes breaks the symmetry of the momentum-space magnetization distribution, leading to inequivalent spin-resolved charge transfer between sublattices across both momentum and real space. These findings uncover novel laser-driven pathways to control magnetic order in altermagnets, enabling a phase transition from AM to ferri-magnetic state.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Nonvolatile Spin FETs from 2D Metallic Ferromagnetic and Ferroelectric Multiferroic Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-electric-controlled nonvolatile spin field-effect transistors (SFETs) based on two-dimensional (2D) multiferroic van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures hold great promise for advanced spintronics applications. However, their performance is hindered by the limited availability of 2D magnetic materials that can switch effectively between metallic and semiconducting states with sizable bandgaps controlled by ferroelectric polarization. Most studies have focused on materials that are naturally semiconducting, achieving a metallic state by modifying the ferroelectric polarization. In this work, we introduce an innovative approach that uses interface effects to convert inherently metallic 2D magnetic materials into half-metals and induce half-semiconducting behavior through changes in ferroelectric polarization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the CrPS3/Sc2CO2 heterostructure demonstrate that the ferroelectric polarization of Sc2CO2 monolayers can adjust the electronic structure of CrPS3, enabling a switch from half-metallic to half-semiconducting states. Building on these insights, we designed a nonvolatile SFET and analyzed its transport properties using the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method combined with DFT. Our results show that reversing the ferroelectric polarization achieves an on/off current ratio exceeding 5000000%, and the heterostructure generates nearly 100% spin-polarized current with a current density of up to 6500 {\mu}A/{\mu}m at bias voltage below 0.2 V. These findings highlight a promising pathway for developing high-performance SFETs that surpass existing 2D heterojunction materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic and chemical structure of metal/oxide interfaces were studied in cobalt/magnetite, $Fe_3O_4$, and cobalt/hematite, ${\alpha}-Fe_2O_3$, epitaxial heterostructures using the comprehensive selection of microscopic and spectroscopic methods. It was observed that the cobalt nanostructures and ultrathin films were oxidized at both interfaces, with a thicker cobalt oxide layer in the system with hematite. The formation of cobalt oxides was accompanied by the interfacial reduction of iron that modified magnetic properties of the iron oxides layers. In particular, uncompensated magnetic moments appear in antiferromagnetic hematite, and the orbital magnetic moment of Co grown on magnetite is significantly enhanced for thicknesses below 1 nm. Synchrotron magnetic microscopy showed a direct correlation in the domain structures of the cobalt/iron oxides: ferromagnetic coupling between cobalt and magnetite and between cobalt and the magnetically modified layer of hematite.</description>

      <title>Accelerated recrystallization of nanocrystalline films as a manifestation of the inner size effect of the diffusion coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to studying the recrystallization of 100 nm thick polycrystalline films of copper and silver. It is found that in copper films deposited by the thermal evaporation method onto a substrate at room temperature, a bimodal crystallite size distribution with maxima at 15 and 35 nm is observed. The bimodal distribution in copper films is preserved during annealing, which leads to a shift of both peaks of the crystallite size distribution histograms to the larger sizes region. In contrast to Cu, micron-sized crystallites are present even in as-deposited Ag films besides the nanosized fraction. These grains are formed due to the phenomenon of self-annealing and weakly evolve during heating owing to grain growth stagnation. The nanosized fraction in as-deposited Ag films is represented by crystallites with the most probable size of 25 nm, which increases to 50 nm as a result of short-term annealing at the temperature of 250{\deg}C. The grain-boundary diffusion coefficient was determined, which is more than 10-18 m2/s for both films of metals. The obtained value indicates a multiple intensification of self-diffusion processes in films, the thickness of which allows us to refer them to macroscopic sample</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometric Origin of Strain-Induced Ferroelectric Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strain-regulated ferroelectric (FE) materials have long attracted significant attention due to their diverse applications. While soft-phonon theory and the (pseudo) Jahn-Teller effect have achieved considerable success in providing phenomenological descriptions and general understanding, the detailed connection between these perspectives and their microscopic dependence on strain regulation remains unclear. Here, under the framework of density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT), we demonstrate that the Berry curvature of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) plays a pivotal role in the interatomic force matrix (IFM). A subsequent model analysis shows that external strain can reverse the polarity of the EPC Berry curvature in (quasi)-degenerate electronic subsystems through band inversion, thereby directly leading to phonon softening. The general theory is then applied to the BiOCl monolayer as a benchmark, which offers an accurate description of the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This mechanism is further observed across a broad range of materials through ab initio calculations, providing an insightful perspective on EPC quantum geometry in lattice dynamics and FE phase transitions.</description>

      <title>(Anti-)Altermagnetism from Orbital Ordering in the Ruddlesden-Popper Chromates Sr$_{n+1}$Cr$_n$O$_{3n+1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets form a subclass of collinear antiferromagnets with spin-split electronic states. Here, we introduce the Ruddlesden-Popper chromates Sr$_{n+1}$Cr$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ (including the perovskite SrCrO$_3$) as candidates for antiferromagnetic materials in which altermagnetism emerges from spontaneous orbital ordering, rather than crystal symmetry. Using first-principles calculations, we identify a layer-dependent spin splitting of the electronic states, driven by the interplay between spin and orbital order. We show that if the spin and orbital orders align in adjacent layers, the system exhibits a net spin splitting, and thus altermagnetism. In contrast, if either the spin or the orbital order is reversed in adjacent layers, we observe an anti-altermagnetic state where layerwise compensation leads to net zero spin splitting. We find that for odd $n$, altermagnetic and anti-altermagnetic phases can coexist, whereas for even $n$ and in the perovskite limit, the system remains strictly anti-altermagnetic. In both cases, increasing $n$ favors metallicity. Finally, we indicate that in odd $n$ compounds, epitaxial strain can promote the altermagnetic phase.</description>

      <title>Multiphysics simulations of microstructure influence on hysteresis and eddy current losses of electrical steel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving efficiency of electrical machines requires fundamental knowledge on the mechanisms behind magnetic and eddy current losses of the magnetic core materials, with Fe-Si alloy as a prototype. These losses are intrinsically influenced by the microstructure of the materials. This necessitates physics-based, microstructure-informed multiscale simulations. In the present paper, we utilised micromagnetic simulations and computational homogenization methods to calculate the effective hysteresis and effective conductivities of Fe-Si electrical steels. To demonstrate the methodology, binder-jet printed electrical steel material samples with different microstructure were investigated. The microstructure samples were digitized based on both the descriptor-based synthetic reconstruction and SEM-image-based digitization. More samples were generated with varying microstructure features such as grain size and grain boundary phases. The micromagnetic simulations were then performed to investigate the magnetic hysteresis and hysteresis loss. The eddy current loss was also evaluated by using the effective conductivity through computational homogenization. By performing parameter research on a series of synthetic microstructures, effects of average grain size and grain boundary (GB) phase thickness on the hysteresis loss and eddy current loss were unveiled. An average grain size around 120 \si{\micro m} has the lowest hysteresis loss, although the eddy current loss increases with the grain size. Increasing GB-phase thickness helps reduce both losses. Results indicate the potential to decrease loss of magnetic core materials by microstructure optimization.</description>

      <title>Grain Boundary Segregation and Embrittlement of Aluminum Binary Alloys from First Principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain boundary segregation controls properties of polycrystalline materials such as their susceptibility to intergranular cracking. It is of interest to engineer alloy chemistry to enhance grain boundary cohesion to prevent intergranular failure. While there is collectively a large first-principles dataset for grain boundary embrittlement in multiple Al-based binary alloys, the methodologies used for the first principles calculations, as well as the analyzed fracture paths, are variable amongst studies. Here, we reevaluate and compute grain boundary segregation and embrittlement from all-electron first-principles for the {\Sigma}5[001](210) Al grain boundary. We explicitly evaluate multiple fracture paths, and provide a study case of the chemical trends of the preferred fracture paths across 69 binary Al alloys. The results suggest that neglecting certain low energy fracture paths can lead to errors of estimating embrittlement potency up to the order of 1 eV per solute atom, especially for multiple d-block transition metal solutes that are of engineering interest. The database calculated here also permits a comprehensive comparison between all-electron and pseudopotential methodologies. The effects of Hubbard U density functional theory on grain boundary segregation and embrittlement in Al(Sc) are found not to be significant in terms of the relative energetic calculations of grain boundaries and free surfaces (differences are of order 0.1 eV or less).</description>

      <title>Graphene intercalation of the large gap quantum spin Hall insulator bismuthene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum spin Hall insulator bismuthene, a two-third monolayer of bismuth on SiC(0001), is distinguished by helical metallic edge states that are protected by a groundbreaking 800 meV topological gap, making it ideal for room temperature applications. This massive gap inversion arises from a unique synergy between flat honeycomb structure, strong spin orbit coupling, and an orbital filtering effect that is mediated by the substrate. However, the rapid oxidation of bismuthene in air has severely hindered the development of applications, so far confining experiments to ultra-high vacuum conditions. Here, we successfully overcome this barrier, intercalating bismuthene between SiC and a protective sheet of graphene. As we demonstrate through scanning tunneling microscopy and photoemission spectroscopy, graphene intercalation preserves the structural and topological integrity of bismuthene, while effectively shielding it from oxidation in air. We identify hydrogen as the critical component that was missing in previous bismuth intercalation attempts. Our findings facilitate ex-situ experiments and pave the way for the development of bismuthene based devices, signaling a significant step forward in the development of next-generation technologies.</description>

      <title>Radiation sputtering of hydrocarbon ices at Europa-relevant temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study shows that the sputtering of hydrocarbon water ice leads to the production of mostly CO2, CO, and fragmented hydrocarbons. The onset of sputtered hydrocarbons is immediate, and quickly reaches a steady state, whereas CO2 and CO are formed more gradually. It is found that higher temperatures cause more sputtering, and that there are some notable differences in the distribution of species that are sputtered at different temperatures, indicating local heterogeneity of sputtering yields depending on the surface temperature.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Models for Reinforced Concrete Pipes Condition Prediction: The State-of-the-Art Using Artificial Neural Networks and Multiple Linear Regression in a Wisconsin Case Study</title>

Abstract: The aging sewer infrastructure in the U.S., covering 2.1 million kilometers, encounters increasing structural issues, resulting in around 75,000 yearly sanitary sewer overflows that present serious economic, environmental, and public health hazards. Conventional inspection techniques and deterministic models do not account for the unpredictable nature of sewer decline, whereas probabilistic methods depend on extensive historical data, which is frequently lacking or incomplete. This research intends to enhance predictive accuracy for the condition of sewer pipelines through machine learning models artificial neural networks (ANNs) and multiple linear regression (MLR) by integrating factors such as pipe age, material, diameter, environmental influences, and PACP ratings. ANNs utilized ReLU activation functions and Adam optimization, whereas MLR applied regularization to address multicollinearity, with both models assessed through metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R2. The findings indicated that ANNs surpassed MLR, attaining an R2 of 0.9066 compared to MLRs 0.8474, successfully modeling nonlinear relationships while preserving generalization. MLR, on the other hand, offered enhanced interpretability by pinpointing significant predictors such as residual buildup. As a result, pipeline degradation is driven by pipe length, age, and pipe diameter as key predictors, while depth, soil type, and segment show minimal influence in this analysis. Future studies ought to prioritize hybrid models that merge the accuracy of ANNs with the interpretability of MLR, incorporating advanced methods such as SHAP analysis and transfer learning to improve scalability in managing infrastructure and promoting environmental sustainability.</description>

      <title>Influence of nanoparticulates and microgrooves on the secondary electron yield and electrical resistance of laser-treated copper surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser surface structuring has proven to be an effective technique for achieving a copper surface with secondary electron yield (SEY) values close to or below unity. However, the attributes that minimize SEY, such as moderately deep grooves and redeposited nanoparticles, may lead to undesirable consequences, including increased radio frequency surface resistance. This investigation systematically examined data about different cleaning procedures designed to eliminate redeposited adsorbed particulates. Various analysis techniques were used iteratively after each consecutive cleaning step, providing insights into the evolving surface characteristics. The collected experimental results identified distinct impacts of microgrooves, groove orientation, and associated particulates on secondary electron yield and surface resistance. Exposing the crests while retaining high particulate coverage in the grooves leads to reduced SEY values and surface resistance, suggesting that the tips of the grooves exert a more significant influence on surface current density than the groove depth. At the same time, nanoparticles in the grooves have a more significant impact on SEY values than the exposed tips at the surface.</description>

      <title>Orbital torques and orbital pumping in two-dimensional rare-earth dichalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of spin-orbit torque properties in two-dimensional (2D) materials presents one of the challenges of modern spintronics. In this context, 2D layers involving rare-earth ions $-$ which give rise to robust magnetism, exhibit pronounced orbital polarization of the states, and carry strong spin-orbit interaction $-$ hold particular promise. Here, we investigate ferromagnetic Janus H-phase monolayers of 4$f$-Eu rare-earth dichalcogenides EuSP, EuSSe, and EuSCl using first-principles calculations. We demonstrate that all compounds exhibit significant spin-orbit torques which originate predominantly in the colossal current-induced orbital response on the Eu $f$-electrons. Moreover, we demonstrate that the corresponding orbital torques can be used to drive strong in-plane currents of orbital angular momentum with non-trivial direction of orbital polarization. Our findings promote $f$-orbital-based 2D materials as a promising platform for in-plane orbital pumping and spin-orbit torque applications, and motivate further research on educated design of orbital properties for orbitronics with 2D materials.</description>

Abstract: Electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) can image nanoscale objects buried below the surface. Here, we theoretically show that this capability can be used to obtain nanotomographic information, i.e., the physical dimensions and dielectric properties, of buried nano-objects.

      <title>Magneto-plasmonic pesponse of nickel nano-rings prepared by electroless method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magneto-plasmonic nanostructures have emerged as promising candidates for advanced sensing applications. However, conventional fabrication methods, such as lithography and sputtering, often involve high costs and complex processes. This study introduces a novel approach for fabricating nickel nano-rings (200-600 nm in diameter) utilizing nanosphere lithography and selective electroless deposition on ITO substrates. The resulting nickel-silver-boron (Ni-Ag-B) nanoarrays exhibit uniform, durable coatings with robust covalent bonds, providing a simpler, more cost-effective alternative to traditional methods. The unique ring-shaped geometry of the nano-rings enhances plasmonic effects by concentrating the electromagnetic field, thus outperforming other nanostructures. Unlike thin films, these nano-rings demonstrate surface plasmon resonance (SPR) within the 470-614 nm range when illuminated at a 45$^{\deg}$ incident angle. Moreover, ellipsometry parameter calculations and Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect (MOKE) measurements revealed narrow Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) peaks at 512 nm and 560 nm, indicating superior sensitivity for detection compared to conventional SPR and ellipsometry-SPR techniques. Finite element simulations using COMSOL provided valuable insight into the influence of magnetic fields on the electromagnetic response of the nano-rings, confirming their potential for optical communication and highly sensitive sensing technologies. This study addresses limitations in existing magneto-plasmonic systems, offering a scalable and innovative solution for the development of next-generation sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall effect in highly c-plane oriented Mn$_{3}$Ge/Si(100) thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00809v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic Mn$_{3}$Ge with a non-collinear Kagome structures present exciting prospects for exploring Berry curvature driven anomalous Hall effects (AHE). Despite substantial progress in bulk systems, the synthesis of crystalline thin films directly on silicon with a hexagonal phase presents a particular challenge unless a buffer layer is employed. In this study, we report the synthesis of single phase c-plane oriented hexagonal Mn$_{3}$Ge(0001) films on Si(100) using pulsed laser deposition. Under suitable growth conditions, we obtain layer-by-layer films with atomically flat surfaces and interfaces. High-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy study reveals the detail surface atomic structures, where the surface Mn atoms spontaneously arrange into a Kagome lattice. Tunneling spectroscopy (dI/dV) measurement on the atomically resolved Kagome surface show a minima in local density of states near the Fermi level, likely originated from the Weyl crossings near K points. Despite the nearly vanishing magnetization, magnetotransport measurements in 30 nm $Mn_{3}$Ge(0001) films show anomalous Hall resistivity up to 0.41 ($\mu\Omega\cdot\text{cm}$) at 2 K. Our \textit{ab initio} calculations shed further light on the existence of topological features and the band structures in Mn$_{3+x}$Ge$_{1-x}$ with increasing Mn concentration $x$. The anomalous Hall response at room temperature in crystalline Mn$_{3}$Ge films on Si(100) offer promising potential for the development of antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity of the hybrid Ruddlesden-Popper La5Ni3O11 single crystals under high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10 under high pressure indicates that the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phase nickelates Rn+1NinO3n+1 (R = rare earth) is a new material family for high-temperature superconductivity. Exploring the superconductivity of other RP or hybrid RP phase nickelates under high pressure has become an urgent and interesting issue. Here, we report a novel hybrid RP nickelate superconductor of La5Ni3O11. The hybrid RP nickelate La5Ni3O11 is formed by alternative stacking of La3Ni2O7 with n=2 and La2NiO4 with n=1 along the c axis. The transport and magnetic torque measurements indicate a density-wave transition at approximately 170 K near ambient pressure, which is highly similar to both La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10. With increasing pressure, high-pressure transport measurements reveal that the density-wave transition temperature (TDW) continuously increases to approximately 210 K with increasing pressure up to 12 GPa before the appearance of pressure-induced superconductivity, and the density-wave transition abruptly fades out in a first-order manner at approximately 12 GPa. The optimal superconductivity with Tconset = 64 K and Tczero = 54 K is achieved at approximately 21 GPa. On the other hand, high-pressure X-ray diffraction experiments reveal a structural phase transition from an orthorhombic structure to a tetragonal structure at approximately 4.5 GPa. In contrast to La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10, the pressure-induced structural transition has no significant effect on either the density-wave transition or the superconductivity, suggesting a minor role of lattice degree of freedom in La5Ni3O11. The present discovery extends the superconducting member in the RP nickelate family and sheds new light on the superconducting mechanism.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependence of nonlinear elastic moduli of polystyrene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear elastic properties of polymers and polymeric composites are essential for accurate prediction of their response to dynamic loads, which is crucial in a wide range of applications. These properties can be affected by strain rate, temperature, and pressure. The temperature susceptibility of nonlinear elastic moduli of polymers remains poorly understood. We have recently observed a significant frequency dependence of the nonlinear elastic (Murnaghan) moduli of polystyrene. In this paper we expand this analysis by the temperature dependence. The measurement methodology was based on the acousto-elastic effect, and involved analysis of the dependencies of velocities of longitudinal and shear single-frequency ultrasonic waves in the sample on the applied static pressure. Measurements were performed at different temperatures in the range of 25-65 {\deg}C and at different frequencies in the range of 0.75-3 MHz. The temperature susceptibility of the nonlinear moduli $l$ and $m$ was found to be two orders of magnitude larger than that of linear moduli $\lambda$ and $\mu$. At the same time, the observed variations of $n$ modulus with temperature were low and within the measurement tolerance. The observed tendencies can be explained by different influence of pressure on relaxation processes in the material at different temperatures.</description>

Abstract: Doping stoichiometric SiNx layers (x=[N]/[Si]=1.33) with Si atoms by ultra-low energy ion implantation (ULE-II) and annealing them at different temperatures can significantly impact the switching characteristics. Electrical characterization and dielectric breakdown measurements are used to identify the main switching properties and performance of the fabricated devices and the effect that the Si dopants and annealing temperature have. In addition, impedance spectroscopy measurements revealed the dielectric properties of the silicon nitride films, as well as the ac conductance, which is utilized to identify the conduction mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: We test and simulate the mesoscopic cracking behavior of specimens made of a standard concrete mixture. To this end, we combine stable wedge-splitting fracture experiments performed during X-ray tomography, their analysis with digital volume correlation providing the full three-dimensional displacement field, and phase-field cohesive fracture modeling. In our computations, we apply the measured boundary conditions and model the actual heterogeneous material structure at the mesoscopic scale. Within the phase-field model, we explicitly distinguish among (thus individually represent) the mesostructural features of distinct material phases with size above a threshold of 1 mm, while we homogenize pores and finer aggregates below this threshold within the cementitious mortar matrix, with material parameters characterized accordingly. We compare experimental and numerical results in terms of both local and global quantities.</description>

      <title>Damage of bilayer structure in La3Ni2O7-d induced by high pO2 annealing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity with onset temperature of ~80 K in pressurized bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper La3Ni2O7-d has attracted much attention. Despite intense research, determination of the exact oxygen content and understanding of the relationship between superconductivity and oxygen content remain a big challenge. Here, we report a systematical study on the structure and physical properties of La3Ni2O7-d polycrystalline powders which were prepared using sol-gel method at ambient pressure and then annealed under various oxygen pressure. We found that high pO2 annealing with slow cooling results in a new phase, which can be modeled using the hybrid single-layer-trilayer La3Ni2O7 or the tetragonal bilayer La3Ni2O7. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements revealed significant single layers and trilayers after high oxygen pressure annealing, evidencing damage of the bilayer structure. The superconducting transition under high pressure became weak for high pO2 annealed samples, which is consistent with the damage of the bilayer structure. Our results reveal that the bilayer structure is fragile and post-annealing under near atmosphere pressure of oxygen is suitable to maintain bilayer structure and increase oxygen content at the same time.</description>

      <title>Origin of phonon decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonon decoherence determines the characteristic timescales over which coherent lattice vibrations decay, making it a crucial process for understanding the non-equilibrium dynamics of crystal lattices after excitation by a pump pulse. Here, we report a theoretical and computational investigation of the origin of phonon decoherence within a first-principles many-body framework. We derive quantum kinetic equations for the dynamics of coherent phonons by explicitly accounting for dissipation processes induced by electron-phonon and phonon-phonon interactions. The decoherence rate and frequency renormalization are formulated in terms of the non-equilibrium phonon self energy, providing a framework amenable for ab initio calculations. To validate this approach, we conduct a first-principles study of phonon decoherence for the elemental semimetals antimony and bismuth. The robust agreement with available temperature- and fluence-dependent experimental data confirms the accuracy of our theoretical and computational framework. More generally, our findings reveal that either electron-phonon and phonon-phonon coupling can prevail in determining the decoherence time, depending on the temperature and driving conditions. Overall, this work fills a critical gap in the theoretical understanding of phonon decoherence, providing a predictive framework for determining the timescales of light-induced structural dynamics in driven solids.</description>

      <title>Spectra-orthogonal optical anisotropy in wafer-scale molecular crystal monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the spectral and polarization responses of two-dimensional (2D) crystals is vital for developing ultra-thin platforms for compact optoelectronic devices. However, independently tuning optical anisotropy and spectral response remains challenging in conventional semiconductors due to the intertwined nature of their lattice and electronic structures. Here, we report spectra-orthogonal optical anisotropy, where polarization anisotropy is tuned independently of spectral response, in wafer-scale, one-atom-thick 2D molecular crystal (2DMC) monolayers synthesized on monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) crystals. Utilizing the concomitant spectral consistency and structural tunability of perylene derivatives, we demonstrate tunable optical polarization anisotropy in 2DMCs with similar spectral profiles, as confirmed by room-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and cross-polarized reflectance microscopy. Additional angle-dependent analysis of the single- and polycrystalline molecular domains reveals an epitaxial relationship between the 2DMC and the TMD. Our results establish a scalable, molecule-based 2D crystalline platform for unique and tunable functionalities unattainable in covalent 2D solids.</description>

      <title>Chiral Spin and Orbital Angular Momentum Textures in Mn Chains on W(110): Interplay of Spin-Orbit Coupling and Crystal Field Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.00348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stabilization of unusual spin-orbit driven magnetic orderings are achieved for chains of Mn atoms deposited on a W(110) substrate. First-principles electronic structure calculations show that the ground state spin configuration is non-collinear, forming chiral spiral-like structures, driven by competing nearest and next-nearest neighbor interactions. The orbital magnetic moments are also found to exhibit non-collinear ordering that, interestingly, tend to align in-plane for some systems with an orientation distinctly differently from that of the spin moment. We analyse the mechanism behind such behaviour, and find that it is due to the competition between the spin-orbit interaction and crystal-field splitting. Model calculations based on this assumption reproduce the main findings observed in our first-principles calculations.</description>

      <title>Amorphous Boron Nitride as an Ultrathin Copper Diffusion Barrier for Advanced Interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on amorphous boron nitride ($\rm \alpha$-BN) as a novel diffusion barrier for advanced semiconductor technology, particularly addressing the critical challenge of copper diffusion in back-end-of-line (BEOL) interconnects. Owing to its ultralow dielectric constant and robust barrier properties, $\rm \alpha$-BN is examined as an alternative to conventional low-k dielectrics. The investigation primarily employs theoretical modelling, using a Gaussian Approximation Potential, to simulate and understand the atomic-level interactions. This machine learning-based approach allows the performance of realistic simulations of amorphous structure of $\rm \alpha$-BN, enabling the exploration of the impact of different film morphologies on barrier efficacy. Furthermore, we studied the electronic and optical properties of the films using a simple Tight-Binding model. In addition to the theoretical studies, we performed diffusion studies of copper through PECVD $\rm \alpha$-BN on Si. The results from both the theoretical and experimental investigations highlight the potential of $\rm \alpha$-BN as a highly effective diffusion barrier, suitable for integration in nanoelectronics. This research shows that $\rm \alpha$-BN is a promising candidate for BEOL interconnects but also demonstrates the synergy of advanced computational models and experimental methods in material innovation for semiconductor applications.</description>

      <title>Theoretical lower limit of coercive field in ferroelectric hafnia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09426v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high coercive field ($E_c$) of hafnia-based ferroelectrics presents a major obstacle to their applications. The ferroelectric switching mechanisms in hafnia that dictate $E_c$, especially those related to domain nucleation in the Nucleation-Limited-Switching (NLS) model and domain wall motion in the Kolmogorov-Avrami-Ishibas (KAI) model, have remained elusive. We develop a deep-learning-assisted multiscale approach, incorporating atomistic insights into the critical nucleus, to predict both NLS- and KAI-type coercive fields. The theoretical NLS-type $E_c$ values agree with previous experimental results as well as our own measurements and also exhibit the correct thickness scaling for films between 3 and 20 nm. Combined theoretical and experimental investigations reveal that the giant $E_c$ in hafnia-based ferroelectrics arises from the ultra-thin geometry, which confines switching to the NLS mechanism. We predict that the theoretical lower limit for KAI-type $E_c$ is 0.1 MV/cm arsing from mobile domain walls. The activation of KAI-type switching to achieve lower $E_c$ is supported by our experimental demonstration of a low coercive field of 1 MV/cm in a 60 nm ferroelectric (HfO$_2$)$_n$/(ZrO$_2$)$_n$ ($n=3$ unit cells) superlattices. These findings establish a comprehensive framework for understanding ferroelectric switching in hafnia and highlight the potential of geometry and domain-wall engineering to achieve low-$E_c$ devices.</description>

      <title>How Can We Engineer Electronic Transitions Through Twisting and Stacking in TMDC Bilayers and Heterostructures? A First-Principles Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Layered two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit unique properties, expanding opportunities in material design. We investigate MX$_2$ transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) in homo- and heterobilayers with different stacking and twist angles. Twisted bilayers introduce Moir\'e patterns, significantly altering electronic properties. Using first-principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) with range-separated hybrid functionals, we examine 30 MX$_2$ combinations, revealing how stacking and composition influence stability and band gap energy (E$_g$). Notably, the MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructure with a 60\textdegree~shift maintains a direct band gap, highlighting its potential for applications. Homobilayers under low-strain conditions exhibit diverse stacking-dependent electronic behaviors, where MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, and WSe$_2$ transition between direct and indirect band gaps at specific twist angles. MoS$_2$ can even switch between semiconductor and metallic states. Critical twist angles (17.9\textdegree, 42.1\textdegree, 77.9\textdegree, and 102.1\textdegree) in twisted WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ bilayers yield symmetric Moir\'e patterns with tunable band gaps. Our findings emphasize that controlling heterostructures and twist angles is a powerful strategy for engineering electronic properties, offering a pathway for next-generation materials.</description>

      <title>Dissecting van der Waals interactions with Density Functional Theory -- Wannier-basis approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new scheme for the computation of dispersive interactions from first principles is presented. This cost-effective approach relies on a Wannier function representation compatible with density function theory descriptions. This is an electronic-based many-body method that captures the full electronic and optical response properties of the materials. It provides the foundation to discern van der Waals and induction energies as well as the role of anisotropy and different stacking patterns when computing dispersive interactions in systems. Calculated results for binding energies in benchmarked materials and layered materials, such as graphite, hBN, and MoS$_2$ give encouraging comparisons with available experimental data. Strategies for broadened computational descriptions of dispersive interactions are also discussed. Our investigation aims at stimulating new experimental studies to measure van der Waals energies in a wider range of materials, especially in layered systems.</description>

      <title>Information-entropy-driven generation of material-agnostic datasets for machine-learning interatomic potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contrast to their empirical counterparts, machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIAPs) promise to deliver near-quantum accuracy over broad regions of configuration space. However, due to their generic functional forms and extreme flexibility, they can catastrophically fail to capture the properties of novel, out-of-sample configurations, making the quality of the training set a determining factor, especially when investigating materials under extreme conditions. We propose a novel automated dataset generation method based on the maximization of the information entropy of the feature distribution, aiming at an extremely broad coverage of the configuration space in a way that is agnostic to the properties of specific target materials. The ability of the dataset to capture unique material properties is demonstrated on a range of unary materials, including elements with the fcc (Al), bcc (W), hcp (Be, Re and Os), graphite (C), and trigonal (Sb, Te) ground states. MLIAPs trained to this dataset are shown to be accurate over a range of application-relevant metrics, as well as extremely robust over very broad swaths of configurations space, even without dataset fine-tuning or hyper-parameter optimization, making the approach extremely attractive to rapidly and autonomously develop general-purpose MLIAPs suitable for simulations in extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Complexions at the Iron-Magnetite Interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthesizing distinct phases and controlling the crystalline defects in them are key concepts in materials and process design. These approaches are usually described by decoupled theories, with the former resting on equilibrium thermodynamics and the latter on nonequilibrium kinetics. By combining them into a holistic form of defect phase diagrams, we can apply phase equilibrium models to the thermodynamic evaluation of defects such as vacancies, dislocations, surfaces, grain boundaries, and phase boundaries, placing the understanding of material imperfections and their role on properties on solid thermodynamic and theoretical grounds. In this study, we characterize an interface-stabilized phase between Fe and Fe3O4 (magnetite) with differential phase contrast (DPC) imaging in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). This method uniquely enables the simultaneous imaging of both heavy Fe atoms and light O atoms, providing precise mapping of the atomic structure and chemical composition at this heterogeneous metal-oxide interface. We identify a well-ordered two-layer interface-stabilized phase state (referred to as complexion) at the Fe[001]/Fe3O4[001] interface. Using density-functional theory (DFT), we not only explain the observed complexion but also map out various interface-stabilized phases as a function of the O chemical potential. We show that the formation of complexions influences the properties of the interface, increasing its adhesion by 20 % and changing the charge transfer between adjacent materials, also leveraging impact on the transport properties across such interfaces. Our findings highlight the potential of tunable phase states at defects as a new asset in advanced materials design, paving the way for knowledge-based and optimized corrosion protection, catalysis, magnetism, and redox-driven phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Universally optimizable strategy for magnetic gaps towards high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall states via magnetic-insulator/topological-insulator building-blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimizing the magnetic Zeeman-splitting term, specifically the magnetic gap of the topological surface states (TSSs), is a crucial issue and central challenge in advancing higher-temperature quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. In this work, we demonstrate a counterintuitive, nonmonotonic relationship between the magnetic gap and the hybridization strength in ferromagnetic-insulator (FMI)/topological-insulator (TI) sandwich structures. Concretely, insufficient hybridization strength fails to induce a substantial magnetic gap; while excessive hybridization incandesces the competition between kinetic and Coulomb exchange interactions, thereby reducing the gap. Strong hybridization strength also spatially delocalizes the TSSs, diminishing the effective orbital coupling between TSS-based p and magnetic d orbitals, which further weakens kinetic and Coulomb exchange interaction strength. Moreover, modifying the stacking order offers an experimentally viable approach to optimizing magnetic gaps, enabling the tunability of Chern numbers, chirality and maximizing global gaps. These findings unveil a universal guiding principle for optimizing magnetic gaps in FMI-TI proximity-based QAH systems, offering valuable insights for advancing experimental implementations in this field.</description>

Abstract: Moir\'e patterns, typically formed by overlaying two layers of two-dimensional materials, exhibit an effective long-range periodicity that depends on the short-range periodicity of each layer and their spatial misalignment. Here, we study moir\'e patterns in objective structures with symmetries different from those in conventional patterns such as twisted bilayer graphene. Specifically, the mathematical descriptions for ring patterns, 2D Bravais lattice patterns, and helical patterns are derived analytically as representative examples of objective moir\'e patterns, using an augmented Fourier approach. Our findings reveal that the objective moir\'e patterns retain the symmetries of their original structures but with different parameters. In addition, we present a non-objective case, conformal moir\'e patterns, to demonstrate the versatility of this approach. We hope this geometric framework will provide insights for solving more complex moir\'e patterns and facilitate the application of moir\'e patterns in X-ray diffractions, wave manipulations, molecular dynamics, and other fields.</description>

      <title>Giant Nonvolatile Multistate Resistance with Fully Magnetically Controlled in van der Waals Multiferroic Tunnel Junctions</title>

Abstract: Ferroelectric polarization switching in electrically controlled van der Waals multiferroic tunnel junctions (vdW-MFTJs) causes atomic migration, compromising device stability and fatigue resistance. Here we propose a fully magnetically controlled vdW-MFTJ based on a \(\mathrm{CrBr_3/MnPSe_3/CrBr_3}\) vertical heterostructure, which achieves ferroelectric polarization reversal without relying on atomic migration driven by inversion symmetry breaking. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the spin-polarized quantum transport properties of the proposed structure. By integrating asymmetric PtTe$_2$/alkali-metal (Li/Na/K)-doped/intercalated CrBr$_3$ electrodes, the device demonstrates exceptional performance, with a maximum tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) exceeding $8.1\times10^5$\% and tunneling electroresistance (TER) reaching 2499\%, while the spin-filtering channels can be flexibly controlled by the magnetization direction of the magnetic free layer, achieving perfect spin-filtering over a broad bias voltage range. Applying an external bias voltage further enhances these metrics, increasing TMR to $3.6\times 10^7$\% and TER to 9990\%. Notably, a pronounced negative differential resistance (NDR) effect is observed, yielding an unprecedented peak-to-valley ratio (PVR) of $9.55\times10^9$\%, representing the highest value reported for vertical tunnel junctions. These extraordinary characteristics highlight the potential of vdW-MFTJs for ultra-efficient electronic switching, a key feature for next-generation spintronic devices. Our findings provide a solid theoretical foundation for designing and developing high-performance magnetic storage and logic technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report new quasi-aperiodic, ground-state structures and phase transitions in $\Sigma5$ tilt grain boundaries (GBs) in body-centered cubic (BCC) refractory metals Nb, Ta, Mo, and W. $\Sigma5$ tilt GBs have been extensively investigated over the past several decades, with their ground-state structure -- composed of kite-shaped structural units -- previously thought to be well understood. By performing a rigorous GB structure search that optimizes the number of atoms in the boundary core, we predict new quasi-aperiodic "split kite" phases analogous to those previously found in GBs in face-centered cubic metals. Our results suggest that complex aperiodic phases of GBs appear to be a general phenomenon. Density functional theory calculations yield similar GB energies and structures for kite and split kite phases in all BCC metals studied. Phase-contrast image simulations of split kites show better agreement with experimental observations, offering an alternative explanation for previous microscopy results and motivating future atomically resolved imaging of the GB structure.</description>

      <title>Effect of metal (Ti) interlayer on fracture toughness of TiN thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Titanium nitride (TiN) is widely used as a protective coating due to its high hardness, but suffers from inherent brittleness and low fracture toughness, limiting its applicability. The layering of TiN films with metallic titanium (Ti) improves the overall fracture behaviour of the architecture by modifying the crack driving force due to elastic-plastic mismatch between the layers. Microcantilever fracture tests were carried out on bilayer (Ti-TiN, TiN-Ti) and trilayer (Ti-TiN-Ti) architectures to determine the fracture toughness and study the fundamental crack growth behaviour. The initiation fracture toughness in bilayer architecture with crack in Ti layer is almost 70% higher, when compared to crack in TiN layer. In Ti-TiN bilayer the crack propagated catastrophically post linear elastic deformation, whereas the crack was arrested at the TiN/Ti interface in both TiN-Ti and Ti-TiN-Ti architectures due to plastic energy dissipation in the Ti layer. Crack tip plasticity originated in the metallic Ti layer in TiN-Ti and Ti-TiN-Ti architectures increased the total fracture resistance by more than eight-fold compared to the Ti-TiN bilayer.</description>

Abstract: Recent developments in topological mechanics have demonstrated the ability of Maxwell lattices to effectively focus stress along domain walls between differently polarized domains. The focusing ability can be exploited to protect the lattice bulk from accidental stress concentration -- and eventually onset and propagation of fracture -- at structural hot spots such as defects and cracks. A recent study has revisited the problem for structural lattices featuring non-ideal hinges, showing that the focusing remains robust, albeit diluted in strength. Realizing that the problem of domain wall localization has been traditionally framed in the context of linear elasticity, in this work we extend the study to the realm of soft structures undergoing nonlinear finite deformation. Through experiments performed on silicone hyperelastic prototypes, we assess and quantify the robustness of the phenomenon against the macroscopic shape changes induced by large deformation, with special attention to deformation levels that alter the topology of the bulk, lifting the topological protection. Furthermore, we identify a simple geometric indicator for this transition.</description>

Abstract: Lanthanum-hydrogen system and its derivatives remain among the most promising for achieving room-temperature superconductivity. In this study, we examined the formation of ternary lanthanum-scandium superhydrides at pressures up to 220 GPa. The primary product of the LaSc alloy's reaction with hydrogen is newly discovered cubic (La,Sc)H$_{12}$, demonstrating clear superconducting transition in all six channels of the van der Pauw scheme below 244-248 K. In this compound with an unusually large unit cell volume, virtually no magnetoresistance was observed in fields up to 68 Tesla. Synthesized samples of (La,Sc)H$_{12}$ demonstrate pronounced superconducting diode and SQUID-like effects at a record high temperature of 233 K. Furthermore, our analysis revealed the formation of lower hexagonal polyhydrides (La,Sc)H$_{6-7}$, which could potentially account for the anomaly in electrical resistance observed near 274 K. This anomaly between 265-290 K also appears in the radio-frequency transmission measurements and may be of a superconducting nature.</description>

      <title>Origin of yield stress and mechanical plasticity in model biological tissues</title>

Abstract: During development and under normal physiological conditions, biological tissues are continuously subjected to substantial mechanical stresses. In response to large deformations cells in a tissue must undergo multicellular rearrangements in order to maintain integrity and robustness. However, how these events are connected in time and space remains unknown. Here, using computational and theoretical modeling, we studied the mechanical plasticity of epithelial monolayers under large deformations. Our results demonstrate that the jamming-unjamming (solid-fluid) transition in tissues can vary significantly depending on the degree of deformation, implying that tissues are highly unconventional materials. Using analytical modeling, we elucidate the origins of this behavior. We also demonstrate how a tissue accommodates large deformations through a collective series of rearrangements, which behave similarly to avalanches in non-living materials. We find that these tissue avalanches are governed by stress redistribution and the spatial distribution of vulnerable spots. Finally, we propose a simple and experimentally accessible framework to predict avalanches and infer tissue mechanical stress based on static images.</description>
