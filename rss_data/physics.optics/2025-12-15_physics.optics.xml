      <title>3D-printed microscope with illumination for undergraduate wave optics laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an educational tool, a microscope with a video camera, that can be fabricated either from a standard microscope or assembled from inexpensive, commercially available components (objectives, beam splitters, LEDs, linear stages) and 3D-printed elements. Usage of interference filters in combination with white light-emitting diode (LED) illumination enables the quantitative study of optical phenomena such as refraction, interference (e.g., Newton's rings), Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction. Thus, we propose an instrument that can be used to illustrate the theoretical foundations of an undergraduate optics course and beyond.</description>

      <title>Deep diffractive optical neural networks for detecting Skyrmionic topologies of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical Skyrmions are topological forms of structured light with the potential of an infinite encoding alphabet that is immune to disturbance. This attractive prospect is hindered by the lack of any topological detector, a challenging problem due to the non-orthogonal nature of the topological invariant (N). Here we demonstrate the first deterministic detector for Skyrmionic topologies of light using a deep diffractive optical neural network. Our network uses two independent processing channels of 5 diffractive layers each to map incoming topologies to spatially separated Gaussian channels from which N can be detected. We overcome the complexity of the training by using a spatial mode basis rather than pixels, reducing the training variables by x1000 compared to current methods. We use the detector on an input set of 81 input topologies, showing high accuracy even in the presence of significant levels of noise. Finally, to show the practical utility of the device, we transmit and receive an image encoded in a 14-level topological alphabet with no discernible cross-talk. Our work offers a new paradigm for the emergent field of diffractive optical networks and can easily be extended to other forms of optical topologies, setting a clear pathway for their deployment in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Bismuth nanogratings with narrow plasmon resonances for dynamic polarized color generation and colorimetric sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bismuth nanostructures are appealing for sustainable color generation and sunlight harvesting, thanks to their non-toxicity and their tunable visible-to-near infrared interband plasmon resonances. However, owing to their broad and polarization-insensitive spectral features, the nanostructures reported so far displayed a limited color tunability and were unsuitable for other applications such as sensing. Herein, we report bismuth nanogratings with polarization-sensitive and narrow plasmon resonances (Q &gt; 10). They were fabricated on the $cm^2$ scale following a lithography-free approach: conformal pulsed laser deposition of bismuth onto the reflective and transparent nanostructured layers of DVDs. We characterized their specular reflectance for different orientations of the plane of incidence, angles of incidence, and polarizations of light. When light is polarized in the plane perpendicular to the lines, plasmon resonances occur and shift across the visible-to-near infrared upon changing the angle of incidence. In contrast, no such resonances occur when light is polarized in the plane parallel to the lines. This results in well-contrasted, polarization-sensitive colors, which are iridescent for the former orientation of polarization, and not for the latter. Resonances strongly shift upon changing the refractive index of the surrounding medium (&gt; 500 nm/RIU), resulting in a marked change in the plasmonic color, e.g., from green in air to red in water. This showcases the potential of these nanogratings for dynamic polarized color generation and colorimetric sensing.</description>

      <title>Inverse-Designed Hollow Nanowire Cavity with a Non-Hermitian Perturbation for OAM Light Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We designed a gallium nitride hexagonal hollow nanowire whispering gallery mode cavity that generates an |m|=6 topological light with orbital angular momentum (OAM). OAM is generated by breaking the cross-sectional mirror symmetry of the nanowire, which creates a non-Hermitian system. This is achieved by replacing the central airhole of the hollow nanowire with a cluster of 6 overlapping circular air holes with rotational offset relative to the hexagonal cross-sectional profile of the nanowire. The design parameters were then further optimized in Finite Element Method using an inverse design method to maximize the normalized OAM order |l|. We were able to realize of a cavity mode with |l| = 5.7, a mode purity of about 97%, and a Q-factor of ~250. This marks the first OAM generating active photonic device design falling within a sub-micron footprint, with additional novelties of being single component and materialistically homogeneous.</description>

      <title>Active steering of cathodoluminescence through a generalized Smith-Purcell effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical metasurfaces can shape the near fields of energetic electrons, enabling Smith-Purcell (SP) emission. We introduce a generalized SP effect relying on finite periodic arrays whose elements possess individually tunable polarizabilities, allowing us to explore higher-order SP radiation. By controlling the amplitude and phase of each of the elements, we show through rigorous theory the ability to create an SP steering device. In particular, we explore the active tuning capabilities of doped graphene, and thermally driven phase-change materials, which we compare with standard passive plasmonic structures made of gold and silver. Our results establish programmable electron-driven light sources and spectroscopic probes spanning the terahertz-to-visible range, advancing tunable metasurfaces for next-generation electron-photon technologies.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic and Deterministic Routes to Soliton Combs in Non-Hermitian Kerr Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a cardinal solution for the long-standing and fundamental problem associated with the adiabatic, reversible, and controlled excitation of both dark and bright solitons in Kerr micro-resonators with normal group velocity dispersion. Our findings stem from the inclusion of a localised non-Hermitian potential, which we use to drastically reshape the characteristic collapsed snaking structure associated with such solitons. Consequently, we demonstrate a novel snaking-free bifurcation landscape where solitons of all possible widths are continuously connected via the dynamic change of the cavity detuning, and hence dissipative localised states of unprecedentedly high pump-to-comb conversion efficiencies can be excited in an adiabatic, deterministic, and reversible fashion. Our fundamental discovery has practical implications of paramount importance for frequency comb generation in all-normal dispersion cavities, which are key to comb generation in most spectral regions away from the telecom bands.</description>

      <title>Compact Eye Tracking for VR/AR Displays via Deep Learned MicroLED Projection and Single-Pixel Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast and accurate eye tracking in a virtual reality or augmented reality headset could lead to better display performance and enable novel methods of user interaction with the system. However, it remains a challenge for a system to combine the required operational speed and accuracy of eye tracking with a technology that has a small enough form factor and weight to be easily integrated into a user-friendly headset. By using small, lightweight hardware comprising a high frame rate microLED array and fast single pixel detector, we report a model eye tracking system based on single pixel tracking and a specially developed set of deep learned illumination patterns. This model system is used to demonstrate eye tracking with an angular accuracy of better than one degree and a measurement rate of up to $3.59 \,$ kHz.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary-order exceptional points in a nanomechanical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order exceptional points (EPs) govern non-Hermitian system dynamics through their enriched and sharpened spectral topology, yet the intrinsic topological fragility hinders robust experimental realization. Here, we present a scalable architecture that implements arbitrary-order EPs via a recurrent network comprising a single nanomechanical resonator and unlimited virtual resonators. We experimentally realize mechanical EPs up to the seventh order and confirm this architecture's scalability. Moreover, we reveal that the fundamental noise component and the measured signal share the same system coupling channel and thus undergo identical root-response amplification near EPs of arbitrary order, consistent with our signal-to-noise ratio measurements. Our work establishes a general platform for exploring higher-order EP-based phenomena while clarifying the fundamental boundary of non-Hermitian sensitivity enhancement across diverse physical systems.</description>

      <title>High-velocity optothermal whirlpool actuation at the air-water interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a meniscus lifted above a free water surface by an optical fiber delivering near infrared radiation, the upper confinement of the heated buoyant liquid amplifies the surface temperature gradient, driving particularly strong thermocapillary effects. When the temperature gradient within the meniscus becomes very large, the stationary convection flow destabilizes in a periodic pattern of surface hydrothermal waves. We show that these light fueled waves can be controlled to a large extent by acting on the system parameters, and harnessed to propel buoyant macroparticles along stable closed trajectories at exceptionally high speeds. With 20 mW of input power at 1550 nm, we observe fast linear oscillations of 0.1 to 1 mm particles with peak velocities up to 2 cm/s and a whirlpool-like stable orbital motion with rotation rate up to 600 rpm, the largest reported so far for optothermal actuation. These findings establish a new efficient method for contactless actuation on liquid surfaces with direct application in microfluidics and in the realization of efficient light powered micromotors. At the same time, the proposed fiber meniscus configuration provides a simple and adaptable platform for studying optothermal fluid instabilities and for generating and controlling surface thermocapillary waves.</description>

      <title>Quantized pumping in disordered nonlinear Thouless pumps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of nonlinear optical Thouless pumps in the presence of disorder, using optical waveguide arrays. It was previously known that the displacement of solitons in Thouless pumps is quantized and may exhibit integer and fractional transport over the course of the pump cycle. Here, we demonstrate that, in disordered nonlinear pumps, quantization may be maintained despite the presence of disorder, even though it would not be in the linear domain. Moreover, nonlinearity allows pumps to be executed more quickly (i.e., less adiabatically). This may serve as a design principle for integrated non-reciprocal devices based on temporal modulation.</description>

      <title>Tailoring quantum walks in integrated photonic lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike discrete photonic circuits, which manipulate photons step-by-step using a series of optical elements, arrays of coupled waveguides enable photons to interfere continuously across the entire structure. When composed of a nonlinear material, such arrays can also directly generate quantum states of light within the circuit. To clarify the similarities and distinctions between these two approaches of quantum walks, we conduct here a systematic comparison between linear waveguide arrays, injected with photons produced externally, and nonlinear arrays, where photon pairs are continuously generated via parametric down-conversion. We experimentally validate these predictions using III-V semiconductor nonlinear waveguide lattices with varied geometries, enabling us to tune the depth of the quantum walks over an order of magnitude and reveal the gradual emergence of non-classicality in the output state. Finally, we demonstrate an inverse-design approach to engineer \textit{aperiodic} waveguide arrays, whose optimized coupling profiles generate maximally entangled states such as the biphoton W-state. These results highlight the potential of continuously-coupled photonic systems to harness high-dimensional entanglement within compact architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an interaction-free ghost imaging scheme based on a thermal light source. By utilizing the quantum Zeno-like effect, our approach significantly reduces the light dose absorbed by the sample, thereby effectively preventing sample damage induced by light-matter interactions. Combined with the elimination of entangled photon sources and single-photon detectors, our approach enables significantly more photons to be utilized for image reconstruction, thereby markedly enhancing image quality compared to conventional ghost imaging. We further demonstrate active suppression of background noise via controllable photon loss. Our work offers a practical and cost-effective route to non-destructive, high-quality imaging for light-sensitive samples in fields such as life sciences.</description>

Abstract: Spectroscopic polarimetry (SP) is a powerful tool for evaluation of thin film, optical materials, and biological samples because it can provide both polarimetric and spectroscopic characteristics of objects. However, its performance is often hampered by the mechanical instability and the limited data acquisition speed arising from the mechanical polarization modulation. Dual-comb spectroscopic polarimetry (DCSP) based on a combination of SP with dual-comb spectroscopy can acquire optical spectra of amplitude ratio and phase difference in p- and s-polarization components of the output light from simultaneous measurement of optical spectra of optical amplitude and phase in p- and s-polarization components without the need for mechanical polarization modulation. In this article, we combine the DCSP with polarization control pulse sequences (PCPS) with different polarizations and time delays for a more detailed analysis of the sample's polarization response based on Jones matrix. We obtain Jones matrix of a sample as a function of wavelength by measuring those optical spectra while multiplexing the incident light into multiple polarizations instead of a single polarization. Such Jones matrix DCSP (JM-DCSP) is applied for analysis of optical elements with known polarization property and its experimental result is in good agreement with theoretical values, indicating the validity of the proposed method. JM-DCSP will further expand the application scope of SP.</description>

      <title>Speckle-Driven Single-Shot Orbital Angular Momentum Recognition with Ultra-Low Sampling Density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) recognition of vortex beams is critical for applications ranging from optical communications to quantum technologies. However, conventional approaches designed for free-space propagation struggle when light passes through scattering media, such as multimode fibers (MMF), and often rely on high-resolution sensors with tens of thousands of pixels to record detailed intensity profiles. Here, by harnessing scattering media as intrinsic encoders rather than detrimental factors, we introduce a speckle-driven OAM recognition technique termed patially multiplexed points detection (SMPD). This method extracts intensity information from a few spatially distributed points in a speckle plane, where object feature is naturally multiplexed, thereby transforming scattering from a detrimental effect into an efficient encoding mechanism while drastically reducing sampling requirements. Remarkably, it achieves over 99% retrieval accuracy for OAMs recognition using just 16 sampling points, corresponding to a sampling density of 0.024% compared with conventional imaging-based approaches. Furthermore, spatiotemporally interleaved vortex beams decoding, highcapacity OAM-multiplexed communication, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST classification are implemented to verify the versatility of SMPD. This work establishes a scalable strategy for efficient optical information processing and fiberbased sensing in complex environments.</description>

      <title>High Purcell enhancement in all-TMDC nanobeam resonator designs with active monolayers for nanolasers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a nanobeam resonator incorporating an active monolayer, designed to achieve a high Purcell enhancement. The resonator is fully composed of transition-metal-dichalcogenide materials and intended to operate as a high-beta-factor nanolaser. A theoretical framework that models and optimizes the Purcell enhancement associated with the emission from atomically thin layers is developed. This framework is based on a resonance expansion, enabling spectral resolution of physical quantities governed by high-Q resonances. The numerical optimization of the resonator leads to the presence of a high-Q resonance supporting a strong electric field confinement in the monolayer to maximize the modal gain.</description>

      <title>Expanding the reach of diffusing wave spectroscopy and tracer bead microrheology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14973</link>

Abstract: Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy (DWS) is an extension of standard dynamic light scattering (DLS), applied to soft materials that are turbid or opaque. The propagation of light is modeled using light diffusion, characterized by a light diffusion coefficient that depends on the transport mean free path l* of the medium. DWS is highly sensitive to small particle displacements or other local fluctuations in the scattering properties and can probe sub-nanometer displacements. Analyzing the motion of beads in a viscoelastic matrix, known as one-bead microrheology, is one of the most common applications of DWS. Despite significant advancements since its invention in the late 1980s, including two-cell and multispeckle DWS, challenges such as merging single- and multispeckle data and limited accuracy for short correlation times persist. Here, we address these issues by improving the two-cell echo DWS scheme. We propose a calibration-free method to blend and merge echo and two-cell DWS data and demonstrate the use of an exponential basis fit to enhance data quality, in particular at very short times. Building on this, we introduce stable corrections for bead and fluid inertia, significantly improving the quality of microrheology data at high frequencies.</description>

      <title>Wave-particle duality in the measurement of gravitational radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03527v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a consistent description of the quantum measurement process, whether the wave or particle-like aspect of a system is revealed depends on the details of the measurement chain, and cannot be interpreted as an objective fact about the system independent of the measurement. We show precisely how this comes to be in the measurement of gravitational radiation. Whether a wave or particle-like aspect is revealed is a property of the detector employed at the end of the quantum measurement chain, rather than of the meter, such as a gravitational-wave (GW) antenna or resonant bar, used to couple the radiation to the detector. A linear detector yields no signal for radiation in a Fock state and a signal proportional to the amplitude in a coherent state -- supporting a wave-like interpretation. By contrast, the signal from a detector coupled to the meter's energy is non-zero only when the incident radiation contains at least a single graviton. Thus, conceptually simple modifications of contemporary GW antennae can reveal wave-particle duality in the measurement of gravitational radiation.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of a nuclear spin qubit register in silicon photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Color centers provide an optical interface to quantum registers based on electron and nuclear spin qubits in solids. The T center in silicon is an emerging spin-photon interface that combines telecom O-band optical transitions and an electron spin in a scalable photonics platform. In this work, we demonstrate the initialization, coherent control, and state readout of a three-qubit register based on the electron spin of a T center coupled to a hydrogen and a silicon nuclear spin. The spin register exhibits spin echo coherence times of $0.41(2)$~ms for the electron spin, $112(12)$~ms for the hydrogen nuclear spin, and $67(7)$~ms for the silicon nuclear spin. We use nuclear-nuclear two-qubit gates to generate entanglement between the two nuclear spins with a fidelity of $F=0.77(3)$ and a coherence time of $T^*_2=2.60(8)$~ms. Our results show that a T center in silicon photonics can realize a multi-qubit register with an optical interface for quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlation scheme for quantum optical coherence tomography based on Michelson interferometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum optical coherence tomography (QOCT) offers a simple way to cancel dispersion broadening in a sample while also providing twice the resolution compared to classical OCT. However, to achieve these advantages, a bright and broadband source of entangled photon pairs is required. A simple implementation uses collinear spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a Michelson interferometer (MI), yet this autocorrelation scheme suffers from parasitic terms and sensitivity to phase noise. Here, we introduce a cross-correlation MI-based QOCT that overcomes these drawbacks, significantly advancing QOCT toward practical applications.</description>

      <title>Random-phase Wave Splatting of Translucent Primitives for Computer-generated Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17480v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Holographic near-eye displays offer ultra-compact form factors for VR/AR systems but rely on advanced computer-generated holography (CGH) algorithms to convert 3D scenes into interference patterns on spatial light modulators (SLMs). Conventional CGH typically generates smooth-phase holograms, limiting view-dependent effects and realistic defocus blur, while severely under-utilizing the SLM space-bandwidth product. We propose Random-phase Wave Splatting (RPWS), a unified wave optics rendering framework that converts arbitrary 3D representations based on 2D translucent primitives into random-phase holograms. RPWS is fully compatible with modern 3D representations such as Gaussians and triangles, improves bandwidth utilization which effectively enlarges eyebox size, reconstructs accurate defocus blur and parallax, and leverages time-multiplexed rendering not as a heuristic for speckle suppression, but as a mathematically exact alpha-blending mechanism derived from first principles in statistics. At the core of RPWS are (1) a new wavefront compositing procedure and (2) an alpha-blending scheme for random-phase geometric primitives, ensuring correct color reconstruction and robust occlusion when compositing millions of primitives. RPWS departs substantially from the recent primitive-based CGH algorithm, Gaussian Wave Splatting (GWS). Because GWS uses smooth-phase primitives, it struggles to capture view-dependent effects and realistic defocus blur and under-utilizes the SLM space-bandwidth product; moreover, naively extending GWS to random-phase primitives fails to reconstruct accurate colors. In contrast, RPWS is designed from the ground up for arbitrary random-phase translucent primitives, and through simulations and experimental validations we demonstrate state-of-the-art image quality and perceptually faithful 3D holograms for next-generation near-eye displays.</description>

      <title>Momentum-resolved two photon interference of weak coherent states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate an experimental scheme for high-precision position measurements based on transverse-momentum-resolved two-photon interferometry with independent photons and single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) arrays. Our scheme extends the operative range of Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry beyond its intrinsic constraints due to photons indistinguishability, paving the way to applications in high-resolution imaging. We assess the experimental results against the ultimate precision bounds as determined by quantum estimation theory. Our experiment ultimately proves that transverse-momentum resolved measurements of fourth-order correlations in the fields can be employed to overcome spatial distinguishability between independent photons. The relevance of our results extends beyond sensing and imaging towards quantum information processing, as we show that partial photon distinguishability and entanglement impurity are not necessarily a nuisance in a technique that relies on two-photon interference.</description>

      <title>Table-top all-attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS) has emerged as a powerful technique within the field of attosecond science, combining extremely high temporal and excellent spectral resolution. So far, ATAS has been implemented in pump-probe experiments where an attosecond extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) pump or probe pulse was combined with a near-infrared (NIR) pulse in the femtosecond range, with the attosecond time resolution deriving from sub-cycle NIR-driven dynamics. Investigations of ultrafast electron dynamics in atoms, molecules and solids, with potential impact across physics, chemistry, and biology, would benefit significantly from the ability to perform all-attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (AATAS). Here we demonstrate time-resolved AATAS using a table-top high-harmonic generation (HHG) source. The method is applied to investigate previously unresolved electronic coherences in Xe, revealing oscillatory valence hole motion with a 3-femtosecond period. In addition, systematic investigations of electron dynamics in Kr, Ar, and Ne are presented. Our work shows that, thanks to its broad bandwidth, high stability and easy accessibility, HHG is an ideal source for AATAS, offering the potential for replication in numerous laboratories.</description>
