      <title>How to Improve Portuguese Secondary Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I share some personal thoughts on the status of Portuguese secondary education in general, and of the physics part thereof in particular, drawn from several decades of experience of organizing training activities for students and school teachers, as well as several hundred visits to secondary schools and similar numbers of interviews of secondary school students (from Portugal and elsewhere). I offer various suggestions for improving and modernising our current system.</description>

      <title>Illustrating Special-Relativity Phenomena via Gaussian Ray Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We highlight the correspondence between one-dimensional Lorentz transformations, which relate events observed from two distinct inertial reference frames, and ray transfer transformations in Gaussian optics. Specifically, we identify optical systems whose transfer matrices reproduce the mathematical structure of the Lorentz transformation. Within this framework, we show that fundamental effects of special relativity as time dilatation, length contraction and loss of synchronicity find a direct counterpart in the behavior of light rays deviated by a diverging lens, thereby providing a novel and illustrative optical equivalence of relativistic phenomena. This article is intended for a broad audience of physicists. The correspondence described is general and may interest students with a moderate background in special relativity and optics, as well as teachers in the corresponding fields.</description>

      <title>It's Not The Plane -- It's The Pilot: A Framework for Cognitive-Activated AI-Augmentation to Avoid the Boiling Frog Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems can now reliably solve many standard tasks used in introductory physics courses, producing correct equations, graphs, and explanations. While this capability is often framed as an opportunity for efficiency or personalization, it also poses a subtle ethical and educational risk: students may increasingly submit correct results without engaging in the epistemic practices that define learning physics.This challenge has recently been described as the "boiling frog problem" because we may not fully recognize how rapidly AI capabilities are advancing and fail to respond with commensurate urgency. In this article, we argue that the central challenge of AI in physics education is not cheating or tool selection, but instructional design. Drawing on research on self-regulated learning, cognitive load, multiple representations, and hybrid intelligence, we propose a practical framework for cognitively activated learning activities that structures student activities before, during, and after AI use. Using an example from an introductory kinematics laboratory, we show how AI can be integrated in ways that preserve prediction, interpretation, and evaluation as core learning activities. Rather than treating AI as an answer-generating tool, the framework positions AI as an epistemic partner whose contributions are deliberately bounded and reflected upon.</description>
