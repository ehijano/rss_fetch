      <title>Performing all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of intrinsically disordered proteins with replica exchange solute tempering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations are a valuable tool for characterizing the conformational ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). IDP conformational ensembles are highly heterogeneous and contain structures with many distinct topologies separated by large free-energy barriers. Sampling the vast conformational space of IDPs in explicit solvent all-atom MD simulations is extremely challenging, and enhanced sampling methods are generally required to obtain statistically meaningful descriptions of IDP conformational ensembles. Replica exchange solute tempering (REST) methods, where multiple coupled simulations of a system are performed in parallel with selectively modified potential energy functions, are a powerful approach for efficiently sampling the conformational space of IDPs. In this chapter, we demonstrate how to set-up, perform and analyze all-atom MD simulations of IDPs with REST enhanced sampling methods.</description>

      <title>Development and application of $\Delta$-machine-learned interatomic potentials to platinum-Nafion interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLPs) have rapidly progressed in accuracy, speed, and data efficiency in recent years. However, training robust MLPs in multicomponent systems still remains a challenge. In this work, we demonstrate a method to physically inform a MLP by $\Delta$-learning the correction to the bonding term in a Dreiding potential for Nafion. The $\Delta$-MLP respects the internal bonds of the polymer but otherwise learns atomic interactions and reactivity from density functional theory training data. We use this $\Delta$-MLP to study the properties of the platinum-Nafion interface, analyzing polymer structure, proton mobility near and far from the platinum catalyst, and reaction pathway performance. The method shows promise in terms of data-efficient treatment of multicomponent systems, but further refinement is needed in the quality of input data to achieve combined insights into structure, transport, and reactivity at polymer-catalyst interfaces.</description>

      <title>Chemical hydrodynamics of nuclear spin states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanical equations of motion are strictly linear in state descriptors, such as wavefunctions and density matrices, but equations describing chemical kinetics and hydrodynamics may be non-linear in concentrations. This incompatibility is fundamental, but special cases can be handled - for example, in magnetic resonance where nuclear spin interactions may be too weak influence concentration dynamics. For processes involving single spins and first-order chemical reactions, this is a well-researched topic, but time evolution of complex nuclear spin systems in the presence of second-order kinetics, diffusion, and flow has so far remained intractable. This creates obstacles in microfluidics, homogeneous catalysis, and magnetic resonance imaging of metabolic processes.
  In this communication we report a numerically stable formalism for time-domain quantum mechanical description of nuclear spin dynamics and decoherence in the simultaneous presence of diffusion, flow, and second-order chemical reactions. The formalism is implemented in versions 2.11 and later of the open-source Spinach library. As an illustration, we use Diels-Alder cycloaddition of acrylonitrile to cyclopentadiene, yielding endo- and exo-norbornene carbonitrile, in the presence of diffusion and flow in the detection chamber of a microfluidic NMR probe (a finite element model with thousands of Voronoi cells) with a spatially localised stripline radiofrequency coil.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Role of Peierls Vibrations in Singlet Fission with the Adaptive Hierarchy of Pure States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singlet fission, a phenomenon in which a singlet exciton is converted to two triplet excitons, is sensitive to vibrations that perturb couplings between electronic states (i.e., Peierls vibrations). In singlet fission models larger than dimers, the inconvenient scaling of exact simulations has limited treatment of Peierls vibrations to approximate methods. In this letter, we generalize the formally-exact, reduced-scaling adaptive Hierarchy of Pure States (adHOPS) method to account for both Holstein and Peierls vibrations and study singlet fission in ethylphenyl perylene di-imide (EP-PDI). We find that singlet fission is accelerated by constructive interference between charge-transfer mediated pathways when Peierls vibrations break the anti-symmetry of electronic couplings in conjunction with rapid vibrationally-mediated relaxation of singlet excitons. Finally, we extend this singlet fission model to a linear chain of EP-PDI, exploring edge effects and demonstrating the possibility of size-invariant scaling in simulations of singlet fission on 10s-to-100s-of-nm scales.</description>

      <title>How individual vs shared coordination governs the degree of correlation in rotational vs residence times in a high-viscosity lithium electrolyte</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commercially used carbonate-based electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries are susceptible to many challenges, including flammability, volatility, and lower thermal stability. Solvated ionic liquids of LiTFSI salt (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-amide) and glyme-based solvents are potential alternative candidates for commonly used electrolytes. We perform classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations study the effect of concentration and temperature on the translational and rotational dynamics. The radial distribution function shows stronger coordination of Li$^+$ ions with tetraglyme(G4), as shown in earlier studies, and forms a stable [Li(G4)]$^+$ cation complex. The self-diffusion coefficients are lower than the values experimentally observed but show better improvement over other classical force fields. An increase in the salt concentrations leads to a higher viscosity of the system and reduces the overall ionic mobility of Li$^{+}$ ions. Diluting the system with a larger number of glyme molecules leads to shorter rotational relaxation times for both TFSI and tetraglyme. Ion-residence times show that Li$^+$ ions form stable and long-lasting complexes with G4 molecules than TFSI anions. The residence time of [Li(G4)]$^+$ complex decreases at higher salt concentrations due to the availability of fewer G4 molecules to coordinate with a Li$^+$ ion. G4 is also seen to form polydentate complexes with Li$^+$ without a shared coordination, allowing rotation without breaking coordination, unlike TFSI, which requires coordination disruption for rotation. This distinction explains the poor correlation between rotation and residence time for G4 and the strong correlation for TFSI.</description>

      <title>A Computational Study of the Vibrational and Rotational g-Factors of the Diatomic Molecules LiH, LiF, CO, CS, SiO and SiS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to present theoretical values for the vibrational and rotational g-factors of several diatomic molecules. The calculations have been carried out at the Multi-Configurational Self-Consistent Field (MCSCF) level of theory. To determine the most reliant method and basis set for these calculations also the Hartree-Fock (HF) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) approaches were considered. Different DFT functionals, including B3LYP, BHandHLYP, PBE0, B3PW91 and KT3 have been employed. Furthermore, different active spaces were evaluated to optimize MCSCF. To establish the accuracy of the methods the computed rotational g-factors were compared to experimental values. The benchmark study of CO and CS shows that the MCSCF method provides most reliable results and that the aug-cc-pCV5Z basis set is the most sufficient. The aug-cc-pCVQZ basis set for Li and aug-cc-pV5Z basis set for H gave best results for LiH. The active spaces tested for CO and CS do not yet converge towards the experimental values when more determinants were included. However, if the g-factors are vibrationally averaged, the computed values are seen to move towards the experimental value. Lastly, the g-factors have been vibrationally averaged, and it shows a slight improved agreement between computed values and experimental data.</description>

      <title>Complex-variable MP2 theory applied to core-vacant states for the computation of Auger spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model Auger spectra using second-order M\o ller-Plesset perturbation (MP2) theory combined with complex-scaled basis functions. For this purpose, we decompose the complex MP2 energy of the core-hole state into contributions from specific decay channels and propose a corresponding equation-of-motion (EOM) method for computing the doubly ionized final states of Auger decay. These methods lead to significant savings in computational cost compared to our recently developed approaches based on coupled-cluster theory [J. Chem. Phys. 156, 114117 (2022)].
  The test set for this study comprises water, ammonia, methane, hydrogen sulfide, phosphine, and silane. The energies of the final states of Auger decay are obtained with an accuracy comparable to EOM coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) theory. Partial decay widths and branching ratios between KLL, KLM, and KMM decay of K-shell holes in third-row hydrides are in good agreement with EOM-CCSD, while deviations are more significant for second-row hydrides. For L$_1$-shell holes, which undergo Coster-Kronig decay, MP2 yields unphysical results. However, we show that a suitable shift of the MP2 energy denominators leads to more reliable branching ratios and spectra for these problematic cases.</description>

      <title>Multi-fidelity learning for interatomic potentials: Low-level forces and high-level energies are all you need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The promise of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) has led to an abundance of public quantum mechanical (QM) training datasets. The quality of an MLIP is directly limited by the accuracy of the energies and atomic forces in the training dataset. Unfortunately, most of these datasets are computed with relatively low-accuracy QM methods, e.g., density functional theory with a moderate basis set. Due to the increased computational cost of more accurate QM methods, e.g., coupled-cluster theory with a complete basis set extrapolation, most high-accuracy datasets are much smaller and often do not contain atomic forces. The lack of high-accuracy atomic forces is quite troubling, as training with force data greatly improves the stability and quality of the MLIP compared to training to energy alone. Because most datasets are computed with a unique level of theory, traditional single-fidelity learning is not capable of leveraging the vast amounts of published QM data. In this study, we apply multi-fidelity learning to train an MLIP to multiple QM datasets of different levels of accuracy, i.e., levels of fidelity. Specifically, we perform three test cases to demonstrate that multi-fidelity learning with both low-level forces and high-level energies yields an extremely accurate MLIP -- far more accurate than a single-fidelity MLIP trained solely to high-level energies and almost as accurate as a single-fidelity MLIP trained directly to high-level energies and forces. Therefore, multi-fidelity learning greatly alleviates the need for generating large and expensive datasets containing high-accuracy atomic forces and allows for more effective training to existing high-accuracy energy-only datasets. Indeed, low-accuracy atomic forces and high-accuracy energies are all that are needed to achieve a high-accuracy MLIP with multi-fidelity learning.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-body Simulations from a Reinforcement-Learned Exponential Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving for the many-body wavefunction represents a significant challenge on both classical and quantum devices because of the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space with system size. While the complexity of the wavefunction can be reduced through conventional ans\"{a}tze (e.g., the coupled cluster ansatz), it can still grow rapidly with system size even on quantum devices. An exact, universal two-body exponential ansatz for the many-body wavefunction has been shown to be generated from the solution of the contracted Schr\"odinger equation (CSE), and recently, this ansatz has been implemented without classical approximation on quantum simulators and devices for the scalable simulation of many-body quantum systems. Here we combine the solution of the CSE with a form of artificial intelligence known as reinforcement learning (RL) to generate highly compact circuits that implement this ansatz without sacrificing accuracy. As a natural extension of CSE, we reformulate the wavefunction update as a Markovian decision process and train the agent to select the optimal actions at each iteration based upon only the current CSE residual. Compact circuits with high accuracy are achieved for H3 and H4 molecules over a range of molecular geometries.</description>

      <title>Three types of condensation in open wedges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Condensation in linear wedges formed by semi-infinite walls is a well-established critical phenomenon characterized by the continuous growth of an adsorbed liquid layer as bulk two-phase coexistence is approached. In this study, we investigate condensation in finite-length wedges open at both ends, demonstrating that the process becomes first-order. The open boundaries and finite geometry induce a remarkably rich phase behavior of the confined fluid, exhibiting three distinct types of condensation, reentrant phenomena, and continuous higher-order transitions between condensation states. Through a detailed macroscopic analysis, we derive the conditions for each type of condensation, classify the global phase diagrams, and explore asymptotic behavior in specific limiting cases. The asymptotic predictions are confirmed by a detailed comparison with the numerical solutions of the governing equations.</description>

      <title>Construction of First Principle Based Adiabatic and Diabatic Hamiltonian for TiO$_6^{8-}$ unit of BaTiO$_3$ Crystal: Photoemission Spectra and Ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ferroelectric property of BaTiO$_3$ crystal arises from the strong Pseudo Jahn-Teller (PJT) interactions between the non-degenerate ground electronic state, $^1A_{1g}$ and the degenerate $^1T_{1u}$ symmetry states through the nuclear distortions of $t_{1u}$ modes in TiO$_6^{8-}$ unit. In a $d^0$ electronic configuration of $Ti^{4+}$ ion, the PJT interaction leads to a stabilization effect, which has been explored using Beyond Born-Oppenheimer (BBO) theory. The $^1T_{1u}$ excited states form a three-state degeneracy, exhibiting feeble Jahn-Teller (JT) distortions over the $t_{2g}$ planes. For the first time, we compute \textit{ab initio} adiabatic potential energy surfaces (PESs) and non-adiabatic coupling terms (NACTs), and thereafter, diabatic PESs and couplings for the perovskite unit, TiO$_6^{8-}$. Using a Time-Dependent Discrete Variable Representation (TDDVR) approach, the theoretical photoemission spectra exhibit good agreement with the experimental ones. Moreover, the experimental observation on order parameter associated with ferroelectric properties of BaTiO$_3$ crystal show close resemblance with present and other theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Learning simple heuristic rules for classifying materials based on chemical composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past decade, there has been a significant interest in the use of machine learning approaches in materials science research. Conventional deep learning approaches that rely on complex, nonlinear models have become increasingly important in computational materials science due to their high predictive accuracy. In contrast to these approaches, we have shown in a recent work that a remarkably simple learned heuristic rule -- based on the concept of topogivity -- can classify whether a material is topological using only its chemical composition. In this paper, we go beyond the topology classification scenario by also studying the use of machine learning to develop simple heuristic rules for classifying whether a material is a metal based on chemical composition. Moreover, we present a framework for incorporating chemistry-informed inductive bias based on the structure of the periodic table. For both the topology classification and the metallicity classification tasks, we empirically characterize the performance of simple heuristic rules fit with and without chemistry-informed inductive bias across a wide range of training set sizes. We find evidence that incorporating chemistry-informed inductive bias can reduce the amount of training data required to reach a given level of test accuracy.</description>

      <title>Computational Insights into the Chemical Reaction Networks of C3H6O3,C3H7O3 and C2H5O2: Implications for the Interstellar Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of complex organic molecules in the interstellar medium (ISM) is central to astrochemistry and prebiotic chemistry, as these species may act as precursors to biomolecules essential for life. Although glyceraldehyde (HOCH2CH(OH)C(O)H, GCA) has not yet been detected in the ISM, the presence of structurally related compounds in various astronomical environments suggests that it may form under interstellar conditions. In this study, we employed the automated reaction discovery tool AutoMeKin to systematically explore the gas-phase chemical reaction networks (CRNs) of C3H6O3 (GCA), C3H7O3 (a hydrogenated analog), and C2H5O2. Reaction pathways were characterized at the wB97XD/Def2-TZVPP level of theory, and rate coefficients for key processes were computed using the competitive canonical unified statistical (CCUS) model, which accounts for multiple dynamic bottlenecks. Our analysis revealed several barrierless pathways leading to GCA or to GCA and a leaving group. Notably, the reaction between glyoxal (HCOHCO) and the HOCHCH2OH radical, though neither has yet been detected in the ISM, was found to efficiently produce GCA and a formyl radical. However, aside from the aforementined exception, most GCA formation channels result in highly vibrationally excited intermediates that are more likely to undergo rapid unimolecular decomposition than to be stabilized by radiative emission under typical ISM conditions. These results suggest that while gas-phase GCA formation is chemically feasible, it is likely transient and difficult to detect directly. In contrast, alternative products such as formaldehyde, glycolaldehyde, and (Z)-ethene-1,2-diol dominate many pathways and align better with current astronomical observations.</description>

Abstract: The ionic conductivity of a nanofluidic channel is one of its most basic properties, which is systematically characterized in experiments. While most studies to date have focused on the DC conductivity, there has recently been a surge of interest in the behavior of nanochannels under AC voltages. Here, we show that in nanochannels with electrically conducting walls, electrons can contribute to transporting ionic current through the channel. We identify a critical frequency and lengthscale above which electrons in the channel walls become the main charge carriers, resulting in a strongly increased conductivity. Our findings open the way to the engineering of nanofluidic functionalities based on ion-electron coupling.</description>

      <title>El Agente: An Autonomous Agent for Quantum Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational chemistry tools are widely used to study the behaviour of chemical phenomena. Yet, the complexity of these tools can make them inaccessible to non-specialists and challenging even for experts. In this work, we introduce El Agente Q, an LLM-based multi-agent system that dynamically generates and executes quantum chemistry workflows from natural language user prompts. The system is built on a novel cognitive architecture featuring a hierarchical memory framework that enables flexible task decomposition, adaptive tool selection, post-analysis, and autonomous file handling and submission. El Agente Q is benchmarked on six university-level course exercises and two case studies, demonstrating robust problem-solving performance (averaging &gt;87% task success) and adaptive error handling through in situ debugging. It also supports longer-term, multi-step task execution for more complex workflows, while maintaining transparency through detailed action trace logs. Together, these capabilities lay the foundation for increasingly autonomous and accessible quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Efficient Computation of the Long-Range Exact Exchange using an Extended Screening Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a computationally efficient screening for the Coulomb potential that also allows calculating approximated long-range exact exchange contributions with an accuracy similar to an explicit full-range evaluation of the exact exchange. Starting from the screening function of the HSE functional, i.e., the complementary error function, as zeroth order, a first-order Taylor expansion in terms of the screening parameter {\omega} is proposed as an approximation of the long-range Coulomb potential. The resulting extended screening function has a similar spatial extend as the complementary error function leading to a computational speed comparable to screened hybrid functionals such as HSE06, but with long-range exact exchange contributions included. The approach is tested and demonstrated for prototypical semiconductors and organic crystals using the PBE0 functional. Predicted energy band gaps, total energies, cohesive energies, and lattice energies from the first-order approximated PBE0 functional are close to those from the unmodified PBE0 functional, but are obtained at significantly reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>Novel Long-Wave Near-Infrared Fluorescence Bands in Tricarbocyanine Dyes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-wave near-infrared (LWNIR) dyes have garnered significant attention, particularly in biomedical applications, due to their ability to enhance light absorption, making them highly effective for in vivo imaging and phototherapy. Among these dyes, cyanines are notable for their broad tunability across the ultraviolet (UV) to LWNIR spectrum and their ability to form J-aggregates, which result in narrow absorption and enhanced emission peaks, often accompanied by a red-shift in their spectra. In this study, we investigate the fluorescence properties of three known tricarbocyanine dyes, uncovering new emission bands in the LWNIR region. These dyes exhibit two distinct fluorescence peaks between 1605 and 1840 nm, with an emission tail extending up to ~2200 nm. The intensity of these peaks varies depending on dye concentration. Furthermore, we assess the photostability, pH sensitivity, and thermal stability of the dyes, providing key insights into their potential for stable and efficient biomedical applications. Our study provides a deep investigation of the spectral characteristics of these dyes, seeking to enhance their potential application in biomedical imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water is an unusual liquid. Its thermophysical properties are non-monotonic with temperature T and pressure p. It's not been known how water's behaviors are encoded in its molecules. We give a statistical physics model, Cage Water, which assumes three bonding states: van der Waals, pairwise hydrogen bonding, and multi-body cooperative caging hydrogen bonds. The model is analytical, so very fast to compute, yet it gives excellent agreement with extensive pT experiments. Through readily interpretable substates, Cage Water explains water's liquid anomalies -- including its controversial liquid-liquid supercooling transition -- as simple switchovers among the three bonding types.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Weakly Supervised Learning for Interatomic Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning plays an increasingly important role in computational chemistry and materials science, complementing computationally intensive ab initio and first-principles methods. Despite their utility, machine-learning models often lack generalization capability and robustness during atomistic simulations, yielding unphysical energy and force predictions that hinder their real-world applications. We address this challenge by introducing a physics-informed, weakly supervised approach for training machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs). We introduce two novel loss functions, extrapolating the potential energy via a Taylor expansion and using the concept of conservative forces. Our approach improves the accuracy of MLIPs applied to training tasks with sparse training data sets and reduces the need for pre-training computationally demanding models with large data sets. Particularly, we perform extensive experiments demonstrating reduced energy and force errors -- often lower by a factor of two -- for various baseline models and benchmark data sets. Moreover, we demonstrate improved robustness during MD simulations of the MLIP models trained with the proposed weakly supervised loss. Finally, our approach improves the fine-tuning of foundation models on sparse, highly accurate ab initio data. An implementation of our method and scripts for executing experiments are available at https://github.com/nec-research/PICPS-ML4Sci.</description>

      <title>Kohn-Sham inversion with mathematical guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use an exact Moreau-Yosida regularized formulation to obtain the exchange-correlation potential for periodic systems. We reveal a profound connection between rigorous mathematical principles and efficient numerical implementation, which marks the first computation of a Moreau-Yosida-based inversion for physical systems. We develop a mathematically rigorous inversion algorithm which is demonstrated for representative bulk materials, specifically bulk silicon, gallium arsenide, and potassium chloride. Our inversion algorithm allows the construction of rigorous error bounds that we are able to verify numerically. This unlocks a new pathway to analyze Kohn-Sham inversion methods, which we expect in turn to foster mathematical approaches for developing approximate functionals.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Embedding for Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06813v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel multi-scale embedding scheme that links conventional QM/MM embedding and bootstrap embedding (BE) to allow simulations of large chemical systems on limited quantum devices. We also propose a mixed-basis BE scheme that facilitates BE calculations on extended systems using classical computers with limited memory resources. Benchmark data suggest the combination of these two strategies as a robust path in attaining the correlation energies of large realistic systems, combining the proven accuracy of BE with chemical and biological systems of interest in a lower computational cost method. Due to the flexible tunability of the resource requirements and systematic fragment construction, future developments in the realization of quantum computers naturally offer improved accuracy for multi-scale BE calculations.</description>

      <title>Egret-1: Pretrained Neural Network Potentials For Efficient and Accurate Bioorganic Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20955v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate simulation of atomic systems has the potential to revolutionize the design of molecules and materials. Unfortunately, exact solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation scale as O(N!) and remain inaccessible for systems with more than a handful of atoms, forcing scientists to accept steep tradeoffs between speed and accuracy and limiting the reliability and utility of the resultant simulations. Recent work in machine learning has demonstrated that neural network potentials (NNPs) can learn efficient approximations to quantum mechanics and resolve this tradeoff, but existing NNPs still suffer from limited accuracy relative to state-of-the-art quantum-chemical methods. Here, we present Egret-1, a family of large pretrained NNPs based on the MACE architecture with general applicability to main-group, organic, and biomolecular chemistry. We find that the Egret-1 models equal or exceed the accuracy of routinely employed quantum-chemical methods on a variety of standard tasks, including torsional scans, conformer ranking, and geometry optimization, while offering multiple-order-of-magnitude speedups relative to legacy methods. We also highlight important lacunae for future NNP research to investigate, and suggest strategies for building future high-quality models with increased scale and generality.</description>

      <title>LipidBERT: A Lipid Language Model Pre-trained on METiS de novo Lipid Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06150v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we generate and maintain a database of 10 million virtual lipids through METiS's in-house de novo lipid generation algorithms and lipid virtual screening techniques. These virtual lipids serve as a corpus for pre-training, lipid representation learning, and downstream task knowledge transfer, culminating in state-of-the-art LNP property prediction performance. We propose LipidBERT, a BERT-like model pre-trained with the Masked Language Model (MLM) and various secondary tasks. Additionally, we compare the performance of embeddings generated by LipidBERT and PhatGPT, our GPT-like lipid generation model, on downstream tasks. The proposed bilingual LipidBERT model operates in two languages: the language of ionizable lipid pre-training, using in-house dry-lab lipid structures, and the language of LNP fine-tuning, utilizing in-house LNP wet-lab data. This dual capability positions LipidBERT as a key AI-based filter for future screening tasks, including new versions of METiS de novo lipid libraries and, more importantly, candidates for in vivo testing for orgran-targeting LNPs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of the capability of a pre-trained language model on virtual lipids and its effectiveness in downstream tasks using web-lab data. This work showcases the clever utilization of METiS's in-house de novo lipid library as well as the power of dry-wet lab integration.</description>

      <title>Fastest first-passage time statistics for time-dependent particle injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common scenario in a variety of biological systems is that multiple particles are searching in parallel for an immobile target located in a bounded domain, and the fastest among them that arrives to the target first triggers a given desirable or detrimental process. The statistics of such extreme events -- the \textit{fastest\/} first-passage to the target -- is well-understood by now through a series of theoretical analyses, but exclusively under the assumption that all $N$ particles start \textit{simultaneously\/}, i.e., all are introduced into the domain instantly, by $\delta$-function-like pulses. However, in many practically important situations this is not the case: in order to start their search, the particles often have to enter first into a bounded domain, e.g., a cell or its nucleus, penetrating through gated channels or nuclear pores. This entrance process has a random duration so that the particles appear in the domain sequentially and with a time delay. Here we focus on the effect of such an extended-in-time injection of multiple particles on the fastest first-passage time (fFPT) and its statistics. We derive the full probability density function $H_N(t)$ of the fFPT with an arbitrary time-dependent injection intensity of $N$ particles. Under rather general assumptions on the survival probability of a single particle and on the injection intensity, we derive the large-$N$ asymptotic formula for the mean fFPT, which is quite different from that obtained for the instantaneous $\delta$-pulse injection. The extended injection is also shown to considerably slow down the convergence of $H_N(t)$ to the large-$N$ limit -- the Gumbel distribution -- so that the latter may be inapplicable in the most relevant settings with few tens to few thousands of particles.</description>
