      <title>Ribbonlength upper bounds for small crossing knots and links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a thin strip of paper, tie a knot, connect the ends, and flatten into the plane. This is a physical model of a folded ribbon knot in the plane, first introduced by Louis Kauffman. We study the folded ribbonlength of these folded ribbon knots, which is defined as the knot's length-to-width ratio. The {\em ribbonlength problem} asks to find the infimal folded ribbonlength of a knot or link type. By finding new methods of creating folded ribbon knots, we improve upon existing upper bounds for the folded ribbonlength of $(2,q)$-torus links, twist knots, and pretzel links. These give the best known bounds to date for small crossing knots in these families. For example, there is a folded ribbonlength twist knot $T_n$ with folded ribbonlength $\text{Rib}(T_n) = n +6$. Applying this to the figure-eight knot $T_2$ yields a folded ribbonlength $\text{Rib}(T_2)= 8$, which we conjecture is the infimum.</description>

      <title>Thurston's asymmetric metric for the space of flat metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thurston introduced in his seminal work an asymmetric metric on Teichm\"uller space by the ratio of simple closed curve length. In this paper, we generalize the idea and define an asymmetric metric on the space of unit-area flat metrics coming from half-translation structures on a closed surface. We also discuss two different topologies coming from the asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Irreducible 4-manifolds with order two fundamental group and even intersection form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct smooth manifolds with order two $\pi_1$ and even intersection forms which are irreducible, meaning they do not decompose into non-trivial connected sums. Their intersection forms being even implies that their universal covers admit spin structures. Such manifolds are determined up to homeomorphism by their Euler characteristic $e$, signature $\sigma$, and whether they themselves are also spin. In the case that the manifold is spin, we construct irreducible manifolds for all but $17$ realizable coordinates in the region of the $(e,\sigma)$-plane with $c_1^2 = 2e+3\sigma \geq 0$ up to orientation. In the case that the manifold is non-spin, we construct irreducible manifolds for all but $24$ realizable coordinates in the region of the $(e,\sigma)$-plane with $\sigma/8&lt;-8$ and $c_1^2/4&gt;9$, again up to orientation. We construct these manifolds by taking equivariant fiber sums of Lefschetz fibrations and other symplectic manifolds which are simply-connected and spin. Along the way, we develop machinery to track when the spin structure is preserved during these operations.</description>

      <title>Square-section braid groups and Higman-Neumann-Neumann extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For positive integers $n$, $p$ and $q$ with $pq-n&gt;0$, let $UC(n,p\times q)$ denote the configuration space of $n$ unlabelled hard unit squares in the rectangle $[0,p]\times[0,q]$, and let $B_n(p\times q)$ denote the corresponding fundamental group. It is known that, as $pq-n$ becomes large, $UC(n,p\times q)$ starts capturing homotopical properties of the classical configuration space of $n$ unlabelled pairwise-distinct points in the plane. At the start of this approximation process, $UC(pq-1,p\times q)$ is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of $(p-1)(q-1)$ circles, while the only other general families of spaces $UC(n,p\times q)$ known to be aspherical are $UC(n,p\times2)$ for $p\geq n$, and $UC(pq-2,p\times q)$. The fundamental groups of the former family are known to be responsible for the ``right-angled'' relations in Artin's classical braid groups. We prove that the fundamental groups of the latter family have a minimal presentation all whose relators are commutators. In particular, after explaining how $B_{2p-2}(p\times2)$ arises as the right-angled Artin group (RAAG) associated to a certain meta-edge, we show that $B_{3p-2}(p\times3)$ is a Higman-Neumann-Neumann extension of the RAAG associated to the corresponding meta-square. We provide a geometric interpretation of the latter fact in terms of Salvetti complexes.</description>

      <title>On Salem numbers of degree 4 and arithmetic hyperbolic orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we construct an arithmetic hyperbolic $6-$orbifold $\mathcal{O}$ such that, any square-rootable Salem number of degree at most $4$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is realized as the exponential of the length of a closed geodesic in $\mathcal{O}$. We also prove that $n=6$ is the minimal dimension among arithmetic hyperbolic orbifolds of the first type where it can be obtained. In an appendix, we establish a general relation between the discriminant of a Salem number and the determinant of a quadratic space which realizes it. In particular, for any $m,d&gt;0$ we present a geometric proof of the existence of Salem numbers of degree $2m$ with discriminant $(-1)^{m+1}d$ in $\mathbb{Q}^{\times}/\mathbb{Q}^{\times 2}$.</description>

      <title>Interactions between Coarse Homotopy and Ends on Proper Geodesic Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the coarse-geometric notion of ends in the context of coarse homotopy. We show that, when recontextualized as a functor from an appropriate coarse category of proper geodesic spaces, the set of ends $\mathcal{E}\text{nds}(-)$ is a coarse homotopy invariant. Further, we prove the existence of a natural surjection from the coarse path component functor $\pi_0^{\text{Crs}}(-)$ to $\mathcal{E}\text{nds}(-)$, and show that in general, this is not an injection (even when restricted to locally finite planar graphs). Finally, we begin to consider when this injection indeed exists by showing that this is the case for locally finite geometric trees, providing a number of useful preliminary lemmas on the behaviour of geodesics in this context.</description>

      <title>Constructing embedded surfaces for cellular embeddings of leveled spatial graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a given spatial graph $\mathcal{G} \subset \mathbb{R}^3$, we would like to find a closed orientable surface $\mathcal{S}$ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ in which $\mathcal{G}$ is cellular embedded. However, for general $\mathcal{G}$ this is not possible. We therefore define a property of spatial graphs, called leveled, to show that for leveled spatial graphs with a small number of levels, a surface $\mathcal{S}$ can always be found. The argument is based on decomposing $\mathcal{G}$ into spatial subgraphs that can be placed on a sphere and on cylinders attached as handles, in such a way that the resulting surface contains a cellular embedding of $\mathcal{G}$. We generalize the procedure to an algorithm that, if successful, constructs $\mathcal{S}$ for leveled spatial graphs with any number of levels. We conjecture that all connected leveled embeddings can be cellular embedded with the presented algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are 46,972 prime knots with crossing number 14. Among them 19,536 are alternating and have arc index 16. Among the non-alternating knots, 17, 477, and 3,180 have arc index 10, 11, and 12, respectively. The remaining 23,762 have arc index 13 or 14. There are none with arc index smaller than 10 or larger than 14.
  We obtained 8,027 knots having arc index 13 and 15,735 knots having arc index 14. We show them by their minimal grid diagrams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we study equivariant versions of Stolz' R-groups, the positive scalar curvature structure groups $R_n(X)^G$, for proper actions of discrete groups $G$. We define the concept of a fundamental groupoid functor for a $G$-space, encapsulating all the fundamental group information of all the fixed point sets and their relations. We construct classifying spaces for fundamental groupoid functors. As a geometric result, we show that Stolz' equivariant R-group $R_n(X)^G$ depends only on the fundamental groupoid functor of the reference space $X$. The proof covers at the same time in a concise and clear way the classical non-equivariant case.</description>

      <title>Direct Sampling of Confined Polygons in Linear Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04885v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for sampling tightly confined random equilateral closed polygons in three-space which has runtime linear in the number of edges. Using symplectic geometry, sampling such polygons reduces to sampling a moment polytope, and in our confinement model this polytope turns out to be very natural from a combinatorial point of view. This connection to combinatorics yields both our fast sampling algorithm and explicit formulas for the expected distances of vertices to the origin. We use our algorithm to investigate the expected total curvature of confined polygons, leading to a very precise conjecture for the asymptotics of total curvature.</description>

      <title>On the number of components of folds of image simple fold maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A smooth map between manifolds is said to be \emph{image simple} if its restriction to its singular point set is a topological embedding. We study the parity of the number of connected components of the singular point set for image simple fold maps from a closed manifold of dimension $\ge 2$ to a surface. It is known that this parity is a homotopy invariant when the source manifold is of even dimension and the target surface is orientable. In this paper we show that for an arbitrary image simple fold map from a closed odd-dimensional manifold of dimension $\ge 3$ to a (possibly non-orientable) surface, this parity is not a homotopy invariant. We give two constructive proofs: one uses techniques from open book decompositions and round fold maps, and the other uses allowable moves. The constructed homotopies add one new component to the singular point set. We also give a new proof of the homotopy invariance of the parity of the number of connected components of the singular point set for image simple fold maps from a closed even-dimensional manifold to an orientable surface together with an example showing that this does not hold for maps into non-orientable surfaces in general.</description>

      <title>The Prescribed Metric on Convex Subsets of Anti-de Sitter Space with Quasi-Circle Ideal Boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $h^{+}$ and $h^{-}$ be two complete, conformal metrics on the disc $\mathbb{D}$. Assume moreover that the derivatives of the conformal factors of the metrics $h^{+}$ and $h^{-}$ are bounded at any order with respect to the hyperbolic metric, and that the metrics have curvatures in the interval $\left(-\frac{1}{\epsilon}, -1 - \epsilon\right)$, for some $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Let $f$ be a quasi-symmetric map. We show the existence of a globally hyperbolic convex subset $\Omega$ (see Definition 4.1) of the three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space, such that $\Omega$ has $h^{+}$ (respectively $h^{-}$) as the induced metric on its future boundary (respectively on its past boundary) and has a gluing map $\Phi_{\Omega}$ (see Definition 5.7) equal to $f$.</description>

Abstract: In their solution to the orchard-planting problem, Green and Tao established a structure theorem which proves that in a line arrangement in the real projective plane with few double points, most lines are tangent to the dual curve of a cubic curve. We provide geometric arguments to prove that in the case of a simplicial arrangement, the aforementioned cubic curve cannot be irreducible. It follows that Gr\"{u}nbaum's conjectural asymptotic classification of simplicial arrangements holds under the additional hypothesis of a linear bound on the number of double points.</description>

      <title>On the colored Links--Gould polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a cabling formula for the Links--Gould polynomial of knots colored with a $4n$-dimensional irreducible representation of $\mathrm{U}^H_q\mathfrak{sl}(2|1)$ and identify them with the $V_n$-polynomial of knots for $n=2$. Using the cabling formula, we obtain genus bounds and a specialization to the Alexander polynomial for the colored Links--Gould polynomial that is independent of $n$, which implies corresponding properties of the $V_n$-polynomial for $n=2$ conjectured in previous work of two of the authors, and extends the work done for $n=1$. Combined with work of one of the authors arXiv:2409.03557, our genus bound for $\mathrm{LG}^{(2)}=V_2$ is sharp for all knots with up to $16$ crossings.</description>

      <title>Embedding calculus and Vassiliev spectral sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vassiliev spectral sequence and Sinha spectral sequence are both related to cohomology of the space of long knots $\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}^3$. Although they have different origins, the Vassiliev $E_1$-page and the Sinha $E_2$-page are isomorphic (up to a degree shift). In this paper, we prove that they have isomorphic $E_\infty$-pages if the coefficient ring is a field. Together with degeneracy of the Sinha sequence, this implies that the Vassiliev sequence degenerates at $E_1$-page over $\mathbb{Q}$ including the non-diagonal part. Our result also implies that for any coefficient field, the space of finite type $n$ knot invariants is isomorphic to the space of weight systems of weight $\leq n$ if and only if the parts of the Sinha sequence of bidegree $(-i,i)$ degenerate at $E_2$ for $i\leq 2n$. For the construction of the isomorphism, we use a variant of Thom space model which was introduced in the author's previous paper and captures embedding calculus of the knot space in terms of fat diagonals. As a byproduct of the construction, we give a partial computation on differentials of unstable versions of the Vassiliev sequence which converge to finite dimensional approximations of the knot space.</description>
