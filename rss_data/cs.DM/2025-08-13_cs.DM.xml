      <title>Short Proof: Exact Solution to the Finite Frobenius Coin Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Frobenius Coin Problem is a classic question in mathematics: given coins of specified denominations, what is the largest amount that cannot be formed using only those coins? This brief work covers a variation of such question, posing a limit on the number of coins available for each denomination. Thus, the new problem becomes finding the count of distinct values that can be represented, and those that cannot, within the finite set of integers ranging from zero to the sum of all coins. We refer to this version of the problem as the "finite" case. We will show how this closely relates to the original question, and prove an exact formula solving the problem when exactly two denominations are involved.</description>

      <title>A Fast GRASP Metaheuristic for the Trigger Arc TSP with MIP-Based Construction and Multi-Neighborhood Local Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Trigger Arc Traveling Salesman Problem (TA-TSP) extends the classical TSP by introducing dynamic arc costs that change when specific \textit{trigger} arcs are traversed, modeling scenarios such as warehouse operations with compactable storage systems. This paper introduces a GRASP-based metaheuristic that combines multiple construction heuristics with a multi-neighborhood local search. The construction phase uses mixed-integer programming (MIP) techniques to transform the TA-TSP into a sequence of tailored TSP instances, while the improvement phase applies 2-Opt, Swap, and Relocate operators. Computational experiments on MESS 2024 competition instances achieved average optimality gaps of 0.77\% and 0.40\% relative to the best-known solutions within a 60-second limit. On smaller, synthetically generated datasets, the method produced solutions 11.3\% better than the Gurobi solver under the same time constraints. The algorithm finished in the top three at MESS 2024, demonstrating its suitability for real-time routing applications with state-dependent travel costs.</description>

      <title>Generalized Bicycle Codes with Low Connectivity: Minimum Distance Bounds and Hook Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new upper and lower bounds on the minimum distance of certain generalized bicycle (GB) codes beyond the reach of techniques for classical codes capable of even capturing the true minimum distance for some cases. These bounds are then applied to illustrate the existence and analyze two highly degenerate GB code families with parameters $[[d^2+1,2,d]]$ for odd $d \geq 3$ and $[[d^2,2,d]]$ for even $d \geq 4$, both having the property that each check qubit is connected to exactly four data qubits similar to surface codes. For the odd-distance family, we analyze the structure of low-weight logical Pauli operators and demonstrate the existence of a fault-tolerant logical CNOT gate between the two logical qubits, achievable through a simple relabeling of data qubits. We further construct a syndrome extraction pattern for both families that does not imply minimum distance reduction arising from extraction circuit faults that propagate from the check qubits to the data qubits. Finally, we numerically evaluate their logical error rates under a code capacity depolarizing noise model using the belief propagation ordered statistics decoding (BP-OSD) and minimum-weight perfect-matching (MWPM) decoders, yielding thresholds of approximately $14-16\%$ for the odd and even families, very similar to those of rotated surface codes.</description>

      <title>Near-optimal edge partitioning via intersecting families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of edge-centric graph partitioning, where the goal is to distribute the edges of a graph among several almost equally sized parts in order to minimize the replication factor of vertices. We build a partitioning algorithm that guarantees near-perfect balance and replication factor $\sqrt{n} (1 + o(1))$ for arbitrary number of parts $n$. This asymptotical bound cannot be improved. To do so, we introduce balanced intersecting systems. It is a construction similar to symmetric intersecting families, but the symmetry condition is replaced by a weaker balance condition. We build an algorithm that uses such a system, and prove that by using a system of optimal rank we achieve exactly optimal guarantees for the replication factor. Finally, we build balanced intersecting systems with asymptotically optimal rank.</description>

      <title>The degree-restricted random process is far from uniform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00835v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The degree-restricted random process is a natural algorithmic model for generating graphs with degree sequence D_n=(d_1, \ldots, d_n): starting with an empty n-vertex graph, it sequentially adds new random edges so that the degree of each vertex v_i remains at most d_i. Wormald conjectured in 1999 that, for d-regular degree sequences D_n, the final graph of this process is similar to a uniform random d-regular graph.
  In this paper we show that, for degree sequences D_n that are not nearly regular, the final graph of the degree-restricted random process differs substantially from a uniform random graph with degree sequence D_n. The combinatorial proof technique is our main conceptual contribution: we adapt the switching method to the degree-restricted process, demonstrating that this enumeration technique can also be used to analyze stochastic processes (rather than just uniform random models, as before).</description>

      <title>Subtree Distances, Tight Spans and Diversities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metric embeddings are central to metric theory and its applications. Here we consider embeddings of a different sort: maps from a set to subsets of a metric space so that distances between points are approximated by minimal distances between subsets. Our main result is a characterization of when a set of distances $d(x,y)$ between elements in a set $X$ have a subtree representation, a real tree $T$ and a collection $\{S_x\}_{x \in X}$ of subtrees of~$T$ such that $d(x,y)$ equals the length of the shortest path in~$T$ from a point in $S_x$ to a point in $S_y$ for all $x,y \in X$. The characterization was first established for {\em finite} $X$ by Hirai (2006) using a tight span construction defined for distance spaces, metric spaces without the triangle inequality. To extend Hirai's result beyond finite $X$ we establish fundamental results of tight span theory for general distance spaces, including the surprising observation that the tight span of a distance space is hyperconvex. We apply the results to obtain the first characterization of when a diversity -- a generalization of a metric space which assigns values to all finite subsets of $X$, not just to pairs -- has a tight span which is tree-like.</description>

      <title>The Normal Play of the Domination Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13118v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2010, Bre\v{s}ar, Klav\v{z}ar and Rall introduced the optimization variant of the graph domination game and the game domination number, which was proved PSPACE-hard by Bre\v{s}ar et al. in 2016. In 2024, Leo Versteegen obtained the celebrated proof of the Conjecture $\frac{3}{5}$ on this variant of the domination game, proposed by Kinnersley, West and Zamani in 2013. In this paper, we investigate for the first time the normal play of the domination game, which we call Normal Domination Game, that is an impartial game where the last to play wins. We first prove that this game is PSPACE-complete even in graphs with diameter two. We also use the Sprague-Grundy theory to prove that Alice (the first player) wins in the path $P_n$ if and only if $n$ is not a multiple of $4$, and wins in the cycle $C_n$ if and only if $n=4k+3$ for some integer $k$. Moreover, we obtain a polynomial time algorithm to decide the winner for any disjoint union of paths and cycles in the Normal Domination Game and its natural partizan variant. Finally, we also prove that the Mis\`ere Domination Game (the last to play loses) is PSPACE-complete, as are the natural partizan variants of the normal game and the mis\`ere game.</description>

      <title>Rainbow copies of spanning subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21290v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G_{n,p}^{[\kappa]}$ denote the space of $n$-vertex edge coloured graphs, where each edge occurs independently with probability $p$. The colour of each existing edge is chosen independently and uniformly at random from the set $[\kappa]$. We consider the threshold for the existence of rainbow colored copies of a spanning subgraph $H$. We provide lower bounds on $p$ and $\kappa$ sufficient to prove the existence of such copies w.h.p.</description>
