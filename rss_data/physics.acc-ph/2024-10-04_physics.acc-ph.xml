      <title>Post-irradiation examination of a prototype tantalum-clad target for the Beam Dump Facility at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Beam Dump Facility (BDF) is a planned fixed-target installation in CERN's North Area, set to start operating in 2031. A proton beam of 400 GeV/c will be delivered in 1 s pulses of 4e13 protons every 7.2 s, amounting to 4e19 protons on target (PoT) per year, with an average thermal power deposition of 305 kW. The experiment requires high-Z and high-density materials and involves challenging thermomechanical conditions; hence, a water-cooled refractory metal core is proposed. To prevent corrosion and erosion, the target materials - tungsten and a molybdenum-based alloy, TZM-, are clad with a tantalum alloy using hot isostatic pressing. To verify the reliability of the target design and manufacturing process, a reduced-scale prototype target was manufactured and irradiated with 2.4e16 PoT in 2018. This paper presents the findings of the post-irradiation examination (PIE) conducted 2.5 years later. The PIE consisted of non-destructive and destructive activities, including film imaging, microscopy, metrology, ultrasonic testing, microstructural analysis, and mechanical and thermal characterization. No irradiation effects resulting from thermal stresses, such as geometrical changes or cracks in the cladding, were observed, and it was determined that the bonding between the core and cladding materials was robust. Moreover, no changes were detected in the microstructures or mechanical properties of the bulk materials. In conclusion, the robustness of the target baseline design and manufacturing process was confirmed, validating its suitability for operating under the desired conditions. Nonetheless, the observed brittleness of sintered tungsten indicates a potential area for improvement to enhance the lifetime of the BDF target. Overall, the examinations provided valuable insights into the performance of the prototype and indicated potential refinements for the future BDF target complex.</description>

      <title>Impact of beam asymmetries at the Future Circular Collider e+e-</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present detailed simulations with asymmetric initial beam settings in the context of the proposed Future Circular Collider e+e- (FCC-ee) using the Xsuite framework. We compare simulated equilibrium bunch sizes and luminosities against an already existing analytical model, which shows remarkably good agreement for realistic small perturbations. We investigate the longitudinal top-up injection, the currently preferred injection scheme for the FCC-ee, using self-consistent simulations featuring beam-beam collisions with beamstrahlung and the injection process, for the first time. We present and assess the sensitivity and required precision of the nominal beam parameters in a potential real-life operation by providing first estimates of the tolerances in the initial asymmetry of several machine parameters, with respect to the 3D flip-flop mechanism, obtained from parameter scan simulations.</description>

      <title>Role of microstructure on flux expulsion of superconducting radio frequency cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trapped residual magnetic flux during the cool-down due to the incomplete Meissner state is a significant source of radio frequency losses in superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities. Here, we show a clear correlation between the niobium microstructure in elliptical cavity geometry and flux expulsion behavior. In particular, a traditionally fabricated Nb cavity half cell from an annealed poly-crystalline Nb sheet after an 800 $^\circ$C heat treatment leads to a bi-modal microstructure that ties in with flux trapping and inefficient flux expulsion. This non-uniform microstructure is related to varying strain profiles along the cavity shape. A novel approach to prevent this non uniform microstructure is presented by fabricating a 1.3 GHz single cell Nb cavity with a cold-worked sheet and subsequent heat treatment leading to better flux expulsion after 800 $^\circ$C/3 h. Microstructural evolution by electron backscattered diffraction-orientation imaging microscopy on cavity cutouts, and flux pinning behavior by dc-magnetization on coupon samples confirms a reduction in flux pinning centers with increased heat treatment temperature. The heat treatment temperature dependent mechanical properties and thermal conductivity are reported. The significant impact of cold-work in this study demonstrates clear evidence for the importance of microstructure required for high-performance superconducting cavities with reduced losses caused by magnetic flux trapping.</description>
