      <title>X-SHYNE: X-Shooter spectra of young exoplanet analogs II. Presentation and analysis of the full library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X-SHYNE library is a homogeneous sample of 43 medium-resolution (R=8000) infrared (0.3-2.5um) spectra of young (&lt;500Myr), low-mass (&lt;20Mjup), and cold (Teff=600-2000K) isolated brown dwarfs and wide-separation companions observed with the VLT/X-Shooter instrument. To characterize our targets, we performed a global comparative analysis. We first applied a semi-empirical approach. By refining their age and bolometric luminosity, we derived key atmospheric and physical properties, such as Teff, mass, surface gravity (g), and radius, using the evolutionary model COND03. These results were then compared with the results from a synthetic analysis based on three self-consistent atmospheric models. To compare our spectra with these grids we used the Bayesian inference code ForMoSA. We found similar Lbol estimates between both approaches, but an underestimated Teff from the cloudy models, likely due to a lack of absorbers that could dominate the J and H bands of early L. We also observed a discrepancy in the log(g) estimates, which are dispersed between 3.5 and 5.5 dex for mid-L objects. We interpreted this as a bias caused by a range of rotational velocities leading to cloud migration toward equatorial latitudes, combined with a variety of viewing angles that result in different observed atmospheric properties (cloud column densities, atmospheric pressures, etc.). Finally, while providing robust estimates of [M/H] and C/O for individual objects remains challenging, the X-SHYNE library globally suggests solar values, which are consistent with a formation via stellar formation mechanisms. This study highlights the strength of homogeneous datasets in performing comparative analyses, reducing the impact of systematics, and ensuring robust conclusions while avoiding over-interpretation.</description>

      <title>Secular Resonances in Planet-Hosting Binary Stars. I. General Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the diversity of circumstellar planets in binary stars and the strong effects of the secular resonances of Jupiter and Saturn on the formation and architecture of the inner solar system, we have launched an expansive project on studying the effects of secular resonances on the formation of terrestrial planets around a star of a moderately close binary. As the first phase of our project, we present here the general theory of secular resonances in dual-star systems where the primary hosts two giant planets. Using the concept of generalized disturbing function, we derive the formula for the locations of secular resonances and show that in systems where the perturbation of the secondary star is stronger, the locations of secular resonances are farther way from the primary and closer to the giant planets. The latter implies that in such systems, terrestrial planet formation has a larger area to proceed with more of the protoplanetary disk being available to it. To demonstrate the validity of our theoretical results, we simulated the evolution of a protoplanetary disk interior to the inner giant planet. Results, in addition to confirming our theoretical predictions, pointed to an important finding: In binary stars, the perturbation of the secondary suppresses the secular resonances of giant planets. Simulations also show that as the disk loses material, secular resonances move inward, scattering objects out of the disk and/or facilitating their collisional growth. We present results of our study and discuss their implications for the simulations of terrestrial planet formation.</description>

      <title>Secular Resonances in Planet-Hosting Binary Stars. II. Application to Terrestrial Planet Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuing our study of the effects of secular resonances on the formation of terrestrial planets in moderately close binary stars, we present here the results of an extensive numerical simulations of the formation of these objects. Considering a binary with two giant planets and a protoplanetary disk around its primary star, we have simulated the late stage of terrestrial planet formation for different types of the secondary, and different orbital elements of the binary and giant planets. Results demonstrate that terrestrial planet formation can indeed proceed constructively in such systems; however, as predicted by the general theory, secular resonances are suppressed and do not contribute to the formation process. Simulations show that it is in fact the mean-motion resonances of the inner giant planet that drive the dynamics of the protoplanetary disk and the mass and orbital architecture of the final bodies. Simulations also show that in the majority of the cases, the final systems contain only one terrestrial planet with a mass of 0.6-1.7 Earth masses. Multiple planets appear on rare occasions in the form of Earth-Mars analogs with the smaller planet in an exterior orbit. When giant planets are in larger orbits, the number of these double-planet systems increases and their planets become more massive. Results also show that when the orbits of the giant planets carry inclinations, while secular resonances are still suppressed, mean-motion resonances are strongly enhanced, drastically reducing the efficacy of the formation process. We present the results of our simulations and discuss their implications.</description>

      <title>Lunar exosphere dynamics at the north pole following Perseid 2009 meteoroid impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of the lunar exosphere provide valuable insights into dynamic processes affecting the Moon, such as meteoroid bombardment. The Chamberlain model was employed to estimate the zenith column density and temperature of Na atoms on August 13/14, 2009, after the peak of the Perseid meteor shower. Additionally, the column density and temperature of Na atoms delivered to the lunar exosphere by gradual processes during the peak on August 12/13, 2009, were estimated. Expected ratios of line-of-sight column densities of Na atoms at three observed altitudes on August 12/13, 2009, were obtained using the Chamberlain model and Monte Carlo simulations. The heightened intensities of Na emission lines on August 12/13, 2009, are attributed to the onset of the third short-term peak in Perseid activity predicted by celestial mechanics. The best agreement between observations and theoretical models was achieved with a theoretical temperature of 3000 K for impact-produced Na atoms. This third peak of Perseids began between 23:29 and 23:41 UT on August 12, 2009, lasting approximately 83 minutes, with a mass flux attributed to the Perseids ranging between 1.6 x 10^-16 and 5 x 10^-16 g cm^-2 s^-1. Additionally, depletion of Li content compared to Na content in the lunar exosphere was detected. A model predicting Perseid meteoroid stream activity on the Moon was developed and compared with spectral observations of the lunar exosphere. By modeling 25,000 years of comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle's orbits, 175 cometary trails likely to have generated meteoroids near Earth and the Moon during the Perseid 2009 meteor shower were identified. Our results reveal annual maxima inducing filament trail structures, one of which closely aligned with the observed peak of increased Na content in the lunar exosphere.</description>

      <title>The $n$-body problem -- an alternative scheme for determining solutions for planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a general alternative scheme of the procedure and necessary conditions for solving the $n$-body problem. The presented solution is not a solution of the classical problem, where the initial conditions of positions and initial velocities/momenta of the bodies are known. Starting from the standard initial condition the procedure treats contributions to momentum from particular pair-wise interactions as independent variables from which the total momentum and velocity of a given mass is then reproduced. Initial values of those contributions are arbitrary as long as the resulting velocities match the initial condition. The obtained solutions take into account the gravitational interactions between each pair of bodies, as a result of which they are characterized by higher stability than the solutions of the classical problem. The presented procedure was used to calculate the positions and mutual velocities of three bodies: the Sun, the Earth and the Moon. It has also been tested for our entire planetary system (8 planets) with the Sun and the Moon. For these types of systems, the method allows obtaining solutions that are stable. The procedure was also tested on the example of the Pythagorean system of bodies.</description>

      <title>On the origin and dynamical evolution of Jupiter's moon Amalthea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interior to the orbits of Jupiter's iconic Galilean moons are four small satellites with individual mean radii, $R\lesssim 84$ km. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that these bodies formed at a more distant location in Jupiter's circumplanetary disk before coming to reside at their current short-period orbits. Nonetheless, how these moons dynamically evolved to such a location has yet to be explained in the emerging paradigm of Jovian satellite formation. Here, we present a quantitative model for the origin of the largest of these inner moons, Amalthea, that can be extended to its neighbor, Thebe, and to other small bodies in astrophysical disks. We propose that Amalthea's anomalous features are due to it having formed alongside the Galileans in a reservoir of satellitesimals located at a large jovian-centric distance. As the innermost Galilean, Io, migrated inward from this reservoir, it captured the satellitesimal, Amalthea, into resonance and shepherded the small body to its modern neighborhood. During migration through the disk, dissipative forcing from aerodynamic drag induces overstable librations in the Io-Amalthea resonance, such that only a narrow range of nebular parameters can accommodate the requisite long-range transport. In particular, the disk-aspect ratio, $h/r$, emerges as the key variable. Our calculations indicate that the circumjovian disk had a scale height of at least $h/r\gtrsim0.08$, implying a relatively hot, actively accreting disk during the epoch of satellite formation. These results thus shed light on the evolution of the Jovian system, along with the more general phenomenon of satellite-disk interactions.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Apophis's deformation-driven rotational evolution during its closest encounter to the Earth in 2029</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2029, the near-Earth asteroid (99942) Apophis approaches the Earth within six Earth radii. This opportunity is one of the rarest natural experiments that we can use to better characterize a small body through telescopic observations and space missions. Earlier geological investigations consistently suggested that major geological processes might not occur on Apophis during this closest encounter, including surface processing and interior deformation. However, minor resurfacing may occur, depending on local geological conditions. A critical finding is that the rotational evolution occurs due to the tidal effect from the Earth. The present study offers an additional perspective on the rotational evolution, which may vary due to variations in interior properties. Namely, possible deformation processes may change the spin state variation from the rigid body state, even if deformation is not measurable. The effort in this work is to explore this issue using a simplified model, motivated by earlier studies by Hirabayashi (2023) and Taylor et al. (2023). The results show that the deformation-driven spin state change may be possible, depending on Young's modulus. If this asteroid's Young's modulus is ~1 MPa or higher, the spin state only deviates a few degrees from the rigid body state over one year. However, if it is ~10 kPa or less, the spin state deviation may reach a few degrees, even a few days after the closest encounter. Both telescopic observations and space missions can provide strong insights into this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Mars Life Explorer (MLE) with True Agnostic Life Detection Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mars Life Explorer (MLE) mission concept offers a critical opportunity to investigate whether extant life exists within the mid-latitude ice deposits of Mars. However, MLE's current science traceability matrix emphasizes habitability assessment and organic chemistry over direct life detection. As crewed missions to Mars may occur as early as 2040, the window for uncontaminated robotic exploration is rapidly closing. A high-confidence determination of Martian life must be achieved before irreversible anthropogenic contamination compromises scientific integrity. This paper evaluates the scientific, technical, and policy limitations of the current MLE architecture and recommends specific instrumentation upgrades and governance measures necessary to enable definitive and agnostic life detection while safeguarding planetary protection.</description>

      <title>Fast and Fewrious: Stochastic binary perturbations from fast compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive compact objects soften binaries. This process has been used for decades to constrain the population of such objects, particularly as a component of dark matter (DM). The effects of light compact objects, such as those in the unconstrained asteroid-mass range, have generally been neglected. In principle, low-energy perturbers can harden binaries instead of softening them, but the standard lore is that this effect vanishes when the perturber velocities are large compared to the binary's orbital velocity, as is typical for DM constituents. Here, we revisit the computation of the hardening rate induced by light perturbers. We show that although the perturbations average to zero over many encounters, many scenarios of interest for DM constraints are in the regime where the variance cannot be neglected. We show that a few fast-moving perturbers can leave stochastic perturbations in systems that are measured with great precision, and we use this framework to revisit the constraint potential of systems such as binary pulsars and the Solar System. This opens a new class of dynamical probes with potential applications to asteroid-mass DM candidates.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive analysis of CM Draconis: eclipse timing variations driven by either a third body or stellar magnetic activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CM Draconis system is a well-studied, double-lined spectroscopic binary that is totally eclipsing and exhibits strong magnetic activity. Nearly one million photometric measurements have been collected across multiple wavelengths over more than half a century. In addition to showing frequent flare activity and apsidal motion, CM Dra also hosts a distant white dwarf and has been proposed to harbor a Jupiter-sized circumbinary companion. At only 47 light-years from Earth, it remains one of the most observationally rich and dynamically intriguing low-mass binary systems. We present a comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the system using new ground-based observations and data from 19 sectors of the \textit{TESS} mission. We derive precise fundamental parameters for both components: $M_1 = 0.2307 \pm 0.0008\,M_\odot$, $M_2 = 0.2136 \pm 0.0008\,M_\odot$, $R_1 = 0.2638 \pm 0.0011\,R_\odot$, $R_2 = 0.2458 \pm 0.0010\,R_\odot$, $L_1 = 0.0060 \pm 0.0005\,L_\odot$, and $L_2 = 0.0050 \pm 0.0004\,L_\odot$. The derived distance ($14.4 \pm 0.6$ pc) is consistent with \textit{Gaia} DR3 measurements. Eclipse timing variations (ETVs) spanning over five decades were analyzed in detail. A long-period ($\sim$56 yr) modulation was identified, which may be attributed either to the light-time effect of a possible circumbinary companion or to magnetic activity cycles. While the Bayesian Information Criterion statistically favors the model involving a light-time effect from a planetary companion, stellar activity remains a viable alternative that cannot yet be ruled out. Our results demonstrate that CM Dra is a valuable test case for studying both stellar activity and the potential presence of circumbinary companions in multiple-star systems. Continued long-term monitoring will be essential to distinguish between these competing scenarios.</description>

      <title>A metal-poor atmosphere with a hot interior for a young sub-Neptune progenitor: JWST/NIRSpec transmission spectrum of V1298 Tau b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the JWST/NIRSpec G395H transmission spectrum of the young (10 - 20 Myr old) transiting planet V1298 Tau b (9.85+/-0.35 Re, Teq=670K). Combined HST and JWST observations reveal a haze free, H/He dominated atmosphere with a large scale height (~1500km), allowing detection of CO2 (35 sigma), H2O (30 sigma), CO (10 sigma), CH4 (6 sigma), SO2 (4 sigma) and OCS (3.5 sigma). Our observations probe several scale heights (~4.4 in the CO2 4.3 microns and ~3 in the 2.7 micron water band). The planet's mass, inferred from atmospheric scale height using free retrieval and grid modelling is 12+/-1 and 15+/-1.7Me respectively which is significantly lower than previous radial velocity estimates and confirm it as a 'gas-dwarf' sub-Neptune progenitor. We find an atmospheric super-solar metallicity (logZ=0.6^+0.4_-0.6 x solar) and a sub-solar C/O ratio (0.22^+0.06_-0.05). The atmospheric metallicity is low compared to matured sub-Neptunes by an order of magnitude. The CH4 abundance ([CH4]=-6.2^+0.3_-0.5) is ~7 sigma lower than equilibrium chemistry prediction. To adjust for the low methane abundance, the self-consistent grids favour a high internal temperature (~500K) and vertical mixing (Kzz ~10^7-10^8 cm2/s). These internal temperatures are inconsistent with predictions from evolutionary models, which expect ~100 - 200K at the current system age. We estimate a gas-to-core mass fraction between 0.1 - 8 %, with a core mass of 11 - 12 Me, consistent with in-situ gas dwarf formation. A deep atmospheric metallicity gradient may explain both the high internal temperature and low observable metallicity. Over time, mass loss from such an atmosphere could enhance its metallicity, potentially reconciling V1298 Tau b with mature sub-Neptunes.</description>

      <title>Assessing robustness and bias in 1D retrievals of 3D Global Circulation Models at high spectral resolution: a WASP-76 b simulation case study in emission</title>

Abstract: High-resolution spectroscopy (HRS) of exoplanet atmospheres has successfully detected many chemical species and is quickly moving toward detailed characterization of the chemical abundances and dynamics. HRS is highly sensitive to the line shape and position, thus, it can detect three-dimensional (3D) effects such as winds, rotation, and spatial variation of atmospheric conditions. At the same time, retrieval frameworks are increasingly deployed to constrain chemical abundances, pressure-temperature (P-T) structures, orbital parameters, and rotational broadening. To explore the multidimensional parameter space, they need computationally fast models that are consequently mostly one-dimensional (1D). However, this approach risks introducing interpretation bias since the planet's true nature is 3D. We investigate the robustness of this methodology at high spectral resolution by running 1D retrievals on simulated observations in emission within an observational framework using 3D Global Circulation Models of the quintessential HJ WASP-76 b. We find that the retrieval broadly recovers conditions present in the atmosphere, but that the retrieved P-T and chemical profiles are not a homogeneous average of all spatial and phase-dependent information. Instead, they are most sensitive to spatial regions with large thermal gradients, which do not necessarily coincide with the strongest emitting regions. Our results further suggest that the choice of parameterization for the P-T and chemical profiles, as well as Doppler offsets among opacity sources, impact retrieval results. These factors should be carefully considered in future retrieval analyses.</description>
