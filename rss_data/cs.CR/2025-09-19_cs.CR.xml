      <title>Early Approaches to Adversarial Fine-Tuning for Prompt Injection Defense: A 2022 Study of GPT-3 and Contemporary Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper documents early research conducted in 2022 on defending against prompt injection attacks in large language models, providing historical context for the evolution of this critical security domain. This research focuses on two adversarial attacks against Large Language Models (LLMs): prompt injection and goal hijacking. We examine how to construct these attacks, test them on various LLMs, and compare their effectiveness. We propose and evaluate a novel defense technique called Adversarial Fine-Tuning. Our results show that, without this defense, the attacks succeeded 31\% of the time on GPT-3 series models. When using our Adversarial Fine-Tuning approach, attack success rates were reduced to near zero for smaller GPT-3 variants (Ada, Babbage, Curie), though we note that subsequent research has revealed limitations of fine-tuning-based defenses. We also find that more flexible models exhibit greater vulnerability to these attacks. Consequently, large models such as GPT-3 Davinci are more vulnerable than smaller models like GPT-2. While the specific models tested are now superseded, the core methodology and empirical findings contributed to the foundation of modern prompt injection defense research, including instruction hierarchy systems and constitutional AI approaches.</description>

      <title>FedMentor: Domain-Aware Differential Privacy for Heterogeneous Federated LLMs in Mental Health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving adaptation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in sensitive domains (e.g., mental health) requires balancing strict confidentiality with model utility and safety. We propose FedMentor, a federated fine-tuning framework that integrates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and domain-aware Differential Privacy (DP) to meet per-domain privacy budgets while maintaining performance. Each client (domain) applies a custom DP noise scale proportional to its data sensitivity, and the server adaptively reduces noise when utility falls below a threshold. In experiments on three mental health datasets, we show that FedMentor improves safety over standard Federated Learning without privacy, raising safe output rates by up to three points and lowering toxicity, while maintaining utility (BERTScore F1 and ROUGE-L) within 0.5% of the non-private baseline and close to the centralized upper bound. The framework scales to backbones with up to 1.7B parameters on single-GPU clients, requiring &lt; 173 MB of communication per round. FedMentor demonstrates a practical approach to privately fine-tune LLMs for safer deployments in healthcare and other sensitive fields.</description>

      <title>Beyond Data Privacy: New Privacy Risks for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural language understanding, reasoning, and autonomous decision-making. However, these advancements have also come with significant privacy concerns. While significant research has focused on mitigating the data privacy risks of LLMs during various stages of model training, less attention has been paid to new threats emerging from their deployment. The integration of LLMs into widely used applications and the weaponization of their autonomous abilities have created new privacy vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities provide opportunities for both inadvertent data leakage and malicious exfiltration from LLM-powered systems. Additionally, adversaries can exploit these systems to launch sophisticated, large-scale privacy attacks, threatening not only individual privacy but also financial security and societal trust. In this paper, we systematically examine these emerging privacy risks of LLMs. We also discuss potential mitigation strategies and call for the research community to broaden its focus beyond data privacy risks, developing new defenses to address the evolving threats posed by increasingly powerful LLMs and LLM-powered systems.</description>

      <title>Resisting Quantum Key Distribution Attacks Using Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of quantum computing poses significant risks to the security of modern communication networks as it breaks today's public-key cryptographic algorithms. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) offers a promising solution by harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics to establish secure keys. However, practical QKD implementations remain vulnerable to hardware imperfections and advanced attacks such as Photon Number Splitting and Trojan-Horse attacks. In this work, we investigate the potential of using quantum machine learning (QML) to detect popular QKD attacks. In particular, we propose a Hybrid Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) model to improve the detection of common QKD attacks. By combining quantum-enhanced learning with classical deep learning, the model captures complex temporal patterns in QKD data, improving detection accuracy. To evaluate the proposed model, we introduce a realistic QKD dataset simulating normal QKD operations along with seven attack scenarios, Intercept-and-Resend, Photon-Number Splitting (PNS), Trojan-Horse attacks Random Number Generator (RNG), Detector Blinding, Wavelength-dependent Trojan Horse, and Combined attacks. The dataset includes quantum security metrics such as Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER), measurement entropy, signal and decoy loss rates, and time-based metrics, ensuring an accurate representation of real-world conditions. Our results demonstrate promising performance of the quantum machine learning approach compared to traditional classical machine learning models, highlighting the potential of hybrid techniques to enhance the security of future quantum communication networks. The proposed Hybrid QLSTM model achieved an accuracy of 93.7.0\% after 50 training epochs, outperforming classical deep learning models such as LSTM, and CNN.</description>

      <title>The Sum Leaks More Than Its Parts: Compositional Privacy Risks and Mitigations in Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become integral to multi-agent systems, new privacy risks emerge that extend beyond memorization, direct inference, or single-turn evaluations. In particular, seemingly innocuous responses, when composed across interactions, can cumulatively enable adversaries to recover sensitive information, a phenomenon we term compositional privacy leakage. We present the first systematic study of such compositional privacy leaks and possible mitigation methods in multi-agent LLM systems. First, we develop a framework that models how auxiliary knowledge and agent interactions jointly amplify privacy risks, even when each response is benign in isolation. Next, to mitigate this, we propose and evaluate two defense strategies: (1) Theory-of-Mind defense (ToM), where defender agents infer a questioner's intent by anticipating how their outputs may be exploited by adversaries, and (2) Collaborative Consensus Defense (CoDef), where responder agents collaborate with peers who vote based on a shared aggregated state to restrict sensitive information spread. Crucially, we balance our evaluation across compositions that expose sensitive information and compositions that yield benign inferences. Our experiments quantify how these defense strategies differ in balancing the privacy-utility trade-off. We find that while chain-of-thought alone offers limited protection to leakage (~39% sensitive blocking rate), our ToM defense substantially improves sensitive query blocking (up to 97%) but can reduce benign task success. CoDef achieves the best balance, yielding the highest Balanced Outcome (79.8%), highlighting the benefit of combining explicit reasoning with defender collaboration. Together, our results expose a new class of risks in collaborative LLM deployments and provide actionable insights for designing safeguards against compositional, context-driven privacy leakage.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Agent LLM Defense Pipeline Against Prompt Injection Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt injection attacks represent a major vulnerability in Large Language Model (LLM) deployments, where malicious instructions embedded in user inputs can override system prompts and induce unintended behaviors. This paper presents a novel multi-agent defense framework that employs specialized LLM agents in coordinated pipelines to detect and neutralize prompt injection attacks in real-time. We evaluate our approach using two distinct architectures: a sequential chain-of-agents pipeline and a hierarchical coordinator-based system. Our comprehensive evaluation on 55 unique prompt injection attacks, grouped into 8 categories and totaling 400 attack instances across two LLM platforms (ChatGLM and Llama2), demonstrates significant security improvements. Without defense mechanisms, baseline Attack Success Rates (ASR) reached 30% for ChatGLM and 20% for Llama2. Our multi-agent pipeline achieved 100% mitigation, reducing ASR to 0% across all tested scenarios. The framework demonstrates robustness across multiple attack categories including direct overrides, code execution attempts, data exfiltration, and obfuscation techniques, while maintaining system functionality for legitimate queries.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Efficient Jailbreak Method Exploiting LLMs' Helpfulness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety alignment aims to prevent Large Language Models (LLMs) from responding to harmful queries. To strengthen safety protections, jailbreak methods are developed to simulate malicious attacks and uncover vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce HILL (Hiding Intention by Learning from LLMs), a novel jailbreak approach that systematically transforms imperative harmful requests into learning-style questions with only straightforward hypotheticality indicators. Further, we introduce two new metrics to thoroughly evaluate the utility of jailbreak methods. Experiments on the AdvBench dataset across a wide range of models demonstrate HILL's strong effectiveness, generalizability, and harmfulness. It achieves top attack success rates on the majority of models and across malicious categories while maintaining high efficiency with concise prompts. Results of various defense methods show the robustness of HILL, with most defenses having mediocre effects or even increasing the attack success rates. Moreover, the assessment on our constructed safe prompts reveals inherent limitations of LLMs' safety mechanisms and flaws in defense methods. This work exposes significant vulnerabilities of safety measures against learning-style elicitation, highlighting a critical challenge of balancing helpfulness and safety alignments.</description>

      <title>Beyond Classification: Evaluating LLMs for Fine-Grained Automatic Malware Behavior Auditing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated malware classification has achieved strong detection performance. Yet, malware behavior auditing seeks causal and verifiable explanations of malicious activities -- essential not only to reveal what malware does but also to substantiate such claims with evidence. This task is challenging, as adversarial intent is often hidden within complex, framework-heavy applications, making manual auditing slow and costly. Large Language Models (LLMs) could help address this gap, but their auditing potential remains largely unexplored due to three limitations: (1) scarce fine-grained annotations for fair assessment; (2) abundant benign code obscuring malicious signals; and (3) unverifiable, hallucination-prone outputs undermining attribution credibility. To close this gap, we introduce MalEval, a comprehensive framework for fine-grained Android malware auditing, designed to evaluate how effectively LLMs support auditing under real-world constraints. MalEval provides expert-verified reports and an updated sensitive API list to mitigate ground truth scarcity and reduce noise via static reachability analysis. Function-level structural representations serve as intermediate attribution units for verifiable evaluation. Building on this, we define four analyst-aligned tasks -- function prioritization, evidence attribution, behavior synthesis, and sample discrimination -- together with domain-specific metrics and a unified workload-oriented score. We evaluate seven widely used LLMs on a curated dataset of recent malware and misclassified benign apps, offering the first systematic assessment of their auditing capabilities. MalEval reveals both promising potential and critical limitations across audit stages, providing a reproducible benchmark and foundation for future research on LLM-enhanced malware behavior auditing. MalEval is publicly available at https://github.com/ZhengXR930/MalEval.git</description>

      <title>LLM Jailbreak Detection for (Almost) Free!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enhance security through alignment when widely used, but remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks capable of producing inappropriate content. Jailbreak detection methods show promise in mitigating jailbreak attacks through the assistance of other models or multiple model inferences. However, existing methods entail significant computational costs. In this paper, we first present a finding that the difference in output distributions between jailbreak and benign prompts can be employed for detecting jailbreak prompts. Based on this finding, we propose a Free Jailbreak Detection (FJD) which prepends an affirmative instruction to the input and scales the logits by temperature to further distinguish between jailbreak and benign prompts through the confidence of the first token. Furthermore, we enhance the detection performance of FJD through the integration of virtual instruction learning. Extensive experiments on aligned LLMs show that our FJD can effectively detect jailbreak prompts with almost no additional computational costs during LLM inference.</description>

      <title>What Gets Measured Gets Managed: Mitigating Supply Chain Attacks with a Link Integrity Management System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The web continues to grow, but dependency-monitoring tools and standards for resource integrity lag behind. Currently, there exists no robust method to verify the integrity of web resources, much less in a generalizable yet performant manner, and supply chains remain one of the most targeted parts of the attack surface of web applications.
  In this paper, we present the design of LiMS, a transparent system to bootstrap link integrity guarantees in web browsing sessions with minimal overhead. At its core, LiMS uses a set of customizable integrity policies to declare the (un)expected properties of resources, verifies these policies, and enforces them for website visitors. We discuss how basic integrity policies can serve as building blocks for a comprehensive set of integrity policies, while providing guarantees that would be sufficient to defend against recent supply chain attacks detailed by security industry reports. Finally, we evaluate our open-sourced prototype by simulating deployments on a representative sample of 450 domains that are diverse in ranking and category. We find that our proposal offers the ability to bootstrap marked security improvements with an overall overhead of hundreds of milliseconds on initial page loads, and negligible overhead on reloads, regardless of network speeds. In addition, from examining archived data for the sample sites, we find that several of the proposed policy building blocks suit their dependency usage patterns, and would incur minimal administrative overhead.</description>

      <title>ATLANTIS: AI-driven Threat Localization, Analysis, and Triage Intelligence System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ATLANTIS, the cyber reasoning system developed by Team Atlanta that won 1st place in the Final Competition of DARPA's AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC) at DEF CON 33 (August 2025). AIxCC (2023-2025) challenged teams to build autonomous cyber reasoning systems capable of discovering and patching vulnerabilities at the speed and scale of modern software. ATLANTIS integrates large language models (LLMs) with program analysis -- combining symbolic execution, directed fuzzing, and static analysis -- to address limitations in automated vulnerability discovery and program repair. Developed by researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology, Samsung Research, KAIST, and POSTECH, the system addresses core challenges: scaling across diverse codebases from C to Java, achieving high precision while maintaining broad coverage, and producing semantically correct patches that preserve intended behavior. We detail the design philosophy, architectural decisions, and implementation strategies behind ATLANTIS, share lessons learned from pushing the boundaries of automated security when program analysis meets modern AI, and release artifacts to support reproducibility and future research.</description>

      <title>Threats and Security Strategies for IoMT Infusion Pumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) into healthcare systems has transformed patient care by enabling real-time monitoring, enhanced diagnostics, and enhanced operational efficiency. However, this increased connectivity has also expanded the attack surface for cybercriminals, raising significant cybersecurity and privacy concerns. This study focuses on the cybersecurity vulnerabilities of IoMT infusion pumps, which are critical devices in modern healthcare. Through a targeted literature review of the past five years, we analyzed seven current studies from a pool of 132 papers to identify security vulnerabilities. Our findings indicate that infusion pumps face vulnerabilities such as device-level flaws, authentication and access control issues, network and communication weaknesses, data security and privacy risks, and operational or organizational challenges that can expose them to lateral attacks within healthcare networks. Our analysis synthesizes findings from seven recent studies to clarify how and why infusion pumps remain vulnerable in each of these areas. By categorizing the security gaps, we highlight critical risk patterns and their implications. This work underscores the scope of the issue and provides a structured understanding that is valuable for healthcare IT professionals and device manufacturers. Ultimately, the findings can inform the development of targeted, proactive security strategies to better safeguard infusion pumps and protect patient well-being.</description>

      <title>Enterprise AI Must Enforce Participant-Aware Access Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise settings where they interact with multiple users and are trained or fine-tuned on sensitive internal data. While fine-tuning enhances performance by internalizing domain knowledge, it also introduces a critical security risk: leakage of confidential training data to unauthorized users. These risks are exacerbated when LLMs are combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines that dynamically fetch contextual documents at inference time.
  We demonstrate data exfiltration attacks on AI assistants where adversaries can exploit current fine-tuning and RAG architectures to leak sensitive information by leveraging the lack of access control enforcement. We show that existing defenses, including prompt sanitization, output filtering, system isolation, and training-level privacy mechanisms, are fundamentally probabilistic and fail to offer robust protection against such attacks.
  We take the position that only a deterministic and rigorous enforcement of fine-grained access control during both fine-tuning and RAG-based inference can reliably prevent the leakage of sensitive data to unauthorized recipients.
  We introduce a framework centered on the principle that any content used in training, retrieval, or generation by an LLM is explicitly authorized for \emph{all users involved in the interaction}. Our approach offers a simple yet powerful paradigm shift for building secure multi-user LLM systems that are grounded in classical access control but adapted to the unique challenges of modern AI workflows. Our solution has been deployed in Microsoft Copilot Tuning, a product offering that enables organizations to fine-tune models using their own enterprise-specific data.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Distilled Retrieval-Augmented Guarding Model for Online Malicious Intent Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in interactive applications, online malicious intent detection has become increasingly critical. However, existing approaches fall short of handling diverse and complex user queries in real time. To address these challenges, we introduce ADRAG (Adversarial Distilled Retrieval-Augmented Guard), a two-stage framework for robust and efficient online malicious intent detection. In the training stage, a high-capacity teacher model is trained on adversarially perturbed, retrieval-augmented inputs to learn robust decision boundaries over diverse and complex user queries. In the inference stage, a distillation scheduler transfers the teacher's knowledge into a compact student model, with a continually updated knowledge base collected online. At deployment, the compact student model leverages top-K similar safety exemplars retrieved from the online-updated knowledge base to enable both online and real-time malicious query detection. Evaluations across ten safety benchmarks demonstrate that ADRAG, with a 149M-parameter model, achieves 98.5% of WildGuard-7B's performance, surpasses GPT-4 by 3.3% and Llama-Guard-3-8B by 9.5% on out-of-distribution detection, while simultaneously delivering up to 5.6x lower latency at 300 queries per second (QPS) in real-time applications.</description>

      <title>Threat Modeling for Enhancing Security of IoT Audio Classification Devices under a Secure Protocols Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of IoT nodes equipped with microphones and capable of performing on-device audio classification exposes highly sensitive data while operating under tight resource constraints. To protect against this, we present a defence-in-depth architecture comprising a security protocol that treats the edge device, cellular network and cloud backend as three separate trust domains, linked by TPM-based remote attestation and mutually authenticated TLS 1.3. A STRIDE-driven threat model and attack-tree analysis guide the design. At startup, each boot stage is measured into TPM PCRs. The node can only decrypt its LUKS-sealed partitions after the cloud has verified a TPM quote and released a one-time unlock key. This ensures that rogue or tampered devices remain inert. Data in transit is protected by TLS 1.3 and hybridised with Kyber and Dilithium to provide post-quantum resilience. Meanwhile, end-to-end encryption and integrity hashes safeguard extracted audio features. Signed, rollback-protected AI models and tamper-responsive sensors harden firmware and hardware. Data at rest follows a 3-2-1 strategy comprising a solid-state drive sealed with LUKS, an offline cold archive encrypted with a hybrid post-quantum cipher and an encrypted cloud replica. Finally, we set out a plan for evaluating the physical and logical security of the proposed protocol.</description>

      <title>Security Analysis of Web Applications Based on Gruyere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of Internet technologies, web systems have become essential infrastructures for modern information exchange and business operations. However, alongside their expansion, numerous security vulnerabilities have emerged, making web security a critical research focus within the broader field of cybersecurity. These issues are closely related to data protection, privacy preservation, and business continuity, and systematic research on web security is crucial for mitigating malicious attacks and enhancing the reliability and robustness of network systems. This paper first reviews the OWASP Top 10, summarizing the types, causes, and impacts of common web vulnerabilities, and illustrates their exploitation mechanisms through representative cases. Building upon this, the Gruyere platform is adopted as an experimental subject for analyzing known vulnerabilities. The study presents detailed reproduction steps for specific vulnerabilities, proposes comprehensive remediation strategies, and further compares Gruyere's vulnerabilities with contemporary real-world cases. The findings suggest that, although Gruyere's vulnerabilities are relatively outdated, their underlying principles remain highly relevant for explaining a wide range of modern security flaws. Overall, this research demonstrates that web system security analysis based on Gruyere not only deepens the understanding of vulnerability mechanisms but also provides practical support for technological innovation and security defense.</description>

      <title>Variables Ordering Optimization in Boolean Characteristic Set Method Using Simulated Annealing and Machine Learning-based Time Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving systems of Boolean equations is a fundamental task in symbolic computation and algebraic cryptanalysis, with wide-ranging applications in cryptography, coding theory, and formal verification. Among existing approaches, the Boolean Characteristic Set (BCS) method[1] has emerged as one of the most efficient algorithms for tackling such problems. However, its performance is highly sensitive to the ordering of variables, with solving times varying drastically under different orderings for fixed variable counts n and equations size m. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel optimization framework that synergistically integrates machine learning (ML)-based time prediction with simulated annealing (SA) to efficiently identify high-performance variables orderings. Weconstruct a dataset comprising variable frequency spectrum X and corresponding BCS solving time t for benchmark systems(e.g., n = m = 28). Utilizing this data, we train an accurate ML predictor ft(X) to estimate solving time for any given variables ordering. For each target system, ft serves as the cost function within an SA algorithm, enabling rapid discovery of low-latency orderings that significantly expedite subsequent BCS execution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms the standard BCS algorithm[1], Gr\"obner basis method [2] and SAT solver[3], particularly for larger-scale systems(e.g., n = 32). Furthermore, we derive probabilistic time complexity bounds for the overall algorithm using stochastic process theory, establishing a quantitative relationship between predictor accuracy and expected solving complexity. This work provides both a practical acceleration tool for algebraic cryptanalysis and a theoretical foundation for ML-enhanced combinatorial optimization in symbolic computation.</description>

      <title>Blockchain-Enabled Explainable AI for Trusted Healthcare Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Blockchain-Integrated Explainable AI Framework (BXHF) for healthcare systems to tackle two essential challenges confronting health information networks: safe data exchange and comprehensible AI-driven clinical decision-making. Our architecture incorporates blockchain, ensuring patient records are immutable, auditable, and tamper-proof, alongside Explainable AI (XAI) methodologies that yield transparent and clinically relevant model predictions. By incorporating security assurances and interpretability requirements into a unified optimization pipeline, BXHF ensures both data-level trust (by verified and encrypted record sharing) and decision-level trust (with auditable and clinically aligned explanations). Its hybrid edge-cloud architecture allows for federated computation across different institutions, enabling collaborative analytics while protecting patient privacy. We demonstrate the framework's applicability through use cases such as cross-border clinical research networks, uncommon illness detection and high-risk intervention decision support. By ensuring transparency, auditability, and regulatory compliance, BXHF improves the credibility, uptake, and effectiveness of AI in healthcare, laying the groundwork for safer and more reliable clinical decision-making.</description>

      <title>Watermarking and Anomaly Detection in Machine Learning Models for LORA RF Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) distinguishes wireless devices by the small variations in their analog circuits, avoiding heavy cryptographic authentication. While deep learning on spectrograms improves accuracy, models remain vulnerable to copying, tampering, and evasion. We present a stronger RFFI system combining watermarking for ownership proof and anomaly detection for spotting suspicious inputs. Using a ResNet-34 on log-Mel spectrograms, we embed three watermarks: a simple trigger, an adversarially trained trigger robust to noise and filtering, and a hidden gradient/weight signature. A convolutional Variational Autoencoders (VAE) with Kullback-Leibler (KL) warm-up and free-bits flags off-distribution queries. On the LoRa dataset, our system achieves 94.6% accuracy, 98% watermark success, and 0.94 AUROC, offering verifiable, tamper-resistant authentication.</description>

      <title>Beyond Surface Alignment: Rebuilding LLMs Safety Mechanism via Probabilistically Ablating Refusal Direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose persistent threats to large language models (LLMs). Current safety alignment methods have attempted to address these issues, but they experience two significant limitations: insufficient safety alignment depth and unrobust internal defense mechanisms. These limitations make them vulnerable to adversarial attacks such as prefilling and refusal direction manipulation. We introduce DeepRefusal, a robust safety alignment framework that overcomes these issues. DeepRefusal forces the model to dynamically rebuild its refusal mechanisms from jailbreak states. This is achieved by probabilistically ablating the refusal direction across layers and token depths during fine-tuning. Our method not only defends against prefilling and refusal direction attacks but also demonstrates strong resilience against other unseen jailbreak strategies. Extensive evaluations on four open-source LLM families and six representative attacks show that DeepRefusal reduces attack success rates by approximately 95%, while maintaining model capabilities with minimal performance degradation.</description>

      <title>Evil Vizier: Vulnerabilities of LLM-Integrated XR Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended reality (XR) applications increasingly integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance user experience, scene understanding, and even generate executable XR content, and are often called "AI glasses". Despite these potential benefits, the integrated XR-LLM pipeline makes XR applications vulnerable to new forms of attacks. In this paper, we analyze LLM-Integated XR systems in the literature and in practice and categorize them along different dimensions from a systems perspective. Building on this categorization, we identify a common threat model and demonstrate a series of proof-of-concept attacks on multiple XR platforms that employ various LLM models (Meta Quest 3, Meta Ray-Ban, Android, and Microsoft HoloLens 2 running Llama and GPT models). Although these platforms each implement LLM integration differently, they share vulnerabilities where an attacker can modify the public context surrounding a legitimate LLM query, resulting in erroneous visual or auditory feedback to users, thus compromising their safety or privacy, sowing confusion, or other harmful effects. To defend against these threats, we discuss mitigation strategies and best practices for developers, including an initial defense prototype, and call on the community to develop new protection mechanisms to mitigate these risks.</description>

      <title>Pod: An Optimal-Latency, Censorship-Free, and Accountable Generalized Consensus Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14931v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the inherent issues of high latency in blockchains and low scalability in traditional consensus protocols. We present pod, a novel notion of consensus whose first priority is to achieve the physically-optimal latency of one round-trip, i.e., requiring only one network trip for writing a transaction and one for reading it. To accomplish this, we first eliminate inter-replica communication. Instead, clients send transactions directly to all replicas, which independently process transactions and append them to local logs. Replicas assigns a timestamp and a sequence number to each transaction in their logs, allowing clients to extract valuable metadata about the transactions and the system state. Later on, clients retrieve these logs and extract transactions (and associated metadata) from them. Necessarily, this construction achieves weaker properties than a total-order broadcast protocol, due to existing lower bounds. Our work models the primitive of pod and defines its security properties. We then show pod-core, a protocol that satisfies properties such as transaction confirmation within $2\delta$, censorship resistance against Byzantine replicas, and accountability for safety violations. We show that single-shot auctions can be realized using the pod notion and observe that it is also sufficient for other popular applications.</description>

      <title>Normalized Square Root: Sharper Matrix Factorization Bounds for Differentially Private Continual Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The factorization norms of the lower-triangular all-ones $n \times n$ matrix, $\gamma_2(M_{count})$ and $\gamma_{F}(M_{count})$, play a central role in differential privacy as they are used to give theoretical justification of the accuracy of the only known production-level private training algorithm of deep neural networks by Google. Prior to this work, the best known upper bound on $\gamma_2(M_{count})$ was $1 + \frac{\log n}{\pi}$ by Mathias (Linear Algebra and Applications, 1993), and the best known lower bound was $\frac{1}{\pi}(2 + \log(\frac{2n+1}{3})) \approx 0.507 + \frac{\log n}{\pi}$ (Matou\v{s}ek, Nikolov, Talwar, IMRN 2020), where $\log$ denotes the natural logarithm. Recently, Henzinger and Upadhyay (SODA 2025) gave the first explicit factorization that meets the bound of Mathias (1993) and asked whether there exists an explicit factorization that improves on Mathias' bound. We answer this question in the affirmative. Additionally, we improve the lower bound significantly. More specifically, we show that $$
  0.701 + \frac{\log n}{\pi} + o(1) \;\leq\; \gamma_2(M_{count}) \;\leq\; 0.846 + \frac{\log n}{\pi} + o(1). $$ That is, we reduce the gap between the upper and lower bound to $0.14 + o(1)$.
  We also show that our factors achieve a better upper bound for $\gamma_{F}(M_{count})$ compared to prior work, and we establish an improved lower bound: $$
  0.701 + \frac{\log n}{\pi} + o(1) \;\leq\; \gamma_{F}(M_{count}) \;\leq\; 0.748 + \frac{\log n}{\pi} + o(1). $$ That is, the gap between the lower and upper bound provided by our explicit factorization is $0.047 + o(1)$.</description>

      <title>BEACON: Behavioral Malware Classification with Large Language Model Embeddings and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Malware is becoming increasingly complex and widespread, making it essential to develop more effective and timely detection methods. Traditional static analysis often fails to defend against modern threats that employ code obfuscation, polymorphism, and other evasion techniques. In contrast, behavioral malware detection, which monitors runtime activities, provides a more reliable and context-aware solution. In this work, we propose BEACON, a novel deep learning framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate dense, contextual embeddings from raw sandbox-generated behavior reports. These embeddings capture semantic and structural patterns of each sample and are processed by a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) for multi-class malware classification. Evaluated on the Avast-CTU Public CAPE Dataset, our framework consistently outperforms existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-based behavioral embeddings and the overall design of BEACON for robust malware classification.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Simulation Framework for Multi-channel Replay Speech Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Replay speech attacks pose a significant threat to voice-controlled systems, especially in smart environments where voice assistants are widely deployed. While multi-channel audio offers spatial cues that can enhance replay detection robustness, existing datasets and methods predominantly rely on single-channel recordings. In this work, we introduce an acoustic simulation framework designed to simulate multi-channel replay speech configurations using publicly available resources. Our setup models both genuine and spoofed speech across varied environments, including realistic microphone and loudspeaker impulse responses, room acoustics, and noise conditions. The framework employs measured loudspeaker directionalities during the replay attack to improve the realism of the simulation. We define two spoofing settings, which simulate whether a reverberant or an anechoic speech is used in the replay scenario, and evaluate the impact of omnidirectional and diffuse noise on detection performance. Using the state-of-the-art M-ALRAD model for replay speech detection, we demonstrate that synthetic data can support the generalization capabilities of the detector across unseen enclosures.</description>

      <title>Distributed Batch Matrix Multiplication: Trade-Offs in Download Rate, Randomness, and Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the trade-off between communication rate and privacy for distributed batch matrix multiplication of two independent sequences of matrices $\bold{A}$ and $\bold{B}$ with uniformly distributed entries. In our setting, $\bold{B}$ is publicly accessible by all the servers while $\bold{A}$ must remain private. A user is interested in evaluating the product $\bold{AB}$ with the responses from the $k$ fastest servers. For a given parameter $\alpha \in [0, 1]$, our privacy constraint must ensure that any set of $\ell$ colluding servers cannot learn more than a fraction $\alpha$ of $\bold{A}$. Additionally, we study the trade-off between the amount of local randomness needed at the encoder and privacy. Finally, we establish the optimal trade-offs when the matrices are square and identify a linear relationship between information leakage and communication rate.</description>

      <title>Orion: Fuzzing Workflow Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fuzz testing is one of the most effective techniques for finding software vulnerabilities. While modern fuzzers can generate inputs and monitor executions automatically, the overall workflow, from analyzing a codebase, to configuring harnesses, to triaging results, still requires substantial manual effort. Prior attempts focused on single stages such as harness synthesis or input minimization, leaving researchers to manually connect the pieces into a complete fuzzing campaign.
  We introduce Orion, a framework that automates the the manual bottlenecks of fuzzing by integrating LLM reasoning with traditional tools, allowing campaigns to scale to settings where human effort alone was impractical. Orion uses LLMs for code reasoning and semantic guidance, while relying on deterministic tools for verification, iterative refinement, and tasks that require precision. Across our benchmark suite, Orion reduces human effort by 46-204x depending on the workflow stage, and we demonstrate its effectiveness through the discovery of two previously unknown vulnerabilities in the widely used open-source clib library.</description>

      <title>Cloud-Edge Collaborative Data Anomaly Detection in Industrial Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09942</link>

Abstract: Existing research on sensor data anomaly detection for industrial sensor networks still has several inherent limitations. First, most detection models usually consider centralized detection. Thus, all sensor data have to be uploaded to the control center for analysis, leading to a heavy traffic load. However, industrial sensor networks have high requirements for reliable and real-time communication. The heavy traffic load may cause communication delays or packets lost by corruption. Second, there are complex spatial and temporal features in industrial sensor data. The full extraction of such features plays a key role in improving detection performance.To solve the limitations above, this paper develops a cloud-edge collaborative data anomaly detection approach for industrial sensor networks that mainly consists of a sensor data detection model deployed at individual edges and a sensor data analysis model deployed in the cloud. The former is implemented using Gaussian and Bayesian algorithms, which effectively filter the substantial volume of sensor data generated during the normal operation of the industrial sensor network, thereby reducing traffic load. It only uploads all the sensor data to the sensor data analysis model for further analysis when the network is in an anomalous state. The latter based on GCRL is developed by inserting Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) into Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), which can effectively extract the spatial and temporal features of the sensor data for anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Differentially Private Text Sanitization via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is the de facto privacy standard against privacy leakage attacks, including many recently discovered ones against large language models (LLMs). However, we discovered that LLMs could reconstruct the altered/removed privacy from given DP-sanitized prompts. We propose two attacks (black-box and white-box) based on the accessibility to LLMs and show that LLMs could connect the pair of DP-sanitized text and the corresponding private training data of LLMs by giving sample text pairs as instructions (in the black-box attacks) or fine-tuning data (in the white-box attacks). To illustrate our findings, we conduct comprehensive experiments on modern LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-4o, Claude-3, Claude-3.5, OPT, GPT-Neo, GPT-J, Gemma-2, and Pythia) using commonly used datasets (such as WikiMIA, Pile-CC, and Pile-Wiki) against both word-level and sentence-level DP. The experimental results show promising recovery rates, e.g., the black-box attacks against the word-level DP over WikiMIA dataset gave 72.18% on LLaMA-2 (70B), 82.39% on LLaMA-3 (70B), 75.35% on Gemma-2, 91.2% on ChatGPT-4o, and 94.01% on Claude-3.5 (Sonnet). More urgently, this study indicates that these well-known LLMs have emerged as a new security risk for existing DP text sanitization approaches in the current environment.</description>

      <title>GASLITEing the Retrieval: Exploring Vulnerabilities in Dense Embedding-based Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense embedding-based text retrieval$\unicode{x2013}$retrieval of relevant passages from corpora via deep learning encodings$\unicode{x2013}$has emerged as a powerful method attaining state-of-the-art search results and popularizing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Still, like other search methods, embedding-based retrieval may be susceptible to search-engine optimization (SEO) attacks, where adversaries promote malicious content by introducing adversarial passages to corpora. Prior work has shown such SEO is feasible, mostly demonstrating attacks against retrieval-integrated systems (e.g., RAG). Yet, these consider relaxed SEO threat models (e.g., targeting single queries), use baseline attack methods, and provide small-scale retrieval evaluation, thus obscuring our comprehensive understanding of retrievers' worst-case behavior. This work aims to faithfully and thoroughly assess retrievers' robustness, paving a path to uncover factors related to their susceptibility to SEO. To this end, we, first, propose the GASLITE attack for generating adversarial passages, that$\unicode{x2013}$without relying on the corpus content or modifying the model$\unicode{x2013}$carry adversary-chosen information while achieving high retrieval ranking, consistently outperforming prior approaches. Second, using GASLITE, we extensively evaluate retrievers' robustness, testing nine advanced models under varied threat models, while focusing on pertinent adversaries targeting queries on a specific concept (e.g., a public figure). Amongst our findings: retrievers are highly vulnerable to SEO against concept-specific queries, even under negligible poisoning rates (e.g., $\geq$0.0001% of the corpus), while generalizing across different corpora and query distributions; single-query SEO is completely solved by GASLITE; adaptive attacks demonstrate bypassing common defenses; [...]</description>

      <title>CRSet: Private Non-Interactive Verifiable Credential Revocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Like any digital certificate, Verifiable Credentials (VCs) require a way to revoke them in case of an error or key compromise. Existing solutions for VC revocation, most prominently Bitstring Status List, are not viable for many use cases because they may leak the issuer's activity, which in turn leaks internal business metrics. For instance, staff fluctuation through the revocation of employee IDs. We identify the protection of issuer activity as a key gap and propose a formal definition for a corresponding characteristic of a revocation mechanism. Then, we introduce CRSet, a non-interactive mechanism that trades some space efficiency to reach these privacy characteristics. For that, we provide a proof sketch. Issuers periodically encode revocation data and publish it via Ethereum blob-carrying transactions, ensuring secure and private availability. Relying Parties (RPs) can download it to perform revocation checks locally. Sticking to a non-interactive design also makes adoption easier because it requires no changes to wallet agents and exchange protocols. We also implement and empirically evaluate CRSet, finding its real-world behavior to match expectations. One Ethereum blob fits revocation data for about 170k VCs.</description>

      <title>MADAR: Efficient Continual Learning for Malware Analysis with Distribution-Aware Replay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millions of new pieces of malicious software (i.e., malware) are introduced each year. This poses significant challenges for antivirus vendors, who use machine learning to detect and analyze malware, and must keep up with changes in the distribution while retaining knowledge of older variants. Continual learning (CL) holds the potential to address this challenge by reducing the storage and computational costs of regularly retraining over all the collected data. Prior work, however, shows that CL techniques, which are designed primarily for computer vision tasks, fare poorly when applied to malware classification. To address these issues, we begin with an exploratory analysis of a typical malware dataset, which reveals that malware families are diverse and difficult to characterize, requiring a wide variety of samples to learn a robust representation. Based on these findings, we propose $\underline{M}$alware $\underline{A}$nalysis with $\underline{D}$istribution-$\underline{A}$ware $\underline{R}$eplay (MADAR), a CL framework that accounts for the unique properties and challenges of the malware data distribution. Through extensive evaluation on large-scale Windows and Android malware datasets, we show that MADAR significantly outperforms prior work. This highlights the importance of understanding domain characteristics when designing CL techniques and demonstrates a path forward for the malware classification domain.</description>

      <title>BLACKOUT: Data-Oblivious Computation with Blinded Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14654v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lack of memory-safety and exposure to side channels are two prominent, persistent challenges for the secure implementation of software. Memory-safe programming languages promise to significantly reduce the prevalence of memory-safety bugs, but make it more difficult to implement side-channel-resistant code. We aim to address both memory-safety and side-channel resistance by augmenting memory-safe hardware with the ability for data-oblivious programming. We describe an extension to the CHERI capability architecture to provide blinded capabilities that allow data-oblivious computation to be carried out by userspace tasks. We also present BLACKOUT, our realization of blinded capabilities on a FPGA softcore based on the speculative out-of-order CHERI-Toooba processor and extend the CHERI-enabled Clang/LLVM compiler and the CheriBSD operating system with support for blinded capabilities. BLACKOUT makes writing side-channel-resistant code easier by making non-data-oblivious operations via blinded capabilities explicitly fault. Through rigorous evaluation we show that BLACKOUT ensures memory operated on through blinded capabilities is securely allocated, used, and reclaimed and demonstrate that, in benchmarks comparable to those used by previous work, BLACKOUT imposes only a small performance degradation (1.5% geometric mean) compared to the baseline CHERI-Toooba processor.</description>

      <title>Silenzio: Secure Non-Interactive Outsourced MLP Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Outsourcing ML training to cloud-service-providers presents a compelling opportunity for resource constrained clients, while it simultaneously bears inherent privacy risks. We introduce Silenuio, the first fully non-interactive outsourcing scheme for the training of MLPs that achieves 128bit security using FHE (precisely TFHE). Unlike traditional MPC-based protocols that necessitate interactive communication between the client and server(s) or non-collusion assumptions among multiple servers, Silenzio enables the "fire-and-forget" paradigm without such assumptions. In this approach, the client encrypts the training data once, and the server performs the training without any further interaction.
  Silenzio operates entirely over low-bitwidth integer to mitigate the computational overhead inherent to FHE. Our approach features a novel low-bitwidth matrix multiplication gadget that leverages input-dependent residue number systems, ensuring that no intermediate value overflows 8bit. Starting from an RNS-to-MRNS conversion process, we propose an efficient block-scaling mechanism, which approximately shifts encrypted tensor values to their user-specified most significant bits. To instantiate the backpropagation of the error, Silenzio introduces a low-bitwidth gradient computation for the cross-entropy loss.
  We evaluate Silenzio on standard MLP training tasks regarding runtime as well as model performance and achieve similar classification accuracy as MLPs trained using PyTorch with 32bit floating-point computations. Our open-source implementation of Silenzio represents a significant advancement in privacy-preserving ML, providing a new baseline for secure and non-interactive outsourced MLP training.</description>

      <title>Timestamp Manipulation: Timestamp-based Nakamoto-style Blockchains are Vulnerable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05328v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nakamoto consensus are the most widely adopted decentralized consensus mechanism in cryptocurrency systems. Since it was proposed in 2008, many studies have focused on analyzing its security. Most of them focus on maximizing the profit of the adversary. Examples include the selfish mining attack [FC '14] and the recent riskless uncle maker (RUM) attack [CCS '23]. In this work, we introduce the Staircase-Unrestricted Uncle Maker (SUUM), the first block withholding attack targeting the timestamp-based Nakamoto-style blockchain. Through block withholding, timestamp manipulation, and difficulty risk control, SUUM adversaries are capable of launching persistent attacks with zero cost and minimal difficulty risk characteristics, indefinitely exploiting rewards from honest participants. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle that threatens the security of blockchains. We conduct a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of SUUM, including the attack conditions, its impact on blockchains, and the difficulty risks. Finally, we further discuss four feasible mitigation measures against SUUM.</description>

      <title>Security and Privacy Measurement on Chinese Consumer IoT Traffic based on Device Lifecycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, consumer Internet of Things (IoT) devices have become widely used in daily life. With the popularity of devices, related security and privacy risks arise at the same time as they collect user-related data and transmit it to various service providers. Although China accounts for a larger share of the consumer IoT industry, current analyses on consumer IoT device traffic primarily focus on regions such as Europe, the United States, and Australia. Research on China, however, is currently relatively rare. This study constructs the first large-scale dataset about consumer IoT device traffic in China. Specifically, we propose a fine-grained traffic collection guidance covering the entire lifecycle of consumer IoT devices, gathering traffic from 77 devices spanning 38 brands and 12 device categories. Based on this dataset, we analyze traffic destinations and encryption practices across different device types during the entire lifecycle and compare the findings with the results of other regions. Compared to other regions, our results show that consumer IoT devices in China rely more on domestic services and overall perform better in terms of encryption practices. However, there are still 23/40 devices improperly conducting certificate validation, and 2/70 devices use insecure encryption protocols. To facilitate future research, we open-source our traffic collection guidance and make our dataset publicly available.</description>

      <title>Larger-scale Nakamoto-style Blockchains Offer Better Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional security models for Nakamoto-style blockchains overestimate adversarial coordination by assuming instantaneous synchronization among malicious nodes, neglecting the critical impact of internal communication delays on security. This paper introduces a dual-delay framework to revisit security analysis, addressing this oversight through two key innovations. First, the static delay model quantifies how adversarial communication delays (\(\Delta_a\)) constrain the effective growth rate of private chains, derived via an M/D/1 queuing model as \(\lambda_{eff} = \lambda_a / (1 + \lambda_a \Delta_a)\). This model reveals that the security threshold (\(\beta^*\)), the maximum adversarial power the system tolerates, increases with \(\Delta_a\), even exceeding the classic 51\% boundary when \(\Delta_a \textgreater \Delta\) (honest nodes' delay), breaking the long-standing 50\% assumption. Second, the dynamic delay model integrates probabilistic corruption and scale-dependent delays to characterize the total adversarial delay window (\(\Delta_{total} = \Delta(n) e^{-k\beta} + c \log(1 + \beta n)\)), where \(\Delta(n) \in \Theta(\log n)\) captures honest nodes' logarithmic delay growth. Asymptotic analysis shows adversarial power decays linearly with network scale, ensuring the probability of \(\beta \leq \beta^*\) approaches 1 as \(n \to \infty\). By exposing the interplay between network scale, communication delays, and power dilution, we provide a theoretical foundation for optimizing consensus protocols and assessing robustness in large-scale Nakamoto-style blockchains.</description>

      <title>Exploit Tool Invocation Prompt for Tool Behavior Hijacking in LLM-Based Agentic System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05755v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM-based agentic systems leverage large language models to handle user queries, make decisions, and execute external tools for complex tasks across domains like chatbots, customer service, and software engineering. A critical component of these systems is the Tool Invocation Prompt (TIP), which defines tool interaction protocols and guides LLMs to ensure the security and correctness of tool usage. Despite its importance, TIP security has been largely overlooked. This work investigates TIP-related security risks, revealing that major LLM-based systems like Cursor, Claude Code, and others are vulnerable to attacks such as remote code execution (RCE) and denial of service (DoS). Through a systematic TIP exploitation workflow (TEW), we demonstrate external tool behavior hijacking via manipulated tool invocations. We also propose defense mechanisms to enhance TIP security in LLM-based agentic systems.</description>

      <title>A Graph-Based Approach to Alert Contextualisation in Security Operations Centres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interpreting the massive volume of security alerts is a significant challenge in Security Operations Centres (SOCs). Effective contextualisation is important, enabling quick distinction between genuine threats and benign activity to prioritise what needs further analysis. This paper proposes a graph-based approach to enhance alert contextualisation in a SOC by aggregating alerts into graph-based alert groups, where nodes represent alerts and edges denote relationships within defined time-windows. By grouping related alerts, we enable analysis at a higher abstraction level, capturing attack steps more effectively than individual alerts. Furthermore, to show that our format is well suited for downstream machine learning methods, we employ Graph Matching Networks (GMNs) to correlate incoming alert groups with historical incidents, providing analysts with additional insights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.06459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical tools which satisfy rigorous privacy guarantees are necessary for modern data analysis. It is well-known that robustness against contamination is linked to differential privacy. Despite this fact, using multivariate medians for differentially private and robust multivariate location estimation has not been systematically studied. We develop novel finite-sample performance guarantees for differentially private multivariate depth-based medians, which are essentially sharp. Our results cover commonly used depth functions, such as the halfspace (or Tukey) depth, spatial depth, and the integrated dual depth. We show that under Cauchy marginals, the cost of heavy-tailed location estimation outweighs the cost of privacy. We demonstrate our results numerically using a Gaussian contamination model in dimensions up to $d = 100$, and compare them to a state-of-the-art private mean estimation algorithm. As a by-product of our investigation, we prove concentration inequalities for the output of the exponential mechanism about the maximizer of the population objective function. This bound applies to objective functions that satisfy a mild regularity condition.</description>

      <title>MetaTrading: An Immersion-Aware Model Trading Framework for Vehicular Metaverse Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19665v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Timely updating of Internet of Things data is crucial for achieving immersion in vehicular metaverse services. However, challenges such as latency caused by massive data transmissions, privacy risks associated with user data, and computational burdens on metaverse service providers (MSPs) hinder the continuous collection of high-quality data. To address these challenges, we propose an immersion-aware model trading framework that enables efficient and privacy-preserving data provisioning through federated learning (FL). Specifically, we first develop a novel multi-dimensional evaluation metric for the immersion of models (IoM). The metric considers the freshness and accuracy of the local model, and the amount and potential value of raw training data. Building on the IoM, we design an incentive mechanism to encourage metaverse users (MUs) to participate in FL by providing local updates to MSPs under resource constraints. The trading interactions between MSPs and MUs are modeled as an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC) to analyze and balance their costs and gains, where MSPs as leaders determine rewards, while MUs as followers optimize resource allocation. To ensure privacy and adapt to dynamic network conditions, we develop a distributed dynamic reward algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning, without acquiring any private information from MUs and other MSPs. Experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, achieving improvements in IoM of 38.3% and 37.2%, and reductions in training time to reach the target accuracy of 43.5% and 49.8%, on average, for the MNIST and GTSRB datasets, respectively. These findings validate the effectiveness of our approach in incentivizing MUs to contribute high-value local models to MSPs, providing a flexible and adaptive scheme for data provisioning in vehicular metaverse services.</description>

      <title>Survivability of Backdoor Attacks on Unconstrained Face Recognition Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01607v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of Deep Learning-based Face Recognition Systems raises multiple security concerns. While prior research has identified backdoor vulnerabilities on isolated components, Backdoor Attacks on real-world, unconstrained pipelines remain underexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive system-level analysis of Backdoor Attacks targeting Face Recognition Systems and provides three contributions. We first show that face feature extractors trained with large margin metric learning losses are susceptible to Backdoor Attacks. By analyzing 20 pipeline configurations and 15 attack scenarios, we then reveal that a single backdoor can compromise an entire Face Recognition System. Finally, we propose effective best practices and countermeasures for stakeholders.</description>

      <title>DSperse: A Framework for Targeted Verification in Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DSperse is a modular framework for distributed machine learning inference with strategic cryptographic verification. Operating within the emerging paradigm of distributed zero-knowledge machine learning, DSperse avoids the high cost and rigidity of full-model circuitization by enabling targeted verification of strategically chosen subcomputations. These verifiable segments, or "slices", may cover part or all of the inference pipeline, with global consistency enforced through audit, replication, or economic incentives. This architecture supports a pragmatic form of trust minimization, localizing zero-knowledge proofs to the components where they provide the greatest value. We evaluate DSperse using multiple proving systems and report empirical results on memory usage, runtime, and circuit behavior under sliced and unsliced configurations. By allowing proof boundaries to align flexibly with the model's logical structure, DSperse supports scalable, targeted verification strategies suited to diverse deployment needs.</description>

      <title>Exact Coset Sampling for Quantum Lattice Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a simple and provably correct replacement for the contested ``domain-extension'' in Step 9 of a recent windowed-QFT lattice algorithm with complex-Gaussian windows~\citep{chen2024quantum}. The published Step 9 suffers from a periodicity/support mismatch. Our drop-in subroutine uses a pair-shift difference to cancel all unknown offsets exactly and to synthesize a uniform cyclic subgroup (zero-offset coset) of order $P$ inside $(\mathbb{Z}_{M_2})^n$. A subsequent QFT enforces the intended modular linear relation. The sole structural assumption is the residue accessibility condition, which enables coherent auxiliary cleanup; no amplitude periodicity is used. The unitary is reversible, uses $\mathrm{poly}(\log M_2)$ gates, and preserves upstream asymptotics.</description>
