      <title>Solitary states in spiking oscillators with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a system of globally coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators, showing that the presence of higher-order interactions affects the character of the transition between synchronous and asynchronous states. In particular, we demonstrate that, around the synchronization transition, solitary states emerge due to the presence of second-order interactions. In difference to the phenomenology observed in systems of phase oscillators, we show that, at low coupling strengths, solitary states appear for both transition directions, whereas for higher couplings they only occur in the forward direction, with the backwards one characterized by explosive desynchronization.</description>

      <title>Long-Time and Short-Time Dynamics in a Weighted-Median Opinion Model on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17552v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social interactions influence people's opinions. In some situations, these interactions eventually yield a consensus opinion; in others, they can lead to opinion fragmentation and the formation of different opinion groups in the form of ``echo chambers''. Consider a social network of individuals with continuous-valued scalar opinions, and suppose that they can change their opinions when they interact with each other. In many models of the opinion dynamics of individuals in a network, it is common for opinion updates to depend on the mean opinion of interacting individuals. As an alternative, which may be more realistic in some situations, we study an opinion model with an opinion-update rule that depends on the weighted median of the opinions of interacting individuals. Through numerical simulations of our median-update opinion model, we investigate how the final opinion distribution depends on network structure. For configuration-model networks, we also derive a mean-field approximation for the asymptotic dynamics of the opinion distribution when there are infinitely many individuals. We numerically investigate its accuracy for short-time opinion dynamics on various networks.</description>

      <title>The Origin of Structure in the Auroral Ionosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The auroral ionosphere presents a paradox: turbulence often thrives in a conductive layer that should suppress the growth rates of plasma instabilities. Using a novel composite power spectrum from coherent radar and GPS data, we show that turbulence on a wide range of scales stem not from local instabilities. Instead, its spectrum is a structural imprint of field-aligned electrical currents, and its dissipative character is governed by the flux of precipitating particles. Our measurements provide a clear geophysical example of a driven, emergent system of self-organized dissipative structures.</description>
