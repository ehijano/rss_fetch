      <title>Sharp non-uniqueness for the Navier-Stokes equations in R^3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a sharp and strong non-uniqueness for a class of weak solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\R^3$. To be more precise, we exhibit the non-uniqueness result in a strong sense, that is, any weak solution is non-unique in L^p([0,T];L^\infty(\R^3)) with 1\le p&lt;2. Moreover, this non-uniqueness result is sharp with regard to the classical Ladyzhenskaya-Prodi-Serrin criteria at endpoint (2, \infty), which extends the sharp nonuniqueness for the Navier-Stokes equations on torus $\TTT^3$ in the recent groundbreaking work (Cheskidov and Luo, Invent. Math., 229 (2022), pp. 987-1054) to the setting of the whole space. The key ingredient is developing a new iterative scheme that balances the compact support of the Reynolds stress error with the non-compact support of the solution via introducing incompressible perturbation fluid.</description>

      <title>Fractional Sobolev-Choquard critical systems with Hardy term and weighted singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a fractional p-Laplacian system of equations in the entire space RN with doubly critical singular nonlinearities involving a local critical Sobolev term together with a nonlocal Choquard critical term; the problem also includes a homogeneous singular Hardy term; moreover, all the nonlinearities involve singular critical weights. To prove the main result we use a refinement of Sobolev inequality that is related to Morrey space because our problem involves doubly critical exponentss and a version of the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality. With the help of these results, we provide sufficient conditions under which a weak nontrivial solution to the problem exists via variational methods.</description>

      <title>Sharp $L^1$-convergence rates to the Barenblatt solutions for the compressible Euler equations with time-varying damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of compressible isentropic flow when the initial mass is finite and the friction varies with time, which is modeled by the compressible Euler equation with time-dependent damping. In this paper, we obtain the best $L^1$-convergence rates to date, for any $\gamma\in(1,+\infty)$ and $\nu\in[0,1)$. Here, $\gamma$ is the adiabatic gas exponent, and $\nu$ is the physical parameter in the damping term. The key to the analysis lies in a new perspective on the relationship between the density function and the Barenblatt solution of the porous medium equation, and finding the relevant lower bound for the case of $\gamma&lt;2$ is a tricky problem. Specialized to $\nu=0$, these convergence rates also show an essential improvement over the original rates. Moreover, for all $\gamma\in(1,+\infty)$, the results in this work are the first to present a unified form of $L^1$-convergence rates. Indeed, even for $\nu=0$, as noted in 2011, ``the current rate is difficult to improve with the current method". Our results are therefore an encouraging advancement.</description>

      <title>Critical norm blow-up rates for the energy supercritical nonlinear heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the first classification of blow-up rates of the critical norm for solutions of the energy supercritical nonlinear heat equation, without any assumptions such as radial symmetry or sign conditions. Moreover, the blow-up rates we obtain are optimal, for solutions that blow-up with bounded $L^{n(p-1)/2,\infty}(\mathbf{R}^n)$-norm up to the blow-up time. We establish these results by proving quantitative estimates for the energy supercritical nonlinear heat equation with a robust new strategy based on quantitative $\varepsilon$-regularity criterion averaged over certain comparable time scales. With this in hand, we then produce the quantitative estimates using arguments inspired by Palasek [31] and Tao [38] involving quantitative Carleman inequalities applied to the Navier-Stokes equations. Our work shows that energy structure is not essential for establishing blow-up rates of the critical norm for parabolic problems with a scaling symmetry. This paves the way for establishing such critical norm blow-up rates for other nonlinear parabolic equations.</description>

      <title>Existence and asymptotic properties of standing waves for dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate with rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the existence and asymptotic properties of prescribed mass standing waves for the rotating dipolar Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a harmonic potential in the unstable regime. This equation arises as an effective model describing Bose-Einstein condensate of trapped dipolar quantum gases rotating at the speed $\Omega$. To be precise, we mainly focus on the two cases: the rotational speed $0&lt;\Omega&lt;\Omega^{*}$ and $\Omega=\Omega^{*}$, where $\Omega^{*}$ is called a critical rotational speed. For the first case, we obtain two different standing waves, one of which is a local minimizer and can be determined as the ground state, and the other is mountain pass type. For the critical case, we rewrite the original problem as a dipole Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a constant magnetic field and partial harmonic confinement. Under this setting, a local minimizer can also be obtained, which seems to be the optimal result. Particularly, in both cases, we establish the mass collapse behavior of the local minimizers. Our results extend the work of Dinh (Lett. Math. Phys., 2022) and Luo et al. (J. Differ. Equ., 2021) to the non-axially symmetric harmonic potential, and answer the open question proposed by Dinh.</description>

      <title>Low Mach Number Limit of Non-isentropic Inviscid Elastodynamics with General Initial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the incompressible limit of non-isentropic inviscid elastodynamic equations with general initial data in 3D half-space. The deformation tensor is assumed to satisfy the neo-Hookean linear elasticity and degenerates in the normal direction on the solid wall. The uniform estimates in Mach number are established based on two important observations. First, the entropy has enhanced regularity in the direction of each column of the deformation tensor, which exactly helps us avoid the loss of derivatives caused by the simultaneous appearance of elasticity and entropy in vorticity analysis. Second, a special structure of the wave equation of the pressure together with elliptic estimates helps us reduce the normal derivatives in the control of divergence and pressure. The strong convergence of solutions in time is obtained by proving local energy decay of the wave equation and using the technique of microlocal defect measure.</description>

      <title>Uniform Anisotropic Regularity and Low Mach Number Limit of Non-isentropic Ideal MHD Equations with a Perfectly Conducting Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the low Mach number limit of non-isentropic ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations with general initial data in the half-space whose boundary satisfies the perfectly conducting wall condition. By observing a special structure contributed by Lorentz force in vorticity analysis, we establish uniform estimates in suitable anisotropic Sobolev spaces with weights of Mach number determined by the number of material derivatives. We also observe that the entropy has the enhanced regularity in the direction of the magnetic field. These two observations help us get rid of the loss of derivatives and weights of Mach number in vorticity analysis caused by the simultaneous appearance of entropy, general initial data and the magnetic field, which is one of the major difficulties that do not appear in Euler equations or the isentropic problems. By utilizing the technique of Alinhac good unknowns, the anti-symmetric structure is preserved in the tangential estimates for the system differenetiated by high-order material derivatives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamical behavior of non-autonomous Lame thermoelastic systems within $N$-dimensional materials. With appropriate constraints on nonlinear characteristics and functional parameters, we initially establish the existence of a uniformly absorbing set by constructing a Lyapunov function. Subsequently, we employ the contraction mapping principle to demonstrate the uniformly asymptotic compactness of the system. Finally, under irrotational conditions, we prove the existence of a uniform attractor $\mathcal{A}_\Sigma$ in the space $H_c$.</description>

      <title>Emergence of complexity in opinion propagation: A reaction-diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a model designed to describe the spread and accumulation of opinions in a population. Inspired by the social contagion paradigm, our model is built on the classical SIR model of Kermack and McKendrick and consists in a system of reaction-diffusion equations. In the scenario we consider, individuals within the population can adopt new opinions via interactions with others, following some simple rules. The individuals can gradually adopt more complex opinions over time. Our main result is the characterization of a maximal complexity of opinions that can persist and propagate. In addition, we show how the parameters of the model influence this maximal complexity. Notably, we show that it grows almost exponentially with the size of the population, suggesting that large communities can foster the emergence of more complex opinions.</description>

      <title>The p-Laplacian: phenomenological modelling of the flow in porous media and CFD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to discuss several aspects of connections between the p-Laplacian and mathematical models in hydrology. At first we present models of groundwater flow in phreatic aquifers and models of irrigation and drainage that lead to quasilinear parabolic equations involving the p-Laplacian. Next, we survey conditions of validity of Strong Maximum Principle and Strong Comparison Principle for this type of problems. Finally, we employ computer fluid dynamics simulations to realistic scenario of fracture networks to estimate values of the parameters of constitutive laws governing groundwater flow in the context of fractured hard-rock aquifers.</description>

      <title>Sharp lifespan estimates for semilinear fractional evolution equations with critical nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider semilinear wave equation and other second order $\sigma$-evolution equations with different (effective or non-effective) damping mechanisms driven by fractional Laplace operators; in particular, the nonlinear term is the product of a power nonlinearity $|u|^p$ with the critical exponent $p=p_{\mathrm{c}}(n)$ and a modulus of continuity $\mu(|u|)$. We derive a critical condition on the nonlinearity by proving a global in time existence result under the Dini condition on $\mu$ and a blow-up result when $\mu$ does not satisfy the Dini condition. Especially, in this latter case we determine new sharp estimates for the lifespan of local solutions, obtaining upper and lower bounds of the lifespan which coincide, except for some multiplicative constants. The proofs of the blow-up result and the upper bound estimates of the lifespan require an introduction of new test functions which allows to overcome some new difficulties due to the presence of both non-local differential operators and general nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>On the embedding of weighted Sobolev spaces with applications to a planar nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the embedding properties for the weighted Sobolev space $H^1_V(\mathbb{R}^N)$ into the Lebesgue weighted space $L^\tau_W(\mathbb{R}^N)$. Here $V$ and $W$ are diverging weight functions.
  The different behaviour of $V$ with respect to $W$ at infinity plays a crucial role. Particular attention is paid to the case $V=W$. This situation is very delicate since it depends strongly on the dimension and, in particular, $N=2$ is somewhat a limit case. As an application, an existence result for a planar nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in presence of coercive potentials is provided.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear discrete Schr\"odinger equations with a point defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $d$-dimensional discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with general power nonlinearity and a delta potential. Our interest lies in the interplay between two localization mechanisms. On the one hand, the attractive (repulsive) delta potential acting as a point defect breaks the translational invariance of the lattice so that a linear staggering (non-staggering) bound state is formed with negative (positive) energy. On the other hand, focusing nonlinearity may lead to self-trapping of excitation energy. For focusing nonlinearity we prove the existence of a spatially exponentially localized and time-periodic ground state and investigate the impact of an attractive respectively repulsive delta potential on the existence of an excitation threshold, i.e. supercritical $l^2$ norm, for the creation of such a ground states. Explicit expressions for the lower excitation thresholds are given. Reciprocally, we discuss the influence of defocusing nonlinearity on the durability of the linear bound states and provide upper thresholds of the $l^2-$norm for their preservation. Regarding the asymptotic behavior of the solutions we establish that for a $l^2-$norm below the excitation threshold the solutions scatter to a solution of the linear problem in $l^{p&gt;2}$.</description>

      <title>Motion of Islands of Elastic Thin Films in the Dewetting Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses a two-dimensional sharp interface variational model for solid-state dewetting of thin films with surface energies, introduced by Wang, Jiang, Bao, and Srolovitz in \cite{jiang2016solid}. Using the $H^{-1}$-gradient flow structure of the evolution law, short-time existence for a surface diffusion evolution equation with curvature regularization is established in the context of epitaxially strained two-dimensional films. The main novelty, as compared to the study of the wetting regime, is the presence of moving contact lines.</description>

      <title>The Stein-log-Sobolev inequality and the exponential rate of convergence for the continuous Stein variational gradient descent method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stein Variational Gradient Descent method is a variational inference method in statistics that has recently received a lot of attention. The method provides a deterministic approximation of the target distribution, by introducing a nonlocal interaction with a kernel. Despite the significant interest, the exponential rate of convergence for the continuous method has remained an open problem, due to the difficulty of establishing the related so-called Stein-log-Sobolev inequality. Here, we prove that the inequality is satisfied for each space dimension and every kernel whose Fourier transform has a quadratic decay at infinity and is locally bounded away from zero and infinity. Moreover, we construct weak solutions to the related PDE satisfying exponential rate of decay towards the equilibrium. The main novelty in our approach is to interpret the Stein-Fisher information, also called the squared Stein discrepancy, as a duality pairing between $H^{-1}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ and $H^{1}(\mathbb{R}^d)$, which allows us to employ the Fourier transform. We also provide several examples of kernels for which the Stein-log-Sobolev inequality fails, partially showing the necessity of our assumptions.</description>

      <title>Partial regularity and higher integrability for A-quasiconvex variational problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that minimizers of variational problems $$ \mbox{minimize}\quad \mathcal E(v)=\int_\Omega f(x,v(x))\mathrm{d} x\quad\text{for } \mathscr{A} v=0, $$
  are partially continuous provided that the integrands $f$ are strongly $\mathscr{A}$-quasiconvex in a suitable sense. We consider $p$-growth problems with $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, linear pde operators $\mathscr{A}$ of constant rank, and Dirichlet boundary conditions, in the sense that admissible fields are of the form $v=v_0+\varphi$, with $\mathscr{A}$-free $\varphi\in C_c^\infty(\Omega)$. Our analysis also covers the "potentials case" $$ \mbox{minimize}\quad \mathcal F(u)=\int_\Omega f(x,\mathscr{B} u(x))\mathrm{d} x\quad\text{for } u\in C_c^\infty(\Omega), $$ where $\mathscr{B}$ is a different linear pde operator of constant rank. We also prove appropriate higher integrability of minimizers for both types of problems.</description>

      <title>Critical threshold for weakly interacting log-correlated focusing Gibbs measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study log-correlated Gibbs measures on the $d$-dimensional torus with weakly interacting focusing quartic potentials whose coupling constants tend to $0$ as we remove regularization. In particular, we exhibit a phase transition for this model by identifying a critical threshold, separating the weakly and strongly coupling regimes; in the weakly coupling regime, we show that the frequency-truncated measures converge to the base Gaussian measure (possibly with a renormalized $L^2$-cutoff), whereas, in the strongly coupling regime, we prove non-convergence of the frequency-truncated measures, even up to a subsequence. Our result answers an open question posed by Brydges and Slade (1996).</description>

      <title>Some Korn-Hardy inequalities with power weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:1305.4262 Bousquet and Van Schaftingen derive a duality estimate for a certain class of canceling operators, and as an application prove new multidimensional Hardy inequalities. These methods were generalised by arXiv:1809.08485, arXiv:2012.00067 to cover Hardy-Sobolev inequalities and Stein-Weiss inequalities for cocanceling vector fields. We are motivated by these works to study Hardy-Sobolev inequalities with power weights, where the weight may grow towards infinity. These inequalities were previously inaccessible due to this growth. This note demonstrates a specific example of where the original duality estimate for canceling operators can be improved, and as an application prove Korn-Hardy inequality with power weights on \(\R^2\) with sub-quadratic growth at infinity.</description>

      <title>Complete translating solitons in Lorentzian products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obstructions to the existence of spacelike solitons depending on the growth of the mean curvature $H$ are proved for Lorentzian products $(M\times \mathbb{R}, \bar g=g_M-dt^2)$ with lowerly bounded curvature. The role of these bounds for both the completeness of the soliton $\Sigma$ and the applicability of the Omori-Yau principle for the drift Laplacian, is underlined. The differences between bounds in terms of the intrinsic distance $g$ of the soliton and the distance $g_M$ in the ambiance are analyzed, and lead to a revision of classic results on completeness for spacelike submanifolds. In particular, primary bounds, including affine $g$-bounds and logarithmic $g_M$-bounds, become enough to ensure both completeness and Omori-Yau's. Therefore, they become an obstruction to the existence of solitons when the ambiance Ricci is non-negative.
  These results, illustrated with a detailed example, deepen the uniqueness of solutions of elliptic equations which are not uniformly elliptic, providing insights into the interplay between mean curvature growth and the global properties of this geometric flow.</description>

      <title>Liouville theorems for parabolic systems with homogeneous nonlinearities and gradient structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.13723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liouville theorems for scaling invariant nonlinear parabolic equations and systems (saying that the equation or system does not possess nontrivial entire solutions) guarantee optimal universal estimates of solutions of related initial and initial-boundary value problems. Assume that $p&gt;1$ is subcritical in the Sobolev sense. In the case of nonnegative solutions and the system $$U_t-\Delta U=F(U)\quad\hbox{in}\quad {\mathbb R}^n\times{\mathbb R},$$ where $U=(u_1,\dots,u_N)$, $F=\nabla G$ is $p$-homogeneous and satisfies the positivity assumptions $G(U)&gt;0$ for $U\neq0$ and $\xi\cdot F(U)&gt;0$ for some $\xi\in{\mathbb R}^N$ and all $U\geq0$, $U\ne 0$, it has recently been shown in [P. Quittner, Duke Math. J. 170 (2021), 1113-1136] that the parabolic Liouville theorem is true whenever the corresponding elliptic Liouville theorem for the system $-\Delta U=F(U)$ is true. By modifying the arguments in that proof we show that the same result remains true without the positivity assumptions on $G$ and $F$, and that the class of solutions can also be enlarged to contain (some or all) sign-changing solutions. In particular, in the scalar case $N=1$ and $F(u)=|u|^{p-1}u$, our results cover the main result in [T. Bartsch, P. Polacik and P. Quittner, J. European Math. Soc. 13 (2011), 219-247]. We also prove a parabolic Liouville theorem for solutions in ${\mathbb R}^n_+\times{\mathbb R}$ satisfying homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on $\partial{\mathbb R}^n_+\times{\mathbb R}$ since such theorem is also needed if one wants to prove universal estimates of solutions of related systems in $\Omega\times(0,T)$, where $\Omega\subset{\mathbb R}^n$ is a smooth domain. Finally, we use our Liouville theorems to prove universal estimates for particular parabolic systems.</description>

Abstract: Based on the three-ball inequality and the doubling inequality established in [23], we quantify the strong unique continuation established by Koch and Tataru [21] for elliptic operators with unbounded lower-order coefficients. We also derive a uniform quantitative strong unique continuation for eigenfunctions that we use to prove that two Dirichlet-Laplace-Beltrami operators are gauge equivalent whenever their corresponding metrics coincide in the vicinity of the boundary and their boundary spectral data coincide on a subset of positive measure.</description>

      <title>Suppression of chemotactic singularity by buoyancy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemotactic singularity formation in the context of the Patlak-Keller-Segel equation is an extensively studied phenomenon. In recent years, it has been shown that the presence of fluid advection can arrest the singularity formation given that the fluid flow possesses mixing or diffusion enhancing properties and its amplitude is sufficiently strong - this effect is conjectured to hold for more general classes of nonlinear PDEs. In this paper, we consider the Patlak-Keller-Segel equation coupled with a fluid flow that obeys Darcy's law for incompressible porous media via buoyancy force. We prove that in contrast with passive advection, this active fluid coupling is capable of suppressing singularity formation at arbitrary small coupling strength: namely, the system always has globally regular solutions.</description>

      <title>Modified scattering for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with long-range potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the final state problem for the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a critical long-range nonlinearity and a long-range linear potential. Given a prescribed asymptotic profile which is different from the free evolution, we construct a unique global solution scattering to the profile. In particular, the existence of the modified wave operators is obtained for sufficiently localized small scattering data. The class of potential includes a repulsive long-range potential with a short-range perturbation, especially the positive Coulomb potential in two and three space dimensions. The asymptotic profile is constructed by combining Yafaev's type linear modifier [38] associated with the long-range part of the potential and the nonlinear modifier introduced by Ozawa [29]. Finally, we also show that one can replace Yafaev's type modifier by Dollard's type modifier under a slightly stronger decay assumption on the long-range potential. This is the first positive result on the modified scattering for the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation in the case when both of the nonlinear term and the linear potential are of long-range type.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions of mass supercritical Schrodinger-Poisson equation with potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07277v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the existence of normalized solutions $(\lambda,u)\subset (0,\infty)\times H^1(\mathbb{R}^3)$ to the following Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson equation $$ \begin{cases} -\Delta u+V(x)u+\lambda u+(|x|^{-1}\ast u^2)u=|u|^{p-2}u&amp;\text{in}\,\mathbb{R}^{3},\\ u&gt;0,\quad \int_{\mathbb{R}^{3}}u^2dx=a^2, \end{cases} $$ where $a&gt;0$ is fixed, $p\in(\frac{10}{3},6)$ is a given exponent and the potential $V$ satisfies some suitable conditions. Since the $L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)$-norm of $u$ is fixed, $\lambda$ appears as a Lagrange multiplier. For $V(x)\geq0$, our solutions are obtained by using a mountain-pass argument on bounded domains and a limit process introduced by Bartsch et al. For $V(x)\leq0$, we directly construct an entire mountain-pass solution with positive energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is composed of two parts. We prove in the first part the uniqueness of the determination of the unbounded zero-order coefficient in a parabolic equation from boundary measurements. The novelty of our result is that it covers the largest class of unbounded zero-order coefficients. We establish in the second part a logarithmic stability inequality for the problem of determining the initial condition from a single interior measurement. As by-product, we obtain an observability inequality for a parabolic equation with unbounded zero-order coefficient. The proof of this observability inequality is based on a new global quantitative unique continuation for the Schr\"odinger equation with unbounded potential. For the sake of completeness, we provide in Appendix A a full proof of this result.</description>

      <title>Radial symmetry of stationary and uniformly-rotating solutions to the 2D Euler equation in a disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the radial symmetry properties of stationary and uniformly rotating solutions of the 2D Euler equation in the unit disc, both in the smooth setting and the patch setting. In the patch setting, we prove that every uniformly rotating patch with angular velocity $\Omega\le 0$ or $\Omega \ge 1/2$ must be radial, where both bounds are sharp. The conclusion holds under the assumption that the rotating patch considered is disconnected, with its boundaries consisting of several Jordan curves. We also show that every uniformly rotating smooth solution $\omega_0$ must be radially symmetric if its angular velocity $\Omega\le \inf \omega_0/2$ or $\Omega\ge \sup \omega_0/2$. The proof is based on the symmetry properties of non-negative solutions to elliptic problems. A newly tailored approach is developed to address the symmetries of non-negative solutions to piecewise coupled semi-linear elliptic equations.</description>

Abstract: We develop a principal trace and generalized index formula for a Dirac-Schr\"odinger operator $D$ on open space of odd dimension $d\geq 3$ with a potential given by a family of self-adjoint unbounded operators acting on a infinite dimensional Hilbert space $H$. The presented results generalize formulas surrounding the Callias index theorem to to the case of unbounded operator potentials, for which the operator $D$ is not necessarily Fredholm. This is the principal novelty of this paper. As application, we include examples where the trace formula is used to calculate the Witten index of non-Fredholm massless $(d+1)$-Dirac-Schr\"odinger operators acting in $L^2\left(\mathbb{R}^{d+1},H\right)$.</description>

In this paper, we consider the so-called constant $Q$-curvature equation \[ \varepsilon^4\Delta_{g}^2 u -\varepsilon^2 b \Delta_{g} u +a u = u^{p} , \qquad \text{in } M, \quad u&gt;0, \quad u\in H^2_g(M) \] where $a,b$ are positive constants such that $b^2-4 a&gt;0$, $p$ is a sub-critical exponent $1&lt;p&lt;2^\#-1=\frac{n+4}{n-4}$, $\Delta_g$ denotes the Laplace-Beltrami operator and $\Delta_g^2:=\Delta_{g}(\Delta_{g})$ is the bilaplacian operator on $M$.
  We show that, if $\varepsilon&gt;0$ is small enough, then positive solutions to the above constant $Q$-curvature equation are generated by a maximum or minimum point of the function $\tau_g$, given by \[
  \tau_g(\xi):= \sum_{i, j=1}^{n} \frac{\partial^{2} g_{\xi}^{i i}}{\partial z_{j}^{2}}(0),
  \] where $g_{\xi}^{i j}$ denotes the components of the inverse of the metric $g$ in geodesic normal coordinates. This result shows that the geometry of $M$ plays a crucial role in finding solutions to the equation above and provides a metric of constant $Q$-curvature on a product manifold of the form $(M\times X, g+\varepsilon^2 h)$ where $(M,g)$ is flat and closed, and $(X,h)$ any $m$-dimensional Einstein Riemannian manifold, $m\geq 3$.</description>

Abstract: We consider convergence properties of the long-term behaviors with respect to the coefficient of the stochastic term for a nonautonomous stochastic $p$-Laplacian lattice equation with multiplicative noise. First, the upper semi-continuity of pullback random $(\ell^2,\ell^q)$-attractor is proved for each $q\in[1,+\infty)$. Then, a convergence result of the time-dependent invariant sample Borel probability measures is obtained in $\ell^2$. Next, we show that the invariant sample measures satisfy a stochastic Liouville type equation and a termwise convergence of the stochastic Liouville type equations is verified. Furthermore, each family of the invariant sample measures is turned out to be a sample statistical solution, which hence also fulfills a convergence consequence.</description>
