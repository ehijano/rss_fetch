      <title>What do Large Language Models know about materials?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in the fields of mechanical engineering and materials science. As models that establish connections through the interface of language, LLMs can be applied for step-wise reasoning through the Processing-Structure-Property-Performance chain of material science and engineering. Current LLMs are built for adequately representing a dataset, which is the most part of the accessible internet. However, the internet mostly contains non-scientific content. If LLMs should be applied for engineering purposes, it is valuable to investigate models for their intrinsic knowledge -- here: the capacity to generate correct information about materials. In the current work, for the example of the Periodic Table of Elements, we highlight the role of vocabulary and tokenization for the uniqueness of material fingerprints, and the LLMs' capabilities of generating factually correct output of different state-of-the-art open models. This leads to a material knowledge benchmark for an informed choice, for which steps in the PSPP chain LLMs are applicable, and where specialized models are required.</description>

      <title>Model of dark current in silicon-based barrier impurity band infrared detector devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark current in silicon-based blocked impurity band (BIB) infrared detectors has long been a critical limitation on device performance. This work proposes a chiral-phonon-assisted spin current model at interfaces to explain the parabolic-like dark current behavior observed at low bias voltages. Concurrently, the spatially-confined charge transport theory is employed to elucidate the dark current generation mechanism across the entire operational voltage range.</description>

Abstract: We bring attention to the fact that the claim of Brambilla et.al. [Extreme Mechanics Letters 74 (2025) 102267; arXiv:2406.14502] of discovering a novel design for pentamode materials is incorrect. Back in 2016 Briane, Harutyunyan and myself [Mathematics and Mechanics of Complex Systems 5 (2016) 41--94; arXiv:1606.03305] designed a class of stiff pentamodes, that include the high bulk modulus pentamodes of Brambilla et.al.</description>

      <title>An ultrasonic transducer for vibration mode conversion of wedge-shaped structure of acoustic black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15218v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic black hole (ABH) structure has been extensively employed in applications such as vibration mitigation, noise reduction, and energy harvesting, owing to its unique sound wave trapping and energy concentration effects. Furthermore, ABH structure shows significant promise in improving the performance of ultrasonic device and constructing multifunctional acoustic field. Therefore, this paper proposes an ultrasonic mode-conversion transducer consisting of a Langevin transducer and an ABH wedge radiant plate to investigate the potential applications of ABH in ultrasonic levitation and multifunctional particle manipulation. The theoretical model of flexural vibration of the radiant plate was established by utilizing Timoshenko beam theory and transfer matrix method, and the calculated vibration frequencies demonstrated good agreement with those obtained from finite element simulations (FES). The electrical impedance frequency response characteristics, vibration modes and the near-field sound pressure distribution of the transducer in air were also simulated. The results revealed that the amplitude of the ABH wedge radiant plate increases stepwise, and the sound pressure exhibits a gradient distribution. A prototype of the transducer was fabricated and experimentally tested, confirming the accuracy of FES and the feasibility of the design approach. Finally, the ultrasonic levitation experiment demonstrated that the ABH design enables the formation of gradient distribution of sound pressure in the standing wave sound field, thereby facilitating precise particle sorting.</description>

      <title>Improving 8x8 TeraFET array sensitivity through liquid-nitrogen cooling in a compact low-noise cryostat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sensitivity of antenna-coupled field-effect transistors (TeraFETs) to terahertz (THz) radiation has been shown to improve continuously with decreasing temperature. In this work, we first present a quantitative evaluation of the temperature-dependent noise-equivalent power (NEP) of recently developed patch-antenna-coupled TeraFET detectors resonant at 540 GHz, with measurements down to 20 K. Based on these results, we project NEP values approaching 1 to 2 pW/$\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ under efficient power coupling-comparable to state-of-the-art superconducting niobium transition-edge sensors (TESs) operated at 4 K. Building on these findings in the sub-1 THz range, a compact, low-noise, liquid-nitrogen-cooled (77 K) TeraFET power detection system for spectroscopy applications was realized. The system incorporates an 8$\times$8 pixel-binned detector array fabricated in a commercial 65 nm Si-CMOS process, optimized for operation in the 2.85- to 3.4 THz band, where fast, sensitive and spectrally specific detectors that do not require helium cooling remain scarce. Final system characterization was performed in the focal plane of a 2.85-THz quantum-cascade laser delivering approximately 2 mW of optical power. An experimental linear dynamic range exceeding 67 dB was achieved without saturation (for 1 Hz-detection bandwidth). The system provides a -3 dB detection bandwidth of 5 MHz vastly exceeding that of conventional thermal detectors (typically 1-kHz), thus potentially enabling advanced applications such as time-resolved THz spectroscopy down to the sub-$\mu$s scale. Combined with its broad temperature operability and compact design, the system is particularly well suited for space- and payload-constrained platforms such as balloon- and satellite-based missions, where deep cryogenic cooling is impractical.</description>

      <title>Hyperelastic nature of the Hoek-Brown criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a nonlinear elasto-plastic model, for which a specific class of hyperbolic elasticity arises as a straight consequence of the yield criterion invariance on the plasticity level. We superimpose this nonlinear elastic (or hyperelastic) behavior with plasticity obeying the associated flow rule. Interestingly, we find that a linear yield criterion on the thermodynamical force associated with plasticity results in a quadratic yield criterion in the stress space. This suggests a specific hyperelastic connection between Mohr-Coulomb and Hoek-Brown (or alternatively between Drucker-Prager and Pan-Hudson) yield criteria. We compare the elasto-plastic responses of standard tests for the Drucker-Prager yield criterion using either linear or the suggested hyperbolic elasticity. Notably, the nonlinear case stands out due to dilatancy saturation observed during cyclic loading in the triaxial compression test. We conclude this study with structural finite element simulations that clearly demonstrate the numerical applicability of the proposed model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14142v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A light guide is an essential part of many scintillator counters and light collection systems. Our main interest is a light guide for a thin wide scintillator which has high light transmission while converting the area of the light source to the shape of a photo-detector. We propose a variation of the light guide which avoids a 90$\rm ^o$ twist of the strips, reduces the length of the light pipe, and reduces the complexity of production. Detailed Monte Carlo simulation studies have been performed for a 3-strip S-shaped light-guide system.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Ionic Hardware Security Primitives: Embedding Data Protection at the Material Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Big Data revolution has heightened the demand for robust, energy-efficient security hardware capable of withstanding increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. Conventional encryption schemes, reliant on complex algorithms, are resource-intensive and remain vulnerable. To fortify sensitive information, society needs innovative anti-hacking and anti-counterfeiting technologies that exploit new materials and designs. Here, we present a magneto-ionic strategy for hardware-level security based on fully selective voltage-controlled N3- ion migration within pre-defined, initially paramagnetic FeCoN dots. This process generates ferromagnetic sublayers of tuneable thickness, resulting in either deterministic (single-domain or vortex) or probabilistic states (with coexisting magnetic configurations and voltage-adjustable probabilities), each exhibiting stochastic orientation and chirality, thereby providing a rich platform for magnetic fingerprinting. This approach enables self-protected primitives, including true random number generators, physical unclonable functions, and in-memory probabilistic inference. The resulting reconfigurable architecture combines tamper resistance, low energy consumption, and scalability, marking a significant leap toward next-generation hardware security rooted in emergent magnetic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Mitigating state transition errors during readout with a synchronized flux pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State transitions during qubit measurements are extremely detrimental to quantum tasks that rely on repeated measurements, such as quantum error correction. These state transitions can occur when excessive measurement power leads to qubit excitations outside its computational space. Alternatively, the qubit state can decay rapidly when the measurement protocol inadvertently couples the qubit to lossy modes such as two-level systems (TLSs). We experimentally verify the impact of these TLSs in qubit readout by measuring the transition errors at different qubit flux bias. Because such state transitions during measurements are often localized in frequency space, we demonstrate the ability to avoid them during a fluxonium readout by exploiting the qubit's flux-tunability. By synchronizing the flux bias with the readout photon dynamics, we obtain an optimal readout fidelity of 99 % (98.4 %) in 1 us (0.5 us) integration time. Our work advances the understanding of state transitions in superconducting circuit measurements and demonstrates the potential of fluxonium qubits to achieve fast high-fidelity readout.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependent Mechanical and Structural Properties of Uniaxially Strained Planar Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations in a planar graphene sheet, we investigate the temperature dependence of its mechanical behavior under uniaxial tensile stress applied either along the armchair or the zigzag direction. Stress-strain curves are calculated for different temperatures and the corresponding dependence of various elastic parameters, like the Young modulus, the third-order elastic modulus, the tensile strength and failure strain, is presented. Fracture stress and strain, as well as the Young modulus, decrease almost linearly with temperature. The distributions of bond lengths and bond angles at different strains and temperatures are also discussed and approximate analytical expressions are presented. The latter describe accurately the numerically obtained distributions.</description>

      <title>Ultralow-V{\pi}L Silicon Electro-Optic Directional Coupler Switch with a Liquid Crystal Cladding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An ultralow-V{\pi}L photonic switch device is demonstrated utilizing the high optical and electrical field confinement in silicon slot waveguides coupled with the strong electro-optic response of nematic liquid crystals. A silicon photonic directional coupler switch with a modulation efficiency of 0.0195 Vmm and a loss-efficiency product of 0.0624 VdB is achieved. The 1.5 mm long device is based on two-mode interference within a single slot waveguide resulting in a V{\pi} of 0.013 V and an extinction ratio of ~ 9dB at 1550 nm wavelength. The power consumption of the photonic switch is estimated to be below 0.6 nW and it possesses a response time of &lt;1.5 ms. A comparative performance study between the directional coupler switch and a Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) switch is performed. The directional coupler switch is projected to have a smaller footprint and lower optical loss compared to a similar design MZI switch making it a strong candidate for switch matrix designs and applications.</description>

Abstract: As artificial intelligence continues to push into real-time, edge-based and resource-constrained environments, there is an urgent need for novel, hardware-efficient computational models. In this study, we present and validate a neuromorphic computing architecture based on resonant-tunnelling diodes (RTDs), which exhibit the nonlinear characteristics ideal for physical reservoir computing (RC). We theoretically formulate and numerically implement an RTD-based RC system and demonstrate its effectiveness on two image recognition benchmarks: handwritten digit classification and object recognition using the Fruit~360 dataset. Our results show that this circuit-level architecture delivers promising performance while adhering to the principles of next-generation RC -- eliminating random connectivity in favour of a deterministic nonlinear transformation of input signals.</description>

      <title>Efficient ultrafast photoacoustic transduction on Tantalum thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nano-acoustic strain generation in thin metallic films via ultrafast laser excitation is widely used in material science, imaging and medical applications. Recently, it was shown that transition metals, such as Titanium, exhibit enhanced photoacoustic transduction properties compared to noble metals, such as Silver. This work presents experimental results and simulations that demonstrate that among transition metals Tantalum exhibits superior photoacoustic properties. Experiments of nano-acoustic strain generation by femtosecond laser pulses focused on thin Tantalum films deposited on Silicon substrates are presented. The nano-acoustic strains are measured via pump-probe transient reflectivity that captures the Brillouin oscillations produced by photon-phonon interactions. The observed Brillouin oscillations are correlated to the photoacoustic transduction efficiency of the Tantalum thin film and compared to the performance of Titanium thin films, clearly demonstrating the superior photoacoustic transduction efficiency of Tantalum. The findings are supported by computational results on the laser-induced strains and their propagation in these thin metal film/substrate systems using a Two-Temperature Model in combination with thermo-mechanical Finite Element Analysis. Finally, the role of the metal transducer-substrate acoustic impedance matching is discussed and the possibility to generate appropriately modulated acoustic pulse trains inside the crystalline substrate structures for the development of crystalline undulators used for {\gamma}-ray generation is presented.</description>

Abstract: Biological systems rely on ions and molecules as information carriers rather than electrons, motivating the development of devices that interface with biochemical systems for sensing, information processing, and actuation via spatiotemporal control of ions and molecules. Iontronics aims to achieve this vision by constructing devices composed of ion-conducting materials such as polyelectrolyte hydrogels, but advancing beyond simple single-stage circuit configurations that operate under steady-state conditions is a challenge. Here, we propose and model more complex ionic circuits, namely bistable flip-flop and ring oscillators, consisting of multiple ionic bipolar junction transistors (IBJTs). We begin by modeling and characterizing single IBJTs using both a simplified one-dimensional Nernst-Planck model and a more-detailed two-dimensional Poisson-Nernst-Planck model, elucidating the effects of geometry, size, and fixed charge on the IBJT performance and response time. The one- and two-dimensional models exhibit good agreement, indicating negligible transverse inhomogeneities. Additionally, these models show that reducing the base width improves current amplification, a behavior analogous to electronic BJTs. Building on this understanding, by using the IBJTs as voltage inverters and buffers, we design and model more complex ionic circuits that dynamically change their states in response to ionic signals. Specifically, we demonstrate that the ionic flip-flop retains one-bit memory and that the ring oscillator achieves autonomous periodic self-oscillation without an external clock. Our work provides a foundation for designing dynamic iontronic circuitry using ionic conductors, enabling biochemical signal processing and logic operations based on ionic transport.</description>

      <title>Anomalous size effects with fixed criticality in bistable flexible mechanical metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When the structure deformation is dominated by the low-energy deformation mode, the structure hardens with the increase in the size (number of units) at small sizes. This anomalous behavior will eventually disappear with the decay length of the finite structure converging to a size-independent characteristic quantity, but the specific critical point at which the anomalous behavior disappears still cannot be accurately and concisely described. Here, under two steady states of the bistable chain, we observed anomalous size effects with constant and oscillating criticality (the proportion of inhomogeneous deformation), two criticalities exactly separate the increasing and decreasing intervals of stiffness variation. They are interrelated due to the implied symmetries between the two steady states. On the other hand, they are distinguished because of the opposite superposition modes under the two steady states. Specifically, the constant criticality corresponds to the anomalous size effect achieved by the competition mechanism, while the oscillating criticality reveals an anomalous size effect achieved by the new mechanism (cancellation mechanism). In the anomalous size effect achieved by the cancellation mechanism, the singular characteristics generated by the completely cancelled deformation make it very robust. This robustness reflects in that the anomalous effect is no longer limited to linear small deformation, but it can still be observed stably in nonlinear large deformation. Our study reinterprets the anomalous size effect at a quantitative level, and the proposed cancellation mechanism expands the possible application range of this anomalous effect.</description>

      <title>Transversality-Enforced Tight-Binding Models for 3D Photonic Crystals aided by Topological Quantum Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tight-binding models can accurately replicate the band structure and topology of crystalline systems. They have been widely used in solid-state physics due to their versatility and low computational cost. It is straightforward to build an accurate tight-binding model of any crystalline system using the crystal's maximally localized Wannier functions as a basis. Unfortunately, in 3D photonic crystals, the transversality condition of Maxwell's equations precludes the construction of a basis of maximally localized Wannier functions via usual techniques. As a result, building reliable tight-binding models of 3D photonic crystals has not been straightforward up to now. In this work, we show how to overcome this problem using topological quantum chemistry, allowing us to express the band structure of the photonic crystal as a difference of band representations. This can be achieved by introducing a set of auxiliary modes, as recently proposed in Christensen et al., Phys. Rev. X 12, 021066 (2022), which regularizes the Gamma-point obstruction arising from the transversality constraint of Maxwell's equations. The decomposition into elementary band representations allows us to isolate a set of pseudo-orbitals that permit us to construct an accurate transversality-enforced tight-binding model that matches the dispersion, symmetry content, and topology of the 3D photonic crystal under study. Moreover, we show how to introduce the effects of a gyrotropic bias in the framework, modeled via non-minimal coupling to a static magnetic field. Our work provides the first systematic method to analytically model the photonic bands of the lowest transverse modes over the entire Brillouin zone via a transversality-enforced tight-binding model.</description>

      <title>Tuning of Josephson junctions -- the effects of depinning physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building more powerful quantum computers requires manufacturing processes with tight tolerances. To improve the tolerances on Josephson junctions, techniques to fine tune their properties after fabrication have been developed. Understanding how tuning techniques may physically modify the tunnel barrier of a Josephson junction is important and will enable these techniques to be optimised. We develop a model of junction tuning based on depinning theory to interpret a phase diagram of tuning rate. We extract the dependence on temperature, time-varying voltages and oscillation frequency. Using depinning theory we are able to show both why time-varying annealing potentials result in controlled junction tuning and how such protocols can be optimised. We examine how tuning changes the electrical breakdown of barriers and discrepancies between modeled and measured higher energy levels of transmon qubits.</description>

      <title>Layered Topological Antiferromagnetic Metal at Room Temperature -- YbMn$_2$Ge$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metallic antiferromagnets are essential for efficient spintronic applications due to their fast switching and high mobility, yet room-temperature metallic antiferromagnets are rare. Here, we investigate YbMn$_2$Ge$_2$, a room temperature antiferromagnet, and establish it as an exfoliable layered metal with altermagnetic surface states. Using multi-orbital Hubbard model calculations, we reveal that its robust metallic AFM ordering is stabilized by electronic correlations and a partially nested Fermi surface. Furthermore, we show that YbMn$_2$Ge$_2$ hosts symmetry-protected topological Dirac crossings, connecting unique even-order spin-polarized surface states with parabolic and inverted Mexican-hat-like dispersion. Our findings position YbMn$_2$Ge$_2$ as a promising platform for exploring the interplay of correlation, topology, and surface altermagnetism of layered antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Wettability and sp2/sp3 ratio effects on supercapacitor performance of N-doped hydrogenated amorphous Carbon Nanofoam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13264v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsed laser-deposited amorphous carbon nanofoams are potential candidate for electrochemical energy storage applications due to ultra-light weight, large volumetric void fractions, and co-existence of sp, sp2 and sp3 carbon hybridization. It is known that charge storage in carbon nanostructures containing disordered sp2-domains is determined by their wettability, surface area, and porosity. However, their charge-storage performance is limited to the areal capacitance of the order of a few mF/cm2. We enhanced the supercapacitor performance of nitrogen-doped amorphous carbon nanofoam by engineering its wettability and sp2-C/sp3-C ratio by vacuum annealing. The specific capacitance was enhanced by about fifty times and the device voltage increased from 0.8 to 1.1 V compared to as-grown carbon nanofoam. In addition, we examined for the first time the initial increase in specific capacitance of the aqueous symmetric supercapacitor with respect to the scan rate, employing in-situ measurements coupling Raman spectroscopy and electrochemistry. We attribute this effect, observed but generally not explained in previous works in the literature, to the electrochemical activation induced by structural changes during the charge storage performance. This optimization of pulsed laser deposited carbon nanofoam may open an avenue for fabricating lightweight and porous nanostructures for advanced macro-to-micro-supercapacitor devices.</description>

      <title>Picogram-Level Nanoplastic Analysis with Nanoelectromechanical System Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy: NEMS-FTIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a photothermal infrared spectroscopy-based approach for the chemical characterization and quantification of nanoplastics. By combining the high sensitivity of nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) with the wide spectral range and ubiquity of commercially available Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometers, NEMS-FTIR offers a cost-efficient and cryogen-free option for the rapid, routine analysis of nanoplastics in aqueous samples. Polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride nanoplastics with nominal diameters ranging from 54 to 262 nm were analyzed by NEMS-FTIR with limits of detection ranging from 102 pg to 355 pg. The absorptance measured by NEMS-FTIR could be further converted to absolute sample mass using the attenuation coefficient, as demonstrated for polystyrene. Thanks to the wide spectral range of NEMS-FTIR, nanoplastic particles from different polymers could be readily identified, even when present in a mixture. The potential of NEMS-FTIR for the analysis of real samples was demonstrated by identifying the presence of nanoplastics released in water during tea brewing. Polyamide leachates were identified in the brewing water without sample pre-concentration. Accelerated aging of the tea bags under elevated temperature and UV radiation showed further release of polyamide over time.</description>

      <title>Atomic layer deposition on particulate materials from 1988 through 2023: A quantitative review of technologies, materials and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is widely studied for numerous applications and is commercially employed in the semiconductor industry, where planar substrates are the norm. However, the inherent ALD feature of coating virtually any surface geometry with atomistic thickness control is equally attractive for coating particulate materials (supports). In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the developments in this decades-old field of ALD on particulate materials, drawing on a bottom-up and quantitative analysis of 799 articles from this field. The obtained dataset is the basis for abstractions regarding reactor types (specifically for particles), coating materials, reactants, supports and processing conditions. Furthermore, the dataset enables direct access to specific processing conditions (for a given material, surface functionality, application etc.) and increases accessibility of the respective literature. We also review fundamental concepts of ALD on particles, and discuss the most common applications, i.e., catalysis (thermo-, electro-, photo-), batteries, luminescent phosphors and healthcare. Finally, we identify historical trends, and provide an outlook on prospective developments.</description>
