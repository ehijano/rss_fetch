      <title>Infinite dimensional symmetric cones and gauge-reversing maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The famous Koecher-Vinberg theorem characterises the finite dimensional formally real Jordan algebras among the finite dimensional order unit spaces as the ones that have a symmetric cone. An alternative characterisation of symmetric cones was obtained by Walsh who showed that the symmetric cones correspond exactly to the finite dimensional order unit spaces for which there exists a gauge-reversing map from the interior of the cone to itself. In this paper we prove an infinite dimensional version of this characterisation of symmetric cones.</description>

      <title>The $S$-resolvent estimates for the Dirac operator on hyperbolic and spherical spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This seminal paper marks the beginning of our investigation into on the spectral theory based on $S$-spectrum applied to the Dirac operator on manifolds. Specifically, we examine in detail the cases of the Dirac operator $\mathcal{D}_H$ on hyperbolic space and the Dirac operator $\mathcal{D}_S$ on the spherical space, where these operators, and their squares $\mathcal{D}_H^2$ and $\mathcal{D}_S^2$, can be written in a very explicit form. This fact is very important for the application of the spectral theory on the $S$-spectrum. In fact, let $T$ denote a (right) linear Clifford operator, the $S$-spectrum is associated with a second-order polynomial in the operator $T$, specifically the operator defined as $
Q_s(T) := T^2 - 2s_0T + |s|^2. $
This allows us to associate to the Dirac operator boundary conditions that can be of Dirichlet type but also of Robin-like type. Moreover, our theory is not limited to Hilbert modules; it is applicable to Banach modules as well. The spectral theory based on the $S$-spectrum has gained increasing attention in recent years, particularly as it aims to provide quaternionic quantum mechanics with a solid mathematical foundation from the perspective of spectral theory. This theory was extended to Clifford operators, and more recently, the spectral theorem has been adapted to this broader context. The $S$-spectrum is crucial for defining the so-called $S$-functional calculus for quaternionic and Clifford operators in various forms. This includes bounded as well as unbounded operators, where suitable estimates of sectorial and bi-sectorial type for the $S$-resolvent operator are essential for the convergence of the Dunford integrals in this setting.</description>

      <title>A Battle-Lemari\'e Frame Characterization of Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a spline frame generated by oversampling against the well-known Battle-Lemari\'e wavelet system of nonnegative integer order, $n$. We establish a characterization of the Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin (quasi-) norms for the smoothness parameter up to $s &lt; n+1$, which includes values of $s$ where the Battle-Lemari\'e system no longer provides an unconditional basis; we, additionally, prove a result for the endpoint case $s=n+1$. This builds off of earlier work by G. Garrig\'os, A. Seeger, and T. Ullrich, where they proved the case $n=0$, i.e. that of the Haar wavelet, and work of R. Srivastava, where she gave a necessary range for the Battle-Lemari\'e system to give an unconditional basis of the Triebel-Lizorkin spaces.</description>

      <title>Direct Sum of Lower Semi-Frames in Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, structural properties of lower semi-frames in separable Hilbert spaces are explored with a focus on transformations under linear operators (may be unbounded). Also, the direct sum of lower semi-frames, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for the preservation of lower semi-frame structure, is examined.</description>

      <title>A note on traces for the Heisenberg calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous work, we gave a local formula for the index of Heisenberg elliptic operators on contact manifolds. We constructed a cocycle in periodic cyclic cohomology which, when paired with the Connes-Chern character of the principal Heisenberg symbol, calculates the index. A crucial ingredient of our index formula was a new trace on the algebra of Heisenberg pseudodifferential operators. The construction of this trace was rather involved. In the present paper, we clarify the nature of this trace.</description>

      <title>On a complex-analytic approach to stationary measures on $S^1$ with respect to the action of $PSU(1,1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a complex-analytic approach to the classification of stationary probability measures on $S^1$ with respect to the action of $PSU(1,1)$ on the unit circle via M\"{o}bius transformations by studying their Cauchy transforms from the perspective of generalized analytic continuation. We improve upon results of Bourgain and present a complete characterization of Furstenberg measures for Fuchsian groups of first kind via the Brown-Shields-Zeller theorem.</description>

      <title>Strict comparison in reduced group $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for every $n\geq 2$, the reduced group $C^*$-algebras of the countable free groups $C^*_r(\mathbb{F}_n)$ have strict comparison. Our method works in a general setting: for $G$ in a large family of non-amenable groups, including hyperbolic groups, free products, mapping class groups, right-angled Artin groups etc., we have $C^*_r(G)$ have strict comparison. This work also has several applications in the theory of $C^*$-algebras including: resolving Leonel Robert's selflessness problem for $C^*_r(G)$; uniqueness of embeddings of the Jiang-Su algebra $\mathcal{Z}$ up to approximate unitary equivalence into $C^*_r(G)$; full computations of the Cuntz semigroup of $C^*_r(G)$ and future directions in the $C^*$-classification program.</description>

      <title>Error bounds for composite quantum hypothesis testing and a new characterization of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13379v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimal error exponents of binary composite i.i.d. state discrimination are trivially bounded by the worst-case pairwise exponents of discriminating individual elements of the sets representing the two hypotheses, and in the finite-dimensional classical case, these bounds in fact give exact single-copy expressions for the error exponents. In contrast, in the non-commutative case, the optimal exponents are only known to be expressible in terms of regularized divergences, resulting in formulas that, while conceptually relevant, practically not very useful. In this paper, we develop further an approach initiated in [Mosonyi, Szil\'agyi, Weiner, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 68(2):1032--1067, 2022] to give improved single-copy bounds on the error exponents by comparing not only individual states from the two hypotheses, but also various unnormalized positive semi-definite operators associated to them. Here, we show a number of equivalent characterizations of such operators giving valid bounds, and show that in the commutative case, considering weighted geometric means of the states, and in the case of two states per hypothesis, considering weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means, are optimal for this approach. As a result, we give a new characterization of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means as the only $2$-variable operator geometric means that are block additive, tensor multiplicative, and satisfy the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality. We also extend our results to composite quantum channel discrimination, and show an analogous optimality property of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means of two quantum channels, a notion that seems to be new. We extend this concept to defining the notion of superoperator perspective function and establish some of its basic properties, which may be of independent interest.</description>
