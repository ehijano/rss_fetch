      <title>Effective Two-Stage Double Auction for Dynamic Resource Trading in Edge Networks via Overbooking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To facilitate responsive and cost-effective computing resource scheduling and service delivery over edge-assisted mobile networks, this paper investigates a novel two-stage double auction methodology via utilizing an interesting idea of resource overbooking to overcome dynamic and uncertain nature from edge servers (sellers) and demand from mobile devices (as buyers). The proposed auction integrates multiple essential factors such as social welfare maximization and decision-making latency (e.g., the time for determining winning seller-buyer pairs) reduction, by introducing a stagewise strategy: an overbooking-driven pre-double auction (OPDAuction) for determining long-term cooperations between sellers and buyers before practical resource transactions as Stage I, and a real-time backup double auction (RBDAuction) for handling residual resource demands during actual transactions. In particular, by applying a proper overbooking rate, OPDAuction helps with facilitating trading contracts between appropriate sellers and buyers as guidance for future transactions, by allowing the booked resources to exceed supply. Then, since pre-auctions may cause risks, our RBDAuction adjusts to real-time market changes, further enhancing the overall social welfare. More importantly, we offer an interesting view to show that our proposed two-stage auction can support significant design properties such as truthfulness, individual rationality, and budget balance. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate good performance in social welfare, time efficiency, and computational scalability, outstripping conventional methods in dynamic edge computing settings.</description>

      <title>Approximately EFX and PO Allocations for Bivalued Chores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the computation for allocations of indivisible chores that are approximately EFX and Pareto optimal (PO). Recently, Garg et al. (2024) show the existence of $3$-EFX and PO allocations for bi-valued instances, where the cost of an item to an agent is either $1$ or $k$ (where $k &gt; 1$) by rounding the (fractional) earning restricted equilibrium. In this work, we improve the approximation ratio to $(2-1/k)$, while preserving the Pareto optimality. Instead of rounding fractional equilibrium, our algorithm starts with the integral EF1 equilibrium for bi-valued chores, introduced by Garg et al. (AAAI 2022) and Wu et al. (EC 2023), and reallocates items until approximate EFX is achieved. We further improve our result for the case when $k=2$ and devise an algorithm that computes EFX and PO allocations.</description>

      <title>HIVEX: A High-Impact Environment Suite for Multi-Agent Research (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Games have been vital test beds for the rapid development of Agent-based research. Remarkable progress has been achieved in the past, but it is unclear if the findings equip for real-world problems. While pressure grows, some of the most critical ecological challenges can find mitigation and prevention solutions through technology and its applications. Most real-world domains include multi-agent scenarios and require machine-machine and human-machine collaboration. Open-source environments have not advanced and are often toy scenarios, too abstract or not suitable for multi-agent research. By mimicking real-world problems and increasing the complexity of environments, we hope to advance state-of-the-art multi-agent research and inspire researchers to work on immediate real-world problems. Here, we present HIVEX, an environment suite to benchmark multi-agent research focusing on ecological challenges. HIVEX includes the following environments: Wind Farm Control, Wildfire Resource Management, Drone-Based Reforestation, Ocean Plastic Collection, and Aerial Wildfire Suppression. We provide environments, training examples, and baselines for the main and sub-tasks. All trained models resulting from the experiments of this work are hosted on Hugging Face. We also provide a leaderboard on Hugging Face and encourage the community to submit models trained on our environment suite.</description>

      <title>Unattainability of Common Knowledge in Asymmetric Games with Imperfect Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a conceptual model game to examine the dynamics of asymmetric interactions in games with imperfect information. The game involves two agents with starkly contrasting capabilities: one agent can take actions but has no information of the state of the game, whereas the other agent has perfect information of the state but cannot act or observe the other agent's actions. This duality manifests an extreme form of asymmetry, and how differing abilities influence the possibility of attaining common knowledge. Using Kripke structures and epistemic logic we demonstrate that, under these conditions, common knowledge of the current game state becomes unattainable. Our findings advance the discussion on the strategic limitations of knowledge in environments where information and action are unevenly distributed.</description>

      <title>Gains-from-Trade in Bilateral Trade with a Broker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study bilateral trade with a broker, where a buyer and seller interact exclusively through the broker. The broker strategically maximizes her payoff through arbitrage by trading with the buyer and seller at different prices. We study whether the presence of the broker interferes with the mechanism's gains-from-trade (GFT) achieving a constant-factor approximation to the first-best gains-from-trade (FB).
  We first show that the GFT achieves a $1 / 36$-approximation to the FB even if the broker runs an optimal posted-pricing mechanism under symmetric agents with monotone-hazard-rate distributions. Beyond posted-pricing mechanisms, even if the broker uses an arbitrary incentive-compatible (IC) and individually-rational (IR) mechanism that maximizes her expected profit, we prove that it induces a $1 / 2$-approximation to the first-best GFT when the buyer and seller's distributions are uniform distributions with arbitrary support. This bound is shown to be tight.
  We complement such results by proving that if the broker uses an arbitrary profit-maximizing IC and IR mechanism, there exists a family of problem instances under which the approximation factor to the first-best GFT becomes arbitrarily bad. We show that this phenomenon persists even if we restrict one of the buyer's or seller's distributions to have a singleton support, or even in the symmetric setting where the buyer and seller have identical distributions.</description>

      <title>Improving Community-Participated Patrol for Anti-Poaching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community engagement plays a critical role in anti-poaching efforts, yet existing mathematical models aimed at enhancing this engagement often overlook direct participation by community members as alternative patrollers. Unlike professional rangers, community members typically lack flexibility and experience, resulting in new challenges in optimizing patrol resource allocation. To address this gap, we propose a novel game-theoretic model for community-participated patrol, where a conservation agency strategically deploys both professional rangers and community members to safeguard wildlife against a best-responding poacher. In addition to a mixed-integer linear program formulation, we introduce a Two-Dimensional Binary Search algorithm and a novel Hybrid Waterfilling algorithm to efficiently solve the game in polynomial time. Through extensive experiments and a detailed case study focused on a protected tiger habitat in Northeast China, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms and the practical applicability of our model.</description>

      <title>Parrondo's effects with aperiodic protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the effectiveness of employing archetypal aperiodic sequencing -- namely Fibonacci, Thue-Morse, and Rudin-Shapiro -- on the Parrondian effect. From a capital gain perspective, our results show that these series do yield a Parrondo's Paradox with the Thue-Morse based strategy outperforming not only the other two aperiodic strategies but benchmark Parrondian games with random and periodical ($AABBAABB\ldots$) switching as well. The least performing of the three aperiodic strategies is the Rudin-Shapiro. To elucidate the underlying causes of these results, we analyze the cross-correlation between the capital generated by the switching protocols and that of the isolated losing games. This analysis reveals that a strong anticorrelation with both isolated games is typically required to achieve a robust manifestation of Parrondo's effect. We also study the influence of the sequencing on the capital using the lacunarity and persistence measures. In general, we observe that the switching protocols tend to become less performing in terms of the capital as one increases the persistence and thus approaches the features of an isolated losing game. For the (log-)lacunarity, a property related to heterogeneity, we notice that for small persistence (less than 0.5) the performance increases with the lacunarity with a maximum around 0.4. In respect of this, our work shows that the optimization of a switching protocol is strongly dependent on a fine-tuning between persistence and heterogeneity.</description>
