      <title>Rubber Friction: Theory, Mechanisms, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rubber friction is of major practical importance in applications such as tires, rubber seals, and footwear. This review article focuses on the theory and experimental studies of rubber friction on substrates with random roughness. We examine both steady sliding and accelerated motion, with particular attention to the origins of the breakloose friction force and the influence of pre-slip, elasticity, and flash temperature on friction dynamics. We further discuss rolling friction for cylinders and spheres, as well as sliding friction for triangular sliders on dry and lubricated rubber surfaces. Theoretical predictions are compared with experimental results obtained using different materials, geometries, and environmental conditions, highlighting the importance of accounting for multiscale roughness. Open challenges, such as the role of adhesion enhancement, energy dissipation due to crack opening, and the physical origin of the short-distance roughness cut-off, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Continuous and discontinuous shape transitions in the spatial distribution of self-propelling particles in power-law potential wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stationary states of an active Brownian particle and run-and-tumble particle in a two dimensional power-law potential well, in the limit where translational diffusion is negligible. The potential energy of the particle is taken to have the form $U(r)\propto r^{n}$, where $n\geq 2$ and even. We derive an exact equation for the positional probability distribution $\phi({\bf r})$ in two dimensions, and solve for the same, under the assumption that the particle's orientation angle is a Gaussian variable. We show that $\phi({\bf r})$ has compact support and undergoes a phase transition-like change in shape as the active velocity increases. For active Brownian particle, our theory predicts a continuous transition in shape for $n=2$ and a discontinuous transition for $n&gt;2$, both of which agree with simulation results. In the strongly active regime, the orientational probability distribution is unimodal near the outer boundary but becomes bimodal towards the interior, signifying orbiting motion. The unimodal-bimodal transition in the angular distribution is nearly absent for run-and-tumble particle.</description>

      <title>Micromechanics of compressive and tensile forces in partially-bonded granular materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In granular media, the presence of even small amounts of interparticle cohesion manifests as an increase in the bulk strength and stiffness, effects that are typically associated with an increase in the average number of constraints per particle. By performing an ensemble of isotropic compression experiments, all starting from the same initial particle configuration but with varying fraction of bonded particles, we use photoelastic force measurements to identify the causes of this phenomenon at the particle-scale and meso-scale. As a function of the percentage of bonded particles, we measure a small decrease in the critical packing fraction at which jamming occurs. Above jamming, the local pressure increases predominantly for the bonded particles, measured relative to the unbonded case, through approximately equal contributions of both tensile and compressive forces. Histograms of the magnitude of the interparticle forces become broader for systems with more bonded particles. We measure both pressure and coordination number as a function of distance from a bonded dimer, both of which are locally enhanced for nearest neighbors, indicating that dimers appear to act as areas of concentrated force and connectivity that improve rigidity.</description>

      <title>Shape-dependent direction reversal in anisotropic catalytic microswimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propulsion direction of active particles is a key feature in self-propelled systems and depends on the propulsion mechanism and environmental conditions. Here, using 3D micro-printed catalytically active particles, we experimentally show that the propulsion direction can change with increasing fuel concentration when the active particle possesses an anisotropic shape. We find that discs, tori, and bent rods reverse their direction of motion with increasing hydrogen peroxide concentration--moving with their inert side forward at low concentrations and with their catalytic side forward at high concentrations. In contrast, spheres and straight rods do not exhibit this reversal. We observe that direction reversal is independent of the base material composition of the swimmer and its size, and only occurs for anisotropic particles where, due to their elongated shape, the location of the solute concentration maximum is unstable and can be shifted by substrate-induced confinements. Our measurements suggest that in addition a change in the platinum-catalyzed reaction of hydrogen peroxide occurs, to which particles with elongated shapes that induce sufficient confinement are more sensitive.</description>

      <title>Controlling Topological Defects in Polar Fluids via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological defects in active polar fluids exhibit complex dynamics driven by internally generated stresses, reflecting the deep interplay between topology, flow, and non-equilibrium hydrodynamics. Feedback control offers a powerful means to guide such systems, enabling transitions between dynamic states. We investigated closed-loop steering of integer-charged defects in a confined active fluid by modulating the spatial profile of activity. Using a continuum hydrodynamic model, we show that localized control of active stress induces flow fields that can reposition and direct defects along prescribed trajectories by exploiting non-linear couplings in the system. A reinforcement learning framework is used to discover effective control strategies that produce robust defect transport across both trained and novel trajectories. The results highlight how AI agents can learn the underlying dynamics and spatially structure activity to manipulate topological excitations, offering insights into the controllability of active matter and the design of adaptive, self-organized materials.</description>

      <title>Liquid crystal based tailoring of strong coupling in \ch{WS2} metasurfaces: towards reconfigurable quantum photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong light-matter interactions in 2D materials have garnered significant interest for their potential in nonlinear optics and quantum photonics. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), with their robust excitonic responses, serve as promising materials for exploring these interactions. Importantly, tailoring such strong coupling giving rise to tunable quantum and non-linear emissions are under explored. In this study, we propose a novel approach that employs liquid crystals (LCs) as a tunable medium to modulate the strong coupling between TMDC excitons and photonic modes and hence gives rise to tunable quantum emissions. LCs offer high birefringence and anisotropic optical properties, which can be dynamically tuned using external stimuli such as electric fields or temperature variations. By embedding TMDCs within an LC environment and coupling them to photonic quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BIC), we demonstrate precise control over the exciton-photon interactions. The orientation of the LCs, governed by applied external fields, directly influences the coupling strength, enabling real-time modulation of exciton-polariton states and Rabi-splitting. Our system exhibits Rabi splitting energy of 182.5 MeV in air, and 139, 153.7, and 131 meV under different LC orientations. Additionally second order autocorrelation function calculated at zero delay yields \( g^{(2)}(0) = 0.89 \), demonstrating photon anti-bunching, confirming the quantum nature of emission. Our findings establish a versatile platform where TMDCs and LCs synergistically enable electrically controllable strong coupling, offering a scalable and responsive architecture for next-generation quantum photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in voting simulated by an intelligent Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voting is an important social activity for expressing public opinions. By conceptually considering a group of voting agents to be intelligent matter, the impact of real-time information on voting results is quantitatively studied by an intelligent Ising model, which is formed by adding nonlinear instantaneous feedback of the overall magnetization to the conventional Ising model. In the new model, the interaction strength becomes a variable depending on the total magnetization rather than a constant, which mimics the scenario that the decision of an individual during vote influenced by the dynamically changing polling result during the election process. Our analytical derivations along with Mote Carlo simulations reveal that, with a positive feedback, the intelligent Ising model exhibits phase transitions at any finite temperatures, a feature lacked in the conventional one-dimensional Ising model. In all dimensions, by varying the feedback strength, the system changes from going through a second-order phase transition to going through a first-order phase transition with increasing temperature, and the two types of phase transitions are connected by a tricritical point. This study on the one hand demonstrates that the intelligent matter with a nonlinear adaptive interaction can exhibit qualitatively different phase behaviors from conventional matter, and on the other hand shows that, during voting, even unbiased feedback may possibly induce spontaneous symmetry breaking, leading to a biased outcome where one side of the vote becomes favored.</description>

      <title>Time-energy tradeoff in stochastic resetting using optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19387v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic resetting is a driving mechanism that is known to minimize the first passage time to reach a target, at the cost of energy expenditure. The choice of the physical implementation of each resetting event determines the tradeoff between the acceleration of the search process and its energetic cost. Here, we present an optimal transport protocol that balances the duration and the energetic cost of each resetting event. This protocol drives a harmonically trapped Brownian particle between two equilibrium states within a finite time and with minimal energetic cost. An explicit comparison with other types of finite-time protocols further shows its specific thermodynamic properties. Its cost is both a lower bound on the cost of unoptimized shortcut protocols and an upper bound on the cost of optimal protocols which do not ensure final equilibrium. When applying the optimal transport protocol to implement stochastic resetting, a single lower time-energy bound is reached: this protocol allows to reach the best tradeoff between energetic cost and search time.</description>

      <title>Theoretical correction methods for optical tweezers: Acquisition of potentials of mean forces between colloidal particles in a bulk and on a surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.10722v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that line optical tweezers (LOT) can measure potential of mean force (PMF) between colloidal particles in the bulk. However, PMF obtained with LOT is empirically modified before showing the result of the final form in order to correct the potential rise at long distances. In the present letter, we derive theoretical correction methods for acquisition of PMF by using statistical mechanics. Using the new methods, PMF can be obtained without the empirical fitting equation. Through the new methods, external potential acting on the trapped two colloidal particles induced by LOT can also be obtained. As an additional study, we explain two methods for obtaining PMF between colloidal particles on a substrate surface, in which a normal single optical tweezers with a fixed focal point is used, and for obtaining PMF between colloidal particles trapped by dual-beam optical tweezers in the bulk. These methods can also obtain the external potential acting on the trapped two colloidal particles.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium distribution of the liquid phase in an unsaturated granular material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an unsaturated granular material, the spatial distribution of the liquid phase results from the competition between gravity and capillary forces. We show that, in the funicular regime, it can be described by a Boltzmann law, with static disorder playing the role of thermal agitation. We propose an approach based on a Langevin equation to derive this distribution, and compare our predictions with conductivity measurements giving the local water content as a function of height in a wet granular medium. We show that experimental data obtained with samples of different polydispersities collapse on a single master curve consistent with our model.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Inverse Design of Metasurfaces for Tailored Narrow Band Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inverse design of metasurfaces poses a considerable challenge because of the intricate interdependencies that exist between structural characteristics and electromagnetic responses. Traditional optimization methods require significant computational resources and frequently do not produce the most effective solutions. This study presents a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning approach known as Latent Style-based Quantum GAN (LaSt-QGAN). This method integrates a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) to enhance the optimization of metasurface designs aimed at achieving narrow-band absorption and unidirectionality. The proposed method results in a reduction of training time by 10X and a decrease in data requirements by 40X when compared to traditional GAN-based approaches. The produced metasurface designs demonstrate a high fidelity in relation to the target absorption spectra compared to the classical GAN based methods. Additionally, the integration of a material look-up table facilitates manufacturability by allowing for the substitution of predicted material properties with viable alternatives, all while preserving performance accuracy. Moreover the model is able to generate Q-factor upto the order of $10^4$, while the training dataset has Q-factor upto the order of $10^3$.</description>
