      <title>Analysis of $(3+1)D$ and $(2+1)D$ nonlinear ultrasonic waves using conformal invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization and classification of scattered nonlinear ultrasonic signatures in 2 dimensional complex damaged media using Time Reversal based Nonlinear Elastic Wave Spectroscopy (TR-NEWS) approach is extended to 3 dimensional complex damaged media. In (2+1)D, i.e. space 2 dimensional time 1 dimensional spacetime, we used quaternion bases for analyses, while in (3+1)D, we use biquaternion bases.
  The optimal weight function of the path of ultrasonic wave in (3+1)D lattice is obtained by using the Echo State Network (ESN) which is a Machine Learning technique. The hysteresis effect is incorporated by using the Preisach-Mayergoyz model.
  We analyze the spectrum data of Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) sample obtained by Quaternion Excitation Symmetry Analysis Method (QESAM) using the conformally invariant quantum mechanical variables of de Alfaro-Fubini-Furlan and their supersymmetrically extended variables of Fubini-Rabinovici.</description>

      <title>Engineering of self-bending surface plasmon polaritons through Hermite-Gaussian mode expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface plasmon polaritons have received much attention over the last decades in fields such as photonics or nanotechnology due to their inherent high sensitivity to metal surface variations (e.g., presence of adsorbates or changes in the roughness). Because of this important property, it is expected that they will find promising major applications in widely cross-disciplinary areas ranging from material science to medicine. Motivated by this ever-growing interest, here we introduce a novel theoretical framework suitable to design new types of structured paraxial surface plasmon beams and to control their propagation along the interface between a dielectric and a lossy metal. This is possible by virtue of a convenient Hermite-Gaussian mode expansion, which constitutes a complete basis set upon which new types of structured paraxial plasmon beams can be generated. The beams obtained from this method present a rather peculiar feature, as they exhibit local intensity maxima at different propagation distances. This way of creating tightly confined structured light allows us control where to place the beam energy. This, thus, opens up worth exploring pathways to manipulate light propagation along metal surfaces at the nanoscale. As a proof-of-concept, we provide numerical evidence of the feasibility of the method by considering the analysis of the propagation of Airy-based surface plasmon polaritons along an air-silver interface.</description>

      <title>Self-accelerating Topological Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both linear and nonlinear self-accelerating valley Hall edge states are predicted in the composited inversion-symmetry-broken photonic graphene lattice with a domain wall. The linear one that is obtained by superimposing a finite-energy Airy envelope to the valley Hall edge state shows self-accelerating, non-diffracting and self-healing properties, with the accelerating trajectory not exactly a parabola. For the nonlinear one which exhibits well self-accelerating and non-diffracting properties that may turn over the moving direction of the valley Hall edge state, it is constructed by superimposing the self-trapped self-accelerating envelope that is obtained from the envelope equation to the valley Hall edge state. The nonlinear self-accelerating valley Hall edge state can circumvent sharp corners without back-scattering, but it is impossible to completely prohibit radiating into the bulk because the topological protection and the self-accelerating demand contrary length of the oscillating tail. The results exhibit the possibility on manipulating topological edge states via self-accelerating waves, and pave the way for the self-accelerating topological photonics.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Quantum Optics and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in quantum optics and squeezed light generation have revolutionized various fields of quantum science over the past three decades, with notable applications such as gravitational wave detection. Here, we extend the use of squeezed light to the realm of ultrafast quantum science. We demonstrate the generation of ultrafast, broadband quantum light pulses spanning 0.33 to 0.73 PHz using light field synthesizer and a four-wave mixing nonlinear process. Experimental results confirm that these pulses exhibit amplitude squeezing, which is consistent with theoretical predictions. This work lays the groundwork for a new field of ultrafast quantum science, enabling real-time studies of quantum light-matter interaction dynamics, which expect to reveal new physics. We also demonstrate the encoding of binary digital data onto these quantum light waveforms, synthesized with attosecond resolution, showcasing potential applications in secure quantum communication. This work paves the way for ultrafast quantum optoelectronics, quantum computing, and next-generation encrypted quantum communication networks, capable of achieving petahertz-scale data transmission speeds.</description>

      <title>A photonic integrated circuit for heterogeneous second harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous integration of GaAs-based lasers with frequency doubling waveguides presents a clear path to scalable coherent sources in the so-called green gap, yet frequency doubling systems have so far relied on separately manufactured lasers to deliver enough power for second harmonic generation. In this work, we propose a photonic integrated circuit (PIC) which alleviates the performance requirements for integrated frequency doublers. Two gain sections are connected by waveguides, with a frequency converter and a wavelength separator in between. The fundamental light circulates between the gain sections until it is converted and emitted through the wavelength separator. Variants of this separated gain PIC are discussed, and the PIC is implemented with thin film lithium niobate and directly bonded GaAs-based lasers, coupled by on-chip facets and adiabatic tapers, realizing visible light generation in the 515-595 nm range.</description>

      <title>Sorting light's radial momentum and orbital angular momentum with a parabola-like lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbital angular momentum and radial momentum both describe the transverse momentum of a light field. Efficient discriminating and sorting the two kinds of momentum lies at the heart of further application. Here, we propose a parabola-like lens that can transform the orbital angular momentum and the radial momentum into different positions in the parabolas. We experimentally characterize the performance of our implementation by separating individual angular and radial momentum as well as the multiple superposition states. The reported scheme can achieve two kinds of transverse momentum identification and thus provide a possible way to complete the characterization of the full transverse momentum of an optical field. The proposed device can readily be used in multiplexing and demultiplexing of optical information, and in principle, achieve unit efficiency, and thus can be suitable for applications that involve quantum states of light.</description>

      <title>High peak-power 2.1-{\mu}m femtosecond Holmium amplifier at 100 kHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a laser system delivering sub-100-fs pulses at 2.1-{\mu}m wavelength with an unprecedented combination of high peak power and high repetition rate. The amplifier system consists of a mode-locked oscillator seeding a regenerative amplifier using the novel broadband material Holmium (Ho)-doped CaAlGdO4 (CALGO), operating in the chirped pulse amplification (CPA) scheme, and a simple single-pass nonlinear compression stage based on a bulk material multi-pass cell (MPC). This simple laser system delivers 97-fs pulse duration and a peak power of 525 MW. We demonstrate the potential of this unique source by generating a microplasma in ambient air, demonstrating the highly focusable intensity to address future plasma-driven secondary sources. To the best of our knowledge, this system is the first Ho-based laser system combining high peak power and high repetition rate in this coveted wavelength region.</description>

      <title>Lifshitz tail states in non-Hermitian disordered photonic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In lattices with uncorrelated on-site potential disorder, Anderson localization near the band edges can exhibit anomalously weak localization in the form of Lifshitz tail states. These states correspond to clusters of contiguous sites with nearly identical on-site energies, allowing excitations to extend significantly beyond the characteristic localization length determined by the inverse of Lyapunov exponent. Since Lifshitz tail states are rare events, with an exponentially small density of states, they are typically considered of limited practical importance. In this work, we demonstrate that when Anderson localization is induced by disorder in an imaginary on-site potential, Lifshitz tail states can dominate the system's dynamics and become experimentally observable. This phenomenon is illustrated through the Anderson-Bernoulli model in a non-Hermitian photonic lattice, shedding light on the unique interplay between disorder and non-Hermiticity in such systems</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal wavevector dynamics of transverse mode-locked beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase-locking of transverse higher-order resonator modes results in a beam with rapidly oscillating spatial intensity profile. To complete the description of such transverse mode-locked (TML) beams, their spatiotemporal phase dynamics are explored in this work. The analysis of the phase terms of TML beams reveals oscillating wavevectors, which are experimentally verified by exploiting the mode-matching requirement of a single-mode fiber. The wavevector oscillation is further quantified by exploring its dependence on beam size. The findings have to be considered in potential future applications of TML beams in phase-sensitive processes.</description>

      <title>Spectrally indistinguishable intermodal-vectorial four-wave-mixing in birefringent few-mode fibers for spatial-polarization-frequency hybrid-entangled photon-pairs generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate both experimentally and theoretically the two intermodal-vectorial four-wave-mixing processes in birefringent few-mode fibers, which are spectrally indistinguishable. We show that two four-wave-mixing processes involving the four polarization modes of different spatial distributions can overlap spectrally as long as the group refractive indices of the signal and idler modes intersect at the pump wavelength. The experimental confirmation of theoretical predictions is performed with PANDA fiber pumped with an Nd:YAG laser with 1064.3 nm wavelength. The spectral overlap enables the hybrid-entanglement of photons in spatial-polarization-frequency degrees of freedom. Moreover, we discuss that the spectral position of the overlapping FWMs can be tailored by: (i) the relative phase birefringence of the four modes participating in the FWM or (ii) the average chromatic dispersion of the signal/idler modes, allowing to move the process away from detrimental Raman scattering. Interestingly, in the $\pm$ 100 THz range from pump considered here, the gain of FWM depends primarily on the integral overlap between the modes participating in the process and is virtually wavelength-independent. This characteristic makes few-mode birefringent fibers a promising platform for developing flat-gain, spectrally tailored sources of photon pairs entangled in multiple degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Emerging Ta$_{4}$C$_{3}$ and Mo$_{2}$Ti$_{2}$C$_{3}$ MXene Nanosheets for Ultrafast Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast nonlinear optical (NLO) response, fast carrier recovery, broadband absorption, and resistance to radiation and heat make 2D materials promising for photonic technologies. However, low electronic conductivity and carrier concentration limit the performance of semiconducting or semimetallic materials. This work investigates the ultrafast NLO properties and carrier dynamics of Ta$_{4}$C$_{3}$T$_{x}$ and out-of-plane ordered Mo$_{2}$Ti$_{2}$C$_{3}$T$_{x}$ MXenes using Z-scan and pump-probe optical Kerr effect techniques under visible and infrared femtosecond laser pulses. Their NLO response surpasses all previously studied MXenes and most other 2D nanomaterials, attaining exceptionally high third-order susceptibility (\c{hi}(3)) values on the order of 10^{-13} esu. Mo$_{2}$Ti$_{2}$C$_{3}$T$_{x}$ exhibits the strongest NLO response under both excitation regimes, attributed to charge transfer between Mo and Ti layers in the MXene structure. Under visible excitation, the studied MXenes display pronounced saturable absorption, while under infrared excitation, they exhibit strong reverse saturable absorption, resulting in efficient optical limiting. Additionally, pump-probe experiments identify two distinct relaxation processes: a fast one on the sub-picosecond timescale and a slower one a few picoseconds after photoexcitation. Our results indicate that these MXenes are among the strongest NLO materials. They show their great potential for advanced photonic and optoelectronic applications in laser technologies, optical protection, telecommunications, and optical/quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Dynamic optical coherence tomography algorithm for label-free assessment of swiftness and occupancy of intratissue moving scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic optical coherence tomography (DOCT) statistically analyzes fluctuations in time-sequential OCT signals, enabling label-free and three-dimensional visualization of intratissue and intracellular activities. Current DOCT methods, such as logarithmic intensity variance (LIV) and OCT correlation decay speed (OCDS) have several limitations.Namely, the DOCT values and intratissue motions are not directly related, and hence DOCT values are not interpretable in the context of the tissue motility. We introduce a new DOCT algorithm that provides more direct interpretation of DOCT in the contexts of dynamic scatterer ratio and scatterer speed in the tissue.The detailed properties of the new and conventional DOCT methods are investigated by numerical simulations, and the experimental validation with in vitro and ex vivo samples demonstrates the feasibility of the new method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of a bound state in the continuum (BIC) which appears in the photonic structure consisting of two coupled waveguides where one of them supports a discrete eigenmode spectrum embedded in the continuum of the other one. A BIC appears when the coupling is suppressed by suitable tuning of structural parameters. In contrast to the previously described configurations, our scheme facilitates genuine guiding of quasi-TE modes in the core with the lower refractive index.</description>

      <title>Space-time inverse-scattering of translation-based motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In optical diffraction tomography (ODT), a sample's 3D refractive-index (RI) is often reconstructed after illuminating it from multiple angles, with the assumption that the sample remains static throughout data collection. When the sample undergoes dynamic motion during this data-collection process, significant artifacts and distortions compromise the fidelity of the reconstructed images. In this study, we develop a space-time inverse-scattering technique for ODT that compensates for the translational motion of multiple-scattering samples during data collection. Our approach involves formulating a joint optimization problem to simultaneously estimate a scattering sample's translational position at each measurement and its motion-corrected 3D RI distribution. Experimental results demonstrate the technique's effectiveness, yielding reconstructions with reduced artifacts, enhanced spatial resolution, and improved quantitative accuracy for samples undergoing continuous translational motion during imaging.</description>

      <title>HfO$_2$-based platform for high-index-contrast visible/UV integrated photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultraviolet and visible integrated photonics are enabling for applications in quantum information, sensing, and spectroscopy, among others. Few materials support low-loss photonics into the UV, and the relatively low refractive index of known depositable materials limits the achievable functionality. Here we present a high-index integrated photonics platform based on HfO$_2$ and Al$_2$O$_3$ composites deposited via Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) with low loss in the visible and near-UV. We show that Al$_2$O$_3$ incorporation dramatically decreases bulk loss compared to pure HfO$_2$, consistent with inhibited crystallization due to the admixture of Al$_2$O$_3$. Composites exhibit refractive index $n$ following the average of that of HfO$_2$ and Al$_2$O$_3$, weighted by the HfO$_2$ fractional composition $x$. At $\lambda=375$ nm, composites with $x=0.67$ exhibit $n=2.08$ preserving most of HfO$_2$'s significantly higher index, and $3.8(7) $ dB/cm material loss. We further present fully etched and cladded waveguides, grating couplers, and ring resonators, realizing single-mode waveguide loss of $0.25(2)$ dB/cm inferred from resonators of 2.6 million intrinsic quality factor at $\lambda=729$ nm, $2.6(2)$ dB/cm at $\lambda=405$ nm, and $7.7(6)$ dB/cm at $\lambda=375$ nm. We measure the composite's thermo-optic coefficient (TOC) to be $2.44(3) \times 10^{-5}$ RIU/$^\circ$C near $\lambda=397$ nm. This work establishes (HfO$_2$)$_x$(Al$_2$O$_3$)$_{1-x}$ composites as a platform amenable to integration for low-loss, high-index photonics spanning the UV to NIR.</description>

      <title>Optical Arbitrary Waveform Generation (OAWG) Using Actively Phase-Stabilized Spectral Stitching</title>

Abstract: The conventional way of generating optical waveforms relies on the in-phase and quadrature (IQ) modulation of a continuous wave (CW) laser tone. In this case, the bandwidth of the resulting optical waveform is limited by the underlying electronic components, in particular by the digital-to-analog converters (DACs) generating the drive signals for the IQ modulator. This bandwidth bottleneck can be overcome by using a concept known as optical arbitrary waveform generation (OAWG), where multiple IQ modulators and DACs are operated in parallel to first synthesize individual spectral slices, which are subsequently combined to form a single ultra-broadband arbitrary optical waveform. However, targeted synthesis of arbitrary optical waveforms from multiple spectral slices has so far been hampered by difficulties to maintain the correct optical phase relationship between the slices. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate spectrally sliced OAWG with active phase stabilization, which permits targeted synthesis of truly arbitrary optical waveforms. We demonstrate the viability of the scheme by synthesizing optical waveforms with record-high bandwidths of up to 325 GHz from four individually generated optical tributaries. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we use the OAWG system to generate 32QAM data signals at symbol rates of up to 320 GBd, which we transmit over 87 km of single-mode fiber and receive by a two-channel non-sliced optical arbitrary waveform measurement (OAWM) system, achieving excellent signal quality. We believe that our scheme can unlock the full potential of OAWG and disrupt a wide range of applications in high-speed optical communications, photonic-electronic digital-to-analog conversion, as well as advanced test and measurement in science and industry.</description>

      <title>Thermal-noise Limits to the Frequency Stability of Burned Spectral Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Techniques in frequency stabilization of lasers to fixed-spacer optical cavities have advanced to the point where the ultimate frequency stabilities are limited by thermal noise in the cavity materials for standard cavity configurations at room temperature. The use of spectral-hole burning (SHB) in laser stabilization has produced promising results in early experiments. In this letter we explore the thermal-noise limits to frequency stability in burned spectral holes. We compile known material parameters for a typical system used in SHB experiments (Eu 3+ doped Y 2 SiO 5 ) to make numerical estimates for the fundamental thermal-noise induced frequency instability in spectral-holes for the liquid-helium temperature and dilution temperature cases. These efforts can guide the design of future SHB experiments and clarify which important material parameters remain to be measured.</description>

      <title>Spin and Density Modes in a Binary Fluid of Light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the experimental observation of spin and density modes in a binary mixture of superfluids of light. A miscible Bose-Bose mixture with repulsive interactions is obtained by propagating, in the paraxial limit, the two circular polarization components of a laser through a non-linear hot atomic vapor. Controlling the intensity and phase for both polarizations allows us to selectively excite the fundamental modes of the mixture. Using a Bragg-like spectroscopy technique, we measure the dispersion relation and identify two distinct branches with different speeds of sound corresponding to the spin and density modes. At large photon density, we observe a crossing of these branches, which is due to an effective photon-photon interaction beyond the two-body regime and related to the saturation of the medium nonlinearity. This novel degree of freedom allows for precise control over the ratio of spin and density sound velocities and provide new insights into the control of binary mixtures collective dynamics.</description>

      <title>Width-independent and Robust Multimode Interference Waveguides Based on Anomalous Bulk States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimode interference (MMI) is a fundamental physical principle that plays a crucial role in modern communication technologies for wave splitting, filtering, switching and multiplexing. Typically, the generation of multimodes is highly dependent on the waveguide's cross-section, particularly its width, by which the mode profiles and the interference patterns can be severely affected, leading to unstable MMI performance. Here, we realize width-independent and robust MMI waveguides. Our principle is based on the unique properties of multilayer graphene lattices. By properly modulating the boundary potential, this Dirac-type material supports anomalous bulk states with uniform wavefunctions independent of the sample size. Benefited from such an anomaly, the bulk states in a waveguide formed by multiple layers of graphene ribbons exhibit width-independent MMI. Enabled by this intriguing characterisitc, we construct 2*2 MMI waveguides using bilayer photonic and phononic crystals with graphene lattices. By precisely modulating their boundaries, the anomalous bulk states and correspondingly the width-independent MMI are achieved. Our experimental measurements show that the input wave energy travelling through the MMI waveguide can be split into two outputs with a frequency-tunable ratio, and due to the width-independent characteristic, the splitter is robust to geometric perturbations. We further demonstrate stable MMI across multiple interconnects with stepped widths, allowing for high power capacity while maintaining high coupling efficiency. Our approach successfully decouples MMI performance from waveguide width, creating lateral degrees of freedom that enable flexibly scalable and robust photonic, phononic, and electronic integrated circuits for versatile MMI applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of quantum-correlated pulse pairs in a dispersion modulated birefringent fiber is considered. The photon-number correlations and squeezing are studied using linearized quantum fluctuation theory. Two models of the pulse propagation in an optical fiber are used. The first model is based on the Manakov equations, and the second one is based on the coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations with differential group delay and birefringence terms. In the Manakov model the correlated pulse pairs can be generated using splitting of a second-order soliton and inelastic collision of two fundamental solitons. The interpulse correlations depends on the modulation period of the fiber dispersion. In the model of the coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations the correlated pulse pair can be produced using pulse splitting due to polarization mode dispersion. The pulses have orthogonal polarization states. This allows the pulses to be separated into two different channels using a polarization beam splitter. The interpulse correlation depends on the interplay between polarization mode dispersion and polarization instability.</description>

      <title>High-Speed Time Series Prediction with a GHz-rate Photonic Spiking Neural Network built with a single VCSEL</title>

Abstract: Photonic technologies hold significant potential for creating innovative, high-speed, efficient and hardware-friendly neuromorphic computing platforms. Neuromorphic photonic methods leveraging ubiquitous, technologically mature and cost-effective Vertical-Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) are of notable interest. VCSELs have demonstrated the capability to replicate neuronal optical spiking responses at ultrafast rates. These characteristics have triggered research into applying these key-enabling devices in spike-based photonic computing. Here, a GHz-rate photonic Spiking Neural Network (p-SNN) using a single VCSEL is reported, and its application to a complex time-series prediction task is demonstrated for the first time. The VCSEL p-SNN combined with a technique to induce network memory, is applied to perform multi-step-ahead predictions of a chaotic time-series. By providing the feedforward p-SNN with only two temporally separated inputs excellent accuracy is experimentally demonstrated over a range of prediction horizons. VCSEL-based p-SNNs therefore offer ultrafast, efficient operation in complex predictive tasks whilst enabling hardware implementations. The inherent attributes and performance of VCSEL p-SNNs hold great promise for use in future light-enabled neuromorphic computing hardware.</description>

      <title>Long-lived quantum correlation by cavity-mediated subradiance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperative effects such as super(sub)radiance in quantum systems arise from the interplay among quantum emitters. While bright superradiant states have been extensively studied and yielded significant insights into cooperative phenomena, subradiant states have remained less explored due to their inherently dark state nature. However, subradiance holds significant potential as valuable quantum resources that exploit long-lived and large-scale entanglement, which is a key for advancing quantum information technologies. Here, we demonstrate a long-lived subradiant state among multiple quantum emitters coupled to a directional low Q cavity. In a tailored photonic environment with balanced cavity dissipation, emitter-field coupling strength, and incoherent pumping, two coupled quantum dots exhibit a steady-state population in a subradiant state with highly negative cooperativity. As an important hallmark of a subradiant state, the system shows large photon bunching (g^((2))(0)&gt;&gt;2) and suppressed single-photon decay. In addition, controlling the excitation wavelength provides a useful tool for manipulating dephasing and the number of coupled emitters, which leads to significant changes in photon statistics. Our approach to inducing cavity-mediated subradiance paves the way for creating and harnessing quantum correlations in quantum emitters via a long-lived entangled quantum state, essential for quantum storage and metrology.</description>

      <title>Partial-immunity of two-photon correlation against wavefront distortion for spatially entangled photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional quantum entanglement in photons offers notable technological advancements over traditional qubit-based systems, including increased information density and enhanced security. However, such high-dimensional states are vulnerable to disruption by complex disordered media, presenting significant challenges in practical applications. Spatially-entangled photons are conventionally generated using a nonlinear crystal via spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC). While the effect of disorder on spatially entangled photons in the near field of the crystal is well understood, the impact of disorder in the far field is more complex. In this work, we present a systematic study of the randomization of two-photon correlations caused by arbitrary phase distortions in the far field by breaking it down into odd and even parity components. First, we theoretically show that the two-photon field is only sensitive to the even-parity part of the phase distortion. In follow-up experiments, we employ a deformable mirror to implement random phase distortions, separating the contributions of odd and even parity phases using Zernike polynomials. The experimental results are in agreements with the theoretical predictions. Subsequently, we perform numerical simulations to show that these results extend to stronger degrees of disorder. Our key finding is that, since two-photon correlations are only affected by the even-parity component of phase modulations, the number of independent adaptive optics elements required for optimizing the correlation can be effectively halved, offering a significant practical advantage in managing disorder in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Topological temporal boundary states in a non-Hermitian spatial crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodic modulation of the material index in time opens momentum gaps. Such systems are regarded as the temporal analogue of common spatial crystals, wherein the bandgaps open in the frequency space. Recent studies have also led to the theoretical prediction of topological temporal boundary states (TTBSs) in such momentum gaps. In this work, we report the discovery and experimental realization of a new type of TTBS, appearing in a non-Hermitian spatial crystal with spatially periodic loss and gain, wherein the emergence of Bloch momentum gap is associated with a parity-time broken phase, instead of relying on periodic temporal modulation. By inducing a sudden flip of signs of the loss and gain profile, a mode emerges in the middle of the Bloch momentum gap and peaks at the flipping instant, which is regarded as a temporal boundary. Remarkably, we found that the temporal flip induces a topological transition in time, and the said mode is a TTBS that is a temporal analogue of the Jackiw-Rebbi state. The TTBS is experimentally observed in a 1D active mechanical lattice, and it can generically emerge in a wide range of non-Hermitian systems. By linking non-Hermitian physics with spatiotemporal topological systems, our results not only deepen the understanding of temporal topological phases but also open new grounds for controlling transient waves by topological means.</description>

      <title>Spectral Convolutional Neural Network Chip for In-sensor Edge Computing of Incoherent Natural Light</title>

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are representative models of artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, the considerable power consumption and limited computing speed of electrical computing platforms restrict further CNN development on edge devices. Optical neural networks are considered next-generation physical implementations of ANNs, but their capabilities are limited by on-chip integration scale and requirement for coherent light sources. This study proposes a spectral convolutional neural network (SCNN) of incoherent natural light by an optical convolutional layer (OCL) and a reconfigurable electrical backend. The OCL is implemented by integrating very large-scale, pixel-aligned spectral filters on a CMOS image sensor on a 12-inch wafer, facilitating highly parallel spectral vector-inner products of incident light. It accepts broadband incoherent natural light containing two spatial and one spectral dimension directly as input with the function of matter meta-imaging. This unique optoelectronic framework empowers in-sensor optical analog computing at extremely high energy efficiency because the OCL is driven by the energy of the information carrier, i. e. natural light. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first integrated optical computing utilizing natural light. We employ the same SCNN chip for completely different real-world complex tasks,and achieve accuracies of over 96% for pathological diagnosis and almost 100% for face anti-spoofing at video rates. The SCNN framework has an unprecedented new function of substance identification, provides a feasible optoelectronic and integrated optical CNN implementation for edge devices or cellphones, providing them with practical and powerful edge computing abilities and facilitating diverse applications, such as intelligent robotics, industrial automation, medical diagnosis, and remote sensing.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a method that reduces the noise caused by multi-scattering (MS) photons in an \invivo optical coherence tomography image. This method combines a specially designed image acquisition (i.e., optical coherence tomography scan) scheme and subsequent complex signal processing. For the acquisition, multiple cross-sectional images (frames) are sequentially acquired while the depth position of the focus is altered for each frame by an electrically tunable lens. In the signal processing, the frames are numerically defocus-corrected, and complex averaged. Because of the inconsistency in the MS-photon trajectories among the different electrically tunable lens-induced defocus, this averaging reduces the MS signal. This method was validated using a scattering phantom and in vivo unanesthetized small fish samples, and was found to reduce MS noise even for unanesthetized in vivo measurement.</description>

      <title>Emergent spin and orbital angular momentum of light in twisted photonic bilayer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the optical response of twisted photonic bilayers, photonic counterparts of van der Waals structures, is sensitive to both spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light. A beam of unpolarized light with zero angular momentum acquires SAM in transmission and OAM in reflection. The developed analytical theory and numerical calculations show that the SAM and OAM arise from distinct microscopic mechanisms and depend differently on the interlayer distance. The predicted phenomena do not require light absorption and are caused by the photon-helicity-dependent light diffraction by the moir\'e pattern, which inevitably occurs in the twisted structure, and the SAM-OAM conversion processes. We also reveal strong SAM and OAM in the moir\'e-diffracted beams. Our findings uncover a profound connection between the emergent SAM and OAM in twisted photonic systems offering new possibilities for angular-momentum-resolved light-matter interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current wireless communication systems are increasingly constrained by insufficient bandwidth and limited power output, impeding the achievement of ultra-high-speed data transmission. The terahertz (THz) range offers greater bandwidth, but it also imposes higher requirements on broadband and high-power devices. In this work, we present a modified uni-traveling-carrier photodiode (MUTC-PD) module with WR-6 waveguide output for photonics-assisted fiber-THz integrated wireless communications. Through the optimization of the epitaxial structure and high-impedance coplanar waveguide (CPW), the fabricated 6-um-diameter MUTC-PD achieves a high output power of -0.96 dBm at 150 GHz and ultra-flat frequency response at D-band. The MUTC-PD is subsequently packaged into a compact WR-6 module, incorporating planar-circuit-based RF-choke, DC-block and probe. The packaged PD module demonstrates high saturation power and flat frequency responses with minimal power roll-off of only 2 dB over 110-170 GHz. By incorporating the PD module into a fiber-THz integrated communication system, high data rates of up to 160 Gbps with 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and a maximum symbol transmission rate of 60 Gbaud with QPSK modulation are successfully secured. The demonstration verifies the potential of the PD module for ultra-broadband and ultra-high-speed THz communications, setting a foundation for future research in high-speed data transmission.</description>

      <title>Field tunable plasmonic lenses for optical microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the behavior and tunability of plasmonic lenses created from arrays of nanoslits, applicable in sub-wavelength optical microscopy and other high-resolution imaging systems. We performed simulations on COMSOL Multiphysics to assess power flow and focal shifts in plasmonic lenses with differing slit designs, refractive indices, and angular distributions. The findings indicate that the confinement can be regulated by adjusting these parameters.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Microscopy Through Complex Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Manipulating broadband fields in scattering media is a modern challenge across photonics and other wave domains. Recent studies have shown that complex propagation in scattering media can be harnessed to manipulate broadband light wave packets in space-time for focusing, imaging, and computing applications. Interestingly, while many proposed methodologies operate on intensity-based assessment of scattered fields, often in the spectral domain, from a pure transmission-function perspective, scattering operates as a linear field-level combinatory process, i.e., the superposition of transformation of unit excitations. As a result, we recently demonstrated that gaining experimental access to instantaneous scattered fields, as available through time-domain spectroscopy in the terahertz spectral range, in conjunction with sparse light excitation typical of ghost imaging, provides a key advantage in enabling the functionalisation of scattering, exposing a novel modelling paradigm. In this paper, we provide experimental proof of reconstructing 1-dimensional object features through a scattering medium using a fully broadband time-domain terahertz approach.</description>

      <title>Exact theory of edge diffraction and launching of transverse electric plasmons at two-dimensional junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An exact solution for electromagnetic wave diffraction at the junction of two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) is obtained and analyzed for electric field polarized along the edge. A special emphasis is paid to the metal-contacted and terminated edges. In the former case, electric field at the edge tends to zero; in the latter case, it tends to a finite value which is screened by 2d system in an anomalous fashion. For both types of edge and capacitive type of 2d conductivity, an incident wave excites transverse electric 2d plasmons. The amplitude of excited TE plasmons is maximized and becomes order of incident wave amplitude for capacitive impedance of 2DES order of free space impedance. For both large and small 2DES impedance, the amplitude of TE plasmons tends to zero according to the power laws which are explicitly derived.</description>
