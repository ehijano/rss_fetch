      <title>The complexity of separability for semilinear sets and Parikh automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a separability problem, we are given two sets $K$ and $L$ from a class $\mathcal{C}$, and we want to decide whether there exists a set $S$ from a class $\mathcal{S}$ such that $K\subseteq S$ and $S\cap L=\emptyset$. In this case, we speak of separability of sets in $\mathcal{C}$ by sets in $\mathcal{S}$.
  We study two types of separability problems. First, we consider separability of semilinear sets by recognizable sets of vectors (equivalently, by sets definable by quantifier-free monadic Presburger formulas). Second, we consider separability of languages of Parikh automata by regular languages. A Parikh automaton is a machine with access to counters that can only be incremented, and have to meet a semilinear constraint at the end of the run. Both of these separability problems are known to be decidable with elementary complexity.
  Our main results are that both problems are coNP-complete. In the case of semilinear sets, coNP-completeness holds regardless of whether the input sets are specified by existential Presburger formulas, quantifier-free formulas, or semilinear representations. Our results imply that recognizable separability of rational subsets of $\Sigma^*\times\mathbb{N}^d$ (shown decidable by Choffrut and Grigorieff) is coNP-complete as well. Another application is that regularity of deterministic Parikh automata (where the target set is specified using a quantifier-free Presburger formula) is coNP-complete as well.</description>

      <title>Pointwise order of generalized Hofstadter functions $G, H$ and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hofstadter's $G$ function is recursively defined via $G(0)=0$ and then $G(n)=n-G(G(n-1))$. Following Hofstadter, a family $(F_k)$ of similar functions is obtained by varying the number $k$ of nested recursive calls in this equation. We establish here that this family is ordered pointwise: for all $k$ and $n$, $F_k(n) \le F_{k+1}(n)$. For achieving this, a detour is made via infinite morphic words generalizing the Fibonacci word. Various properties of these words are proved, concerning the lengths of substituted prefixes of these words and the counts of some specific letters in these prefixes. We also relate the limits of $\frac{1}{n}F_k(n)$ to the frequencies of letters in the considered words.</description>

      <title>From Compactifying Lambda-Letrec Terms to Recognizing Regular-Expression Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a supplement to my talk at the workshop, this extended abstract motivates and summarizes my work with co-authors on problems in two separate areas: first, in the lambda-calculus with letrec, a universal model of computation, and second, on Milner's process interpretation of regular expressions, a proper subclass of the finite-state processes. The aim of my talk was to motivate a transferal of ideas for workable concepts of structure-constrained graphs: from the problem of finding compact graph representations for terms in the lambda-calculus with letrec to the problem of recognizing finite process graphs that can be expressed by regular expressions. In both cases the construction of structure-constrained graphs was expedient in order to enable to go back and forth easily between, in the first case, lambda-terms and term graphs, and in the second case, regular expressions and process graphs.      
  The main focus here is on providing pointers to my work with co-authors, in both areas separately. A secondary focus is on explaining directions of my present projects, and describing research questions of possibly general interest that have developed out of my work in these two areas.</description>

      <title>Random Graph Generation in Context-Free Graph Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for generating random hypergraphs in context-free hypergraph languages. It is obtained by adapting Mairson's generation algorithm for context-free string grammars to the setting of hyperedge replacement grammars. Our main results are that for non-ambiguous hyperedge replacement grammars, the method generates hypergraphs uniformly at random and in quadratic time. We illustrate our approach by a running example of a hyperedge replacement grammar generating term graphs.</description>

      <title>Fibrational perspectives on determinization of finite-state automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colcombet and Petri\c{s}an argued that automata may be usefully considered from a functorial perspective, introducing a general notion of "$\mathcal{V}$-automaton" based on functors into $\mathcal{V}$. This enables them to recover different standard notions of automata by choosing $\mathcal{V}$ appropriately, and they further analyzed the determinization for \textbf{Rel}-automata using the Kleisli adjunction between \textbf{Set} and \textbf{Rel}. In this paper, we revisit Colcombet and Petri\c{s}an's analysis from a fibrational perspective, building on Melli\`es and Zeilberger's recent alternative but related definition of categorical automata as functors $p : \mathcal{Q} \to \mathcal{C}$ satisfying the finitary fiber and unique lifting of factorizations property. In doing so, we improve the understanding of determinization in three regards: Firstly, we carefully describe the universal property of determinization in terms of forward-backward simulations. Secondly, we generalize the determinization procedure for \textbf{Rel} automata using a local adjunction between \textbf{SpanSet} and \textbf{Rel}, which provides us with a canonical forward simulation. Finally we also propose an alterative determinization based on the multiset relative adjunction which retains paths, and we leverage this to provide a canonical forward-backward simulation.</description>
