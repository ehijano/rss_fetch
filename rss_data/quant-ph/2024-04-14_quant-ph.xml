      <title>Benchmarking digital quantum simulations and optimization above hundreds of qubits using quantum critical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The real-time simulation of large many-body quantum systems is a formidable task, that may only be achievable with a genuine quantum computational platform. Currently, quantum hardware with a number of qubits sufficient to make classical emulation challenging is available. This condition is necessary for the pursuit of a so-called quantum advantage, but it also makes verifying the results very difficult. In this manuscript, we flip the perspective and utilize known theoretical results about many-body quantum critical dynamics to benchmark quantum hardware and various error mitigation techniques on up to 133 qubits. In particular, we benchmark against known universal scaling laws in the Hamiltonian simulation of a time-dependent transverse field Ising Hamiltonian. Incorporating only basic error mitigation and suppression methods, our study shows coherent control up to a two-qubit gate depth of 28, featuring a maximum of 1396 two-qubit gates, before noise becomes prevalent. These results are transferable to applications such as digitized quantum annealing and match the results of a 133-site optimization, where we identify an optimal working point in terms of both circuit depth and time step.</description>

      <title>Complexity enriched dynamical phases for fermions on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions, encompassing phenomena like many-body localization transitions and measurement-induced phase transitions, are often characterized and identified through the analysis of quantum entanglement. Here, we highlight that the dynamical phases defined by entanglement are further enriched by complexity. We investigate both the entanglement and Krylov complexity for fermions on regular graphs, which can be implemented by systems like $^6$Li atoms confined by optical tweezers. Our investigations unveil that while entanglement follows volume laws on both types of regular graphs with degree $d = 2$ and $d = 3$, the Krylov complexity exhibits distinctive behaviors. We analyze both free fermions and interacting fermions models. In the absence of interaction, both numerical results and theoretical analysis confirm that the dimension of the Krylov space scales as $D\sim N$ for regular graphs of degree $d = 2$ with $N$ sites, and we have $D\sim N^2$ for $d = 3$. The qualitative distinction also persists in interacting fermions on regular graphs. For interacting fermions, our theoretical analyses find the dimension scales as $D\sim 4^{N^\alpha}$ for regular graphs of $d = 2$ with $0.38\leq\alpha\leq0.59$, whereas it scales as $D\sim 4^N$ for $d = 3$. The distinction in the complexity of quantum dynamics for fermions on graphs with different connectivity can be probed in experiments by measuring the out-of-time-order correlators.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reveal that the information exchange between particle detectors and their ability to harvest correlations from a quantum field can interfere constructively and destructively. This allows for scenarios where the presence of entanglement in the quantum field is actually detrimental to the process of getting the two detectors entangled.</description>

      <title>Discord-type quantum correlations in axially symmetric spin-(1/2, $S$) systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mixed spin-$(1/2, S)$ system with arbitrary spin $S$ and interactions satisfying the U(1) axial symmetry is considered. Compact explicit forms of the local quantum uncertainty (LQU) and local quantum Fisher information (LQFI) are obtained directly through the entries and eigenvalues of the density matrix. Using these forms, we perform a comparative study of discord-type quantum correlations LQU and LQFI for the system at thermal equilibrium. An increase in quantum correlations with increasing spin length $S$ is discovered. Moreover, we find that as the system cools, quantum correlations can undergo one or more abrupt transitions while the temperature changes smoothly.</description>

      <title>LinguaQuanta: Towards a Quantum Transpiler Between OpenQASM and Quipper (Extended)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computing evolves, many important questions emerge, such as how best to represent quantum programs, and how to promote interoperability between quantum program analysis tools. These questions arise naturally in the design of quantum transpilers, which translate between quantum programming languages. In this paper, we take a step towards answering these questions by identifying challenges and best practices in quantum transpiler design. We base these recommendations on our experience designing LinguaQuanta, a quantum transpiler between Quipper and OpenQASM. First, we provide categorical specifications for quantum transpilers, which aim to encapsulate the core principles of the UNIX philosophy. We then identify quantum circuit decompositions which we expect to be useful in quantum transpilation. With these foundations in place, we then discuss challenges faced during the implementation of LinguaQuanta, such as ancilla management and stability under round translation. To show that LinguaQuanta works in practice, a short tutorial is given for the example of quantum phase estimation. We conclude with recommendations for the future of LinguaQuanta, and for quantum software development tools more broadly.</description>

      <title>Optimal Universal Quantum Encoding for Statistical Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal encoding of classical data for statistical inference using quantum computing is investigated. A universal encoder is sought that is optimal for a wide array of statistical inference tasks. Accuracy of any statistical inference is shown to be upper bounded by a term that is proportional to maximal quantum leakage from the classical data, i.e., the input to the inference model, through its quantum encoding. This demonstrates that the maximal quantum leakage is a universal measure of the quality of the encoding strategy for statistical inference as it only depends on the quantum encoding of the data and not the inference task itself. The optimal universal encoding strategy, i.e., the encoding strategy that maximizes the maximal quantum leakage, is proved to be attained by pure states. When there are enough qubits, basis encoding is proved to be universally optimal. An iterative method for numerically computing the optimal universal encoding strategy is presented.</description>

      <title>Fully quantum arbitrarily varying channel coding for entanglement-assisted communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If a sender and a receiver lack precise knowledge about the communication line that connects them, designing a scheme to reliably transmit information becomes more challenging. This has been studied in classical and quantum information theory in the context of compound channel models and arbitrarily varying channel models. However, a fully quantum version of system uncertainty allows for an even more challenging coding scenario with entangled channel uses. This type of model has previously been investigated for classical and quantum capacity. Here, we address the problem of entanglement-assisted capacity in the presence of such system uncertainty. We find that, under the assumption of a finite environment dimension, it is equal to a corresponding compound capacity. Intriguingly, our results imply that in certain fully quantum arbitrarily varying channel models, the entanglement-assisted capacity can be positive while the classical capacity is equal to zero, a phenomenon that does not occur in regular single-channel coding.</description>

      <title>Shortcuts to adiabaticity with general two-level non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shortcuts to adiabaticity are alternative fast processes which reproduce the same final state as the adiabatic process in a finite or even shorter time, which have been extended from Hermitian systems to non-Hermitian systems in recent years, but they are barely explored for general non-Hermitian systems where off-diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian are not Hermitian. In this paper, we propose a shortcuts to adiabaticity technique which is based on a transitionless quantum driving algorithm to realize population transfer for general two-level non-Hermitian systems and give both exact and approximate analytical solutions of the corresponding counteradiabatic driving Hamiltonian, where the latter can be extended to the zeroth-order and first-order terms by applying perturbative theory. We find that the first-order correction term is different from the previous results, which is caused by the non-Hermiticity of the off-diagonal elements. We work out an exact expression for the control function and present examples consisting of a general two-level system with gain and loss to show the theory. The results suggest that the high-fidelity population transfer can be implemented in general non-Hermitian systems by our method, which works even with strong non-Hermiticity and without rotating wave approximation. Furthermore, we show that the general Hamiltonian the off-diagonal elements of which are not conjugate to each other can be implemented in many physical systems with the present experimental technology, such as an atom-light interaction system and whispering-gallery microcavity, which might have potential applications in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical second-order sidebands and group delays in a spinning resonator with parametric amplifier and non-Markovian effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the generation of the frequency components at the second-order sidebands based on a spinning resonator containing a degenerate optical parametric amplifier (OPA). We show an OPA driven by different pumping frequencies inside a cavity can enhance and modulate the amplitude of the second-order sideband with different influences. We find that both the second-order sideband amplitude and its associated group delay sensitively depend on the nonlinear gain of the OPA, the phase of the field driving the OPA, the rotation speed of the resonator, and the incident direction of the input fields. Tuning the pumping frequency of the OPA can remain the localization of the maximum value of the sideband efficiency and nonreciprocal behavior due to the optical Sagnac effect, which also can adjust the linewidth of the suppressive window of the second-order sideband. Furthermore, we extend the study of second-order sideband to the non-Markovian bath which consists of a collection of infinite oscillators (bosonic photonic modes). We illustrate the second-order sidebands in a spinning resonator exhibit a transition from the non-Markovian to Markovian regime by controlling environmental spectral width. \textbf{We also study the influences of the decay from the non-Markovian environment coupling to an external reservoir on the efficiency of second-order upper sidebands.} This indicates a promising new way to enhance or steer optomechanically induced transparency devices in nonlinear optical cavities and provides potential applications for precision measurement, optical communications, and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Quantum Many-body Chaos in the Krylov Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of simple operators is essential for the emergence of chaotic dynamics and quantum thermalization. Recent studies have proposed different measures, including the out-of-time-order correlator and Krylov complexity. It is established that the out-of-time-order correlator serves as the signature of quantum many-body chaos, while the Krylov complexity provides its upper bound. However, there exist non-chaotic systems in which Krylov complexity grows exponentially, indicating that the Krylov complexity itself is not a witness of many-body chaos. In this letter, we introduce the missing ingredient, named as the Krylov metric $K_{mn}$, which probes the size of the Krylov basis. We propose that the universal criteria for fast scramblers include (i) the exponential growth of Krylov complexity, (ii) the diagonal elements $K_{nn}\sim n^h$ with $h\in(0,1]$, and (iii) the negligibility of off-diagonal elements $K_{mn}$ with $m\neq n$. We further show that $h=\varkappa / 2\alpha$ is a ratio between the quantum Lyapunov exponent $\varkappa$ and the Krylov exponent $\alpha$. This proposal is supported by both generic arguments and explicit examples, including solvable SYK models, Luttinger Liquids, and many-body localized systems. Our results provide a refined understanding of how chaotic dynamics emerge from the Krylov space perspective.</description>

      <title>Entanglement signatures for quantum synchronization with single-ion phonon laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entanglement properties of quantum synchronization, based on a single-ion phonon laser subjected to an external drive, have been studied. It is found that the maximum value of steady-state entanglement between the ion's internal and external states occurs near the noiseless boundary from synchronization to unsynchronization, accompanied by noticeable oscillatory behaviors during the corresponding time evolution of entanglement. In addition, the later time dynamics of entanglement also indicates the occurrence of frequency entrainment, as evidenced by the strong consistency between the bending of the observed frequency and the emergence of Liouvillian exceptional points (LEPs) in the first two eigenvalues of the Liouvillian eigenspectrum. Moreover, the emergence of LEPs, which is intimately associated with frequency entrainment, should be widely observed in quantum synchronization and can be explored in LEPs-based applications.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty relations based on the $\rho$-absolute variance for quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty principle reveals the intrinsic differences between the classical and quantum worlds, which plays a significant role in quantum information theory. By using $\rho$-absolute variance, we introduce the uncertainty of quantum channels and explore its properties. By using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the parallelogram law, we establish the product and summation forms of the uncertainty relations for arbitrary two quantum channels, respectively. The summation form of the uncertainty inequalities based on the $\rho$-absolute variance for arbitrary $N$ quantum channels are also investigated and the optimal lower bounds are presented. We illustrate our results by several typical examples.</description>

      <title>Realization of two-qubit gates and multi-body entanglement states in an asymmetric superconducting circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the tunable coupling scheme has become the mainstream scheme for designing superconducting quan tum circuits. By working in the dispersive regime, the ZZ coupling and high-energy level leakage can be effectively suppressed and realize a high fidelity quantum gate. We propose a tunable fluxonium-transmon-transmon (FTT) cou pling scheme. In our system, the coupler is a frequency tunable transmon qubit. Both qubits and coupler are capacitively coupled. The asymmetric structure composed of fluxonium and transmon will optimize the frequency space and form a high fidelity two-qubit quantum gate. By decoupling, the effective coupling strength can be easily adjusted to close to the net coupling between qubits. We numerical simulation the master equation to reduce the quantum noise to zero. We study the performance of this scheme by simulating the general single-qubit X{\pi}/2 gate and two-qubit (iSWAP) gate. In the bias point of the qubits, we achieve a single qubit gate with 99.99% fidelity and a two-qubit gate with 99.95% fidelity. By adjusting the nonlinear Kerr coefficient of fluxonium to an appropriate value, we can achieve a multi-body entanglement state. We consider the correlation between the two qubits and the coupler, and the magnetic flux passing through one qubit has an effect on the other qubit and the coupler. Finally, we analyze the quantum correlation of the two-body entanglement state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum communication and quantum metrology are widely compelling applications in the field of quantum information science, and quantum remote sensing is an intersection of both. Despite their differences, there are notable commonalities between quantum communication and quantum remote sensing, as they achieve their functionalities through the transmission of quantum states. Here we propose a novel quantum integrated sensing and communication (QISAC) protocol, which achieves quantum sensing under the Heisenberg limit while simultaneously enabling quantum secure communication through the transmission of entanglements. We have theoretically proven its security against eavesdroppers. The security of QISAC is characterized by the secrecy capacity for information bit as well as asymmetric Fisher information gain for sensing. Through simulations conducted under the constraints of limited entanglement resources, we illustrate that QISAC maintains high accuracy in the estimation of phase. Hence our QISAC offers a fresh perspective for the applications of future quantum networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled photon pairs form the foundation for many applications in the realm of quantum communication. For fiber-optic transfer of entangled photon pairs, time-bin encoding can potentially offer an improved stability compared to polarization encoded qubits. Here, we lay the theoretical foundations to describe the measurement of time-bin entangled photons. We derive multi-time correlation functions of the time-bin encoded photon pairs, corresponding to quantum state tomographic measurements. Our theory can be the starting point to extend the simulations to include all kinds of loss or decoherence effects that apply in a specific quantum system for realistic simulation for time-bin entanglement from quantum emitters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating and interfering non-classical states of light is fundamental to optical quantum information science and technology. Quantum photonic integrated circuits provide one pathway towards scalability by combining nonlinear sources of non-classical light and programmable circuits in centimeter-scale devices. The key requirements for quantum applications include efficient generation of indistinguishable photon-pairs and high-visibility programmable quantum interference. Here, we demonstrate a lithium niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) integrated photonic circuit that generates a two-photon path-entangled state, and a programmable interferometer for quantum interference. We generate entangled photons with $\sim2.3\times10^8$ pairs/s/mW brightness and perform quantum interference experiments on the chip with $96.8\pm3.6\%$ visibility. LNOI is an emerging photonics technology that has revolutionized high-speed modulators and efficient frequency conversion. Our results provide a path towards large-scale integrated quantum photonics including efficient photon-pair generation and programmable circuits for applications such as boson sampling and quantum communications.</description>

      <title>Coherence properties of NV-center ensembles in diamond coupled to an electron-spin bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate nitrogen-vacancy center (NV) ensembles in diamond under the influence of strongly-correlated electron-spin baths. We thoroughly calculate the decoherence properties of the NV central spin for bath concentrations of 0.1-100 ppm using the cluster-correlation expansion (CCE) method. We systematically analyze possible origins of the significant deviations in the values of the $T_2$ coherence time reported in literature. We demonstrate that significant variations can originate from the choice of averaging and fitting procedures used for the ensemble average and we point out the respective aspects that need to be considered, when comparing the various theoretical studies. Our study may ease readers to perform reliable and fast simulations on the central spin problem. It provides an understanding and interpretation of the outcome parameters describing the dynamics of the local bath spins.</description>

      <title>Lowering the Exponential Wall: Accelerating High-Entropy Alloy Catalysts Screening using Local Surface Energy Descriptors from Neural Network Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational screening is indispensable for the efficient design of high-entropy alloys (HEAs), which hold great potential for catalytic applications. However, the chemical space of HEAs is exponentially vast with respect to the number of constituent elements, and even screening calculations using machine learning potentials can be enormously time-consuming. To address this challenge, we propose a method to rapidly construct models that predict the properties of HEAs from data on monometallic systems (or few-component alloys). The core of our approach is a newly-introduced descriptor called local surface energy ($LSE$), which reflects the local reactivity of solid surfaces at atomic resolution. We successfully created a model using linear regression to screen the adsorption energies of molecules on HEAs based on LSEs from monometallic systems. Furthermore, we made high-precision model development by employing both classical machine learning and quantum machine learning. Using our method, we were able to complete the adsorption energy calculations of CO molecules on 1000 patterns of quinary nanoparticles consisting of 201 atoms within a few hours. These calculations would have taken hundreds of years and hundreds of days using density functional theory and a neural network potential, respectively. Our approach allows accelerated exploration of the vast chemical space of HEAs facilitating the design of novel catalysts.</description>

      <title>Optimized Quantum Autoencoder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum autoencoder (QAE) compresses a bipartite quantum state into its subsystem by a self-checking mechanism. How to characterize the lost information in this process is essential to understand the compression mechanism of QAE\@. Here we investigate how to decrease the lost information in QAE for any input mixed state. We theoretically show that the lost information is the quantum mutual information between the remaining subsystem and the ignorant one, and the encoding unitary transformation is designed to minimize this mutual information. Further more, we show that the optimized unitary transformation can be decomposed as the product of a permutation unitary transformation and a disentanglement unitary transformation, and the permutation unitary transformation can be searched by a regular Young tableau algorithm. Finally we numerically identify that our compression scheme outperforms the quantum variational circuit based QAE\@.</description>

      <title>Towards a spatial cat state of a massive pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an experiment for constructing a spatial cat state of a suspended mirror with an order of $\mathcal{O}$(mg). The mirror is set at the center of two mirrors, creating two optical cavities and optical springs. The induced potential exhibits a double-well shape, and its deformation resembles a second-order phase transition as a function of laser power. We estimate an adiabatic condition for the ground state wave function to metamorphose from a localized state at the origin to a spatial cat state within the double-well potential, within a coherence time determined by mechanical and environmental noises. Our estimation suggests that such a construction is possible if we can provide an ultra-high finesse optical cavity with $F = 2.5 \times 10^5$ and a length of $0.3$ cm, along with a shot-noise-limited laser at $7.9$ nW. The necessary mechanical coherence time is approximately one second.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Quantum Metrology with Non-Phase-Covariant Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detrimental impact of noise on sensing performance in quantum metrology has been widely recognized by researchers in the field. However, there are no explicit fundamental laws of physics stating that noise invariably weakens quantum metrology. We reveal that phase-covariant (PC) noise either degrades or remains neutral to sensing precision, whereas non-phase-covariant (NPC) noise can potentially enhance parameter estimation, surpassing even the ultimate precision limit achievable in the absence of noise. This implies that a non-Hermitian quantum sensor may outperform its Hermitian counterpart in terms of sensing performance. To illustrate and validate our theory, we present several paradigmatic examples of magnetic field metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two different approaches towards the Landau-Zener problem: (i) The Markov approximation in the integro-differential equation for one of the two probability amplitudes, and (ii) an amplitude-and-phase analysis of the linear second order differential equation for same probability amplitude. Our treatment shows that the Markov approximation neglects the non-linearity of the equation but still provides us with the exact asymptotic result.</description>

      <title>Qubit frugal entanglement determination with the deep multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the deep multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (DMERA) on quantum hardware and the causal cone of a subset of the qubits which make up the ansatz. This causal cone spans $O(M+\log{N})$ physical qubits on a quantum device, where $M$ and $N$ are the subset size and the total number qubits in the ansatz respectively. This allows for the determination of the von Neumann entanglement entropy of the $N$ qubit wave-function using $O(M+\log{N})$ qubits by diagonalization of the reduced density matrix (RDM). We show this by randomly initializing a 16-qubit DMERA and diagonalizing the resulting RDM of the $M$-qubit subsystem using density matrix simulation. As an example of practical interest, we also encode the variational ground state of the quantum critical long-range transverse field Ising model (LRTIM) on 8 spins using DMERA. We perform density matrix simulation with and without noise to obtain entanglement entropies in separate experiments using only 4 qubits. Finally we repeat the experiment on the IBM Kyoto backend reproducing simulation results.</description>

      <title>Enhancing initial state overlap through orbital optimization for faster molecular electronic ground-state energy estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum phase estimation algorithm stands as the primary method for determining the ground state energy of a molecular electronic Hamiltonian on a quantum computer. In this context, the ability to initialize a classically tractable state that has a strong overlap with the desired ground state is critical as it directly affects the runtime of the algorithm. However, several numerical studies have shown that this overlap decays exponentially with system size. In this work, we demonstrate that this decay can be alleviated by optimizing the molecular orbital basis, for an initial state constructed from a single Slater determinant. We propose a practical method to achieve this optimization without knowledge of the true molecular ground state and test this method numerically. By comparing the resulting optimized orbitals to the natural orbitals, we find improved overlap. Specifically, for four iron-sulfur molecules, which are known to suffer from the mentioned decay, we show that our method yields one to two orders of magnitude improvement compared to localized molecular orbitals.</description>

      <title>Quantum Iterative Methods for Solving Differential Equations with Application to Computational Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose quantum methods for solving differential equations that are based on a gradual improvement of the solution via an iterative process, and are targeted at applications in fluid dynamics. First, we implement the Jacobi iteration on a quantum register that utilizes a linear combination of unitaries (LCU) approach to store the trajectory information. Second, we extend quantum methods to Gauss-Seidel iterative methods. Additionally, we propose a quantum-suitable resolvent decomposition based on the Woodbury identity. From a technical perspective, we develop and utilize tools for the block encoding of specific matrices as well as their multiplication. We benchmark the approach on paradigmatic fluid dynamics problems. Our results stress that instead of inverting large matrices, one can program quantum computers to perform multigrid-type computations and leverage corresponding advances in scientific computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement logically encoded three-qubit circuits for the quantum Fourier transform (QFT), using the [[7,1,3]] Steane code, and benchmark the circuits on the Quantinuum H2-1 trapped-ion quantum computer. The circuits require multiple logical two-qubit gates, which are implemented transversally, as well as logical non-Clifford single-qubit rotations, which are performed by non-fault-tolerant state preparation followed by a teleportation gadget. First, we benchmark individual logical components using randomized benchmarking for the logical two-qubit gate, and a Ramsey-type experiment for the logical $T$ gate. We then implement the full QFT circuit, using two different methods for performing a logical control-$T$, and benchmark the circuits by applying it to each basis state in a set of bases that is sufficient to lower bound the process fidelity. We compare the logical QFT benchmark results to predictions based on the logical component benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Automated distribution of high-rate, high-fidelity polarization entangled photons using deployed metropolitan fibers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributing high-fidelity, high-rate entanglement over telecommunication infrastructure is one of the main paths towards large-scale quantum networks, enabling applications such as quantum encryption and network protection, blind quantum computing, distributed quantum computing, and distributed quantum sensing. However, the fragile nature of entangled photons operating in real-world fiber infrastructure has historically limited continuous operation of such networks. Here, we present a fully automated system capable of distributing polarization entangled photons over a 34 km deployed fiber in New York City. We achieve end-to-end pair rates of nearly $5\times10^5$ pairs/s and entanglement fidelity of approximately $99\%$. Separately, we achieve 15 days of continuous distribution, with a network up-time of $99.84\%$. Our work paves the way for practical deployment of 24/7 entanglement-based networks with rates and fidelity adequate for many current and future use-cases.</description>

      <title>Fractal spectrum in twisted bilayer optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The translation symmetry of a lattice is greatly modified when subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field [Zak, Phys. Rev. \textbf{134}, A1602 (1964)]. This change in symmetry can lead to magnetic unit cells that are substantially larger than the original ones. Similarly, the translation properties of a double-layered lattice alters drastically while two monolayers are relatively twisted by a small angle, resulting in large-scale moir\'{e} unit cells. Intrigued by the resemblance, we calculate the complete band structures of a twisted bilayer optical lattice and show that the geometric moir\'{e} effect can induce fractal band structures. The fractals are controlled by the twist angle between two monolayers and are closely connected to the celebrated butterfly spectrum of two-dimensional Bloch electrons in a magnetic field [Hofstadter, Phys. Rev. B \textbf{14}, 2239 (1976)]. We demonstrate this by proving that the twisted bilayer optical lattice can be mapped to a generalized Hofstadter's model with long-range hopping. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence on the infinite recursive structures of the spectrum and give an algorithm for computing these structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum metric and topological Euler number in a cyclically modulated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with long-range hopping terms. By computing the quantum geometry tensor, we derive exactly expressions for the quantum metric and Berry curvature of the energy band electrons, and we obtain the phase diagram of the model marked by the first Chern number. Furthermore, we also obtain the topological Euler number of the energy band based on the Gauss-Bonnet theorem on the topological characterization of the closed Bloch states manifold in the first Brillouin zone. However, some regions where the Berry curvature is identically zero in the first Brillouin zone results in the degeneracy of the quantum metric, which leads to ill-defined non-integer topological Euler numbers. Nevertheless, the non-integer "Euler number" provides valuable insights and provide an upper bound for absolute values of the Chern numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular docking (MD) is a crucial task in drug design, which predicts the position, orientation, and conformation of the ligand when bound to a target protein. It can be interpreted as a combinatorial optimization problem, where quantum annealing (QA) has shown promising advantage for solving combinatorial optimization. In this work, we propose a novel quantum molecular docking (QMD) approach based on QA-inspired algorithm. We construct two binary encoding methods to efficiently discretize the degrees of freedom with exponentially reduced number of bits and propose a smoothing filter to rescale the rugged objective function. We propose a new quantum-inspired algorithm, hopscotch simulated bifurcation (hSB), showing great advantage in optimizing over extremely rugged energy landscapes. This hSB can be applied to any formulation of objective function under binary variables. An adaptive local continuous search is also introduced for further optimization of the discretized solution from hSB. Concerning the stability of docking, we propose a perturbation detection method to help ranking the candidate poses. We demonstrate our approach on a typical dataset. QMD has shown advantages over the search-based Autodock Vina and the deep-learning DIFFDOCK in both re-docking and self-docking scenarios. These results indicate that quantum-inspired algorithms can be applied to solve practical problems in the drug discovery even before quantum hardware become mature.</description>

      <title>Probing spontaneously symmetry-broken phases with spin-charge separation through noise correlation measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneously symmetry-broken (SSB) phases are locally ordered states of matter characterizing a large variety of physical systems. Because of their specific ordering, their presence is usually witnessed by means of local order parameters. Here, we propose an alternative approach based on statistical correlations of noise after the ballistic expansion of an atomic cloud. We indeed demonstrate that probing such noise correlators allows one to discriminate among different SSB phases characterized by spin-charge separation. As a particular example, we test our prediction on a 1D extended Fermi-Hubbard model, where the competition between local and nonlocal couplings gives rise to three different SSB phases: a charge density wave, a bond-ordering wave, and an antiferromagnet. Our numerical analysis shows that this approach can accurately capture the presence of these different SSB phases, thus representing an alternative and powerful strategy to characterize strongly interacting quantum matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of two coupled SYK models, conjectured to be holographically dual to an eternal traversable wormhole in AdS$_2$. We consider different periodic drivings of the parameters of the system. We analyze the energy flows in the wormhole and black hole phases of the model as a function of the driving frequency. Our numerical results show a series of resonant frequencies in which the energy absorption and heating are enhanced significantly and the transmission coefficients drop, signalling a closure of the wormhole. These frequencies correspond to part of the conformal tower of states and to the boundary graviton of the dual gravitational theory. Furthermore, we provide evidence supporting the existence of a hot wormhole phase between the black hole and wormhole phases. When driving the strength of the separate SYK terms we find that the transmission can be enhanced by suitably tuning the driving.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the experimental control of pair tunneling in a double-well potential using Floquet engineering. We demonstrate a crossover from a regime with density-assisted tunneling to dominant pair tunneling by tuning the effective interactions. Furthermore, we show that the pair tunneling rate can be enhanced not only compared to the Floquet-reduced single-particle tunneling but even beyond the static superexchange rate, while keeping the effective interaction in a relevant range. This opens possibilities to realize models with explicit pair tunneling in ultracold atomic systems.</description>

Abstract: We propose a theory for coupling matter fields with discrete geometry on higher-order networks, i.e. cell complexes. The key idea of the approach is to associate to a higher-order network the quantum entropy of its metric. Specifically we propose an action given by the quantum relative entropy between the metric of the higher-order network and the metric induced by the matter and gauge fields. The induced metric is defined in terms of the topological spinors and the discrete Dirac operators. The topological spinors, defined on nodes, edges and higher-dimensional cells, encode for the matter fields. The discrete Dirac operators act on topological spinors, and depend on the metric of the higher-order network as well as on the gauge fields via a discrete version of the minimal substitution. We derive the coupled dynamical equations for the metric, the matter and the gauge fields, providing an information theory principle to obtain the field theory equations in discrete curved space.</description>

      <title>Chapter: Vulnerability of Quantum Information Systems to Collective Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:1901.08873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The highly specialist terms `quantum computing' and `quantum information', together with the broader term `quantum technologies', now appear regularly in the mainstream media. While this is undoubtedly highly exciting for physicists and investors alike, a key question for society concerns such systems' vulnerabilities -- and in particular, their vulnerability to collective manipulation. Here we present and discuss a new form of vulnerability in such systems, that we have identified based on detailed many-body quantum mechanical calculations. The impact of this new vulnerability is that groups of adversaries can maximally disrupt these systems' global quantum state which will then jeopardize their quantum functionality. It will be almost impossible to detect these attacks since they do not change the Hamiltonian and the purity remains the same; they do not entail any real-time communication between the attackers; and they can last less than a second. We also argue that there can be an implicit amplification of such attacks because of the statistical character of modern non-state actor groups. A countermeasure could be to embed future quantum technologies within redundant classical networks. We purposely structure the discussion in this chapter so that the first sections are self-contained and can be read by non-specialists.</description>

      <title>Coherent States for infinite homogeneous waveguide arrays: Cauchy coherent states for $E(2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.00872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perelomov coherent states for equally spaced, infinite homogeneous waveguide arrays with Euclidean E(2) symmetry are defined, and a new resolution of the identity is obtained. The key point to construct this novel resolution of the identity is the fact that coherent states satisfy the Helmholtz equation (in coherent states labels), and thus every coherent state belongs to a one-parameter family uniquely determined by the Cauchy initial data of the coherent state in a one-dimensional Cauchy set. For this reason we call \textit{Cauchy coherent} states to these initial data. The novel, non-local resolution of the identity in terms of Cauchy coherent states is provided using frame theory. It is also shown that Perelomov coherent states for the Eucliean E(2) group have a simple and natural physical realization in these waveguide arrays.</description>

      <title>Entangled atomic ensemble and an yttrium-iron-garnet sphere in coupled microwave cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a scheme to generate distant bipartite and tripartite entanglement between an atomic ensemble and an yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere in coupled microwave cavities. We consider an atomic ensemble in a single-mode microwave cavity which is coupled with a second single-mode cavity having a YIG sphere. Our system, therefore, has five excitation modes namely cavity-1 photons, atomic ensemble, cavity-2 photons, a magnon and a phonon mode in the YIG sphere. We show that significant bipartite entanglement exists between indirectly coupled subsystems in the cavities, which is robust against temperature. Moreover, we present suitable parameters for a significant tripartite entanglement of ensemble, magnon, and phonon modes. We also demonstrate the existence of tripartite entanglement between magnon and phonon modes of the YIG sphere with indirectly coupled cavity photons. Interestingly, this distant tripartite entanglement is of the same order as previously found for a single-cavity system. We show that cavity-cavity coupling strength affects both the degree and transfer of quantum entanglement between various subsystems. Therefore, an appropriate cavity-cavity coupling optimizes the distant entanglement by increasing the entanglement strength and its robustness against temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-photon sources are in high demand for quantum information applications. A paradigmatic way to achieve single-photon emission is through anharmonicity in the energy levels, such that the absorption of a single photon from a coherent drive shifts the system out of resonance and prevents absorption of a second one. We identify a novel mechanism for single-photon emission through non-Hermitian anharmonicity, i.e., anharmonicity in the losses instead of in the energy levels. We demonstrate the mechanism in two types of systems, including a feasible setup consisting of a hybrid metallodielectric cavity weakly coupled to a two-level emitter, and show that it induces high-purity single-photon emission at high repetition rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement is a fundamental property in quantum mechanics that systems share inseparable quantum correlation regardless of their mutual distances. Owing to the fundamental significance and versatile applications, the generation of quantum entanglement between {\it macroscopic} systems has been a focus of current research. Here we report on the deterministic generation and tomography of the macroscopically entangled Bell state in a hybrid quantum system containing a millimeter-sized spin system ($\sim 1\times10^{19}$ atoms) and a micrometer-sized superconducting qubit. The deterministic generation is realized by coupling the macroscopic spin system and the qubit via a microwave cavity. Also, we develop a joint tomography approach to confirming the deterministic generation of the Bell state, which gives a generation fidelity of $0.90\pm0.01$. Our work makes the macroscopic spin system the {\it largest} system (in the sense of atom number) capable of generating the maximally entangled quantum state.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Tanner codes constitute a family of quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with good parameters, i.e., constant encoding rate and relative distance. In this article, we prove that quantum Tanner codes also facilitate single-shot quantum error correction (QEC) of adversarial noise, where one measurement round (consisting of constant-weight parity checks) suffices to perform reliable QEC even in the presence of measurement errors. We establish this result for both the sequential and parallel decoding algorithms introduced by Leverrier and Z\'emor. Furthermore, we show that in order to suppress errors over multiple repeated rounds of QEC, it suffices to run the parallel decoding algorithm for constant time in each round. Combined with good code parameters, the resulting constant-time overhead of QEC and robustness to (possibly time-correlated) adversarial noise make quantum Tanner codes alluring from the perspective of quantum fault-tolerant protocols.</description>

Abstract: Hydrogen has emerged as a promising energy source, holding the key to achieve low-carbon and sustainable mobility. However, its applications are still limited by modest conversion efficiency in the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) within fuel cells. Consequently, the development of novel catalysts and a profound understanding of the underlying reactions have become of paramount importance. The complex nature of the ORR potential energy landscape and the presence of strong electronic correlations present challenges to atomistic modelling using classical computers. This scenario opens new avenues for the implementation of novel quantum computing workflows to address these molecular systems. Here, we present a pioneering study that combines classical and quantum computational approaches to investigate the ORR on pure platinum and platinum/cobalt surfaces. Our research demonstrates, for the first time, the feasibility of implementing this workflow on the H1-series trapped-ion quantum computer and identify the challenges of the quantum chemistry modelling of this reaction. The results highlight the involvement of strongly correlated species in the cobalt-containing catalyst, suggesting their potential as ideal candidates for showcasing quantum advantage in future applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermodynamic behavior of Markovian open quantum systems can be described at the level of fluctuations by using continuous monitoring approaches. However, practical applications require assessing imperfect detection schemes, where the definition of main thermodynamic quantities becomes subtle and universal fluctuation relations are unknown. Here we fill this gap by deriving a universal fluctuation relation that links entropy production in ideal and in inefficient monitoring setups. This provides a suitable estimator of dissipation using imperfect detection records that lower bounds the underlying entropy production at the level of single trajectories. We illustrate our findings with a driven-dissipative two-level system following quantum jump trajectories.</description>

Abstract: We develop a general formulation of quantum statistical mechanics in terms of probability currents that satisfy continuity equations in the multi-particle position space, for closed and open systems with a fixed number of particles. The continuity equation for any closed or open system suggests a natural Bohmian interpretation in terms of microscopic particle trajectories, that make the same measurable predictions as standard quantum theory. The microscopic trajectories are not directly observable, but provide a general, simple and intuitive microscopic interpretation of macroscopic phenomena in quantum statistical mechanics. In particular, we discuss how various notions of entropy, proper and improper mixtures, and thermodynamics are understood from the Bohmian perspective.</description>

      <title>Number-State Reconstruction with a Single Single-Photon Avalanche Detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-photon avalanche detectors (SPADs) are crucial sensors of light for many fields and applications. However, they are not able to resolve photon number, so typically more complex and more expensive experimental setups or devices must be used to measure the number of photons in a pulse. Here, we present a methodology for performing photon number-state reconstruction with only one SPAD. The methodology, which is cost-effective and easy to implement, uses maximum-likelihood techniques with a detector model whose parameters are measurable. We achieve excellent agreement between known input pulses and their reconstructions for coherent states with up to $\approx$ 10 photons and peak input photon rates up to several Mcounts/s. When detector imperfections are small, we maintain good agreement for coherent pulses with peak input photon rates of over 40 Mcounts/s, greater than one photon per detector dead time. For anti-bunched light, the reconstructed and independently measured pulse-averaged values of $g^{(2)}(0)$ are also consistent with one another. Our algorithm is applicable to light pulses whose pulse width and correlation time scales are both at least a few detector dead times. These results, achieved with single commercially available SPADs, provide an inexpensive number-state reconstruction method and expand the capabilities of single-photon detectors.</description>

      <title>Optimized synthesis of circuits for diagonal unitary matrices with reflection symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, it is important to optimize the quantum circuits in circuit depth and gate count, especially entanglement gates, including the CNOT gate. Among all the unitary operators, diagonal unitary matrices form a special class that plays a crucial role in many quantum algorithms/subroutines. Based on a natural gate set {CNOT, Rz}, quantum circuits for general diagonal unitary matrices were discussed in several previous works, and an optimal synthesis algorithm was proposed in terms of circuit depth. In this paper, we are interested in the implementation of diagonal unitary matrices with reflection symmetry, which has promising applications, including the realization of real-time evolution for first quantized Hamiltonians by quantum circuits. Owing to such a symmetric property, we show that the quantum circuit in the existing work can be further simplified and propose a constructive algorithm that optimizes the entanglement gate count. Compared to the previous synthesis methods for general diagonal unitary matrices, the quantum circuit by our proposed algorithm achieves nearly half the reduction in both the gate count and circuit depth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent times, hybrid entanglement (HE) between a qubit and a coherent state has demonstrated superior performance in various quantum information processing tasks, particularly in quantum key distribution. Despite its theoretical advantages, efficient generation of such states in the laboratory has been a challenge. Here, we introduce a deterministic and efficient approach for generating HE states using quantum walks. Our method achieves a remarkable fidelity of $99.9\%$ with just $20$ time steps in a one-dimensional split-step quantum walk. This represents a significant improvement over prior approaches for probabilistic generation of HE states with fidelity as low as $80\%$. Our scheme not only provides a robust solution to the generation of HE states but also highlights a unique advantage of quantum walks, thereby contributing to the advancement of this burgeoning field. Moreover, our scheme is experimentally feasible with the current technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cavity magnomechanics has shown great potential in studying macroscopic quantum effects, especially for quantum entanglement, which is a key resource for quantum information science. Here we propose to realize magnon mediated nonreciprocal photon-phonon entanglement, which exhibits asymmetry when opposite magnetic or driving fields are respectively applied to the magnons with the Kerr effect or the photons with the Sagnac effect. We find that the mean magnon number can selectively exhibit nonreciprocal linear or nonlinear (bistable) behavior with the strength of the strong driving field on the cavity. Assisted by this driving field, the magnon-phonon coupling is greatly enhanced, leading to the nonreciprocal photon-phonon entanglement via the swapping interaction between the magnons and photons. This nonreciprocal entanglement can be significantly enhanced with the magnon Kerr and Sagnac effects. Given the available parameters, the nonreciprocal photon-phonon entanglement can be preserved at $\sim3$ K, showing remarkable resilience against the bath temperature. The result reveals that our paper holds promise in developing various nonreciprocal devices with both the magnon Kerr and Sagnac effects in cavity magnomechanics.</description>

Abstract: Harnessing the advantages of shared entanglement for sending quantum messages often requires the implementation of complex two-particle entangled measurements. We investigate entanglement advantages in protocols that use only the simplest two-particle measurements, namely product measurements. For experiments in which only the dimension of the message is known, we show that robust entanglement advantages are possible, but that they are fundamentally limited by Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. Subsequently, we propose a natural extension of the standard scenario for these experiments and show that it circumvents this limitation. This leads us to prove entanglement advantages from every entangled two-qubit Werner state, evidence its generalisation to high-dimensional systems and establish a connection to quantum teleportation. Our results reveal the power of product measurements for generating quantum correlations in entanglement-assisted communication and they pave the way for practical semi-device-independent entanglement certification well-beyond the constraints of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering.</description>

      <title>One-step implementation of nonadiabatic geometric fSim gate in superconducting circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to its significant application in reducing algorithm depth, fSim gates have attracted a lot of attention. However, during the implementation of quantum gates, fluctuations in control parameters and decoherence caused by the environment may lead to a decrease in the fidelity of the gate. Implementing the fSim gate that is robust to these factors in one step remains an unresolved issue. In this manuscript, we propose a one-step implementation of the nonadiabatic geometric fSim gate composed of a nonadiabatic holonomic controlled phase (CP) gate and a nonadiabatic noncyclic geometric iSWAP gate with parallel paths in a tunable superconducting circuit. Compared to the composite nonadiabatic geometric fSim gate composed of a nonadiabatic holonomic CP gate and a nonadiabatic geometric iSWAP gate, our scheme only takes half the time and demonstrates robustness to parameter fluctuations, as well as to environmental impacts. Moreover, the scheme does not require complex controls, making it very easy to implement in experiments, and can be achieved in various circuit structures. Our scheme may provide a promising path toward quantum computation and simulation.</description>

      <title>Experimental bounds on linear-friction dissipative collapse models from levitated optomechanics</title>

Abstract: Collapse models constitute an alternative to quantum mechanics that solve the well-know quantum measurement problem. In this framework, a novel approach to include dissipation in collapse models has been recently proposed, and awaits experimental validation. Our work establishes experimental bounds on the so-constructed linear-friction dissipative Di\'osi-Penrose (dDP) and Continuous Spontaneous localisation (dCSL) models by exploiting experiments in the field of levitated optomechanics. Our results in the dDP case exclude collapse temperatures below $ 10^{-13}$K and $ 6 \times 10^{-12}$K respectively for values of the localisation length smaller than $10^{-6}$m and $10^{-8}$m. In the dCSL case the entire parameter space is excluded for values of the temperature lower than $6 \times 10^{-9}$K.</description>

      <title>Recursive expansion of Tanner graph: a method to construct stabilizer codes with high coding rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum stabilizer codes face the problem of low coding rate. In this article, following the idea of recursively expanding Tanner graph proposed in our previous work, we try to construct new stabilizer codes with high coding rate, and propose XZ-type Tanner-graph-recursive-expansion (XZ-TGRE) code and Tanner-graph-recursive-expansion hypergraph product (TGRE-HP) code. XZ-TGRE code have zero asymptotic coding rate, but its coding rate tends to zero extremely slowly with the growth of code length. Under the same code length, its coding rate is much higher than that of surface code. The coding rate of TGRE-HP is the constant 0.2, which is the highest constant coding rate of stabilizer codes to our best knowledge. We prove that the code distance of XZ-TGRE code scales as $O(log(N))$, and that of TGRE-HP code scales as $O(\log \sqrt{N})$, where $N$ is the code length. Moreover, the code capacity noise threshold of XZ-TGRE code is around 0.078, and that of TGRE-HP code is around 0.096. This articles shows that the idea of recursively expanding Tanner graph might have potential to construct quantum codes with good performance.</description>

      <title>Theory-Independent Realism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The distinctive features of quantum mechanics, which set it apart from other physical theories, challenge our notions of realism. Recovering realism from purely philosophical grounds, a quantitative and operational criterion was proposed in the past, but solely for the context of quantum mechanics. We use a framework of generalized probabilistic theories to expand the notion of realism for a theory-independent context, providing a criterion uniquely based on the probabilities assigned to measurement outcomes. More so, using robustness and the Kullback-Leibler divergence, we propose quantifiers for the realism of arbitrary physical properties given a particular state of a generic physical theory. These theory-independent quantifiers are then employed in quantum mechanics and we investigate their relation with another well-established irrealism measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we report first exact volume-entangled Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) type scar states hosted by PXP and related Hamiltonians corresponding to various geometric configurations of Rydberg-blockaded atom systems, including the most extensively studied ones such as the chain with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) and square lattice. We start by introducing a new zero-energy eigenstate of the PBC chain and proceed by generalizing it to a wide variety of geometries and Hamiltonians. We point out the experimental relevance of such states by providing a concrete and feasible protocol for their preparation on near-term Rydberg quantum devices, which relies only on strictly local measurements and evolution under native Hamiltonians. We also demonstrate the utility of these states for the study of quantum dynamics by describing a simple protocol for measuring infinite-temperature out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) relies on innovative methods to enhance its security and efficiency. Unextendible Product Bases (UPBs) hold promise in quantum cryptography due to their inherent indistinguishability, yet they are underutilized in QKD protocols. This work introduces a protocol utilizing UPBs to establish quantum keys between distant parties. Specifically, we propose a protocol utilizing a $3\times 3$ tile UPB, where Alice sequentially transmits subsystem states to Bob through quantum channels. The protocol's security is underpinned by the no-cloning theorem, prohibiting the cloning of orthogonal states. We analyze potential attacks, including intercept-resend and detector blinding attacks when quantum channels are noiseless, and discuss the challenges posed by the indistinguishability of our protocol for eavesdroppers, thereby enhancing QKD security.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that any pseudoentangled state ensemble with a gap of $t$ bits of entropy requires $\Omega(t)$ non-Clifford gates to prepare. This bound is tight up to polylogarithmic factors if linear-time quantum-secure pseudorandom functions exist. Our result follows from a polynomial-time algorithm to estimate the entanglement entropy of a quantum state across any cut of qubits. When run on an $n$-qubit state that is stabilized by at least $2^{n-t}$ Pauli operators, our algorithm produces an estimate that is within an additive factor of $\frac{t}{2}$ bits of the true entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Modeling the effects of perturbations and steepest entropy ascent on the time evolution of entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents an analysis of the evolution of perturbed Bell diagonal states using the equation of motion of steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics (SEAQT), the Lindblad equation, and various measures of loss of entanglement. First, a brief derivation is presented showing that Bell diagonal states are stationary states that are not stable equilibrium states relative to the SEAQT equation of motion, highlighting the need for the development of perturbation methods to study the evolutions of nearby states. This contrasts with the Lindblad equation of motion for which only some of the Bell diagonal states are stationary. Next, two perturbation methods are presented. The first is a general method for perturbing bipartite systems and the second is a method based on a set of unitary operations that are constrained to hold the system energy and system entropy constant. Sets of density operators are randomly generated with each method and the resulting time-varying characteristics of the system's entanglement are analyzed. The findings reveal that the evolutions associated with the constrained perturbations accurately predict the loss of non-locality and align well with the measured concurrence.</description>

Abstract: We propose a direct (non-recursive) algorithm for applying a rotation $R_{\theta^\ast}$, $\epsilon$-close to a desired rotation $R_\theta$, to a single qubit using the Clifford+Toffoli gate set. Our algorithm does not rely on repeatedly applying a fixed rotation, but immediately applies $R_{\theta^\ast}$. It succeeds with probability strictly greater than $1/2$, has an expected number of repetitions strictly less than 2, expected Toffoli count logarithmic in $\tfrac{1}{\epsilon}$, and expected gate depth also logarithmic in $\tfrac{1}{\epsilon}$.</description>

      <title>Geometric characterization for cyclic heat engines far from equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considerable attention has been devoted to microscopic heat engines in both theoretical and experimental aspects. Notably, the fundamental limits pertaining to power and efficiency, as well as the tradeoff relations between these two quantities, have been intensively studied. This study aims to shed further light on the ultimate limits of heat engines by exploring the relationship between the geometric length along the path of cyclic heat engines operating at arbitrary speeds and their power and efficiency. We establish a tradeoff relation between power and efficiency using the geometric length and the timescale of the heat engine. Remarkably, because the geometric quantity comprises experimentally accessible terms in classical cases, this relation is useful for the inference of thermodynamic efficiency. Moreover, we reveal that the power of a heat engine is always upper bounded by the product of its geometric length and the statistics of energy. Our results provide a geometric characterization of the performance of cyclic heat engines, which is universally applicable to both classical and quantum heat engines operating far from equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the work of [2008.03319], we define a generally covariant max-entanglement wedge of a boundary region $B$, which we conjecture to be the bulk region reconstructible from $B$. We similarly define a covariant min-entanglement wedge, which we conjecture to be the bulk region that can influence the state on $B$. We prove that the min- and max-entanglement wedges obey various properties necessary for this conjecture, such as nesting, inclusion of the causal wedge, and a reduction to the usual quantum extremal surface prescription in the appropriate special cases. These proofs rely on one-shot versions of the (restricted) quantum focusing conjecture (QFC) that we conjecture to hold. We argue that these QFCs imply a one-shot generalized second law (GSL) and quantum Bousso bound. Moreover, in a particular semiclassical limit we prove this one-shot GSL directly using algebraic techniques. Finally, in order to derive our results, we extend both the frameworks of one-shot quantum Shannon theory and state-specific reconstruction to finite-dimensional von Neumann algebras, allowing nontrivial centers.</description>

      <title>On the mass transfer in the 3D Pitaevskii model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine a micro-scale model of superfluidity derived by Pitaevskii in 1959 which describes the interacting dynamics between superfluid He-4 and its normal fluid phase. This system consists of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and the incompressible, inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes equations, coupled to each other via a bidirectional nonlinear relaxation mechanism. The coupling permits mass/momentum/energy transfer between the phases, and accounts for the conversion of superfluid into normal fluid. We prove the existence of weak solutions in $\mathbb{T}^3$ for a power-type nonlinearity, beginning from small initial data. The main challenge is to control the inter-phase mass transfer in order to ensure the strict positivity of the normal fluid density, while obtaining time-independent a priori estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study many-body entanglements and spectra of the extended bosonic Hatano-Nelson model in the hard-core limit. We show that the system undergoes a phase transition from a gapless phase to a charge density wave phase accompanied by a $\mathcal{PT}$ transition in the first excited state. The phase transition is characterized by the crossing of the ground-state biorthogonal order parameter and the sudden change of the first excited-state entanglement entropy. The gapless phase is verified by the logarithmic scaling of the ground-state entanglement entropy with the central charge $c=1$. Furthermore, we show that all energy spectral clusters would form ellipses in strong nearest-neighbor interactions, for which we establish a universal scaling law. The lengths of the major and minor axes are shown to obey power laws with respect to the nearest-neighbor interaction. The exact expressions are derived for the numbers of energy levels on the outermost elliptic ring of each clusters.</description>

      <title>Quantum Isotropic Universe in RQM Analogy: the Cosmological Horizon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of the isotropic Universe in the presence of a free massless scalar field, playing the role of a physical clock. The Hilbert space is constructed via a direct analogy between the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in the minisuperspace and a relativistic scalar one in physical space. In particular, we show how the introduction of a "turning point" in the Universe evolution allows to overcome an intrinsic ambiguity in representing the expanding and collapsing Universe. In this way, the positive and negative frequencies are simply identified with time reversed states. The main subject of the present analysis is the construction of a horizon operator, whose quantum behavior is investigated when Polymer Quantum Mechanics is implemented to describe the asymptotic evolution near the initial singularity. The reason of this choice is motivated by the intrinsic spreading of localized wavepackets when the polymer dispersion relation governs the quantum dynamics. The evidence that the mean value of the quantum horizon operator follows its semiclassical behavior (corrected for polymerization) is a clear indication that a concept of causality can be restored also in the quantum cosmological picture.</description>
