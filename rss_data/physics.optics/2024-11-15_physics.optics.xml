      <title>Perfect absorption of molecular vibration enabled by critical coupling in molecular metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The absorption and emission spectrum arising from the vibrational motion of a molecule is mostly in the infrared region. These fingerprint absorptions of polar bonds enable us to acquire bond-specific chemical information from specimens. However, the mode mismatch between the atomic-scale dimensions of the chemical bonds and the resonance wavelength limits the direct detection of tiny amounts of samples such as self-assembled monolayers or biological membranes. To overcome this limitation, surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRA) has been proposed to enhance infrared absorption directly via local field enhancement. Here, we report on the perfect absorption of molecular vibration enabled by critical coupling in the metamaterials. Our molecular metamaterial design consists of a thin polymer layer sandwiched between a structured metal layer on top and a continuous metal layer at the bottom that supports the gap plasmon mode. The measured and simulated infrared spectra of the molecular metamaterial show broad and narrow absorption bands corresponding to the metamaterial and molecular vibration modes. We show that by tuning the structure's molecular film thickness and periodicity, vibrational absorption can be enhanced to near unity. We also show that for a particular periodicity of the array, metamaterial resonance can be completely suppressed, and only molecular vibrational absorption is excited, giving rise to an extremely narrow absorption band.</description>

      <title>Quantum Nanophotonics with Energetic Particles:X-rays and Free Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid progress in precision nanofabrication and atomic design over the past 50 years has ushered in a succession of transformative eras for molding the generation and flow of light. The use of nanoscale and atomic features to design light sources and optical elements-encapsulated by the term nanophotonics-has led to new fundamental science and innovative technologies across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with substantial emphasis on the microwave to visible regimes. In this review, we pay special attention to the impact and potential of nanophotonics in a relatively exotic yet technologically disruptive regime: high-energy particles such as X-ray photons and free electrons-where nanostructures and atomic design open the doors to unprecedented technologies in quantum science and versatile X-ray sources and optics. As the practical generation of X-rays is intrinsically linked to the existence of energetic free or quasi-free-electrons, our review will also capture related phenomena and technologies that combine free electrons with nanophotonics, including free-electron-driven nanophotonics at other photon energies. In particular, we delve into the demonstration and study of quantum recoil in the X-ray regime, the study of nanomaterial design and free-electron wave shaping as means to enhance and control X-ray radiation, examine the free-electron generation enabled by nanophotonics, and analyze the high-harmonic generation by quasi-free electrons. We also discuss applications of quantum nanophotonics for X-rays and free electrons, including nanostructure waveguides for X-rays, photon pair enhanced X-ray imaging, mirrors, and lenses for X-rays, among others.</description>

      <title>Enhanced sensitivity of sub-THz thermomechanical bolometers exploiting vibrational nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common approach to detecting weak signals or minute quantities involves leveraging on the localized spectral features of resonant modes, where sharper lines (i.e. high Q-factors) enhance transduction sensitivity. However, maximizing the Q-factor often introduced technical challenges in fabrication and design. In this work, we propose an alternative strategy to achieve sharper spectral features by using interference and nonlinearity, all while maintaining a constant dissipation rate. Using far-infrared thermomechanical detectors as a test case, we demonstrate that signal transduction along an engineered response curve slope effectively reduces the detector's noise equivalent power (NEP). This method, combined with an optimized absorbing layer, achieves sub-pW NEP for electrical read-out detectors operating in the sub-THz range.</description>

      <title>Computational metaoptics for imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces -- ultrathin structures composed of subwavelength optical elements -- have revolutionized light manipulation by enabling precise control over electromagnetic waves' amplitude, phase, polarization, and spectral properties. Concurrently, computational imaging leverages algorithms to reconstruct images from optically processed signals, overcoming limitations of traditional imaging systems. This review explores the synergistic integration of metaoptics and computational imaging, "computational metaoptics," which combines the physical wavefront shaping ability of metasurfaces with advanced computational algorithms to enhance imaging performance beyond conventional limits. We discuss how computational metaoptics addresses the inherent limitations of single-layer metasurfaces in achieving multifunctionality without compromising efficiency. By treating metasurfaces as physical preconditioners and co-designing them with reconstruction algorithms through end-to-end (inverse) design, it is possible to jointly optimize the optical hardware and computational software. This holistic approach allows for the automatic discovery of optimal metasurface designs and reconstruction methods that significantly improve imaging capabilities. Advanced applications enabled by computational metaoptics are highlighted, including phase imaging and quantum state measurement, which benefit from the metasurfaces' ability to manipulate complex light fields and the computational algorithms' capacity to reconstruct high-dimensional information. We also examine performance evaluation challenges, emphasizing the need for new metrics that account for the combined optical and computational nature of these systems. Finally, we identify new frontiers in computational metaoptics which point toward a future where computational metaoptics may play a central role in advancing imaging science and technology.</description>

      <title>Germanium Metasurface for MWIR Polarization-Sensitive Stokes Thermal Imaging at 4-micron wavelength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mid-wave (MWIR) spectral range can provide a larger bandwidth for optical sensing and communication when the near-infrared band gets congested. As optical sensing becomes a robust technique for digital imaging and object recognition, this range of thermal imaging needs to convey more information, which can be unraveled from polarization-sensitive detection by integrating the metasurface of the subwavelength scale structured interface to control light-matter interaction. To enforce metasurface-enable simultaneous detection and parallel analysis of polarization states in a compact footprint for 4-micron wavelength, we design a high-contrast Germanium metasurface with an axially asymmetric triangular nanoantenna of the thickness of 0.525 times the wavelength. First, we optimized linear polarization separation of a 52-degree angle with 50% transmission efficiency, holding the meta-element aspect ratio from the 3.5-1.67 range. The transmission modulation in terms of periodicity and lattice resonance for the phase gradient high contrast dielectric grating in correlation with scattering cross-section for both 1D and 2D cases has been discussed, which enables the reduction of the aspect ratio to meet the nanofabrication challenge. Further, by employing the geometric phase, we get 40% and 60% transmission contrast for linear and circular polarization states, respectively, and reconstruct the Stokes vectors and output polarization states. Without spatial multiplexing, this single metasurface unit cell can perform well for the division of focal plane Stoke thermal imaging with an almost 5-degree tilted incidence, excellent refractive index, and height tolerance.</description>

      <title>Solving the Inverse Band-Structure Problem for Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a symmetry-agnostic topology optimization framework for photonic-crystal structures based on computation of the photonic density of states in a manner analogous to $\Gamma$-point integration. We provide a generalization of the approach that allows for computations at different scales with the additional scales being analogous to integration over the full Brillouin zone and to regimes between the two limiting cases of full Brillouin-zone integration and $\Gamma$-point integration, though these other scales do not preserve the symmetry-agnostic nature of the $\Gamma$-point framework. We also demonstrate how our approach can be generalized to the problem of inverting photonic or phononic bandstructures. Finally, we show that at the symmetry-agnostic scale analogous to $\Gamma$-point integration, we can recover a known two-dimensional photonic crystal for the TM polarization. A key insight of our work is the determination of the minimum supercell size and the minimum precision to which the frequencies within the photonic bandgap must be sampled in order to observe photonic-crystal structures.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Carrier Dynamics in Multiple Quantum Well P-I-N Photodiodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum well (QW) structures are widely used in lasers, semiconductor optical amplifiers, modulators, enabling their monolithic integration on the same substrate. As optoelectronic systems evolve to meet the growing bandwidth demands in the terahertz regime, a deep understanding of ultrafast carrier dynamics in QW structures becomes essential. We introduce a comprehensive model to analyze the ultrafast dynamics of interband photo-excited carriers in QW p-i-n structures and to calculate their frequency response. This model characterizes the entire photocarrier transport process, including carrier escape from QWs and movement across heterojunction interfaces. Additionally, we outline theoretical methods for calculating carrier escape times from both QWs and heterojunction interfaces. Using a GaAs/AlGaAs QW p-i-n structure as a case study, we discuss the effects of carrier escape times from QWs and heterojunction interfaces, as well as carrier transit time through the intrinsic region, on the frequency response of QW p-i-n structures.</description>

      <title>Improvement in the Removal Efficiency of the Ultraviolet Laser Ablation by an Additional Simultaneous Irradiation of a Weak Infrared Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remarkable improvement in the removal efficiency of the ultraviolet laser (fourth harmonic wave of Nd:YAG laser) ablation was observed by irradiating a weak infrared laser (fundamental wave of Nd:YAG laser) simultaneously and additionally to various kinds of materials, such as copper, acrylic resin, alumina, silicon and amorphous carbon. The improvement ratio ranged from 50% to 280%, while the laser fluency of the infrared laser was as small as about 1.6% of that of the ultraviolet laser. Although, we have not succeed in explaining the reasons why this effect occurs, it will have the potentiality to decrease the photon cost in the wide range of ultraviolet laser machining, because the method and the phenomena are simple and clear. The improvement in the morphology was also observed, when it is applied to the laser lathe micromachining.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emulsions are ubiquitous in everyday life and find applications in various industries. Optical tweezers (OTs) have emerged as the preferred method for studying emulsion dynamics. In this review, we first introduce the theory of optical trapping and emulsion stability. We then survey applications in the manipulation of emulsions, stability mechanism, the processes of aggregation and coalescence, and important responsive and switchable behaviors. And we overview the instrumentation framework of various OT setups, and evaluate their complexity and cost with a view towards the democratization of this technology. Following this, we delve into basic experimentation methods, the challenges associated with using OTs in emulsion applications. Additionally, we present a promising research outlook, including studies on stability mechanism of emulsions stabilized by compound or mixed emulsifiers or rigid or soft particles, as well as dynamic processes of responsive or functional emulsions.</description>

      <title>Influence of capping layer growth mode on the photoluminescence of InAs quantum dots in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of growth regimes of the silicon capping layer on the optical properties of heterostructures with submonolayer InAs quantum dots embedded in a silicon matrix has been studied. The photoluminescence signal at 1650 nm from submonolayer quantum dots at low temperatures up to 120 K was obtained. It was established that the use of a two-stage method of silicon overgrowing InAs nanoislands makes it possible to increase the photoluminescence intensity by improving the crystalline quality of heterostructures. Analysis of the temperature dependence allowed us to calculate an activation energy for electrons confined in the quantum dots potential well at the level of the thermal energy at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Localization of nanoscale objects with light singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unprecedented atomic-scale measurement resolution has recently been demonstrated in single-shot optical localization metrology based on deep-learning analyses of diffraction patterns of topologically structured light scattered from objects. Here we show that variations in the diffraction patterns caused by positional changes of an object depend upon the spatial derivatives of the magnitude and phase of the incident field, with the latter strongly enhanced at phase singularities. Despite lower intensity near the singularity, an orders-of-magnitude increase in Fisher information contained in the diffraction patterns can be achieved when a nano-object is illuminated by light containing phase singularities, rather than a plane wave. Our work provides a fundamental explanation and motivation for singularity-based metrology with deeply subwavelength precision.</description>

      <title>Photonic frequency multiplexed next-generation reservoir computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a photonic frequency-multiplexed next generation reservoir computer (FM-NGRC) capable of performing real-time inference at GHz speed. NGRCs apply a feed-forward architecture to produce a feature vector directly from the input data over a fixed number of time steps. This feature vector, analogous to the reservoir state in a conventional RC, is used to perform inference by applying a decision layer trained by linear regression. Photonic NGRC provides a flexible platform for real-time inference by forgoing the need for explicit feedback loops inherent to a physical reservoir. The FM-NGRC introduced here defines the memory structure using an optical frequency comb and dispersive fiber while the sinusoidal response of electro-optic Mach-Zehnder interferometers controls the nonlinear transform applied to elements of the feature vector. A programmable waveshaper modulates each comb tooth independently to apply the trained decision layer weights in the analog domain. We apply the FM-NGRC to solve the benchmark nonlinear channel equalization task; after theoretically determining feature vectors that enable high-accuracy distortion compensation, we construct an FM-NGRC that generates these vectors to experimentally demonstrate real-time channel equalization at 5 GS/s with a symbol error rate of $\sim 2\times 10^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic structure integrated superconducting nanowire single-photon detector with BSCCO stripes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) were integrated with plasmonic nanostructures to enhance the absorption efficiency of superconducting BSCCO stripes. A numerical investigation of optimized nanocavity array (NCAI) and nanocavity-trench-array (NCTAI) SNSPDs has revealed that more than one order of magnitude larger absorptance can be achieved at perpendicular incidence, when compared to the corresponding meandered BSCCO pattern in a resonant optical cavity. The SNSPDs were considerably improved either via first and third quarter cavity resonances, as evidenced by the near-field maps and validated by the standard retrieval method. Although, NCAI-SNSPD exhibits slightly larger absorptance, NCTAI-SNSPD remains competitive due to its larger period and significantly smaller filling factor, thereby allowing for quicker electric response.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer vision tasks require processing large amounts of data to perform image classification, segmentation, and feature extraction. Optical preprocessors can potentially reduce the number of floating point operations required by computer vision tasks, enabling low-power and low-latency operation. However, existing optical preprocessors are mostly learned and hence strongly depend on the training data, and thus lack universal applicability. In this paper, we present a metaoptic imager, which implements the Radon transform obviating the need for training the optics. High quality image reconstruction with a large compression ratio of 0.6% is presented through the use of the Simultaneous Algebraic Reconstruction Technique. Image classification with 90% accuracy is presented on an experimentally measured Radon dataset through neural network trained on digitally transformed images.</description>

Abstract: Linear spectra of molecular polaritons formed by $N$ molecules coupled to a microcavity photon mode are usually well described by classical linear optics, raising the question of where the expected nonlinear effects in these strongly coupled systems are. In this work, we derive a general expression for the polaritonic linear spectra that reveal previously overlooked finite-size quantum corrections due to vacuum-mediated molecular Raman processes. Using a $1/N$ expansion, we demonstrate that these nonlinearities are suppressed in typical low-Q cavities due to an emergent timescale separation in polariton dynamics yet manifest in high-Q single-mode cavities where the photon loss is comparable to the single-molecule light-matter coupling strength.</description>

      <title>Polarized Superradiance from CsPbBr3 Quantum Dot Superlattice with Controlled Inter-dot Electronic Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperative emission of photons from an ensemble of quantum dots (QDs) as superradiance can arise from the electronically coupled QDs with a coherent emitting excited state. This contrasts with superfluorescence (Dicke superradiance), where the cooperative photon emission occurs via a spontaneous buildup of coherence in an ensemble of incoherently excited QDs via their coupling to a common radiation mode. While superfluorescence has been observed in perovskite QD systems, reports of superradiance from the electronically coupled ensemble of perovskite QDs are rare. Here, we demonstrate the generation of polarized superradiance with a very narrow linewidth (&lt;5 meV) and a large redshift (~200 meV) from the electronically coupled CsPbBr3 QD superlattice achieved through a combination of strong quantum confinement and ligand engineering. In addition to photon bunching at low excitation densities, the superradiance is polarized in contrast to the uncoupled exciton emission from the same superlattice. This finding suggests the potential for obtaining polarized cooperative photon emission via anisotropic electronic coupling in QD superlattices even when the intrinsic anisotropy of exciton transition in individual QDs is weak.</description>

      <title>Spatial localization and diffusion of Dirac particles and waves induced by random temporal medium variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the consequences of temporal reflection on wave propagation and transformation in systems governed by a pseudospin-1/2 Dirac equation. These systems are spatially uniform but are subject to random temporal variations in mass, which correspond to the energy gap between the Dirac cones. By employing the invariant imbedding method on two complementary random models, we accurately compute all moments of temporal reflectance and derive their analytical expressions in short- and long-time regimes. In the long-time regime, the reflectance probability density is a constant equal to one, indicating uniform probability for any reflectance value. The group velocity of the wave decays to zero with time, signifying spatial localization induced by temporal variations. Numerical simulations of a wave pulse show that the initially narrow pulse evolves into a precisely Gaussian shape over time. In the long-time regime, the pulse center exhibits spatial localization, while its width shows ordinary diffusive behavior, increasing without limit. This behavior is universal, persisting regardless of the initial pulse shape or the probability distribution of the random mass. Our findings suggest that insulating behavior can be induced in Dirac materials by random temporal variations of the medium parameters. We discuss the possibilities of verifying our predictions in various experimental systems.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Terahertz Resonances from Ballistic Electron Funnelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new mechanism for second-harmonic generation through geometrically rectifying-funneling-ballistic electrons in THz optical resonators. Our resonant rectifiers inherently act as second-order harmonic generators, rectifying currents without the presence of a potential barrier. Particle-in-cell simulations reveal that femtosecond electron-surface scattering plays a critical role in this process. We differentiate electron funneling from nonlocal plasmonic drag and bulk Dirac anharmonicity, showing that funneling can reduce the required field intensity for second-harmonic generation by 3-4 orders of magnitude. We provide design guidelines for generating funneling-induced second-harmonic generation, including resonance mode matching and materials selection. This approach offers a practical pathway for low-field, geometrically tunable THz upconversion and rectification, operating from sub-10 THz to multiple tens of THz in graphene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has been experimentally shown to exhibit room-temperature single-photon emission. This emission is attributed to defect states in the wide band-gap of hBN, which allow new optical transitions between these dispersion-less defect levels. In this work, we study the new spectral features introduced by interacting atomic defects in consecutive layers of bilayer hBN. Density Functional theory simulations have been carried out to calculate the energy band structure, frequency-dependent complex dielectric functions, and Kohn-Sham states to demonstrate and understand the cause of the emission enhancements. We found that placing colour centres in the vicinity of each other in bilayer hBN introduces new polarization dependent spectral features, with strong dependence on the distance and relative orientation between atomic defects. Our results provide a pathway to engineering single photon emission in hBN via inter-defect interaction.</description>

      <title>A 2D van der Waals Material for Terahertz Emission with Giant Optical Rectification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exfoliation and stacking of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) crystals have created unprecedented opportunities in the discovery of quantum phases. A major obstacle to the advancement of this field is the limited spectroscopic access due to a mismatch in sample sizes (1 - 10 micrometer) and wavelengths (0.1 - 1 millimeter) of electromagnetic radiation relevant to their low-energy excitations. Here, we introduce a new member of the 2D vdW material family: a terahertz (THz) emitter. We show intense and broadband THz generation from the vdW ferroelectric semiconductor NbOI2 with optical rectification efficiency over one-order-of-magnitude higher than that of the current standard THz emitter, ZnTe. The NbOI2 THz emitter can be easily integrated into vdW heterostructures for on-chip near-field THz spectroscopy of a target vdW material/device. Our approach provides a general spectroscopic tool for the rapidly expanding field of 2D vdW materials and quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Application of signal separation to diffraction image compression and serial crystallography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present here a real-time analysis of diffraction images acquired at high frame-rate (925 Hz) and its application to macromolecular serial crystallography. The software uses a new signal separation algorithm, able to distinguish the amorphous (or powder diffraction) component from the diffraction signal originating from single crystals. It relies on the ability to work efficiently in azimuthal space and derives from the work performed on pyFAI, the fast azimuthal integration library. Two applications are built upon this separation algorithm: a lossy compression algorithm and a peak-picking algo- rithm; the performances of both is assessed by comparing data quality after reduction with XDS and CrystFEL.</description>

Abstract: Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging with intelligent sensors emerges as a novel technique in imaging and sensing occluded objects around corners. With the innovation of bio-inspired neuromorphic sensors, the applications of novel sensors in unconventional imaging tasks like NLOS imaging have shown promising prospects in intelligent perception, encompassing autonomous driving, medical endoscopy and other sensing scenarios. However, the most challenging point of sensors application in computational imaging is the inverse problem established between sensors acquisition and reconstructions. Traditional physical retrieval methods with certain sensors applications usually result in poor reconstruction due to the highly ill-posedness, particularly in moving object imaging. Thanks to the development of neural networks, data-driven methods have greatly improved its accuracy, however, heavy reliance on data volume has put great pressure on data collection and dataset fabrication. To the best of our knowledge, we firstly propose a sensor-dominated restoration prototype termed "event enhanced passive NLOS imaging prototype for moving objects with physical embedding" (EPNP), which illustrated the application of dynamic vision sensors in NLOS imaging. EPNP induces an event camera for feature extraction of dynamic diffusion spot and leverages simulation dataset to pre-train the physical embedded model before fine-tuning with limited real-shot data. The proposed EPNP prototype is verified by simulation and real-world experiments, while the comparisons of data paradigms also validate the superiority of event-based sensor applications in passive NLOS imaging for moving objects and perspectives in advanced imaging techniques.</description>

Abstract: Most modern imaging systems process the data they capture algorithmically before-or instead of-human viewing. As a result, performance depends not on how interpretable the measurements appear, but how effectively they encode details for algorithmic processing. Information theory provides mathematical tools to analyze this, but developing methods that can handle the complexity of real-world measurements yet remain practical enough for widespread use has proven challenging. We introduce a data-driven approach for estimating the information content of imaging system measurements. Our framework requires only experimental measurements and noise characterization, with no need for ground truth data. We demonstrate that these information estimates reliably predict system performance across diverse imaging modalities, including color photography, radio astronomy, lensless imaging, and label-free microscopy. To automate the process of designing imaging systems that maximize information capture we introduce an optimization technique called Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL). The tools we develop in this work unlock information theory as a powerful, practical tool for analyzing and designing imaging systems across a broad range of applications.

      <description>arXiv:2408.12350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a heterodyne stabilized cavity-based interferometer scheme that can serve as a compact and high-sensitivity displacement sensor with a fringe-scale operating range. The technique, in principle, can reach a sub-femtometer noise floor and an operating range on the order of one laser wavelength at $\lambda \approx 1\,\mu m$. With our current experimental setup, we achieve a sensitivity of about $130 fm/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at $1\,Hz$ and $23 fm/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at around $130\,Hz$. By probing a length actuated cavity, we demonstrate six orders of magnitude of dynamic range for displacement measurement, reaching a maximum motion of $0.15\,\mu m$. The tracking bandwidth and displacement range are limited by analog effects in the signal digitization and are extendable in the future.</description>

      <title>Lithium Niobate Photonic Topological Insulator-based Multi-Wavelength Optical Demultiplexer with Piezoelectric Switch-Off</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic topological insulators provide unidirectional, robust, wavelength-selective transport of light at an interface while keeping it insulated at the bulk of the material. The non-trivial topology results in an immunity to backscattering, sharp turns, and fabrication defects. This work leverages these unique properties to design a 2-channel optical demultiplexer based on a lithium niobate photonic topological insulator with piezoelectric switch-off capabilities. A photonic topological insulator design for the demultiplexer allows for good wavelength selectivity, crosstalk as low as $-$54 dB, and better isolation between output channels. The primary operating wavelengths presented are the telecommunication wavelengths of 1310 nm and 1550 nm, but the use of the lithium niobate material allows operation at multiple operating wavelengths. Furthermore, we propose a post-fabrication method to switch off the topological protection and, thus, optical transmittance via an applied voltage utilizing the inverse piezoelectric effect of lithium niobate. This work will contribute to advancing lithium niobate integrated photonics and developing efficient, multi-wavelength, electrically controlled optical communication systems and integrated photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Corner Reflector Plasmonic Nanoantennas for Enhanced Single-Photon Emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emission rate of atom-like photon sources can be significantly improved by coupling them to plasmonic resonant nanostructures. These arrangements function as nanoantennas, serving the dual purpose of enhancing light--matter interactions and decoupling the emitted photons. However, there is a contradiction between the requirements for these two tasks. A small resonator volume is necessary for maximizing interaction efficiency, while a large antenna mode volume is essential to achieve high emission directivity. In this work, we analyze a hybrid structure composed of a noble metal plasmonic resonant nanoparticle coupled to the atom-like emitter, which is designed to enhance the emission rate, alongside a corner reflector aimed at optimizing the angular distribution of the emitted photons. A comprehensive numerical study of silver and gold corner reflector nanoantennas, employing the finite difference time domain method, is presented. The results demonstrate that a well-designed corner reflector can significantly enhance photon emission directivity while also substantially boosting the emission rate.</description>

      <title>Chiral Nonlinear Polaritonics with van der Waals Metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the strong-coupling regime, the interaction between light and matter reaches a hybridization state where the photonic and material components become inseparably linked. Using tailored states of light to break symmetries in such systems can underpin the development of novel non-equilibrium quantum materials. Chiral optical cavities offer a promising way for this, enabling either temporal or spatial symmetry-breaking, both of which are unachievable with conventional mirror cavities. For spatial symmetry-breaking a cavity needs to discriminate the handedness of circularly polarized light, a functionality that can only be achieved with metamaterials. Here, we suggest and demonstrate experimentally a chiral transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) metasurface with broken out-of-plane symmetry, allowing for a selective formation of self-hybridized exciton-polaritons with specific chirality. Our metasurface cavity maintains maximum chirality for oblique incidence up to 20{\deg}, significantly outperforming all previously known designs, thereby turning the angle of incidence from a constraint to a new degree of freedom for sub-nanometer precise control of resonance wavelengths. Moreover, we study the chiral strong-coupling regime in nonlinear experiments and show the polariton-driven nature of chiral third-harmonic generation. Our results demonstrate a clear pathway towards novel quantum material engineering with implications in a wide range of photonics research, such as superconductivity and valleytronics.</description>

      <title>Topological Josephson parametric amplifier array: A proposal for directional, broadband, and low-noise amplification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.13728v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-noise microwave amplifiers are crucial for detecting weak signals in fields such as quantum technology and radio astronomy. However, designing an ideal amplifier is challenging, as it must cover a wide frequency range, add minimal noise, and operate directionally - amplifying signals only in the observer's direction while protecting the source from environmental interference. In this work, we demonstrate that an array of non-linearly coupled Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPAs) can collectively function as a directional, broadband quantum amplifier by harnessing topological effects. By applying a collective four-wave-mixing pump with inhomogeneous amplitudes and linearly increasing phase, we break time-reversal symmetry in the JPA array and stabilize a topological amplification regime where signals are exponentially amplified in one direction and exponentially suppressed in the opposite. We show that compact devices with few sites $N\sim 11-17$ can achieve exceptional performance, with gains exceeding 20 dB over a bandwidth ranging from hundreds of MHz to GHz, and reverse isolation suppressing backward noise by more than 30 dB across all frequencies. The device also operates near the quantum noise limit and provides topological protection against up to 15% fabrication disorder, effectively suppressing gain ripples. The amplifier's intrinsic directionality eliminates the need for external isolators, paving the way for fully on-chip, near-ideal superconducting pre-amplifiers.</description>

The temperature increase is triggered by photothermal effects of fluids and/or boundaries due to the absorption of a focused Gaussian beam irradiated perpendicular to the fluid film, and then the temperature variation induces the flow fields through a buoyancy force and/or thermo-osmotic slip. The semi-analytical solution to this optothermal fluidic system is validated by comparing with the results of numerical simulation, and is applied to typical optothermal fluidic problems. In particular, the optothermal trap of nanoparticles observed in our previous experiment [T. Tsuji, et al., Electrophoresis, 42, 2401 (2021)] is investigated in terms of thermophoretic force and flow drag that are obtained semi-analytically. The semi-analytical solution can be shared through open-source codes that are available to researchers without the background of fluid mechanics.</description>

Abstract: Fiber Specklegram Sensors (FSS) are vital for environmental monitoring due to their high temperature sensitivity, but their complex data poses challeng-es for predictive models. This study introduces Prion-ViT, a prion-inspired Vision Transformer model, inspired by biological prion memory mecha-nisms, to improve long-term dependency modeling and temperature prediction accuracy using FSS data. Prion-ViT leverages a persistent memory state to retain and propagate key features across layers, reducing mean absolute error (MAE) to 0.52{\deg}C and outperforming models like ResNet, Inception Net V2, and standard vision transformers. This work highlights Prion-ViT's potential for real-time industrial temperature monitoring and broader optical sensing applications.</description>
