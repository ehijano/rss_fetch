      <title>On a B-field transform of generalized complex structures over complex tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X^n,\check{X}^n)$ be a mirror pair of an $n$-dimensional complex torus $X^n$ and its mirror partner $\check{X}^n$. Then, by SYZ transform, we can construct a holomorphic line bundle with an integrable connection from each pair of a Lagrangian section of $\check{X}^n\to \mathbb{R}^n/\mathbb{Z}^n$ and a unitary local system along it, and those holomorphic line bundles with integrable connections forms a dg-category $DG_{X^n}$. In this paper, we focus on a certain B-field transform of the generalized complex structure induced from the complex structure on $X^n$, and interpret it as the deformation $X_{\mathcal{G}}^n$ of $X^n$ by a flat gerbe $\mathcal{G}$. Moreover, we construct the deformation of $DG_{X^n}$ associated to the deformation from $X^n$ to $X_{\mathcal{G}}^n$, and also discuss the homological mirror symmetry between $X_{\mathcal{G}}^n$ and its mirror partner on the object level.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the metric and cohomological properties of higher dimensional analogues of Inoue surfaces, that were introduced by Endo and Pajitnov. We provide a solvmanifold structure and show that in the diagonalizable case, they are formal and have invariant de Rham cohomology. Moreover, we obtain an arithmetic and cohomological characterization of pluriclosed and astheno-K\"ahler metrics and show they give new examples in all complex dimensions.</description>

      <title>On completeness of foliated structures, and null Killing fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a compact manifold $(M,\mathfrak{F})$ with a foliation $\mathfrak{F}$, and a smooth affine connection $\nabla$ on the tangent bundle of the foliation $T\mathfrak{F}$. We introduce and study a foliated completeness problem. Namely, under which conditions on $\nabla$ the leaves are complete? We consider different natural geometric settings: the first one is the case of a totally geodesic lightlike foliation of a compact Lorentzian manifold, and the second one is the case where the leaves have particular affine structures. In the first case, we characterize the completeness, and obtain in particular that if a compact Lorentzian manifold admits a null Killing field $V$ such that the distribution orthogonal to $V$ is integrable, then it defines a (totally geodesic) foliation with complete leaves. In the second case, we give a completeness result for a specific affine structure called "the unimodular affine lightlike geometry", and characterize the completeness for a natural relaxation of the geometry. On the other hand, we study the global completeness of a compact Lorentzian manifold in the presence of a null Killing field. We give two non-complete examples, starting from dimension $3$: one is a locally homogeneous manifold, and the other is a $3$D example where the Killing field dynamics is equicontinuous.</description>

      <title>The $L^p$-spectrum of the Laplacian on forms over warped products and Kleinian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we generalize the set of manifolds over which the $L^p$-spectrum of the Laplacian on $k$-forms depends on $p$. We will consider the case of manifolds that are warped products at infinity and certain quotients of Hyperbolic space. In the case of warped products at infinity we prove that the $L^p$-spectrum of the Laplacian on $k$-forms contains a parabolic region which depends on $k$, $p$ and the limiting curvature $a_0$ at infinity. For $M=\mathbb{H}^{N+1}/\Gamma $ with $\Gamma$ a geometrically finite group such that $M$ has infinite volume and no cusps, we prove that the $L^p$-spectrum of the Laplacian on $k$-forms is a exactly a parabolic region together with a set of isolated eigenvalues on the real line.</description>

      <title>Positive mass and isoperimetry for continuous metrics with nonnegative scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the positive mass theorem and the existence of isoperimetric sets on $3$-manifolds endowed with continuous complete metrics having nonnegative scalar curvature in a suitable weak sense.
  We prove that if the manifold has an end that is $C^0$-locally asymptotically flat, and the metric is the local uniform limit of smooth metrics with vanishing lower bounds on the scalar curvature outside a compact set, then Huisken's isoperimetric mass is nonnegative. This addresses a version of a recent conjecture of Huisken about positive isoperimetric mass theorems for continuous metrics satisfying $R_g\geq 0$ in a weak sense. As a consequence, any fill-in of a truncation of a Schwarzschild space with negative ADM mass has nonnegative isoperimetric mass.
  Moreover, in case the whole manifold is $C^0$-locally asymptotically flat and the metric is the local uniform limit of smooth metrics with vanishing lower bounds on the scalar curvature outside a compact set, we prove that, as a large scale effect, isoperimetric sets with arbitrarily large volume exist.</description>

      <title>The classification of complete improper affine spheres with singularities of low total curvature and new examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify complete improper affine spheres with singularities (say improper affine fronts) in unimodular affine three-space $\boldsymbol{R}^3$ whose total curvature is greater than or equal to $-8\pi$. We also study the asymptotic behavior of complete embedded ends of improper affine fronts. Moreover, we give new examples for this class of surfaces, including one which satisfies the equality condition of an Osserman-type inequality and is of positive genus.</description>

      <title>Blow Up of Compact Mean Curvature Flow Solutions with Bounded Mean Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1994, Vel\'{a}zquez constructed a countable family of complete hypersurfaces flowing in $\mathbb{R}^{2N}$ $(N\geq 4)$ by mean curvature, each of which develops a type II singularity at the origin in finite time. Later Guo and Sesum showed that for a non-empty subset of Vel\'{a}zquez's solutions, the mean curvature blows up near the origin, at a rate smaller than that of the second fundamental form; recently Stolarski proved another subset of these solutions has bounded mean curvature up to the singular time. In this paper, we follow their arguments to construct compact mean curvature flow solutions in $\mathbb{R}^n$ $(n\geq 8)$ with bounded mean curvature.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Cayley Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most natural first-order PDE's to be imposed on a Cayley 4-form in eight dimensions is the condition that it is closed. As is known, this implies integrability of the Spin(7) structure defined by the Cayley form, as well as Ricci-flatness of the associated metric. We address the question as to what the most natural second-order in derivatives set of conditions is. We start by constructing the most general diffeomorphism invariant second order in derivatives Lagrangian that is quadratic in the perturbations of the Cayley form. We find that there is a one-parameter family of such Lagrangians. We then describe a non-linear completion of the linear story. To this end, we parametrise the intrinsic torsion of a Spin(7) structure by a 3-form, and show that this 3-form is completely determined by the exterior derivative of the Cayley form. We construct an action functional, which depends on the Cayley 4-form and and auxiliary 3-form as independent variables. There is a unique functional whose Euler-Lagrange equation for the auxiliary 3-form states that it is equal to the torsion 3-form. There is, however, a more general one-parameter family of functionals that can be constructed, and we show how the linearisation of these functionals reproduces the linear story. For any member of our family of theories, the Euler-Lagrange equations are written only using the operator of exterior differentiation of forms, and do not require the knowledge of the metric-compatible Levi-Civita connection. Geometrically, there is a preferred member in the family of Lagrangians, and we propose that its Euler-Lagrange equations are the most natural second-order equations to be satisfied by Cayley forms. Our construction also leads to a natural geometric flow in the space of Cayley forms, defined as the gradient flow of our action functional.</description>

      <title>A Gauss-Bonnet formula for the renormalized area of minimal submanifolds of Poincar\'e-Einstein manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming the extrinsic $Q$-curvature admits a decomposition into the Pfaffian, a scalar conformal submanifold invariant, and a tangential divergence, we prove that the renormalized area of an even-dimensional minimal submanifold of a Poincar\'e-Einstein manifold can be expressed as a linear combination of its Euler characteristic and the integral of a scalar conformal submanifold invariant. We derive such a decomposition of the extrinsic $Q$-curvature in dimensions two and four, thereby recovering and generalizing results of Alexakis-Mazzeo and Tyrrell, respectively. We also conjecture such a decomposition for general natural submanifold scalars whose integral over compact submanifolds is conformally invariant, and verify our conjecture in dimensions two and four. Our results also apply to the area of a compact even-dimensional minimal submanifold of an Einstein manifold.</description>

      <title>Continuity of HYM connections with respect to metric variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the set of (real Dolbeault classes of) balanced metrics $\Theta$ on a balanced manifold $X$ with respect to which a torsion-free coherent sheaf $\mathcal{E}$ on $X$ is slope stable. We prove that the set of all such $[\Theta] \in H^{n - 1,n - 1}(X,\mathbb{R})$ is a convex cone defined by a finite number of linear inequalities. For this, we prove that the set of all $c_1(\mathcal{S})$ for $\mathcal{S} \subset \mathcal{E}$ saturated and coherent is finite.
  When $\mathcal{E}$ is a Hermitian vector bundle, the Kobayashi--Hitchin correspondence provides associated Hermitian Yang--Mills connections, which we show depend continuously on the metric, even around classes with respect to which $\mathcal{E}$ is only semi-stable. In this case, the holomorphic structure induced by the connection is the holomorphic structure of the associated graded object. The method relies on semi-stable perturbation techniques for geometric PDEs with a moment map interpretation and is quite versatile, and we hope that it can be used in other similar problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a full classification of general affine connections on Galilei manifolds in terms of independently specifiable tensor fields. This generalises the well-known case of (torsional) Galilei connections, i.e. connections compatible with the metric structure of the Galilei manifold. Similarly to the well-known pseudo-Riemannian case, the additional freedom for connections that are not metric-compatible lies in the covariant derivatives of the two tensors defining the metric structure (the clock form and the space metric), which however are not fully independent of each other.</description>

      <title>Metric-affine cosmological models and the inverse problem of the calculus of variations. Part 1: variational bootstrapping -- the method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The method of variational completion allows one to transform an (in principle, arbitrary) system of partial differential equations -- based on an intuitive ``educated guess'' -- into the Euler-Lagrange one attached to a Lagrangian, by adding a canonical correction term. Here, we extend this technique to theories that involve at least two sets of dynamical variables : we show that an educated guess of the field equations with respect to one of these sets of variables only is sufficient to variationally complete these equations and recover a Lagrangian for the full theory, up to terms that do not involve the respective variables.
  Applying this idea to natural metric-affine theories of gravity, we prove that, starting from an educated guess of the metric equations only, one can find the full metric equations, together with a generally covariant Lagrangian for the theory, up to metric-independent terms; the latter terms (which can only involve the distortion of the connection) are then completely classified over 4-dimensional spacetimes, by techniques pertaining to differential invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a $C^0$-fragmentation property for Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. More precisely, it is known that for a given open covering $\mathcal{U}$ of a compact symplectic surface we can write each $C^0$-small enough Hamiltonian diffeomorphism as the composition of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms compactly supported inside the open sets of the covering $\mathcal{U}$. We show that such a decomposition can be done with a Lipschitz estimate on the $C^0$-norm of the fragments. We also show the same property for the kernel of $\theta$, the mass-flow homomorphism for homeomorphisms. This answers a question from Buhovsky and Seyfaddini.</description>

Abstract: We study finer properties related to the interior regularity of $m$-dimensional area minimizing currents mod$(q)$ in arbitrary codimension. We show that the set of points where at least one tangent cone is translation invariant along $m-1$ directions is locally a connected $C^{1,\beta}$ submanifold, and moreover such points have unique tangent cones. We establish these results as consequences of a fine excess decay theorem.</description>

      <title>Michell Truss and From 1-beam to k-beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper generalizes the Michell Truss problem and Gangbo's paper from 1-dimension to higher dimensions using geometric measure theory.
  Given an elastic surface $S$ made of $(k-1)$-beams under an equilibriated system $F$ of external forces, then we ask the following two questions:
  1. What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an elastic body made of $k$-beams whose forces on the surface balance $F$ and whose surfaces consist of $S$.
  2. What is an optimal design so that the total cost is a minimum?
  We've solved the existence question completely; and research is still in progress for the minimal question. In particular when $k=1$, it involves a system of beams joining a given finite collection of pointed forces. It was first introduced by A. Michell in 1904, then used in mechanical engineering, and recently popularized in many pure mathematics works by W. Gangbo, Prager, and others. Here we are going to generalize them to higher dimensional cases. We have already found the minimal solutions in terms of the flat chain complex and vector-valued currents. Right now we are studying the Calibration theory for future directions. I appreciate the discussion with Prof. Robert Hardt!</description>

      <title>Initial data sets with vanishing mass are contained in pp-wave spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1981, Schoen-Yau and Witten showed that in General Relativity both the total energy $E$ and the total mass $m$ of an initial data set modelling an isolated gravitational system are non-negative. Moreover, if $E=0$, the initial data set must be contained in Minkowski space. In this paper, we show that if $m=0$, i.e. if $E$ equals the total momentum $|P|$, the initial data set must be contained in a pp-wave spacetime. Our proof combines spinorial methods with spacetime harmonic functions and works in all dimensions. Additionally, we find the decay rate threshold where the embedding has to be within Minkowski space and construct non-vacuum initial data sets with $m=0$ in the borderline case. As a consequence, this completely settles the rigidity of the spacetime positive mass theorem for spin manifolds.</description>

      <title>Flux Quantization on 11-dimensional Superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flux quantization of the C-field in 11d supergravity is arguably necessary for the (UV-)completion of the theory, in that it determines the torsion charges carried by small numbers of M-branes. However, hypotheses about C-field flux-quantization ("models of the C-field") have previously been discussed only in the bosonic sector of 11d supergravity and ignoring the supergravity equations of motion. Here we highlight a duality-symmetric formulation of on-shell 11d supergravity on superspace, observe that this naturally lends itself to completion of the theory by flux quantization, and indeed that 11d super-spacetimes are put on-shell by carrying quantizable duality-symmetric super-C-field flux; the proof of which we present in detail.</description>

Abstract: We classify the smooth linearly stable self-similar solutions of the semilinear heat equation $u_t=\Delta u+|u|^{p-1}u$ in $\mathbb{R}^n\times (0,T)$ under an integral condition for all $p&gt;1$. As a corollary, we prove that finite time blowing up solutions of this equation on a bounded convex domain with $u(\cdot,0)\geq 0$ and $u_t(\cdot,0)\geq 0$ converges to a constant after rescaling at the blow-up point for all $p&gt;1$.</description>

Abstract: We establish a concavity principle for solutions to elliptic and parabolic equations on complex projective space, generalizing the results of Langford and Scheuer. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a general concavity principle outside the constant sectional curvature regime, and in particular, our result partially answers a question raised by Korevaar in 1985 regarding the concavity of solutions to elliptic equations on manifolds with non-constant sectional curvature.</description>

      <title>Approximating maps into manifolds with lower curvature bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many interesting functions arising in applications map into Riemannian manifolds. We present an algorithm, using the manifold exponential and logarithm, for approximating such functions. Our approach extends approximation techniques for functions into linear spaces so that we can upper bound the forward error in terms of a lower bound on the manifold's sectional curvature. Furthermore, when the sectional curvature of a manifold is nonnegative, such as for compact Lie groups, the error is guaranteed to not be worse than in the linear case. We implement the algorithm in a Julia package and apply it to two example problems from Krylov subspaces and dynamic low-rank approximation, respectively. For these examples, the maps are confirmed to be well approximated by our algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.05915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A natural extension of a homogeneous geodesic in homogeneous Riemannian spaces $G/H$, known as a two-step homogeneous geodesic, can be expressed of the form $\gamma(t)=\pi(\exp(tx)\exp(ty))$, where $x$ and $y$ are elements of the Lie algebra of $G$. This paper aims to expand this concept to homogeneous Finsler spaces. We provide certain sufficient conditions for $(\alpha,\beta)$ spaces and decomposable cubic spaces to possess a one-parameter family of invariant Finsler metrics that can be classified as two-step Finsler geodesic orbit spaces. Additionally, we present some illustrative examples of these spaces.</description>

Abstract: We study the links of the Darboux-Halphen-Ramanujan system, with contact geometry, canonical coordinates of some $3$-dimensional Frobenius manifolds and projective connections on Riemann surfaces. One of our important goals is to highlight the role of contact geometry in this setting. We also study autonomous systems "derived" from the potential given by the Group-determinant, of any cyclic group $\Z/n\Z$, $n\geqslant3$, and the Klein group $\Z/2\Z\times\Z/2\Z$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically study calibrated geometry in hyperk\"ahler cones $C^{4n+4}$, their 3-Sasakian links $M^{4n+3}$, and the corresponding twistor spaces $Z^{4n+2}$, emphasizing the relationships between submanifold geometries in various spaces. Our analysis emphasizes the role played by a canonical $\mathrm{Sp}(n)\mathrm{U}(1)$-structure $\gamma$ on the twistor space $Z$. We observe that $\mathrm{Re}(e^{- i \theta} \gamma)$ is an $S^1$-family of semi-calibrations, and make a detailed study of their associated calibrated geometries.
  As an application, we obtain new characterizations of complex Lagrangian and complex isotropic cones in hyperk\"{a}hler cones, generalizing a result of Ejiri and Tsukada. We also generalize a theorem of Storm on submanifolds of twistor spaces that are Lagrangian with respect to both the K\"{a}hler-Einstein and nearly-K\"{a}hler structures.</description>

Abstract: Given a Lie groupoid, we can form its orbit space, which carries a natural diffeology. More generally, we have a quotient functor from the Hilsum-Skandalis category of Lie groupoids to the category of diffeological spaces. We introduce the notion of a lift-complete Lie groupoid, and show that the quotient functor restricts to an equivalence of the categories: of lift-complete Lie groupoids with isomorphism classes of surjective submersive bibundles as arrows, and of quasi-\'{e}tale diffeological spaces with surjective local subductions as arrows. In particular, the Morita equivalence class of a lift-complete Lie groupoid, alternatively a lift-complete differentiable stack, is determined by its diffeological orbit space. Examples of lift-complete Lie groupoids include quasifold groupoids and \'{e}tale holonomy groupoids of Riemannian foliations.</description>

      <title>Isoparametric submanifolds in a Riemannian Hilbert manifold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of a regularizable submanifold in a Riemannian Hilbert manifold. This submanifold is defined as a curvature-invariant submanifold such that its shape operators and its normal Jacobi operators are regularizable, where ``the operators are regularizable'' means that the operators are compact and that their regularized traces and the usual traces of their squares exist. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of an isoparametric submanifold in a Riemannian Hilbert manifold. This submanifold is defined as a regularizable submanifold with flat section and trivial normal holonomy group satisfying the constancy of the regularized mean curvatures in the radial direction of the parallel submanifolds. For a curvature-adapted regularizable submanifold $M$ with trivial normal holonomy group in a locally symmetric Riemannian Hilbert manifold, we prove that if, for any parallel normal vecrtor field $\widetilde{\xi}$ of $M$, the shape operaors $A_{\widetilde{\xi}_x}$ and the normal Jacobi operator $\widetilde R(\widetilde{\xi}_x)$ are independent of the base point $x(\in M)$ (up to orthogonal equivalent), then it is isoparametric under some additional conditions. Also, we define the notion of an equifocal submanifold in a Riemannian Hilbert manifold. We prove that the principal orbits of a certain kind of Hilbert Lie group action on the Riemannian Hilbert manifold $\mathcal A_P^{H^s}$ consisting of all $H^s$-connections of a $G$-bundle $P$ over a compact Riemannian manifold $B$ are equifocal, where $G$ is a semi-simple Lie group and $s&gt;\frac{1}{2}\,{\rm dim}\,B-1$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we derive the first variation formulas for surfaces in 3-dimensional Euclidean space by using the ``strain-displacement relations'' known in thin shell theory. For applications to architectural surface design, we focus on the objective function which has linear Weingarten surfaces as stationary points. This article aims to provide an elementary and cross-disciplinary exposition for applications without any tensor calculus, and thus, we do not give any new mathematical results.</description>

      <title>Injectivity radius lower bound of convex sum of tame Riemannian metrics and applications to symplectic topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the aspect of large-scale symplectic topology, we prove that for any pair $g_0, \, g_1$ of complete Riemannian metrics of bounded curvature and \emph{of injectivity radius bounded away from zero}, the convex sum $g_s: = (1-s ) g_0 + s g_1$ also has bounded curvature depending only on the curvature bounds $\|R_{g_i}\|_{C^0}$ of $g_0$ or $g_1$, and that the injectivity radii of $g_s$ have uniform lower bound depending only on the derivative bounds $\|R_{g_i}\|_{C^1} = \|R_{g_i}\|_{C^0} + \|DR_{g_i}\|_{C^0}$.
  A main technical ingredient to establish the injectivity radius lower bound is an application of the quantitative inverse function theorem. Using these estimates, we prove that each quasi-isometry class of tame metrics is convex and so contractible in strong $C^r$ topology for all finite regularity class of $3 \leq r &lt; \infty$. Using this Riemannian geometry result, we prove that the set of $C^3$-tame almost complex structures inside the same quasi-isometry class associated to the symplectic form $\omega$ is contractible.</description>

Abstract: Consider a pair of smooth, possibly noncompact, properly immersed hypersurfaces moving by mean curvature flow, or, more generally, a pair of weak set flows. We prove that if the ambient space is Euclidean space and if the distance between the two surfaces is initially nonzero, then the surfaces remain disjoint at all subsequent times. We prove the same result when the ambient space is a complete Riemannian manifold of nonzero injectivity radius, provided the curvature tensor (of the ambient space) and all its derivatives are bounded.</description>

Abstract: A polygonal surface in the pseudo-hyperbolic space H 2,n is a complete maximal surface bounded by a lightlike polygon in the Einstein universe Ein 1,n with finitely many vertices. In this article, we give several characterizations of them. Polygonal surfaces are characterized by finiteness of their total curvature, by asymptotic flatness, and also by the fact of having parabolic type and polynomial quartic differential. Our result relies on a comparison between three ideal boundaries associated with a maximal surface, corresponding to three distinct distances naturally defined on the maximal surface.</description>

Abstract: In Gel'fand's inverse problem, one aims to determine the topology, differential structure and Riemannian metric of a compact manifold $M$ with boundary from the knowledge of the boundary $\partial M,$ the Neumann eigenvalues $\lambda_j$ and the boundary values of the eigenfunctions $\varphi_j|_{\partial M}$. We show that this problem has a stable solution with quantitative stability estimates in a class of manifolds with bounded geometry. More precisely, we show that finitely many eigenvalues and the boundary values of corresponding eigenfunctions, known up to small errors, determine a metric space that is close to the manifold in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. We provide an algorithm to construct this metric space. This result is based on an explicit estimate on the stability of the unique continuation for the wave operator.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be either a general hypersurface of degree $n+1$ in $\mathbb P^n$ or a general $(2,n)$ complete intersection in $\mathbb P^{n+1}, n\geq 4$. We construct balanced rational curves on $X$ of all high enough degrees. If $n=3$ or $g=1$, we construct rigid curves of genus $g$ on $X$ of all high enough degrees. As an application we construct some rigid bundles on Calabi-Yau threefolds. In addition, we construct some low-degree balanced rational curves on hypersurfaces of degree $n + 2$ in $\mathbb P^n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11411v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove non-hyperbolicity of primitive symplectic varieties with $b_2 \geq 5$ that satisfy the rational SYZ conjecture. If in addition $b_2 \geq 7$, we establish that the Kobayashi pseudometric vanishes identically. This in particular applies to all currently known examples of irreducible symplectic manifolds and thereby completes the results by Kamenova--Lu--Verbitsky. The key new contribution is that a projective primitive symplectic variety with a Lagrangian fibration has vanishing Kobayashi pseudometric. The proof uses ergodicity, birational contractions, and cycle spaces.</description>

      <title>Mod 2 instanton homology and 4-manifolds with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using instanton homology with coefficients in $Z/2$ we construct a homomorphism $q_2$ from the homology cobordism group in dimension 3 to the integers which is not a rational linear combination of the instanton $h$--invariant and the Heegaard Floer correction term $d$. If an oriented homology $3$--sphere $Y$ bounds a smooth, compact, negative definite $4$--manifold without $2$--torsion in its homology then $q_2(Y)\ge0$, with strict inequality if the intersection form is non-standard.</description>

      <title>Fast ellipsoidal conformal and quasi-conformal parameterization of genus-0 closed surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface parameterization plays a fundamental role in many science and engineering problems. In particular, as genus-0 closed surfaces are topologically equivalent to a sphere, many spherical parameterization methods have been developed over the past few decades. However, in practice, mapping a genus-0 closed surface onto a sphere may result in a large distortion due to their geometric difference. In this work, we propose a new framework for computing ellipsoidal conformal and quasi-conformal parameterizations of genus-0 closed surfaces, in which the target parameter domain is an ellipsoid instead of a sphere. By combining simple conformal transformations with different types of quasi-conformal mappings, we can easily achieve a large variety of ellipsoidal parameterizations with their bijectivity guaranteed by quasi-conformal theory. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Higher form symmetries and orbifolds of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We undertake a detailed study of the gaugings of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory by its intrinsic charge conjugation 0-form and centre 1-form global symmetries, elucidating their higher algebraic and geometric structures, as well as the meaning of dual lower form symmetries. Our derivations of orbifold gauge theories make use of a combination of standard continuum path integral methods, networks of topological defects, and techniques from higher gauge theory. We provide a unified description of higher and lower form gauge fields for a $p$-form symmetry in the geometric setting of $p$-gerbes, and derive reverse orbifolds by the dual $(-1)$-form symmetries. We identify those orbifolds in which charge conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken, and relate the breaking to mixed anomalies involving $(-1)$-form symmetries. We extend these considerations to gaugings by the non-invertible 1-form symmetries of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory by introducing a notion of generalized $\theta$-angle.</description>

      <title>Determinants of pseudo-laplacians and $\zeta^{({\rm reg})}(1)$ for spinor bundles over Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a point of a compact Riemann surface $X$. We study self-adjoint extensions of the Dolbeault Laplacians in hermitian line bundles $L$ over $X$ initially defined on sections with compact supports in $X\backslash\{P\}$. We define the $\zeta$-regularized determinants for these operators and derive comparison formulas for them. We introduce the notion of the Robin mass of $L$. This quantity enters the comparison formulas for determinants and is related to the regularized $\zeta(1)$ for the Dolbeault Laplacian. For spinor bundles of even characteristic, we find an explicit expression for the Robin mass. In addition, we propose an explicit formula for the Robin mass in the scalar case. Using this formula, we describe the evolution of the regularized $\zeta(1)$ for scalar Laplacian under the Ricci flow. As a byproduct, we find an alternative proof for the Morpurgo result that the round metric minimizes the regularized $\zeta(1)$ for surfaces of genus zero.</description>

      <title>Geometric Generative Models based on Morphological Equivariant PDEs and GANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Content and image generation consist in creating or generating data from noisy information by extracting specific features such as texture, edges, and other thin image structures. We are interested here in generative models, and two main problems are addressed. Firstly, the improvements of specific feature extraction while accounting at multiscale levels intrinsic geometric features; and secondly, the equivariance of the network to reduce its complexity and provide a geometric interpretability. To proceed, we propose a geometric generative model based on an equivariant partial differential equation (PDE) for group convolution neural networks (G-CNNs), so called PDE-G-CNNs, built on morphology operators and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Equivariant morphological PDE layers are composed of multiscale dilations and erosions formulated in Riemannian manifolds, while group symmetries are defined on a Lie group. We take advantage of the Lie group structure to properly integrate the equivariance in layers, and are able to use the Riemannian metric to solve the multiscale morphological operations. Each point of the Lie group is associated with a unique point in the manifold, which helps us derive a metric on the Riemannian manifold from a tensor field invariant under the Lie group so that the induced metric has the same symmetries. The proposed geometric morphological GAN (GM-GAN) is obtained by using the proposed morphological equivariant convolutions in PDE-G-CNNs to bring nonlinearity in classical CNNs. GM-GAN is evaluated on MNIST data and compared with GANs. Preliminary results show that GM-GAN model outperforms classical GAN.</description>
