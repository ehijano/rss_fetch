      <title>Ultrarelativistic outflows in asymmetric magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a one-fluid pair plasma magnetohydrodynamical model for asymmetric relativistic magnetic reconnection that incorporates the thermal-inertial effects of the plasma. We find the general scaling relation for the reconnection rate in a Sweet-Parker-type configuration. However, we show that under a specific highly asymmetric scenario, this magnetic reconnection process can produce ultrarelativistic plasma outflows, with velocities surpassing those of the inflow particles, and also, those found in symmetric cases. We highlight the significance of the asymmetry in enhancing particle acceleration and energy release.</description>

      <title>A BBGKY-like Hierarchy for Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Hamiltonian method of constructing BBGKY-like hierarchies for quantum field theories. With suitable choices, our method creates a hierarchical system of evolution equations for the k-th order reduced density matrices. These equations can be closed at finite order using methods developed for the classical BBGKY hierarchy to give non-perturbative approximations for the full quantum equations of motion. Classical observables can then be numerically computed from these approximate equations, providing an analytically tractable method of modeling high-energy environments where quantum effects play a pronounced role.</description>

      <title>On Minimizing Phase Space Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A primary technical challenge for harnessing fusion energy is to control and extract energy from a non-thermal distribution of charged particles. The fact that phase space evolves by symplectomorphisms fundamentally limits how a distribution may be manipulated. While the constraint of phase-space volume preservation is well understood, other constraints remain to be fully appreciated. To better understand these constraints, we study the problem of extracting energy from a distribution of particles using area-preserving and symplectic linear maps. When a quadratic potential is imposed, we find that the maximal extractable energy can be computed as trace minimization problems. We solve these problems and show that the extractable energy under linear symplectomorphisms may be much smaller than the extractable energy under special linear maps. The method introduced in the present study enables an energy-based proof of the linear Gromov non-squeezing theorem.</description>

      <title>Observation of Alfven solitons in the solar corona using Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solitons are predominantly observed in near-earth plasmas as well as planetary magnetospheres; however, their existence in the solar corona remains largely unexplored, despite theoretical investigations. This study aims to address this gap by examining the presence and dynamics of solitons in the solar corona, particularly in the context of coronal heating. Utilizing observational data from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) during the onset of a strong Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) event, the analyses reveal a train of aperiodic solitons with increasing amplitude preceding the eruption. A key finding of this study is that the observed aperiodic soliton train serves as a potential candidate in facilitating energy transfer through dissipation within the coronal plasma, hereby, influencing the initiation of solar eruptive events such as a CME. A defining characteristic of this solitary train is its hypersonic and super-Alfvenic nature, evident from the presence of high Mach numbers that reinforces its role in plasma energy equilibration in the solar corona, thereby contributing to plasma heating.</description>

      <title>Similarity for downscaled kinetic simulations of electrostatic plasmas: reconciling the large system size with small Debye length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple similarity has been proposed for kinetic (e.g., particle-in-cell) simulations of plasma transport that can effectively address the longstanding challenge of reconciling the tiny Debye length with the vast system size. This applies to both transport in unmagnetized plasma and parallel transport in magnetized plasmas, where the characteristics length scales are given by the Debye length, collisional mean free paths, and the system or gradient lengths. The controlled scaled variables are the configuration space, $\mathbf{x}/\mathscr{L},$ and artificial collisional rates, $\mathscr{L}\mu$, which is realized through scaling the Coulomb Logarithm in the simulations, $\mathscr{L}\ln \Lambda.$ Whereas, the scaled time, $t/\mathscr{L}$, and electric field, $\mathscr{L}\mathbf{E}$, are automatic outcomes. The similarity properties are examined, demonstrating that the macroscopic transport physics is preserved through a similarity transformation while keeping the microscopic physics at its original scale of Debye length. To showcase the utility of this approach, two examples of 1D plasma transport problems were simulated using the VPIC code: the plasma thermal quench in tokamaks [J. Li, et al., Nuclear Fusion \textbf{63}, 066030 (2023)] and the plasma sheath in the high-recycling regime [Y. Li, et al., Physics of
  Plasmas \textbf{30}, 063505 (2023)].</description>

      <title>Quantitative Magnetohydrodynamic Modelling of Flux Pumping in ASDEX Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sawtooth-free hybrid scenario has been achieved recently in ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) with applied non-inductive current sources and auxiliary heating [A. Burckhart et al 2023 Nucl. Fusion 63 126056]. Control experiments in AUG suggest that the self-regulating magnetic flux pumping mechanism, characterized by anomalous current redistribution, is responsible for clamping the central safety factor (q_0) close to unity, thereby preventing the sawtooth onset. This work presents a numerical and theoretical investigation of flux pumping in the AUG hybrid scenario based on the two-temperature, visco-resistive, full magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model with the JOREK code. To quantitatively model the flux pumping, we choose realistic parameters, plasma configurations, and source terms based on AUG experiments. During the initial saturation stage of the unstable 1/1 quasi-interchange mode (on millisecond timescales), q_0 exhibits fast under-damped oscillation and reaches a value closer to unity, which is attributed to the self-regulation of core plasma and the fast dynamo effect on the order of V/m. On the longer resistive diffusion timescale of seconds, the slow negative dynamo effect on the order of mV/m induced by the 1/1 MHD instability plays an effective role in flux pumping, which provides quantitative agreement with experimental observations for the first time. The final saturated 1/1 MHD instability exhibits features of the quasi-interchange mode and tearing mode, and the associated convective plasma flow velocity is a few m/s. The toroidal negative electric field from the slow dynamo dominantly offsets the positive current drive and continuously redistributes the current density and pressure. As a result, q_0 is maintained close to unity due to the low-shear profiles of current density and pressure in the plasma core, and the system enters a sawtooth-free and quasi-stationary helical state.</description>
