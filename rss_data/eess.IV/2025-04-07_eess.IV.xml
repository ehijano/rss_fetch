      <title>Performance Analysis of Deep Learning Models for Femur Segmentation in MRI Scan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks like U-Net excel in medical image segmentation, while attention mechanisms and KAN enhance feature extraction. Meta's SAM 2 uses Vision Transformers for prompt-based segmentation without fine-tuning. However, biases in these models impact generalization with limited data. In this study, we systematically evaluate and compare the performance of three CNN-based models, i.e., U-Net, Attention U-Net, and U-KAN, and one transformer-based model, i.e., SAM 2 for segmenting femur bone structures in MRI scan. The dataset comprises 11,164 MRI scans with detailed annotations of femoral regions. Performance is assessed using the Dice Similarity Coefficient, which ranges from 0.932 to 0.954. Attention U-Net achieves the highest overall scores, while U-KAN demonstrated superior performance in anatomical regions with a smaller region of interest, leveraging its enhanced learning capacity to improve segmentation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the Identity Mapping Problem in Self-Supervised Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surge of deep learning has catalyzed considerable progress in self-supervised Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection (HAD). The core premise for self-supervised HAD is that anomalous pixels are inherently more challenging to reconstruct, resulting in larger errors compared to the background. However, owing to the powerful nonlinear fitting capabilities of neural networks, self-supervised models often suffer from the Identity Mapping Problem (IMP). The IMP manifests as a tendency for the model to overfit to the entire image, particularly with increasing network complexity or prolonged training iterations. Consequently, the whole image can be precisely reconstructed, and even the anomalous pixels exhibit imperceptible errors, making them difficult to detect. Despite the proposal of several models aimed at addressing the IMP-related issues, a unified descriptive framework and validation of solutions for IMP remain lacking. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth exploration to IMP, and summarize a unified framework that describes IMP from the perspective of network optimization, which encompasses three aspects: perturbation, reconstruction, and regularization. Correspondingly, we introduce three solutions: superpixel pooling and uppooling for perturbation, error-adaptive convolution for reconstruction, and online background pixel mining for regularization. With extensive experiments being conducted to validate the effectiveness, it is hoped that our work will provide valuable insights and inspire further research for self-supervised HAD.

      <title>Autoregressive High-Order Finite Difference Modulo Imaging: High-Dynamic Range for Computer Vision Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High dynamic range (HDR) imaging is vital for capturing the full range of light tones in scenes, essential for computer vision tasks such as autonomous driving. Standard commercial imaging systems face limitations in capacity for well depth, and quantization precision, hindering their HDR capabilities. Modulo imaging, based on unlimited sampling (US) theory, addresses these limitations by using a modulo analog-to-digital approach that resets signals upon saturation, enabling estimation of pixel resets through neighboring pixel intensities. Despite the effectiveness of (US) algorithms in one-dimensional signals, their optimization problem for two-dimensional signals remains unclear. This work formulates the US framework as an autoregressive $\ell_2$ phase unwrapping problem, providing computationally efficient solutions in the discrete cosine domain jointly with a stride removal algorithm also based on spatial differences. By leveraging higher-order finite differences for two-dimensional images, our approach enhances HDR image reconstruction from modulo images, demonstrating its efficacy in improving object detection in autonomous driving scenes without retraining.</description>

      <title>CALF: A Conditionally Adaptive Loss Function to Mitigate Class-Imbalanced Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imbalanced datasets pose a considerable challenge in training deep learning (DL) models for medical diagnostics, particularly for segmentation tasks. Imbalance may be associated with annotation quality limited annotated datasets, rare cases, or small-scale regions of interest (ROIs). These conditions adversely affect model training and performance, leading to segmentation boundaries which deviate from the true ROIs. Traditional loss functions, such as Binary Cross Entropy, replicate annotation biases and limit model generalization. We propose a novel, statistically driven, conditionally adaptive loss function (CALF) tailored to accommodate the conditions of imbalanced datasets in DL training. It employs a data-driven methodology by estimating imbalance severity using statistical methods of skewness and kurtosis, then applies an appropriate transformation to balance the training dataset while preserving data heterogeneity. This transformative approach integrates a multifaceted process, encompassing preprocessing, dataset filtering, and dynamic loss selection to achieve optimal outcomes. We benchmark our method against conventional loss functions using qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Experiments using large-scale open-source datasets (i.e., UPENN-GBM, UCSF, LGG, and BraTS) validate our approach, demonstrating substantial segmentation improvements.

      <title>GAMBAS: Generalised-Hilbert Mamba for Super-resolution of Paediatric Ultra-Low-Field MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is critical for neurodevelopmental research, however access to high-field (HF) systems in low- and middle-income countries is severely hindered by their cost. Ultra-low-field (ULF) systems mitigate such issues of access inequality, however their diminished signal-to-noise ratio limits their applicability for research and clinical use. Deep-learning approaches can enhance the quality of scans acquired at lower field strengths at no additional cost. For example, Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) fused with transformer modules have demonstrated a remarkable ability to capture both local information and long-range context. Unfortunately, the quadratic complexity of transformers leads to an undesirable trade-off between long-range sensitivity and local precision. We propose a hybrid CNN and state-space model (SSM) architecture featuring a novel 3D to 1D serialisation (GAMBAS), which learns long-range context without sacrificing spatial precision. We exhibit improved performance compared to other state-of-the-art medical image-to-image translation models.</description>

      <title>BrainMRDiff: A Diffusion Model for Anatomically Consistent Brain MRI Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate brain tumor diagnosis relies on the assessment of multiple Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences. However, in clinical practice, the acquisition of certain sequences may be affected by factors like motion artifacts or contrast agent contraindications, leading to suboptimal outcome, such as poor image quality. This can then affect image interpretation by radiologists. Synthesizing high quality MRI sequences has thus become a critical research focus. Though recent advancements in controllable generative AI have facilitated the synthesis of diagnostic quality MRI, ensuring anatomical accuracy remains a significant challenge. Preserving critical structural relationships between different anatomical regions is essential, as even minor structural or topological inconsistencies can compromise diagnostic validity. In this work, we propose BrainMRDiff, a novel topology-preserving, anatomy-guided diffusion model for synthesizing brain MRI, leveraging brain and tumor anatomies as conditioning inputs. To achieve this, we introduce two key modules: Tumor+Structure Aggregation (TSA) and Topology-Guided Anatomy Preservation (TGAP). TSA integrates diverse anatomical structures with tumor information, forming a comprehensive conditioning mechanism for the diffusion process. TGAP enforces topological consistency during reverse denoising diffusion process; both these modules ensure that the generated image respects anatomical integrity. Experimental results demonstrate that BrainMRDiff surpasses existing baselines, achieving performance improvements of 23.33% on the BraTS-AG dataset and 33.33% on the BraTS-Met dataset. Code will be made publicly available soon.</description>

      <title>Here Comes the Explanation: A Shapley Perspective on Multi-contrast Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has been successfully applied to medical image segmentation, enabling accurate identification of regions of interest such as organs and lesions. This approach works effectively across diverse datasets, including those with single-image contrast, multi-contrast, and multimodal imaging data. To improve human understanding of these black-box models, there is a growing need for Explainable AI (XAI) techniques for model transparency and accountability. Previous research has primarily focused on post hoc pixel-level explanations, using methods gradient-based and perturbation-based apporaches. These methods rely on gradients or perturbations to explain model predictions. However, these pixel-level explanations often struggle with the complexity inherent in multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation tasks, and the sparsely distributed explanations have limited clinical relevance. In this study, we propose using contrast-level Shapley values to explain state-of-the-art models trained on standard metrics used in brain tumor segmentation. Our results demonstrate that Shapley analysis provides valuable insights into different models' behavior used for tumor segmentation. We demonstrated a bias for U-Net towards over-weighing T1-contrast and FLAIR, while Swin-UNETR provided a cross-contrast understanding with balanced Shapley distribution.</description>

      <title>Vision Transformers with Autoencoders and Explainable AI for Cancer Patient Risk Stratification Using Whole Slide Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, necessitating accurate diagnosis and prognosis. Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) has become an integral part of clinical workflows with advancements in digital pathology. While various studies have utilized WSIs, their extracted features may not fully capture the most relevant pathological information, and their lack of interpretability limits clinical adoption.
  In this paper, we propose PATH-X, a framework that integrates Vision Transformers (ViT) and Autoencoders with SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) to enhance model explainability for patient stratification and risk prediction using WSIs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A representative image slice is selected from each WSI, and numerical feature embeddings are extracted using Google's pre-trained ViT. These features are then compressed via an autoencoder and used for unsupervised clustering and classification tasks. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis is applied to evaluate stratification into two and three risk groups. SHAP is used to identify key contributing features, which are mapped onto histopathological slices to provide spatial context.
  PATH-X demonstrates strong performance in breast and glioma cancers, where a sufficient number of WSIs enabled robust stratification. However, performance in lung cancer was limited due to data availability, emphasizing the need for larger datasets to enhance model reliability and clinical applicability.</description>

      <title>Explainability of AI Uncertainty: Application to Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation on MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) is essential in healthcare, particularly for high-stakes tasks like medical image segmentation. Explainable AI and uncertainty quantification significantly enhance AI reliability by addressing key attributes such as robustness, usability, and explainability. Despite extensive technical advances in uncertainty quantification for medical imaging, understanding the clinical informativeness and interpretability of uncertainty remains limited. This study introduces a novel framework to explain the potential sources of predictive uncertainty, specifically in cortical lesion segmentation in multiple sclerosis using deep ensembles. The proposed analysis shifts the focus from the uncertainty-error relationship towards relevant medical and engineering factors. Our findings reveal that instance-wise uncertainty is strongly related to lesion size, shape, and cortical involvement. Expert rater feedback confirms that similar factors impede annotator confidence. Evaluations conducted on two datasets (206 patients, almost 2000 lesions) under both in-domain and distribution-shift conditions highlight the utility of the framework in different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Universal Lymph Node Detection in Multiparametric MRI with Selective Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust localization of lymph nodes (LNs) in multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) is critical for the assessment of lymphadenopathy. Radiologists routinely measure the size of LN to distinguish benign from malignant nodes, which would require subsequent cancer staging. Sizing is a cumbersome task compounded by the diverse appearances of LNs in mpMRI, which renders their measurement difficult. Furthermore, smaller and potentially metastatic LNs could be missed during a busy clinical day. To alleviate these imaging and workflow problems, we propose a pipeline to universally detect both benign and metastatic nodes in the body for their ensuing measurement. The recently proposed VFNet neural network was employed to identify LN in T2 fat suppressed and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) sequences acquired by various scanners with a variety of exam protocols. We also use a selective augmentation technique known as Intra-Label LISA (ILL) to diversify the input data samples the model sees during training, such that it improves its robustness during the evaluation phase. We achieved a sensitivity of $\sim$83\% with ILL vs. $\sim$80\% without ILL at 4 FP/vol. Compared with current LN detection approaches evaluated on mpMRI, we show a sensitivity improvement of $\sim$9\% at 4 FP/vol.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Wavelet-Fourier Method for Next-Generation Conditional Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel generative modeling framework,Wavelet-Fourier-Diffusion, which adapts the diffusion paradigm to hybrid frequency representations in order to synthesize high-quality, high-fidelity images with improved spatial localization. In contrast to conventional diffusion models that rely exclusively on additive noise in pixel space, our approach leverages a multi-transform that combines wavelet sub-band decomposition with partial Fourier steps. This strategy progressively degrades and then reconstructs images in a hybrid spectral domain during the forward and reverse diffusion processes. By supplementing traditional Fourier-based analysis with the spatial localization capabilities of wavelets, our model can capture both global structures and fine-grained features more effectively. We further extend the approach to conditional image generation by integrating embeddings or conditional features via cross-attention. Experimental evaluations on CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ, and a conditional ImageNet subset illustrate that our method achieves competitive or superior performance relative to baseline diffusion models and state-of-the-art GANs, as measured by Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score (IS). We also show how the hybrid frequency-based representation improves control over global coherence and fine texture synthesis, paving the way for new directions in multi-scale generative modeling.</description>

      <title>Detection-Friendly Nonuniformity Correction: A Union Framework for Infrared UAVTarget Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images captured using thermal detectors are often affected by temperature dependent low-frequency nonuniformity, which significantly reduces the contrast of the images. Detecting UAV targets under nonuniform conditions is crucial in UAV surveillance applications. Existing methods typically treat infrared nonuniformity correction (NUC) as a preprocessing step for detection, which leads to suboptimal performance. Balancing the two tasks while enhancing detection beneficial information remains challenging. In this paper, we present a detection-friendly union framework, termed UniCD, that simultaneously addresses both infrared NUC and UAV target detection tasks in an end-to-end manner. We first model NUC as a small number of parameter estimation problem jointly driven by priors and data to generate detection-conducive images. Then, we incorporate a new auxiliary loss with target mask supervision into the backbone of the infrared UAV target detection network to strengthen target features while suppressing the background. To better balance correction and detection, we introduce a detection-guided self-supervised loss to reduce feature discrepancies between the two tasks, thereby enhancing detection robustness to varying nonuniformity levels. Additionally, we construct a new benchmark composed of 50,000 infrared images in various nonuniformity types, multi-scale UAV targets and rich backgrounds with target annotations, called IRBFD. Extensive experiments on IRBFD demonstrate that our UniCD is a robust union framework for NUC and UAV target detection while achieving real-time processing capabilities.

      <title>Simultaneous Motion And Noise Estimation with Event Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event cameras are emerging vision sensors, whose noise is challenging to characterize. Existing denoising methods for event cameras consider other tasks such as motion estimation separately (i.e., sequentially after denoising). However, motion is an intrinsic part of event data, since scene edges cannot be sensed without motion. This work proposes, to the best of our knowledge, the first method that simultaneously estimates motion in its various forms (e.g., ego-motion, optical flow) and noise. The method is flexible, as it allows replacing the 1-step motion estimation of the widely-used Contrast Maximization framework with any other motion estimator, such as deep neural networks. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the E-MLB denoising benchmark and competitive results on the DND21 benchmark, while showing its efficacy on motion estimation and intensity reconstruction tasks. We believe that the proposed approach contributes to strengthening the theory of event-data denoising, as well as impacting practical denoising use-cases, as we release the code upon acceptance.

Abstract: Information on standing dead trees is important for understanding forest ecosystem functioning and resilience but has been lacking over large geographic regions. Climate change has caused large-scale tree mortality events that can remain undetected due to limited data. In this study, we propose a novel method for segmenting standing dead trees using aerial multispectral orthoimages. Because access to annotated datasets has been a significant problem in forest remote sensing due to the need for forest expertise, we introduce a method for domain transfer by leveraging domain adaptation to learn a transformation from a source domain X to target domain Y. In this Image-to-Image translation task, we aim to utilize available annotations in the target domain by pre-training a segmentation network. When images from a new study site without annotations are introduced (source domain X), these images are transformed into the target domain. Then, transfer learning is applied by inferring the pre-trained network on domain-adapted images. In addition to investigating the feasibility of current domain adaptation approaches for this objective, we propose a novel approach called the Attention-guided Domain Adaptation Network (ADA-Net) with enhanced contrastive learning. Accordingly, the ADA-Net approach provides new state-of-the-art domain adaptation performance levels outperforming existing approaches. We have evaluated the proposed approach using two datasets from Finland and the US. The USA images are converted to the Finland domain, and we show that the synthetic USA2Finland dataset exhibits similar characteristics to the Finland domain images. The software implementation is shared at https://github.com/meteahishali/ADA-Net. The data is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meteahishali/aerial-imagery-for-standing-dead-tree-segmentation.</description>

      <title>Thermoxels: a voxel-based method to generate simulation-ready 3D thermal models</title>

Abstract: In the European Union, buildings account for 42% of energy use and 35% of greenhouse gas emissions. Since most existing buildings will still be in use by 2050, retrofitting is crucial for emissions reduction. However, current building assessment methods rely mainly on qualitative thermal imaging, which limits data-driven decisions for energy savings. On the other hand, quantitative assessments using finite element analysis (FEA) offer precise insights but require manual CAD design, which is tedious and error-prone. Recent advances in 3D reconstruction, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting, enable precise 3D modeling from sparse images but lack clearly defined volumes and the interfaces between them needed for FEA. We propose Thermoxels, a novel voxel-based method able to generate FEA-compatible models, including both geometry and temperature, from a sparse set of RGB and thermal images. Using pairs of RGB and thermal images as input, Thermoxels represents a scene's geometry as a set of voxels comprising color and temperature information. After optimization, a simple process is used to transform Thermoxels' models into tetrahedral meshes compatible with FEA. We demonstrate Thermoxels' capability to generate RGB+Thermal meshes of 3D scenes, surpassing other state-of-the-art methods. To showcase the practical applications of Thermoxels' models, we conduct a simple heat conduction simulation using FEA, achieving convergence from an initial state defined by Thermoxels' thermal reconstruction. Additionally, we compare Thermoxels' image synthesis abilities with current state-of-the-art methods, showing competitive results, and discuss the limitations of existing metrics in assessing mesh quality.</description>

      <title>Bridging Knowledge Gap Between Image Inpainting and Large-Area Visible Watermark Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visible watermark removal which involves watermark cleaning and background content restoration is pivotal to evaluate the resilience of watermarks. Existing deep neural network (DNN)-based models still struggle with large-area watermarks and are overly dependent on the quality of watermark mask prediction. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel feature adapting framework that leverages the representation modeling capacity of a pre-trained image inpainting model. Our approach bridges the knowledge gap between image inpainting and watermark removal by fusing information of the residual background content beneath watermarks into the inpainting backbone model. We establish a dual-branch system to capture and embed features from the residual background content, which are merged into intermediate features of the inpainting backbone model via gated feature fusion modules. Moreover, for relieving the dependence on high-quality watermark masks, we introduce a new training paradigm by utilizing coarse watermark masks to guide the inference process. This contributes to a visible image removal model which is insensitive to the quality of watermark mask during testing. Extensive experiments on both a large-scale synthesized dataset and a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available in the supplementary materials.</description>

      <title>Inter-event Interval Microscopy for Event Cameras</title>

Abstract: Event cameras, an innovative bio-inspired sensor, differ from traditional cameras by sensing changes in intensity rather than directly perceiving intensity and recording these variations as a continuous stream of "events". The intensity reconstruction from these sparse events has long been a challenging problem. Previous approaches mainly focused on transforming motion-induced events into videos or achieving intensity imaging for static scenes by integrating modulation devices at the event camera acquisition end. In this paper, for the first time, we achieve event-to-intensity conversion using a static event camera for both static and dynamic scenes in fluorescence microscopy. Unlike conventional methods that primarily rely on event integration, the proposed Inter-event Interval Microscopy (IEIM) quantifies the time interval between consecutive events at each pixel. With a fixed threshold in the event camera, the time interval can precisely represent the intensity. At the hardware level, the proposed IEIM integrates a pulse light modulation device within a microscope equipped with an event camera, termed Pulse Modulation-based Event-driven Fluorescence Microscopy.mAdditionally, we have collected IEIMat dataset under various scenes including high dynamic range and high-speed scenarios. Experimental results on the IEIMat dataset demonstrate that the proposed IEIM achieves superior spatial and temporal resolution, as well as a higher dynamic range, with lower bandwidth compared to other methods. The code and the IEIMat dataset will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Balancing Robustness and Efficiency in Embedded DNNs Through Activation Function Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning-based embedded systems for safety-critical applications, such as aerospace and autonomous driving, must be robust to perturbations caused by soft errors. As transistor geometries shrink and voltages decrease, modern electronic devices become more susceptible to background radiation, increasing the concern about failures produced by soft errors. The resilience of deep neural networks (DNNs) to these errors depends not only on target device technology but also on model structure and the numerical representation and arithmetic precision of their parameters. Compression techniques like pruning and quantization, used to reduce memory footprint and computational complexity, alter both model structure and representation, affecting soft error robustness. In this regard, although often overlooked, the choice of activation functions (AFs) impacts not only accuracy and trainability but also compressibility and error resilience. This paper explores the use of bounded AFs to enhance robustness against parameter perturbations, while evaluating their effects on model accuracy, compressibility, and computational load with a technology-agnostic approach. We focus on encoder-decoder convolutional models developed for semantic segmentation of hyperspectral images with application to autonomous driving systems. Experiments are conducted on an AMD-Xilinx's KV260 SoM.</description>

      <title>An ensemble deep learning approach to detect tumors on Mohs micrographic surgery slides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is the gold standard technique for removing high risk nonmelanoma skin cancer however, intraoperative histopathological examination demands significant time, effort, and professionality. The objective of this study is to develop a deep learning model to detect basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and artifacts on Mohs slides. A total of 731 Mohs slides from 51 patients with BCCs were used in this study, with 91 containing tumor and 640 without tumor which was defined as non-tumor. The dataset was employed to train U-Net based models that segment tumor and non-tumor regions on the slides. The segmented patches were classified as tumor, or non-tumor to produce predictions for whole slide images (WSIs). For the segmentation phase, the deep learning model success was measured using a Dice score with 0.70 and 0.67 value, area under the curve (AUC) score with 0.98 and 0.96 for tumor and non-tumor, respectively. For the tumor classification, an AUC of 0.98 for patch-based detection, and AUC of 0.91 for slide-based detection was obtained on the test dataset. We present an AI system that can detect tumors and non-tumors in Mohs slides with high success. Deep learning can aid Mohs surgeons and dermatopathologists in making more accurate decisions.</description>

      <title>Individualized Deepfake Detection Exploiting Traces Due to Double Neural-Network Operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In today's digital landscape, journalists urgently require tools to verify the authenticity of facial images and videos depicting specific public figures before incorporating them into news stories. Existing deepfake detectors are not optimized for this detection task when an image is associated with a specific and identifiable individual. This study focuses on the deepfake detection of facial images of individual public figures. We propose to condition the proposed detector on the identity of an identified individual, given the advantages revealed by our theory-driven simulations. While most detectors in the literature rely on perceptible or imperceptible artifacts present in deepfake facial images, we demonstrate that the detection performance can be improved by exploiting the idempotency property of neural networks. In our approach, the training process involves double neural-network operations where we pass an authentic image through a deepfake simulating network twice. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the area under the curve (AUC) from 0.92 to 0.94 and reduces its standard deviation by 17%. To address the need for evaluating detection performance for individual public figures, we curated and publicly released a dataset of ~32k images featuring 45 public figures, as existing deepfake datasets do not meet this criterion.</description>

      <title>HyperVQ: MLR-based Vector Quantization in Hyperbolic Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of models operating on tokenized data has heightened the need for effective tokenization methods, particularly in vision and auditory tasks where inputs are naturally continuous. A common solution is to employ Vector Quantization (VQ) within VQ Variational Autoencoders (VQVAEs), transforming inputs into discrete tokens by clustering embeddings in Euclidean space. However, Euclidean embeddings not only suffer from inefficient packing and limited separation - due to their polynomial volume growth - but are also prone to codebook collapse, where only a small subset of codebook vectors are effectively utilized. To address these limitations, we introduce HyperVQ, a novel approach that formulates VQ as a hyperbolic Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) problem, leveraging the exponential volume growth in hyperbolic space to mitigate collapse and improve cluster separability. Additionally, HyperVQ represents codebook vectors as geometric representatives of hyperbolic decision hyperplanes, encouraging disentangled and robust latent representations. Our experiments demonstrate that HyperVQ matches traditional VQ in generative and reconstruction tasks, while surpassing it in discriminative performance and yielding a more efficient and disentangled codebook.</description>

      <title>A Symmetric Regressor for MRI-Based Assessment of Striatal Dopamine Transporter Uptake in Parkinson's Disease With Enhanced Uncertainty Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging is commonly used for monitoring Parkinson's disease (PD), where striatal DAT uptake amount is computed to assess PD severity. However, DAT imaging has a high cost and the risk of radiance exposure and is not available in general clinics. Recently, MRI patch of the nigral region has been proposed as a safer and easier alternative. This paper proposes a symmetric regressor for predicting the DAT uptake amount from the nigral MRI patch. Acknowledging the symmetry between the right and left nigrae, the proposed regressor incorporates a paired input-output model that simultaneously predicts the DAT uptake amounts for both the right and left striata. Moreover, it employs a symmetric loss that imposes a constraint on the difference between right-to-left predictions, resembling the high correlation in DAT uptake amounts in the two lateral sides. Additionally, we propose a symmetric Monte-Carlo (MC) dropout method for providing a fruitful uncertainty estimate of the DAT uptake prediction, which utilizes the above symmetry. We evaluated the proposed approach on 734 nigral patches, which demonstrated significantly improved performance of the symmetric regressor compared with the standard regressors while giving better explainability and feature representation. The symmetric MC dropout also gave precise uncertainty ranges with a high probability of including the true DAT uptake amounts within the range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03848v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Professional photo editing remains challenging, requiring extensive knowledge of imaging pipelines and significant expertise. While recent deep learning approaches, particularly style transfer methods, have attempted to automate this process, they often struggle with output fidelity, editing control, and complex retouching capabilities. We propose a novel retouch transfer approach that learns from professional edits through before-after image pairs, enabling precise replication of complex editing operations. We develop a context-aware Implicit Neural Representation that learns to apply edits adaptively based on image content and context, and is capable of learning from a single example. Our method extracts implicit transformations from reference edits and adaptively applies them to new images. To facilitate this research direction, we introduce a comprehensive Photo Retouching Dataset comprising 100,000 high-quality images edited using over 170 professional Adobe Lightroom presets. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach not only surpasses existing methods in photo retouching but also enhances performance in related image reconstruction tasks like Gamut Mapping and Raw Reconstruction. By bridging the gap between professional editing capabilities and automated solutions, our work presents a significant step toward making sophisticated photo editing more accessible while maintaining high-fidelity results.

      <description>arXiv:2502.14807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models are becoming increasingly effective in the medical domain, offering pre-trained models on large datasets that can be readily adapted for downstream tasks. Despite progress, fetal ultrasound images remain a challenging domain for foundation models due to their inherent complexity, often requiring substantial additional training and facing limitations due to the scarcity of paired multimodal data. To overcome these challenges, here we introduce FetalCLIP, a vision-language foundation model capable of generating universal representation of fetal ultrasound images. FetalCLIP was pre-trained using a multimodal learning approach on a diverse dataset of 210,035 fetal ultrasound images paired with text. This represents the largest paired dataset of its kind used for foundation model development to date. This unique training approach allows FetalCLIP to effectively learn the intricate anatomical features present in fetal ultrasound images, resulting in robust representations that can be used for a variety of downstream applications. In extensive benchmarking across a range of key fetal ultrasound applications, including classification, gestational age estimation, congenital heart defect (CHD) detection, and fetal structure segmentation, FetalCLIP outperformed all baselines while demonstrating remarkable generalizability and strong performance even with limited labeled data. We plan to release the FetalCLIP model publicly for the benefit of the broader scientific community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detector-based and detector-free matchers are only applicable within their respective sparsity ranges. To improve adaptability of existing matchers, this paper introduces a novel probabilistic reweighting method. Our method is applicable to Transformer-based matching networks and adapts them to different sparsity levels without altering network parameters. The reweighting approach adjusts attention weights and matching scores using detection probabilities of features. And we prove that the reweighted matching network is the asymptotic limit of detector-based matching network. Furthermore, we propose a sparse training and pruning pipeline for detector-free networks based on reweighting. Reweighted versions of SuperGlue, LightGlue, and LoFTR are implemented and evaluated across different levels of sparsity. Experiments show that the reweighting method improves pose accuracy of detector-based matchers on dense features. And the performance of reweighted sparse LoFTR is comparable to detector-based matchers, demonstrating good flexibility in balancing accuracy and computational complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancing AI in computational pathology requires large, high-quality, and diverse datasets, yet existing public datasets are often limited in organ diversity, class coverage, or annotation quality. To bridge this gap, we introduce SPIDER (Supervised Pathology Image-DEscription Repository), the largest publicly available patch-level dataset covering multiple organ types, including Skin, Colorectal, Thorax, and Breast with comprehensive class coverage for each organ. SPIDER provides high-quality annotations verified by expert pathologists and includes surrounding context patches, which enhance classification performance by providing spatial context.
  Alongside the dataset, we present baseline models trained on SPIDER using the Hibou-L foundation model as a feature extractor combined with an attention-based classification head. The models achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple tissue categories and serve as strong benchmarks for future digital pathology research. Beyond patch classification, the model enables rapid identification of significant areas, quantitative tissue metrics, and establishes a foundation for multimodal approaches.
  Both the dataset and trained models are publicly available to advance research, reproducibility, and AI-driven pathology development. Access them at: https://github.com/HistAI/SPIDER</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04928v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate estimates of Above Ground Biomass (AGB) are essential in addressing two of humanity's biggest challenges: climate change and biodiversity loss. Existing datasets for AGB estimation from satellite imagery are limited. Either they focus on specific, local regions at high resolution, or they offer global coverage at low resolution. There is a need for a machine learning-ready, globally representative, high-resolution benchmark dataset. Our findings indicate significant variability in biomass estimates across different vegetation types, emphasizing the necessity for a dataset that accurately captures global diversity. To address these gaps, we introduce a comprehensive new dataset that is globally distributed, covers a range of vegetation types, and spans several years. This dataset combines AGB reference data from the GEDI mission with data from Sentinel-2 and PALSAR-2 imagery. Additionally, it includes pre-processed high-level features such as a dense canopy height map, an elevation map, and a land-cover classification map. We also produce a dense, high-resolution (10m) map of AGB predictions for the entire area covered by the dataset. Rigorously tested, our dataset is accompanied by several benchmark models and is publicly available. It can be easily accessed using a single line of code, offering a solid basis for efforts towards global AGB estimation. The GitHub repository github.com/ghjuliasialelli/AGBD serves as a one-stop shop for all code and data.</description>

      <title>Dual JPEG Compatibility: a Reliable and Explainable Tool for Image Forensics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a JPEG pipeline (compression or decompression), this paper demonstrates how to find the antecedent of an 8x8 block. If it exists, the block is considered compatible with the pipeline. For unaltered images, all blocks remain compatible with the original pipeline; however, for manipulated images, this is not necessarily true. This article provides a first demonstration of the potential of compatibility-based approaches for JPEG image forensics. It introduces a method to address the key challenge of finding a block antecedent in a high-dimensional space, relying on a local search algorithm with restrictions on the search space. We show that inpainting, copy-move, and splicing, when applied after JPEG compression, result in three distinct mismatch problems that can be detected. In particular, if the image is re-compressed after modification, the manipulation can be detected when the quality factor of the second compression is higher than that of the first. Through extensive experiments, we highlight the potential of this compatibility attack under varying degrees of assumptions. While our approach shows promising results-outperforming three state-of-the-art deep learning models in an idealized setting-it remains a proof of concept rather than an off-the-shelf forensic tool. Notably, with a perfect knowledge of the JPEG pipeline, our method guarantees zero false alarms in block-by-block localization, given sufficient computational power.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Distribution Segmentation in Autonomous Driving: Problems and State of the Art</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we review the state of the art in Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation, with a focus on road obstacle detection in automated driving as a real-world application. We analyse the performance of existing methods on two widely used benchmarks, SegmentMeIfYouCan Obstacle Track and LostAndFound-NoKnown, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and real-world applicability. Additionally, we discuss key challenges and outline potential research directions to advance the field. Our goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive perspective on the current landscape of OoD segmentation and to foster further advancements toward safer and more reliable autonomous driving systems.</description>

      <title>Parametric Shadow Control for Portrait Generation in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating diverse portraits, but lack intuitive shadow control. Existing editing approaches, as post-processing, struggle to offer effective manipulation across diverse styles. Additionally, these methods either rely on expensive real-world light-stage data collection or require extensive computational resources for training. To address these limitations, we introduce Shadow Director, a method that extracts and manipulates hidden shadow attributes within well-trained diffusion models. Our approach uses a small estimation network that requires only a few thousand synthetic images and hours of training-no costly real-world light-stage data needed. Shadow Director enables parametric and intuitive control over shadow shape, placement, and intensity during portrait generation while preserving artistic integrity and identity across diverse styles. Despite training only on synthetic data built on real-world identities, it generalizes effectively to generated portraits with diverse styles, making it a more accessible and resource-friendly solution.</description>
