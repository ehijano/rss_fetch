      <title>Hackathons for biophysics education: simulating the cytoskeleton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hackathons are intensive innovation-oriented events where participants work in teams to solve problems or create projects in as little as 24 or 48 hours. These events are common in startup culture, open source communities and mainstream industry. Here we examine how hackathons can be ported to academic teaching, specifically in computational biophysics. We propose hackathons as a teaching modality distinct from traditional courses and structured workshops. In particular, we suggest they can offer a low-stakes platform for students to overcome entry barriers to computational tools or to explore new topics, disciplines, and skills beyond their academic comfort zone. We tested this format in two computational biophysics hackathons on the G\"ottingen campus in 2023 and 2024, providing practical insights and a preliminary evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, the 2024 event is the first public hackathon dedicated to Biophysics. This paper explores the benefits of the hackathon format for teachers and researchers and provides guidelines for running a hackathon adapted to a teaching goal.</description>

      <title>Using Artificial Neural Networks to Optimize Acceleration Due to Gravity g Measurement in a Compound Pendulum Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore a novel approach of implementing the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to validate a traditional experiment performed in the undergraduate physics laboratory, e.g. measurement of acceleration due to gravity g using compound pendulum. The input layer for the ANN model comprises of different parameters of the compound pendulum experiment such as its effective length, time period of oscillation and initial angular displacement. The model is first trained by using 70 percent of the experimental data. Then the trained model is validated and tested on the rest 30 percent of the experimental data which are treated as unseen data to predict the value of g. The ANN-predicted values are compared with the experimental value of g to assess precision. The average value of g was determined to be 1009.029797cm/s^2 with a random error of $\pm$6.817633 cm/s^2 through traditional experiment. However, the ANN-predicted value of g was 1009.029858 with a mean absolute error of 0.000592 cm/s^2. The authors propose that ANN-based methodologies could bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application by introducing students to cutting-edge computational techniques. Such integration allows for a deeper engagement with the subject matter, encouraging critical thinking and problem-solving skills in experimental physics. This innovative approach underscores the transformative role of machine learning in modern physics education. The model's performance demonstrates high accuracy and robustness in predicting g, outperforming traditional empirical approaches. Our results indicate that ANN-based optimization can significantly improve the precision of gravitational measurements, offering a reliable and efficient tool for applications that require high-accuracy determination of gravitational acceleration.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of a Virtual Laboratory Platform in General Education on Quantum Information Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information science and technology has been revolutionizing our daily life, which attracts the curiosity of young generations from diverse backgrounds. While it is quite challenging to teach and learn quantum information science for non-physics majors due to the abstract and counter intuitive nature of quantum mechanics. To address such challenges, virtual laboratories have offered an effective solution. This paper presents the results of pedagogical research on the efficacy of a virtual laboratory platform in general education courses on quantum information science. Specifically, a virtual lab activity on the Bell test was developed using the commercially available platform QLab. This activity aims to help undergraduates from diverse disciplines grasp the counterintuitive yet fundamental concept of quantum entanglement, famously referred to by Albert Einstein as "spooky action at a distance." Qualitative and quantitative evaluations were conducted over three academic years, demonstrating that the virtual laboratory enabled over 80 \% of students to comprehend the complex concept and characteristics of quantum entanglement. This study provides an effective solution for addressing the challenges of teaching quantum information science in undergraduate general education courses, particularly for students from both science and non-science backgrounds.</description>

      <title>The Mysterious Phenomenon of Forward-Progressing Student Tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the factors that contribute to the forward movement of student desks throughout the school day. We hypothesize that desk movement is influenced not only by classroom floor type but also by the physical characteristics of students, such as height and age. Furthermore, we explore how the subject taught in the classroom (e.g., Science vs. Modern Foreign Languages) contributes to desk dynamics. Utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model, we quantitatively analyse the forces at play in these phenomena. This research reveals that desks on carpeted floors are particularly prone to movement, especially in science classrooms with taller and younger students. While the results may seem trivial, they provide critical insights into the mechanics of classroom furniture behaviour and its implications for educational practices. The paper offers compelling evidence that classroom furniture has a mind of its own or, at the very least, a subtle gravitational pull towards the front of the room.</description>

      <title>Quantum Port: Gamification of quantum teleportation for public engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concepts on quantum physics are generally difficult for the general public to understand and grasp due to its counter-intuitive nature and requirement for higher level of mathematical literacy. With categorical quantum mechanics (CQM), quantum theory is re-formalized into a more intuitive diagrammatic approach, which we will refer to as the first level of transformation, to improve the accessibility and readability of quantum theory to a broader audience since the mathematical details are embedded into diagrammatic rules. Taking inspiration from this diagrammatic approach, we propose the second level of transformation by gamifying the diagrammatic rules of quantum teleportation into a quantum card game called Quantum Port. In this work, we discuss the gamification process of quantum teleportation and provide a printable version of Quantum Port for public engagement.</description>

      <title>A Swift analysis of the Eras tour set list and implications for astrophysics research (Taylor's version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Popular culture plays a significant role in shaping public interest in science, and Taylor Swift's discography frequently incorporates astrophysics terminology. This study examines the occurrence of astrophysics-related words in her lyrics and their representation in the Eras tour set list. By analyzing the frequency of words in Swift's total discography, we identify that astrophysics is promoted the most within her most recent album, The Tortured Poets Department, whereas songs from Midnights promoted astrophysics the most throughout the Eras tour. We catagorize words into various disciplines of astrophysics and find that multimessenger astronomy is promoted the most, both in Swift's total discography and throughout the Eras tour. We perform Taylor expansion and predict $12 \pm 5$ astrophysical terms in Swift's next album. This analysis offers a unique perspective on the intersection of music and science, revealing how Swift's artistry may unintentionally promote interest in different fields of astrophysics.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Technology Job Market: Data Driven Analysis of 3641 Job Posts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Quantum Technology (QT) has created a growing demand for a specialized workforce, spanning across academia and industry. This study presents a quantitative analysis of the QT job market by systematically extracting and classifying thousands of job postings worldwide. The classification pipeline leverages large language models (LLMs) whilst incorporating a "human-in-the-loop" validation process to ensure reliability, achieving an F1-score of 89%: a high level of accuracy. The research identifies key trends in regional job distribution, degree and skill requirements, and the evolving demand for QT-related roles. Findings reveal a strong presence of the QT job market in the United States and Europe, with increasing corporate demand for engineers, software developers, and PhD-level researchers. Despite growing industry applications, the sector remains in its early stages, dominated by large technology firms and requiring significant investment in education and workforce development. The study highlights the need for targeted educational programs, interdisciplinary collaboration, and industry-academic partnerships to bridge the QT workforce gap.</description>
