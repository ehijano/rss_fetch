      <title>Aligning Task- and Reconstruction-Oriented Communications for Edge Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing communication systems aim to reconstruct the information at the receiver side, and are known as reconstruction-oriented communications. This approach often falls short in meeting the real-time, task-specific demands of modern AI-driven applications such as autonomous driving and semantic segmentation. As a new design principle, task-oriented communications have been developed. However, it typically requires joint optimization of encoder, decoder, and modified inference neural networks, resulting in extensive cross-system redesigns and compatibility issues. This paper proposes a novel communication framework that aligns reconstruction-oriented and task-oriented communications for edge intelligence. The idea is to extend the Information Bottleneck (IB) theory to optimize data transmission by minimizing task-relevant loss function, while maintaining the structure of the original data by an information reshaper. Such an approach integrates task-oriented communications with reconstruction-oriented communications, where a variational approach is designed to handle the intractability of mutual information in high-dimensional neural network features. We also introduce a joint source-channel coding (JSCC) modulation scheme compatible with classical modulation techniques, enabling the deployment of AI technologies within existing digital infrastructures. The proposed framework is particularly effective in edge-based autonomous driving scenarios. Our evaluation in the Car Learning to Act (CARLA) simulator demonstrates that the proposed framework significantly reduces bits per service by 99.19% compared to existing methods, such as JPEG, JPEG2000, and BPG, without compromising the effectiveness of task execution.</description>

      <title>Partial and Exact Recovery of a Random Hypergraph from its Graph Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a $d$-uniform random hypergraph on $n$ vertices in which hyperedges are included iid so that the average degree is $n^\delta$. The projection of a hypergraph is a graph on the same $n$ vertices where an edge connects two vertices if and only if they belong to some hyperedge. The goal is to reconstruct the hypergraph given its projection. An earlier work of Bresler, Guo, and Polyanskiy (COLT 2024) showed that exact recovery for $d=3$ is possible if and only if $\delta &lt; 2/5$. This work completely resolves the question for all values of $d$ for both exact and partial recovery and for both cases of whether multiplicity information about each edge is available or not. In addition, we show that the reconstruction fidelity undergoes an all-or-nothing transition at a threshold. In particular, this resolves all conjectures from Bresler, Guo, and Polyanskiy (COLT 2024).</description>

      <title>Decoding for Punctured Convolutional and Turbo Codes: A Deep Learning Solution for Protocols Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural network-based decoding methods have shown promise in enhancing error correction performance, but traditional approaches struggle with the challenges posed by punctured codes. In particular, these methods fail to address the complexities of variable code rates and the need for protocol compatibility. This paper presents a unified Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based decoding architecture specifically designed to overcome these challenges. The proposed method unifies punctured convolutional and Turbo codes. A puncture embedding mechanism integrates puncturing patterns directly into the network, enabling seamless adaptation to varying code rates, while balanced bit error rate training ensures robustness across different code lengths, rates, and channels, maintaining protocol flexibility. Extensive simulations in Additive White Gaussian Noise and Rayleigh fading channels demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional decoding techniques, providing significant improvements in decoding accuracy and robustness. These results underscore the potential of LSTM-based decoding as a promising solution for next-generation artificial intelligence powered communication systems.</description>

      <title>Generalization Guarantees for Representation Learning via Data-Dependent Gaussian Mixture Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish in-expectation and tail bounds on the generalization error of representation learning type algorithms. The bounds are in terms of the relative entropy between the distribution of the representations extracted from the training and "test'' datasets and a data-dependent symmetric prior, i.e., the Minimum Description Length (MDL) of the latent variables for the training and test datasets. Our bounds are shown to reflect the "structure" and "simplicity'' of the encoder and significantly improve upon the few existing ones for the studied model. We then use our in-expectation bound to devise a suitable data-dependent regularizer; and we investigate thoroughly the important question of the selection of the prior. We propose a systematic approach to simultaneously learning a data-dependent Gaussian mixture prior and using it as a regularizer. Interestingly, we show that a weighted attention mechanism emerges naturally in this procedure. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms the now popular Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) method as well as the recent Category-Dependent VIB (CDVIB).</description>

      <title>Benefits of Mutual Coupling in Dynamic Metasurface Antennas for Optimizing Wireless Communications -- Theory and Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are a promising embodiment of next-generation reconfigurable antenna technology to realize base stations and access points with reduced cost and power consumption. A DMA is a thin structure patterned on its front with reconfigurable radiating metamaterial elements (meta-atoms) that are excited by waveguides or cavities. Mutual coupling between the meta-atoms can result in a strongly non-linear dependence of the DMA's radiation pattern on the configuration of its meta-atoms. However, besides the obvious algorithmic challenges of working with physics-compliant DMA models, it remains unclear how mutual coupling in DMAs influences the ability to achieve a desired wireless functionality. In this paper, we provide theoretical, numerical and experimental evidence that strong mutual coupling in DMAs increases the radiation pattern sensitivity to the DMA configuration and thereby boosts the available control over the radiation pattern, improving the ability to tailor the radiation pattern to the requirements of a desired wireless functionality. Counterintuitively, we hence encourage next-generation DMA implementations to enhance (rather than suppress) mutual coupling, in combination with suitable physics-compliant modeling and optimization. We expect the unveiled mechanism by which mutual coupling boosts the radiation pattern control to also apply to other reconfigurable antenna systems based on tunable lumped elements.</description>

      <title>Expectation Propagation based Line Spectral Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09094</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.09094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fundamental problem of line spectral estimation (LSE) using the expectation propagation (EP) method is studied. Previous approaches estimate the model order sequentially, limiting their practical utility in scenarios with large dimensions of measurements and signals. To overcome this limitation, a bilinear generalized LSE (BiG-LSE) method that concurrently estimates the model order is developed. The key concept involves iteratively approximating the original nonlinear model as a bilinear model through Taylor series expansion, with EP employed for inference. To mitigate computational complexity, the posterior log-pdfs are approximated to reduce the number of messages. BiG-LSE automatically determines the model order, noise variance, provides uncertainty levels for the estimates, and adeptly handles nonlinear measurements. Based on the BiG-LSE, a variant employing the von Mises distribution for the frequency is developed, which is suitable for sequential estimation. Numerical experiments and real data are used to demonstrate that BiG-LSE achieves estimation accuracy comparable to current methods.</description>

      <title>Demystifying 5G Polar and LDPC Codes: A Comprehensive Review and Foundations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper serves as a comprehensive guide for practitioners and scholars aiming to understand the channel coding and decoding schemes integral to the 5G NR standard, with a particular focus on LDPC and polar codes. We start by explaining the design procedures that underlie these channel codes, offering fundamental information from the perspectives of both encoding and decoding. In order to determine the present status of research in this area, we also provide a thorough literature review. Notably, we add comprehensive, standard-specific information to these foundational evaluations that is frequently difficult to extract from technical specification documents. The significance of reviewing and refining the foundations of the aforementioned codes lies in their potential to serve as candidate error-correcting codes for the future 6G standard and beyond.</description>

      <title>Spatially-Coupled QLDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00137v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatially-coupled (SC) codes is a class of convolutional LDPC codes that has been well investigated in classical coding theory thanks to their high performance and compatibility with low-latency decoders. We describe toric codes as quantum counterparts of classical two-dimensional spatially-coupled (2D-SC) codes, and introduce spatially-coupled quantum LDPC (SC-QLDPC) codes as a generalization. We use the convolutional structure to represent the parity check matrix of a 2D-SC code as a polynomial in two indeterminates, and derive an algebraic condition that is both necessary and sufficient for a 2D-SC code to be a stabilizer code. This algebraic framework facilitates the construction of new code families. While not the focus of this paper, we note that small memory facilitates physical connectivity of qubits, and it enables local encoding and low-latency windowed decoding. In this paper, we use the algebraic framework to optimize short cycles in the Tanner graph of 2D-SC hypergraph product (HGP) codes that arise from short cycles in either component code. While prior work focuses on QLDPC codes with rate less than 1/10, we construct 2D-SC HGP codes with small memories, higher rates (about 1/3), and superior thresholds.</description>

      <title>Optimal Local Measurements in Single-Parameter Quantum Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum measurement plays a crucial role in quantum metrology. Due to the limitations of experimental capabilities, collectively measuring multiple copies of probing systems can present significant challenges. Therefore, the concept of locality in quantum measurements must be considered. In this work, we investigate the possibility of achieving the Quantum Cram\'er-Rao Bound (QCRB) through local measurements (LM). We first demonstrate that if there exists a LM to saturate the QCRB for qubit systems, then we can construct another rank-1 local projective measurement to saturate the QCRB. In this sense, rank-1 local projective measurements are sufficient to analyze the problem of saturating the QCRB. For pure qubits, we propose two necessary and sufficient methods to determine whether and how a given parameter estimation model can achieve QCRB through LM. The first method, dubbed iterative matrix partition method (IMP) and based on unitary transformations that render the diagonal entries of a tracless matrix vanish, elucidates the underlying mathematical structure of LM as well as the local measurements with classical communications (LMCC), generalizing the result by [Zhou et al Quantum Sci. Technol. 5, 025005 (2020)], which only holds for the later case. We clarify that the saturation of QCRB through LM for the GHZ-encoded states is actually due to the self-similar structure in this approach. The second method, dubbed hierarchy of orthogonality conditions (HOC) and based on the parametrization of rank-1 measurements for qubit systems, allows us to construct several examples of saturating QCRB, including the three-qubit W states and $N$-qubit W states ($N \geq 3$). Our findings offer insights into achieving optimal performance in quantum metrology when measurement resources are limited.</description>

      <title>Time-Uniform Confidence Spheres for Means of Random Vectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08168v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study sequential mean estimation in $\mathbb{R}^d$. In particular, we derive time-uniform confidence spheres -- confidence sphere sequences (CSSs) -- which contain the mean of random vectors with high probability simultaneously across all sample sizes. Our results include a dimension-free CSS for log-concave random vectors, a dimension-free CSS for sub-Gaussian random vectors, and CSSs for sub-$\psi$ random vectors (which includes sub-gamma, sub-Poisson, and sub-exponential distributions). Many of our results are optimal. For sub-Gaussian distributions we also provide a CSS which tracks a time-varying mean, generalizing Robbins' mixture approach to the multivariate setting. Finally, we provide several CSSs for heavy-tailed random vectors (two moments only). Our bounds hold under a martingale assumption on the mean and do not require that the observations be iid. Our work is based on PAC-Bayesian theory and inspired by an approach of Catoni and Giulini.</description>

      <title>Generalized quantum asymptotic equipartition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a generalized quantum asymptotic equipartition property (AEP) beyond the i.i.d. framework where the random samples are drawn from two sets of quantum states. In particular, under suitable assumptions on the sets, we prove that all operationally relevant divergences converge to the quantum relative entropy between the sets. More specifically, both the smoothed min- and max-relative entropy approach the regularized relative entropy between the sets. Notably, the asymptotic limit has explicit convergence guarantees and can be efficiently estimated through convex optimization programs, despite the regularization, provided that the sets have efficient descriptions.
  We give three applications of this result: (i) The generalized AEP directly implies a new generalized quantum Stein's lemma for conducting quantum hypothesis testing between two sets of quantum states. (ii) We introduce a quantum version of adversarial hypothesis testing where the tester plays against an adversary who possesses internal quantum memory and controls the quantum device and show that the optimal error exponent is precisely characterized by a new notion of quantum channel divergence, named the minimum output channel divergence. (iii) We derive a relative entropy accumulation theorem stating that the smoothed min-relative entropy between two sequential processes of quantum channels can be lower bounded by the sum of the regularized minimum output channel divergences.
  At a technical level, we establish new additivity and chain rule properties for the measured relative entropy which we expect will have more applications.</description>

      <title>Interactive Inference: A Neuromorphic Theory of Human-Computer Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05935v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic HCI is a new theoretical approach to designing better UX inspired by the neurophysiology of the brain. Here, we apply the neuroscientific theory of Active Inference to HCI, postulating that users perform Bayesian inference on progress and goal distributions to predict their next action (Interactive Inference). We show how Bayesian surprise between goal and progress distributions follows a mean square error function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the task. However, capacity to process Bayesian surprise follows the logarithm of SNR, and errors occur when average capacity is exceeded. Our model allows the quantitative analysis of performance and error in one framework with real-time estimation of mental load. We show through mathematical theorems how three basic laws of HCI, Hick's Law, Fitts' Law and the Power Law fit our model. We then test the validity of the general model by empirically measuring how well it predicts human performance in a car following task. Results suggest that driver processing capacity indeed is a logarithmic function of the SNR of the distance to a lead car. This positive result provides initial evidence that Interactive Interference can work as a new theoretical underpinning for HCI, deserving further exploration.</description>
