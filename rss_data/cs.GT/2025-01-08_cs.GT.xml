      <title>Truthful mechanisms for linear bandit games with private contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The contextual bandit problem, where agents arrive sequentially with personal contexts and the system adapts its arm allocation decisions accordingly, has recently garnered increasing attention for enabling more personalized outcomes. However, in many healthcare and recommendation applications, agents have private profiles and may misreport their contexts to gain from the system. For example, in adaptive clinical trials, where hospitals sequentially recruit volunteers to test multiple new treatments and adjust plans based on volunteers' reported profiles such as symptoms and interim data, participants may misreport severe side effects like allergy and nausea to avoid perceived suboptimal treatments. We are the first to study this issue of private context misreporting in a stochastic contextual bandit game between the system and non-repeated agents. We show that traditional low-regret algorithms, such as UCB family algorithms and Thompson sampling, fail to ensure truthful reporting and can result in linear regret in the worst case, while traditional truthful algorithms like explore-then-commit (ETC) and $\epsilon$-greedy algorithm incur sublinear but high regret. We propose a mechanism that uses a linear program to ensure truthfulness while minimizing deviation from Thompson sampling, yielding an $O(\ln T)$ frequentist regret. Our numerical experiments further demonstrate strong performance in multiple contexts and across other distribution families.</description>

      <title>Winner-Pays-Bid Auctions Minimize Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any social choice function (e.g., the efficient allocation) can be implemented using different payment rules: first-price, second-price, all-pay, etc. All of these payment rules are guaranteed to have the same expected revenue by the revenue equivalence theorem, but have different distributions of revenue, leading to a question of which one is best. We prove that among all possible payment rules, winner-pays-bid minimizes the variance in revenue and, in fact, minimizes any convex risk measure.</description>

      <title>Voting with Partial Orders: The Plurality and Anti-Plurality Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17413v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Plurality rule for linear orders selects the alternatives most frequently appearing in the first position of those orders, while the Anti-Plurality rule selects the alternatives least often occurring in the final position. We explore extensions of these rules to partial orders, offering axiomatic characterisations for these extensions.\\ \textbf{Keywords:} Plurality, Anti-Plurality, Strict Partial Orders, Voting.</description>

      <title>Information Design with Unknown Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05533v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical information design models (e.g., Bayesian persuasion and cheap talk) require players to have perfect knowledge of the prior distribution of the state of the world. Our paper studies repeated persuasion problems in which the information designer does not know the prior. The information designer learns to design signaling schemes from repeated interactions with the receiver. We design learning algorithms for the information designer to achieve no regret compared to using the optimal signaling scheme with known prior, under two models of the receiver's decision-making. (1) The first model assumes that the receiver knows the prior and can perform posterior update and best respond to signals. In this model, we design a learning algorithm for the information designer with $O(\log T)$ regret in the general case, and another algorithm with $\Theta(\log \log T)$ regret in the case where the receiver has only two actions. (2) The second model assumes that the receiver does not know the prior and employs a no-regret learning algorithm to take actions. We show that the information designer can achieve regret $O(\sqrt{\mathrm{rReg}(T) T})$, where $\mathrm{rReg}(T)=o(T)$ is an upper bound on the receiver's learning regret. Our work thus provides a learning foundation for the problem of information design with unknown prior.</description>
