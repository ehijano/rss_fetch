      <title>Recurrent neural chemical reaction networks that approximate arbitrary dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many important phenomena in chemistry and biology are realized via dynamical features such as multi-stability, oscillations, and chaos. Construction of novel chemical systems with such finely-tuned dynamics is a challenging problem central to the growing field of synthetic biology. In this paper, we address this problem by putting forward a molecular version of a recurrent artificial neural network, which we call a recurrent neural chemical reaction network (RNCRN). We prove that the RNCRN, with sufficiently many auxiliary chemical species and suitable fast reactions, can be systematically trained to achieve any dynamics. This approximation ability is shown to hold independent of the initial conditions for the auxiliary species, making the RNCRN more experimentally feasible. To demonstrate the results, we present a number of relatively simple RNCRNs trained to display a variety of biologically-important dynamical features.</description>

      <title>Mapping dynamical systems into chemical reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical systems with polynomials on the right-hand side can model a wide range of physical processes. A subset of such dynamical systems that can model chemical reactions under mass-action kinetics are called chemical systems. A central problem in synthetic biology is to map general polynomial dynamical systems into dynamically similar chemical ones. In this paper, we present a novel map, called the quasi-chemical map, that can systematically solve this problem. The quasi-chemical map introduces suitable state-dependent perturbations into any given polynomial dynamical system which then becomes chemical under suitably large translation of variables. We prove that this map preserves robust dynamical features, such as generic equilibria and limit cycles, as well as temporal properties, such as periods of oscillations. Furthermore, the resulting chemical systems are of only at most one degree higher than the original dynamical systems. We demonstrate the quasi-chemical map by designing relatively simple chemical systems with exotic dynamics and pre-defined bifurcation structures.</description>
