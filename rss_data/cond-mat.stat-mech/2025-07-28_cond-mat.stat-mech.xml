      <title>Macroscopic fluctuation theory and the absorption of Brownian particles by partially reactive targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT) to analyse current fluctuations in a non-interacting Brownian gas with one or more partially absorbing targets within a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \R^d$. We proceed by coarse-graining a generalised Dean-Kawasaki equation with Robin boundary conditions at the target surfaces. The exterior surface $\partial \Omega$ is maintained at a constant density $\owp$. We first derive MFT equations for the optimal noise-induced path for a single target under a saddle-point approximation of the associated path integral action. We then obtain the Gaussian distribution characterising small current fluctuations by linearising the MFT equations about the corresponding deterministic or noise-averaged system and solving the resulting stationary equations. The Robin boundary conditions are handled using the spectrum of a Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator defined on the target surface. We illustrate the theory by considering the finite interval and a circular annulus. In both cases we determine how the variance of the current depends on the rate of absorption $\kappa$. Finally, we extend our analysis to multiple partially absorbing targets. First, we obtain the general result that, in the case of partially absorbing targets ($0&lt;\kappa&lt;\infty$), the covariance matrix for current fluctuations supports cross correlations even in the absence of particle interactions. (These cross-correlations vanish in the totally absorbing limit $\kappa\rightarrow \infty$.) We then explicitly calculate the covariance matrix for circular targets in a 2D domain by assuming that the targets are much smaller than the characteristic size $L$ of the domain $\Omega$ and applying methods from singular perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Density-dependent transport coefficients in two-dimensional cellular aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale collective behavior of biological systems can be characterized by macroscopic transport, which arises from the non-equilibrium microscopic interactions among individual constituents. A prominent example is the formation of dynamic aggregates by motile eukaryotic cells or bacteria mediated by active contractile forces. In this work, we develop the two-dimensional fluctuating hydrodynamics theory based on the microscopic dynamics of a model system of aggregation by \textit{Neisseria gonorrhoeae} bacteria. The derivation of two macroscopic transport coefficients of bulk diffusivity and conductivity which determine hydrodynamic current of cells is the central result of this work. By showing how transport coefficients depend on cell density and microscopic parameters of the system we predict transport slowdown during the colony formation process. This study provides valuable analytical tools for quantifying hydrodynamic transport in experimental systems involving cellular aggregation occurring due to intermittent contractile dipole forces.</description>

      <title>Exploration and aging of non-Markovian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis explores a central question: how does memory affect the way random walkers explore space? By analyzing various non-Markovian models, where past behavior directly influences future dynamics, we uncover new mechanisms and universal patterns in space exploration.
  In the first part, we study Locally Activated Random Walks (LARWs), where motion depends on the time spent at visited sites. These walks, though simply defined, display rich behaviors such as dynamical trapping, aging, and non-Gaussian diffusion. We identify confinement criteria, reveal a dynamical phase transition, and derive exact analytical results in several regimes.
  The second part focuses on Self-Interacting Random Walks (SIRWs), where the walker's own history governs future steps. Using advanced probabilistic tools, especially Ray-Knight theory, we compute exact results for observables such as splitting probabilities, persistence, first-passage times, number of visited sites, and aging effects. This includes the first exact expressions for aged observables in the saturating Self-Attracting Walk (SATW) model.
  In the third part, we propose a unified framework to describe memory effects in space exploration, based on the walker's tendency to reverse direction over time. This approach reveals robust patterns across a wide class of non-Markovian models, including fractional Brownian motion and the strongly self-interacting True Self-Avoiding Walk (TSAW), where we derive the first exact result for an aged observable in a non-saturating system.
  Together, these results show that memory-driven systems, though complex, can exhibit universal structures. This work offers new tools to analyze such dynamics and lays the groundwork for future research across physics, probability, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Absence of nontrivial local conserved quantities in the Hubbard model on the two or higher dimensional hypercubic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By extending the strategy developed by Shiraishi in 2019, we prove that the standard Hubbard model on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ does not admit any nontrivial local conserved quantities. The theorem strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. To our knowledge, this is the first extension of Shiraishi's proof of the absence of conserved quantities to a fermionic model. Although our proof follows the original strategy of Shiraishi, it is essentially more subtle compared with the proof by Shiraishi and Tasaki of the corresponding theorem for $S=\tfrac12$ quantum spin systems in two or higher dimensions; our proof requires three steps, while that of Shiraishi and Tasaki requires only two steps. It is also necessary to partially determine the conserved quantities of the one-dimensional Hubbard model to accomplish our proof.</description>

      <title>Finite size effect in the persistence probability of the Edwards-Wilkinson model of surface growth and effect of non-linearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical evolution of the surface height is controlled by
  either a linear or a nonlinear Langevin equation, depending on the
  underlying microscopic dynamics, and is often done theoretically
  using stochastic coarse-grained growth equations. The persistence
  probability $p(t)$ of stochastic models of surface growth that are
  constrained by a finite system size is examined in this work. We
  focus on the linear Edwards-Wilkinson model (EW) and the nonlinear
  Kardar-Parisi-Zhang model, two specific models of surface
  growth. The persistence exponents in the continuum version of these
  two models have been widely investigated. Krug et al.[Phys. Rev. E ,
  56:2702-2712, (1997)] and Kallabis et al. [EPL (Europhysics Letters)
  , 45(1):20, 1999] had shown that, the steady-state persistence
  exponents for both these models are related to the growth exponent
  $\beta$ as $\theta=1-\beta$. It is numerically found that the values
  of persistence exponents for both these models are close to the
  analytically predicted values. While the results of the continuum
  equations of the surface growth are well known, we focus to study
  the persistence probability expressions for discrete models with a
  finite size effect. In this article, we have investigated the
  persistence probabilities for the linear Edwards-Wilkinson(EW) model
  and for the non-linear Kardar-Parisi-Zhang(KPZ) model of surface
  growth on a finite one-dimensional lattice. The interesting
  phenomenon which is found in this case is that the known scenario of
  $p(t)$ of the following algebraic decay vanishes as we introduce a
  finite system size.</description>

      <title>Two fluctuating interfaces with sticking interactions: Invariant measures and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a non-equilibrium stochastic model of two fluctuating interfaces which interact through short-range attractive interactions at their points of contact. Beginning from an entangled state, the system exhibits diverse dynamics -- ranging from fast transients with small lifetimes to ultraslow evolution through quasi-stationary states -- and reaches stuck, entangled, or detached steady states. Near the stuck-detached transition, two distinct dynamical modes of evolution co-occur. When the two surfaces evolve through similar dynamics (both Edwards-Wilkinson or both Kardar-Parisi-Zhang), the invariant measure is determined and found to have an inhomogeneous product form. This exact steady state is shown to be the measure of the equilibrium Poland-Scheraga model of DNA denaturation.</description>

      <title>Configurational Entropy and Its Scaling Behavior in Lattice Systems with Number of States Defined by Coordination Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an exactly solvable lattice model that reveals a universal finite-size scaling law for configurational entropy driven purely by geometry. Using exact enumeration via Burnside's lemma, we compute the entropy for diverse 1D, 2D, and 3D lattices, finding that the deviation from the thermodynamic limit $s_{\infty} = \ln (z)$ scales as $\Delta s_{N} \sim N^{-1/d}$, with lattice-dependent higher-order corrections. This scaling, observed across structures from chains to FCC and diamond lattices, offers a minimal framework to quantify geometric influences on entropy. The model captures the order of magnitude of experimental residual entropies (e.g., $S_{\mathrm{molar}} = R \ln 12 \approx 20.7 \, \mathrm{J/mol \cdot K}$) and provides a reference for understanding entropy-driven order in colloids, clusters, and solids.</description>

      <title>Physical Constraints on the Rhythmicity of the Biological Clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circadian rhythms in living organisms are temporal orders emerging from biochemical circuits driven out of equilibrium. Here, we study how the rhythmicity of a biochemical clock is shaped using the KaiABC system. A phase diagram constructed as a function of KaiC and KaiA concentrations reveals a sharply bounded limit-cycle region, which naturally explains arrhythmia upon protein over-expression. Beyond the Hopf bifurcation, intrinsic noise enables regular oscillation via coherence resonance. Within the limit-cycle region, greater rhythmic precision incurs a higher energetic cost, following the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. The cost-minimizing period of the KaiABC clock ($\sim$21-hr) is close enough to entrain to 24-hr cycle of environment. Our study substantiates universal physical constraints on the robustness, precision, and efficiency of noisy biological clocks.</description>

      <title>When does hyperuniformity lead to uniformity across length scales?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperuniform systems are distinguished by an unusually strong suppression of large-scale density fluctuations and, consequently, display a high degree of uniformity at the largest length scales. In some cases, however, enhanced uniformity is expected to be present even at intermediate and possibly small length scales. There exist three different classes of hyperuniform systems, where class I and class III are the strongest and weakest forms, respectively. We utilize the local number variance $\sigma_N^2(R)$ associated with a window of radius $R$ as a diagnostic to quantify the approach to the asymptotic large-$R$ hyperuniform scaling of a variety of class I, II, and III systems. We find, for all class I systems we analyzed, including crystals, quasicrystals, disordered stealthy hyperuniform systems, and the one-component plasma, a faster approach to the asymptotic scaling of $\sigma_N^2(R)$, governed by corrections with integer powers of $1/R$. Thus, we conclude this represents the highest degree of effective uniformity from small to large length scales. Class II systems, such as Fermi-sphere point processes, are characterized by logarithmic $1/\ln(R)$ corrections and, consequently, a lower degree of local uniformity. Class III systems, such as perturbed lattice patterns, present an asymptotic scaling of $1/R^{\alpha}$, $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$, implying, curiously, an intermediate degree of local uniformity. In addition, our study provides insight into when experimental and numerical finite systems are representative of large-scale behavior. Our findings may thereby facilitate the design of hyperuniform systems with enhanced physical properties arising from local uniformity.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium fluctuations in a harmonic trap with annealed stochastic stiffness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive analysis of the positional dynamics and average thermodynamics of an overdamped Brownian particle subject to both, harmonic confinement and annealed disorder due to a temporarily fluctuating trap stiffness. We model this stiffness via a stationary Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process whose correlation time can be tuned from white noise to a quenched limit. We analytically calculate the positional distribution in these limits and provide exact expressions for the $n$th positional moments at finite correlation times, revealing important insights regarding stationarity. Further, we analyze the average work performed on the particle and the heat dissipated into the environment at all times, illustrating the nonequilibrium character of the system and its relaxation into a steady state. Our analytical results are validated by numerical Langevin simulations.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a Boundary-Sensitive Phase in Hyperbolic Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical systems defined on hyperbolic lattices may exhibit phases of matter that only emerge due to negative curvature. We focus on the case of the Ising model under open boundary conditions and show that an ``intermediate'' phase emerges in addition to standard (high-temperature) paramagnetic and (low-temperature) ferromagnetic phases. When performing the Kramers-Wannier duality the fact that it alters boundary conditions becomes crucial, since a finite fraction of lattice sites lie on the boundary. We propose to characterize this ``intermediate'' phase by its sensitivity to boundary conditions, wherein bulk ordering is not spontaneous but rather induced by boundary effects, setting it apart from the Landau paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking. By developing a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry restricted extension of the Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalization Group method, we provide numerical evidence for the existence of all three distinct phases and their corresponding two-stage phase transitions, thereby establishing the complete phase diagram. We also establish how the (spontaneous) intermediate-to-ferromagnetic and the (induced) paramagnetic-to-intermediate transition points are related by the Kramers-Wannier duality relation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic regression automates the process of learning closed-form mathematical models from data. Standard approaches to symbolic regression, as well as newer deep learning approaches, rely on heuristic model selection criteria, heuristic regularization, and heuristic exploration of model space. Here, we discuss the probabilistic approach to symbolic regression, an alternative to such heuristic approaches with direct connections to information theory and statistical physics. We show how the probabilistic approach establishes model plausibility from basic considerations and explicit approximations, and how it provides guarantees of performance that heuristic approaches lack. We also discuss how the probabilistic approach compels us to consider model ensembles, as opposed to single models.</description>

      <title>The joint probability distribution function of global interaction complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the relationship that the interaction energy between any two subsystems is equal to their internal energy multiplied by the interaction coefficient, we have derived a series correlated expressions of statistical physical quantities, such as the interactional average energy, the probability distribution function of internal energy, and so on. It should be noted that the probability distribution function we obtained is existing in many complex systems involving long-range interactions. Further, based on the zeroth law of thermodynamics, we have also obtained the joint probability distribution function of two coupled complex systems. It must be note that the joint probability distribution function we obtained no longer satisfies the common independent multiplication relationship in the previous researches. Finally, we selected several representative foreign exchange high-frequency trading data for verification and found that the theory is consistent with the reality.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons-matter conformal field theory on fuzzy sphere: Confinement transition of Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories compose a large class of interacting conformal field theories in 3d, among which an outstanding category is critical Chern-Simons-matter theories. In this paper, we focus on one of the simplest instances: one complex critical scalar coupled to $\mathrm{U}(1)_2$ Chern-Simons gauge field. It is theoretically interesting as it is conjectured to exhibit dualities between four simple Lagrangian descriptions, but also practically important as it describes the transition between Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid (or $\nu=1/2$ bosonic Laughlin state) and trivially gapped phase. Using the fuzzy sphere regularisation, we realise this theory as a transition on the spherical lowest Landau level between a $\nu_f=2$ fermionic integer quantum Hall state and a $\nu_b=1/2$ bosonic fractional quantum Hall state. We show that this transition is continuous and has emergent conformal symmetry. By studying the operator spectrum, we show that there exists only one relevant singlet with scaling dimension $\Delta_S=1.52(18)$. We also discuss other higher operators and the consequences of our results.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic stability of superflows in General Relativity and Newtonian gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Landau's criterion for superfluidity is a special case of a broader principle: A moving fluid cannot be stopped by frictional forces if its state of motion is a local minimum of the grand potential. We employ this general thermodynamic criterion to derive a set of inequalities that any superfluid mixture (with an arbitrary number of order parameters) must satisfy for a certain state of motion to be long-lived and unimpeded by friction. These macroscopic constraints complement Landau's original criterion, in that they hold at all temperatures, and remain valid even for gapless superfluids. Unfortunately, they are only necessary conditions for the existence of a frictionless hydrodynamic motion, since they presuppose the validity of a fluid description. However, they do provide sufficient conditions for stability against stochastic hydrodynamic fluctuations. We first formulate our analysis within the framework of General Relativity, and then we take the Newtonian limit.</description>

      <title>Finite-Size Effects in Quantum Metrology at Strong Coupling: Microscopic vs Phenomenological Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ultimate precision limits of a spin chain, strongly coupled to a heat bath, for measuring a general parameter and report the results for specific cases of magnetometry and thermometry. Employing a full polaron transform, we derive the effective Hamiltonian and obtain analytical expressions for the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of equilibrium states in both weak coupling (WC) and strong coupling (SC) regimes for a general parameter, explicitly accounting for finite-size (FS) effects. Furthermore, we utilize Hill's nanothermodynamics to calculate an effective QFI expression at SC. Our results reveal a potential advantage of SC for thermometry at low temperatures and demonstrate enhanced magnetometric precision through control of the anisotropy parameter. Crucially, we show that neglecting FS effects leads to considerable errors in ultimate precision bounds for equilibrium thermometry. This work also highlights the inadequacy of phenomenological approaches in describing the metrological capability and thermodynamic behavior of systems at SC. Additionally, we demonstrate the effect of bath on system's phase transition at SC.</description>

      <title>Numerical extraction of crosscap coefficients in microscopic models for (2+1)D conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal field theory (CFT) can be placed on disparate space-time manifolds to facilitate investigations of their properties. For (2+1)D theories, one useful choice is the real projective space $\mathbb{RP}^3$ obtained by identifying antipodal points on the boundary sphere of a three-dimensional ball. One-point functions of scalar primary fields on this manifold generally do not vanish and encode the so-called crosscap coefficients. These coefficients also manifest on the sphere as the overlaps between certain crosscap states and CFT primary states. Taking the (2+1)D Ising CFT as a concrete example, we demonstrate that crosscap coefficients can be extracted from microscopic models. We construct crosscap states in both lattice models defined on polyhedrons and continuum models in Landau levels, where the degrees of freedom at antipodal points are entangled in Bell-type states. By computing their overlaps with the eigenstates of many-body Hamiltonians, we obtain results consistent with those from conformal bootstrap. Importantly, our approach directly reveals the absolute values of crosscap overlaps, whereas bootstrap calculations typically yield only their ratios. Furthermore, we investigate the finite-size scaling of these overlaps and their evolution under perturbations away from criticality.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue spectral tails and localization properties of asymmetric networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contrast to the neatly bounded spectra of densely populated large random matrices, sparse random matrices often exhibit unbounded eigenvalue tails on the real and imaginary axis, called Lifshitz tails. In the case of asymmetric matrices, concise mathematical results have proved elusive. In this work, we present an analytical approach to characterising these tails. We exploit the fact that eigenvalues in the tail region have corresponding eigenvectors that are exponentially localised on highly-connected hubs of the network associated to the random matrix. We approximate these eigenvectors using a series expansion in the inverse connectivity of the hub, where successive terms in the series take into account further sets of next-nearest neighbours. By considering the ensemble of such hubs, we are able to characterise the eigenvalue density and the extent of localisation in the tails of the spectrum in a general fashion. As such, we classify a number of different asymptotic behaviours in the Lifshitz tails, as well as the leading eigenvalue and the inverse participation ratio. We demonstrate how an interplay between matrix asymmetry, network structure, and the edge-weight distribution leads to the variety of observed behaviours.</description>

      <title>On correlation functions of the open XYZ spin 1/2 chain with boundary fields related by a constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the quantum XYZ open spin-1/2 chain with boundary fields. We focus on the particular case in which the six boundary parameters are related by a single constraint enabling us to describe part of the spectrum by standard Bethe equations. We derive for this model exact representations for a set of elementary blocks of correlation functions, hence generalising to XYZ the results obtained in the XXZ open case in arXiv:2208.10097. Our approach is also similar to the approach proposed in the XXZ case arXiv:2208.10097: we solve the model by Sklyanin's version of the quantum Separation of Variables, using Baxter's Vertex-IRF transformation; in this framework, we identify a basis of local operators with a relatively simple action on the transfer matrix eigenstates; we then use the solution of the quantum inverse problem and our recent formulae on scalar products of separate states arXiv:2402.04112 to compute some of the corresponding matrix elements, which can therefore be considered as elementary building blocks for the correlation functions. The latter are expressed in terms of multiple sums in the finite chain, and as multiple integrals in the thermodynamic limit. Our results evidence that, once the basis of local operators is properly chosen, the corresponding building blocks for correlation functions have a similar structure in the XXX/XXZ/XYZ open chains, and do not require any insertion of non-local "tail operators".</description>

      <title>Quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of mid-anneal measurement in quantum annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum annealing is a promising metaheuristic for solving constrained combinatorial optimization problems. However, parameter tuning difficulties and hardware noise often prevent optimal solutions from being properly encoded as the ground states of the problem Hamiltonian. This study investigates mid-anneal measurement as a mitigation approach for such situations, analyzing its effectiveness and underlying physical mechanisms. We introduce a quantitative metric to evaluate the effectiveness of mid-anneal measurement and apply it to the graph bipartitioning problem and the quadratic knapsack problem. Our findings reveal that mid-anneal measurement is most effective when the energy difference between desired solutions and ground states is small, with effectiveness strongly governed by the energy structure. Furthermore, the effectiveness increases as the Hamming distance between the ground and excited states gets small, highlighting the role of state similarity. Analysis of fully-connected Ising models demonstrates that the effectiveness of mid-anneal measurement persists with increasing system size, indicating its scalability and practical applicability to large-scale quantum annealing.</description>

Abstract: In this note we discuss how the matrix product solution for the steady state of the harmonic process is obtained from the solutions already known in the literature, i.e. the closed-form expression derived in arXiv:2107.01720 and the nested integral form obtained in arXiv:2307.02793 and arXiv:2307.14975. Our results clarify the relation between the three representations of the steady state and provide the matrix product solution that has not been available for this model before.</description>

Abstract: The hyperkagome-lattice $S=1/2$ Heisenberg ferromagnet is studied by means of the linear spin-wave theory, the double-time temperature Green's function method, high-temperature expansions series analysis, and quantum Monte Carlo simulations to examine the effect of lattice geometry on the finite-temperature properties. In particular, we have found that the Curie temperature $T_c$ for the hyperkagome-lattice (frustrated lattice) ferromagnet is about $0.33\vert J\vert$ that is smaller than $T_c$ for the diamond-lattice (another three-dimensional lattice with the same coordination number 4 but bipartite one) ferromagnet by about $25\%$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High entropy alloys gained significant scientific interest in recent years due to their enhanced mechanical properties including high yield strength combined with outstanding ductility. The strength of these materials originates from their highly heterogeneous pinning stress fields that hinder dislocation glide, that is, plastic deformation. This work investigates how the correlations and the anisotropy of the pinning stresses, and the long-range nature and the anisotropy of dislocation interactions influence the propagation of dislocations and the depinning transition in these alloys. Furthermore, it is studied how the impact of these factors manifest in the shape of dislocations. The implications to the wider scope of generic disordered systems and to possible experimental applications are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Herd Immunity with Spatial Adaptation Based on Global Prevalence Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During an epidemic outbreak, individuals often modify their behavior in response to global prevalence cues, using spatially mediated adaptations such as reduced mobility or transmission range. In this work, we investigate the impact of distance-based adaptive behaviors on epidemic dynamics, where a fraction of the population adjusts its transmission range and susceptibility to infection based on global prevalence. We consider three adaptation scenarios: a constant adaptive fraction, a power-law dependence and a sigmoidal dependence of adaptive fraction on global prevalence. In the spatially well-mixed regime, we analytically obtain critical adaptation thresholds necessary for epidemic mitigation and in the spatially static regime, we establish bounds for the thresholds using continuum percolation results. Our results indicate that a linear adaptive response to prevalence provides no additional advantage over a constant adaptive fraction in controlling outbreaks, and a highly super-linear response is required to suppress epidemic spread. For a sigmoidal adaptation, we identify conditions under which oscillations in prevalence can emerge, with peak prevalence exhibiting a non-monotonic dependence on the width of the sigmoidal function, suggesting an optimal parameter range that minimizes epidemic severity. We obtain prevalence, final epidemic size, and peak prevalence as functions of adaptation parameters in all adaptation scenarios considered, providing a comprehensive characterization of the effects of spatial adaptation based on global prevalence information in shaping adaptive epidemic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Designing topological cluster synchronization patterns with the Dirac operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing stable cluster synchronization patterns is a fundamental challenge in nonlinear dynamics of networks with great relevance to understanding neuronal and brain dynamics. So far, cluster synchronizion have been studied exclusively in a node-based dynamical approach, according to which oscillators are associated only with the nodes of the network. Here, we propose a topological synchronization dynamics model based on the use of the Topological Dirac operator, which allows us to design cluster synchronization patterns for topological oscillators associated with both nodes and edges of a network. In particular, by modulating the ground state of the free energy associated with the dynamical model we construct topological cluster synchronization patterns. These are aligned with the eigenstates of the Topological Dirac Equation that provide a very useful decomposition of the dynamical state of node and edge signals associated with the network. We use linear stability analysis to predict the stability of the topological cluster synchronization patterns and provide numerical evidence of the ability to design several stable topological cluster synchronization states on random graphs and on stochastic block models.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a simple definition of dynamical entropy for quantum systems under continuous monitoring, inspired by Connes, Narnhofer and Thirring. It quantifies the amount of information gained about the initial condition. A nonzero entropy rate can be obtained by monitoring the thermal fluctuation of an extensive observable in a generic many-body system (away from classical or large N limit). We explicitly compute the entropy rate in the thermodynamic and long-time limit, in terms of the two-point correlation functions. We conjecture a universal Planckian bound for the entropy rate. Related results on the purification rate are also obtained.</description>

Abstract: We present a general and simple formula for computing the entanglement negativity in free fermions. Our formula allows for deriving several universal bounds on negativity and its rate of change in dynamics. The bound on negativity directly relates the clustering property of correlations in free-fermion states to the entanglement area law, and provides the optimal condition for the area law in mixed free fermion states with long-range correlations. In addition, we establish an area-law bound on entanglement generation in open systems, analogous to previously known results for entanglement entropy in unitary dynamics. Our work provides new analytical insights into fermionic mixed-state entanglement.</description>

Abstract: Theoretical analysis of biological and artificial neural networks e.g. modelling of synaptic or weight matrices necessitate consideration of the generic real-asymmetric matrix ensembles, those with varying order of matrix elements e.g. a sparse structure or a banded structure. We pursue the complexity parameter approach to analyze the spectral statistics of the multiparametric Gaussian ensembles of real asymmetric matrices and derive the ensemble averaged spectral densities for real as well as complex eigenvalues. Considerations of the matrix elements with arbitrary choice of mean and variances render us the freedom to model the desired sparsity in the ensemble. Our formulation provides a common mathematical formulation of the spectral statistics for a wide range of sparse real-asymmetric ensembles and also
  reveals, thereby, a deep rooted universality among them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish an analytical criterion for dynamical thermalization within harmonic systems, applicable to both classical and quantum models. Specifically, we prove that thermalization of various observables, such as particle energies in physically relevant random quadratic Hamiltonians, is typical for large systems ($N \gg 1$) with initial conditions drawn from the microcanonical distribution. Moreover, we show that thermalization can also arise from non-typical initial conditions, where only a finite fraction of the normal modes is excited. A different choice of initial conditions, such as all the initial energy localized in a single particle, instead leads to energy equipartition without thermalization. Since the models we consider are integrable, our findings provide a general dynamical basis for an approach to thermalization that bypasses chaos and ergodicity, focusing instead on the physical requirement that thermodynamic observables depend on a large number of normal modes, and build a bridge between the classical and quantum theories of thermalization.</description>

      <title>Universality of Top Rank Statistics for Brownian Reshuffling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamical aspects of the top rank statistics of particles, performing Brownian motions on a half-line, which are ranked by their distance from the origin. For this purpose, we introduce an observable that we call the overlap ratio $\Omega(t)$, whose average is the probability that a particle that is on the top-$n$ list at some time will also be on the top-$n$ list after time $t$. The overlap ratio is a local observable which is concentrated at the top of the ranking and does not require the full ranking of all particles. It is simple to measure in practice. We derive an analytical formula for the average overlap ratio for a system of $N$ particles in the stationary state that undergo independent Brownian motion on the positive real half-axis with a reflecting wall at the origin and a drift towards the wall. In particular, we show that for $N\rightarrow \infty$, the overlap ratio takes a rather simple form $\langle \Omega(t)\rangle = {\rm erfc}(a \sqrt{t})$ for $n\gg 1$ with some scaling parameter $a&gt;0$. This result is a very good approximation even for moderate sizes of the top-$n$ list such as $n=10$. Moreover, as we show, the overlap ratio exhibits universal behavior observed in many dynamical systems including geometric Brownian motion, Brownian motion with a position-dependent drift and a soft barrier on one side, the Bouchaud-M\'ezard wealth distribution model, and Kesten processes.</description>

      <title>Exact solution to a Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook-type equation for quantum lattice gases with dephasing noise</title>

Abstract: The mean-state dynamics of free fermions subject to random projective measurements of local occupation number operators is governed by a Lindblad equation with dephasing noise. In the continuum limit, the equation of motion for the correlation matrix is mapped to a kinetic equation for the Wigner function, which corresponds to a special case of the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) equation without energy conservation. Our main result is the solution to the kinetic equation, showing that the Wigner dynamics emerges from stochastic sampling of classical run-and-tumble processes. As an application, we recover the crossover between ballistic and diffusive transport regimes.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relations for Coherent Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a universal thermodynamic uncertainty relation for Fermionic coherent transport, which bounds the total rate of entropy production in terms of the mean and fluctuations of a single particle current. This bound holds for any multi-terminal geometry and arbitrary chemical and thermal biases, as long as no external magnetic fields are applied. It can further be saturated in two-terminal settings with boxcar-shaped transmission functions and reduces to its classical counterpart in linear response. Upon insertion of a numerical factor, our bound also extends to systems with broken time-reversal symmetry. As an application, we derive trade-off relations between the figures of merit of coherent thermoelectric heat engines and refrigerators, which show that such devices can attain ideal efficiency only at vanishing mean power or diverging power fluctuations. To illustrate our results, we work out a model of a coherent conductor consisting of a chain of quantum dots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the spin-$1$ Blume-Capel model on an infinite strip of the triangular lattice using the transfer-matrix method combined with a sparse-matrix factorization technique. Through finite-size scaling analysis of numerically exact spectra for strip widths up to $L = 19$, we accurately locate the tricritical point improving upon recent Monte Carlo estimates. In the first-order regime, we observe exponential scaling of the spectral gap, reflecting the linear growth of interfacial tension as the temperature decreases below the tricritical point. Finally, we validate our tricritical point estimate through precise agreement with conformal field theory predictions for the tricritical Ising universality class. Our results underscore the continued utility of the transfer-matrix approach for studying phase transitions in complex lattice models.</description>

      <title>Time-energy tradeoff in stochastic resetting using optimal control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic resetting is a driving mechanism that is known to minimize the first passage time to reach a target, at the cost of energy expenditure. The choice of the physical implementation of each resetting event determines the tradeoff between the acceleration of the search process and its energetic cost. Here, we present an optimal transport protocol that balances the duration and the energetic cost of each resetting event. This protocol drives a harmonically trapped Brownian particle between two equilibrium states within a finite time and with minimal energetic cost. An explicit comparison with other types of finite-time protocols further shows its specific thermodynamic properties. Its cost is both a lower bound on the cost of unoptimized shortcut protocols and an upper bound on the cost of optimal protocols which do not ensure final equilibrium. When applying the optimal transport protocol to implement stochastic resetting, a single lower time-energy bound is reached: this protocol allows to reach the best tradeoff between energetic cost and search time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exotic entanglement entropy scaling properties usually come with interesting entanglement structures in real space and novel metrics of the spacetime lattice. One prominent example is the rainbow chain where lattice sites symmetric about the center form entangled Bell pairs due to an effective long-range coupling from the strong inhomogeneity of the coupling strength. This manuscript generalizes the rainbow chain to higher dimensional space on lattices with Hausdorff dimension one and enlarged local Hilbert space keeping the Hamiltonian frustration free. The effective Hamiltonian from the Schrieffer-Wolf transformation is given by a stacking of layers of $k$-simplices with $0$-dimensional (fully-connected) antiferromagnetic Hamiltonians, which can be diagonalized analytically with Young operators. The original lattice can be obtained from proliferating disinclination defects in a regular $k$-dimensional cubical lattice, which introduces curvature at the center of the lattice. The model interpolates between the SYK model and the free-fermionic XX spin chain, and hence might be potentially useful in understanding black hole physics and holography.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Markov chains generalize classical Markov chains for random variables to the quantum realm and exhibit unique inherent properties, making them an important feature in quantum information theory. In this work, we propose the concept of virtual quantum Markov chains (VQMCs), focusing on scenarios where subsystems retain classical information about global systems from measurement statistics. As a generalization of quantum Markov chains, VQMCs characterize states where arbitrary global shadow information can be recovered from subsystems through local quantum operations and measurements. We present an algebraic characterization for virtual quantum Markov chains and show that the virtual quantum recovery is fully determined by the block matrices of a quantum state on its subsystems. Notably, we find a distinction between two classes of tripartite entanglement by showing that the W state is a VQMC while the GHZ state is not. Furthermore, we introduce the virtual non-Markovianity to quantify the non-Markovianity of a given quantum state, which also assesses the optimal sampling overhead for virtually recovering this state. Our findings elucidate distinctions between quantum Markov chains and virtual quantum Markov chains, extending our understanding of quantum recovery to scenarios prioritizing classical information from measurement statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01068v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce ``dual-unitary shadow tomography'' (DUST), a classical shadow tomography protocol based on dual-unitary brick-wall circuits. To quantify the performance of DUST, we study operator spreading and Pauli weight dynamics in one-dimensional qubit systems, evolved by random two-local dual-unitary gates arranged in a brick-wall structure, ending with a measurement layer. We do this by deriving general constraints on the Pauli weight transfer matrix and specializing to the case of dual-unitarity. Remarkably, we find that operator spreading in these circuits have a rich structure resembling that of relativistic quantum field theories, with massless chiral excitations that can decay or fuse into each other, which we call left- or right-movers. We develop a mean-field description of the Pauli weight in terms of $\rho(x,t)$, which represents the probability of having nontrivial support at site $x$ and depth $t$ starting from a fixed weight distribution. We develop an equation of state for $\rho(x,t)$ and simulate it numerically using Monte Carlo simulations. For the task of predicting operators with (nearly) full support, we show that DUST outperforms brick-wall Clifford shadows of equal depth. This advantage is further pronounced for small system sizes and our results are generally robust to finite-size effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01902v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework to implement massive Nambu-Goldstone quasi-particles in driven many-body systems. The underlying mechanism leverages an explicit Lie group structure imprinted into an effective Hamiltonian that governs the dynamics of slow degrees of freedom; the resulting emergent continuous symmetry is weakly explicitly broken, giving rise to a massive Nambu-Goldstone mode, with a spectral mass gap scaling linearly with the drive period. We discuss explicit and experimentally implementable realizations, such as Heisenberg-like spin models that support gapped spin-wave excitations. We provide a protocol to certify the existence of the massive Nambu-Goldstone mode from the dynamics of specific observables, and analyse the dispersion spectrum and their lifetime in the presence of weak explicit symmetry breaking.</description>

Abstract: Quantum thermalization describes how closed quantum systems can effectively reach thermal equilibrium, resolving the apparent incongruity between the reversibility of Schr\"odinger's equation and the second law of thermodynamics. Despite its ubiquity and conceptual significance, the precise conditions that give rise to quantum thermalization are still not well understood. After nearly a century of efforts, we have yet to find a complete mathematical proof that an effective statistical description naturally emerges the underlying quantum dynamics in generic settings. Here, we prove that quantum thermalization must occur in any qubit system with local interactions under three conditions: (i) high effective temperature, (ii) translation invariance, and (iii) no perfect resonances in the energy spectrum. Specifically, we show that a typical, low-complexity pure state drawn from any ensemble with large entropy and well-defined effective temperature becomes locally indistinguishable from a Gibbs state upon unitary evolution. In this setting, our rigorous results prove the widely anticipated notion that statistical physics should be understood as an emergent phenomenon, explicitly derived from the first principles of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum field theories with quenched disorder are so hard to study that even exactly solvable free theories present puzzling aspects. We consider a free scalar field $\phi$ in $d$ dimensions coupled to a random source $h$ with quenched disorder. Despite the presence of a mass scale governing the disorder distribution, we derive a new description of the theory that allows us to show that the theory is gapless and invariant under conformal symmetry, which acts in a non-trivial way on $\phi$ and $h$. This manifest CFT description reveals the presence of exotic continuous symmetries, such as nilpotent bosonic ones, in the quenched theory. We also reconsider Cardy's CFT description defined through the replica trick. In this description, the nilpotent symmetries reveal a striking resemblance with Parisi-Sourlas supersymmetries. We provide explicit maps of correlation functions between such CFTs and the original quenched theory. The maps are non-trivial and show that conformal behaviour is manifest only when considering suitable linear combinations of averages of products of correlators. We also briefly discuss how familiar notions like normal ordering of composite operators and OPE can be generalized in the presence of the more complicated local observables in the quenched theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bethe Ansatz is a method for constructing exact eigenstates of quantum-integrable spin chains. Recently, deterministic quantum algorithms, referred to as "algebraic Bethe circuits", have been developed to prepare Bethe states for the spin-1/2 XXZ model. These circuits represent a unitary formulation of the standard algebraic Bethe Ansatz, expressed using matrix-product states that act on both the spin chain and an auxiliary space. In this work, we systematize these previous results, and show that algebraic Bethe circuits can be derived by a change of basis in the auxiliary space. The new basis, identical to the "F-basis" known from the theory of quantum-integrable models, generates the linear superposition of plane waves that is characteristic of the coordinate Bethe Ansatz. We explain this connection, highlighting that certain properties of the F-basis (namely, the exchange symmetry of the spins) are crucial for the construction of algebraic Bethe circuits. We demonstrate our approach by presenting new quantum circuits for the inhomogeneous spin-1/2 XXZ model.</description>

Abstract: We report on experimental studies of the distribution of the off-diagonal elements of the scattering matrix of open microwave networks with symplectic symmetry and a chaotic wave dynamics. These consist of two geometrically identical subgraphs with unitary symmetry described by complex conjugate Hamiltonians, that are coupled by a pair of bonds. The results are compared to random-matrix theory predictions obtained on the basis of the Heidelberg approach for the scattering matrix of open quantum-chaotic systems. We demonstrate that deviations from random-matrix theory predictions observed in the distributions may be attributed to the fact that the subgraphs are not fully connected.</description>

      <title>Role of interaction anisotropy in polymer cononsolvency: insights from the Flory-Huggins-Potts framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cononsolvency occurs when mixing two good solvents creates poor-solvent conditions for polymers over specific composition ranges, causing macroscopic phase separation or microscopic chain collapse. Despite its technological and biophysical relevance, the connection between macroscopic and microscopic manifestations of cononsolvency remains unclear. A key challenge is identifying which interactions govern cononsolvency: coarse-grained analyses like standard Flory--Huggins models assume purely isotropic interactions, while atomistic simulations contain complex anisotropic interactions that cannot be precisely controlled or isolated. Here, we address the role of interaction anisotropy using the Flory-Huggins-Potts framework, which treats $\chi$ as a thermodynamic average over molecular orientations. This enables controlled comparison between systems with isotropic versus anisotropic interactions that share identical effective $\chi$ parameters, either driving cononsolvency by strong solvent-cosolvent affinity or preferential polymer-cosolvent affinity. While pairs of systems exhibit equivalent macroscopic phase behavior, lattice Monte Carlo simulations reveal that those featuring anisotropic interactions generate distinct collapse signatures, particularly in reentrant coil-globule transitions or characteristics of the solvation structure. These results demonstrate how microscopic interaction anisotropy influences cononsolvency behavior beyond what effective $\chi$ parameters alone predict.</description>

Abstract: Landau theory of superfluidity associates low-temperature flow of the normal component with the phonon wind. This picture does not apply to superfluids in which Galilean invariance is broken either by disorder, or porous media, or lattice potential, and the phonon wind is no longer responsible for depletion of the superfluid component. Based on Popov's hydrodynamic action with anharmonic terms, we present a general theory for temperature ($T$) dependence of the superfluid stiffness at low $T$, which reproduces Landau result as a special case when several parameters of the hydrodynamic action are fixed by the Galilean invariance. At the technical level, the theory of low-temperature depletion in a $d$-dimensional quantum superfluid maps onto the problem of finite-size ($L$) corrections in a $(d+1)$-dimensional anisotropic (pseudo-)classical-field system with U(1)-symmetric complex-valued action. We validate our theory with numeric simulations of interacting lattice bosons and the J-current model. In a broader context, our approach reveals universal low-temperature thermodynamics of superfluids with an intrinsic connection between finite-$T$ and finite-$L$ effects implying universal scaling, $T^{d+1}$ and $1/L^{d+1}$, respectively, for a large class of thermodynamic quantities.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking in an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is generally believed that spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetry is restricted by Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem. A special case is that the 1D ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain holds long-range order because the order parameter commutes with the Hamiltonian. The other one is that the recently found frustration-free Hamiltonians can bypass this theorem, but the observed symmetry breaking is fragile under generic perturbations. In this Letter, we have discovered a new example that goes beyond the above two examples-- a 1D antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on comb lattice -- that can achieve spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetry. In addition to the long range order parameter, its energy spectrum shows Anderson tower of states. Importantly, it is not a frustration-free model and its order parameter does not commute with the Hamiltonian. Moreover, the long-range order is robust under symmetry-preserving perturbations. Combining numerical simulation and theoretical analysis, we have further confirmed and understood this nontrivial phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Mixed-state phases from local reversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a refined definition of mixed-state phase equivalence based on locally reversible channel circuits. We show that such circuits preserve topological degeneracy and the locality of all operators including both strong and weak symmetries. Under a locally reversible channel, weak unitary symmetries are locally dressed into channel symmetries, a new generalization of symmetry for open quantum systems. For abelian higher-form symmetries, we show the refined definition preserves anomalies and spontaneous breaking of such symmetries within a phase. As a primary example, a two-dimensional classical loop ensemble is trivial under the previously adopted definition of mixed-state phases. However, it has non-trivial topological degeneracy arising from a mutual anomaly between strong and weak 1-form symmetries, and our results show that it is not connected to a trivial state via locally reversible channel circuits.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Theory of Two-dimensional Chiral Malthusian Flocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic behavior of two-dimensional chiral dry Malthusian flocks; that is, chiral polar-ordered active matter with neither number nor momentum conservation. We show that, in the absence of fluctuations, such systems generically form a ``time cholesteric", in which the velocity of the entire system rotates uniformly at a fixed frequency b. Fluctuations about this state belong to the universality class of (2+1)-Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, which implies short-ranged orientational order in the hydrodynamic limit. We then show that, in the limit of weak chirality, the hydrodynamics of a system with reasonable size is expected to governed by the linear regime of the KPZ equation, exhibiting quasi-long-ranged orientational order. Our predictions for the velocity and number density correlations are testable in both simulations and experiments.</description>

      <title>SETOL: A Semi-Empirical Theory of (Deep) Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a SemiEmpirical Theory of Learning (SETOL) that explains the remarkable performance of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Neural Networks (NNs). We provide a formal explanation of the origin of the fundamental quantities in the phenomenological theory of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR): the heavy-tailed power-law layer quality metrics, alpha and alpha-hat. In prior work, these metrics have been shown to predict trends in the test accuracies of pretrained SOTA NN models, importantly, without needing access to either testing or training data. Our SETOL uses techniques from statistical mechanics as well as advanced methods from random matrix theory and quantum chemistry. The derivation suggests new mathematical preconditions for ideal learning, including a new metric, ERG, which is equivalent to applying a single step of the Wilson Exact Renormalization Group. We test the assumptions and predictions of SETOL on a simple 3-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating excellent agreement with the key theoretical assumptions. For SOTA NN models, we show how to estimate the individual layer qualities of a trained NN by simply computing the empirical spectral density (ESD) of the layer weight matrices and plugging this ESD into our SETOL formulas. Notably, we examine the performance of the HTSR alpha and the SETOL ERG layer quality metrics, and find that they align remarkably well, both on our MLP and on SOTA NNs.</description>
