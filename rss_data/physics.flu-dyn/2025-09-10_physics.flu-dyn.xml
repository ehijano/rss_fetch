      <title>Towards enhanced mixing of a high viscous miscible blob in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the rectilinear displacement and deformation of a highly viscous, miscible circular blob influenced by a less viscous fluid within a homogeneous porous medium featuring physically realistic no-flux boundaries. We utilize a fourth-order accurate compact finite difference scheme for the spatial discretization of the nonlinear partial differential equations that govern this phenomenon. The resulting semi-discrete equations are then integrated using the second-order Crank-Nicolson (CN) method. We conduct numerical simulations for a P\'eclet number ($Pe \leq 3000$) and a log-mobility ratio $0 \leq R \leq 7$, which reveal three distinct pattern formations: comet-shape, lump-shape, and viscous fingering instability. Our results demonstrate that the deformation, spreading, and mixing of the blob vary non-ideally with both $Pe$ and $R$, a behavior attributed to the blob's initial curvature. Consequently, enhanced mixing can be achieved at intermediate values of $Pe$ and $R$, suggesting the existence of an optimal mixing condition. These findings have significant implications for fields such as oil recovery, CO$_2$ sequestration, pollution remediation, and chromatography separation.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks in Clean Combustion: A Pathway to Sustainable Aerospace Propulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving clean combustion systems is crucial in terms of solving environmental impacts, decarbonization needs and sustainability matters. Traditional combustion modeling techniques via computational fluid dynamics with accurate chemical kinetics face obstacles in computational cost and accurate representation of turbulence-chemistry interactions. Physically Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as a new framework, merges physical laws with data-driven learning and shows great potential as an alternative methodology. By directly integrating conservation equations into their training process, PINNs achieve accurate mesh-free modeling of complex combustion phenomena despite having limited data sets. This review examines how this approach applies to clean combustion systems while focusing on their impact in aerospace applications including flame dynamics, turbulent combustion, emission prediction, and instability management in propulsion systems. Next-generation aerospace engines rely on PINNs to reduce computational costs while increasing predictive performance and enabling real-time control methods. This analysis concludes by exploring current barriers and future paths, while demonstrating how PINNs can revolutionize sustainable and efficient combustion technologies in aerospace propulsion systems.</description>

      <title>Gelation effects on the spreading of non-Newtonian drops impacting a reactive liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report in this experimental and numerical study effects of gelation on the early-time spreading ($&lt;$ 10ms) of millimetric non-Newtonian drops of biopolymer and particle suspensions impacting a Newtonian liquid containing reactive compounds. Our analyses are initially conducted through experiments by considering a variety of biopolymer and gelling compound concentrations, and impact velocities. The experimental results are then compared to three-dimensional numerical simulations based on a variational multiscale approach, which focuses on the impact of simple viscoplastic drops on a liquid bath in the absence of gelation (non-reactive liquid). These comparisons enable the development of theoretical arguments that emphasise relevant gelation effects on the drop's maximum spreading.</description>

      <title>Vortex controlled heat transfer in eight row plate fin and tube exchangers: CFD derived air side Nusselt correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates and characterizes the row dependent thermal performance of an 8 row finned tube heat exchanger (HEX) with an offset tube arrangement and continuous flat fins. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations reveal distinct hydraulic thermal behavior across the tube rows, with the first, second, and eighth rows exhibiting significantly higher heat transfer efficiency than the average for the entire HEX under specific flow conditions. At air velocities below 3 ms-1, the first rows exhibit increased efficiency, while the eighth row exhibits comparatively better efficiency at velocities exceeding 6 ms-1. In the fitted range (2.5 to 10 ms-1), orders 1, 2, and 8 outperform orders 3 to 7 by approximately 15 to 25% in Nusselt number, indicating that orders 1, 2, and 8 operate under distinct flow and thermal conditions. The study also determined individual Nusselt number correlations for each order through systematic simulations over the velocity range from 2.5 to 10 ms-1. The analysis further linked these changes to specific flow mechanisms, such as boundary layer development, wake interference, and vortex shedding, which govern the distinct thermal behavior of the first, second, and last orders. These findings can enable dual optimization: lower capital costs by minimizing the number of orders for the target thermal performance, and lower operating costs by reducing pressure drop (reducing fan power).</description>

      <title>Far-field axisymmetric solution of the Brinkman equation for a point force near a no-slip wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the far-field solution for the Green's function of a point force acting perpendicular to a no-slip wall in a Brinkman fluid, focusing on the regime where the distance between the force and the wall is much smaller than the screening length. The general solution is obtained in closed form up to a single integral and can be systematically expanded in a Taylor series in both the far-field and near-field limits. The flow can then be expressed as a series of source-multipole singularities with an additional, analytically known, correction in the proximity of the wall. Comparisons with numerical integration demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the asymptotic expansions. The results are also applicable to the unsteady Stokes flow driven by a localized assembly of forces, such as a beating cilium protruding from a flat surface.</description>

      <title>Learning Turbulent Flows with Generative Models: Super-resolution, Forecasting, and Sparse Flow Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural operators are promising surrogates for dynamical systems but when trained with standard L2 losses they tend to oversmooth fine-scale turbulent structures. Here, we show that combining operator learning with generative modeling overcomes this limitation. We consider three practical turbulent-flow challenges where conventional neural operators fail: spatio-temporal super-resolution, forecasting, and sparse flow reconstruction. For Schlieren jet super-resolution, an adversarially trained neural operator (adv-NO) reduces the energy-spectrum error by 15x while preserving sharp gradients at neural operator-like inference cost. For 3D homogeneous isotropic turbulence, adv-NO trained on only 160 timesteps from a single trajectory forecasts accurately for five eddy-turnover times and offers 114x wall-clock speed-up at inference than the baseline diffusion-based forecasters, enabling near-real-time rollouts. For reconstructing cylinder wake flows from highly sparse Particle Tracking Velocimetry-like inputs, a conditional generative model infers full 3D velocity and pressure fields with correct phase alignment and statistics. These advances enable accurate reconstruction and forecasting at low compute cost, bringing near-real-time analysis and control within reach in experimental and computational fluid mechanics.

      <title>Controlling the collective transport of large passive particles with suspensions of microorganisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A promising approach to transport cargo at the microscale lies within the use of self-propelled microorganisms, whose motion entrains that of passive particles. However, most applications remain limited to just a few passive particles of similar size as the microorganisms, since the transport mechanism relies on the interaction between individual swimmers and single particles. Here, we demonstrate how to control the collective transport of hundreds of large passive particles with phototactic microalga. Using directional light stimuli in suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we trigger bioconvection rolls capable of macroscale transport. Passive particles an order of magnitude larger than the microalgae are either attracted or repelled by the rolls depending on their density. Using experiments and simulation, we rationalize these bioconvective flows and describe how to harness them for cargo transport, with future applications in targeted drug delivery and decontamination.</description>

      <title>Membrane Heterogeneity Driven Dynamics of Multicomponent Vesicles in Shear Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their significance in biology and materials science, the dynamics of multicomponent vesicles under shear flow remain poorly understood because of their nonlinear and strongly coupled nature, especially regarding the role of membrane heterogeneity in driving nonequilibrium behavior. Here we present a thermodynamically consistent phase-field model, which is validated against experiments, for the quantitative investigation of these dynamics. While prior research has primarily focused on viscosity or bending rigidity contrasts, we demonstrate that surface tension heterogeneity can also trigger swinging and tumbling in vesicles under shear. Additionally, our systematic phase diagram reveals three previously unreported dynamical regimes arising from the interplay between bending rigidity heterogeneity and shear flow. Overall, our model provides a robust framework for understanding multicomponent vesicle dynamics, with findings offering new physical insights and design principles for tunable vesicle-based carriers.</description>

      <title>A Pathway to Practical Quantum Advantage in Solving Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) promises to tackle classically intractable problems. A key milestone is solving the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE), which has remained formidable for quantum algorithms due to their high input-output overhead and nonlinearity. Here, we establish a full-stack framework that charts a practical pathway to a quantum advantage for large-scale NSE simulation. Our approach integrates a spectral-based input/output algorithm, an explicit and synthesized quantum circuit, and a refined error-correction protocol. The algorithm achieves an end-to-end exponential speedup in asymptotic complexity, meeting the lower bound for general quantum linear system solvers. Through symmetry-based circuit synthesis and optimized error correction, we reduce the required logical and physical resources by two orders of magnitude. Our concrete resource analysis demonstrates that solving NSE on a $2^{80}$-grid is feasible with 8.71 million physical qubits (at an error rate of $5 \times 10^{-4}$) in 42.6 days -- outperforming a state-of-the-art supercomputer, which would require over a century. This work bridges the gap between theoretical quantum speedup and the practical deployment of high-performance scientific computing.</description>

      <title>A low-Mach phase field-lattice Boltzmann-finite difference model for reactive gas flows propagating through complex shaped particle assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study provides a systematic derivation of a phase-field version of the momentum, mass and heat transport equations, while accounting for chemical reactions in the fluid phase. To achieve this goal, the volume averaging technique is used to reformulate the conservation equations in the presence of multiple phases and their respective diffuse interfaces. It is shown that the structure of the multiphase/diffuse interface version of the conservation equations is very similar to the original single phase/sharp interface formulation. The multiphase character of the problem is accounted for the coupling terms, which act at the interface between adjacent phases. For the special case of a reactive fluid in contact with an inert solid, two coupling parameters are introduced, which control the exchange of momentum and heat at the interface. For numerical solver, a low-Mach number hybrid lattice Boltzmann-finite difference-phase field (LB-FD-PF) framework is developed and implemented in the open source software OpenPhase Academic. Chemical reactions of reactive flows are included into the model by coupling OpenPhase Academic with the open-source chemical kinetics software CANTERA, which delivers details of the chemical reaction mechanisms and the necessary thermodynamic and transport properties of the reacting chemical species. The model is thoroughly validated against alternative numerical simulations of reactive flows as well as experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop and implement numerically a phase field model for the evolution and detachment of a gas bubble resting on a solid substrate and surrounded by a viscous liquid. The bubble has a static contact angle $\theta $ and will be subject to gravitational forces. We compute, as a function of the static contact angle, the cricital Bond number over which bubbles detach from the substrate. Then, we perform similar studies for bubble resting on inclined substrates and bubbles under the action of an external flow. We provide approximate formulas for the critical Bond number under all these circumstances. Our method is also able to resolve the pinchoff of the bubble and the possible appearence of satellites.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Triad Interactions and Evolving Turbulence -- Part 2: Implications for Practical Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how momentum and kinetic energy is transferred between Fourier components (the so-called triad interactions) in measured turbulent flow fields, i.e. in practical, discretely sampled signals with limited temporal and spatial domains. We empirically observe that the finite resolution in experimental investigations causes a decoupling between time and space, which broadens the phase match condition to include both spatial and temporal frequencies as predicted in Part 1. It is also empirically observed that the Fourier components may interact with a finite time delay and within a broadened frequency window (finite overlap widths) in both time and space, as compared to the usual integrals over infinite ranges where Fourier components interact by overlapping Dirac delta functions. Furthermore, it is empirically observed how the finite temporal and spatial measurement domains of velocity records can have a significant effect on the efficiency of the triad interactions and thereby on the shape and development of measured velocity power spectra. These finite spatial/temporal domains thus influence the measured spatial and temporal development of turbulence, the possibility for non-local interactions and hence also non-equilibrium turbulence, e.g. fractal grid generated turbulence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, Chandrasekhar's deductive theory of turbulence is extended to the case of hydrodynamics and hydromagnetics, with higher order fluid moments. We include the contributions from correlation tensors at two different points of space and two different points in time to account for the energy transfer between Fourier modes with different $k$ values. We start with three governing equations using the first three moments of Vlasov equation, which gives us particle, momentum and energy conservation relations, respectively. We obtain the scalar representations of correlation tensors for hydrodynamics as well as hydromagnetics. Finally we pick an example from literature where the energy spectra alone was not capable of explaining the observations reported by the authors.</description>

      <title>Competing Mechanisms at Vibrated Interfaces of Density-Contrast Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid--fluid interfacial instability and subsequent fluid mixing are ubiquitous in nature and engineering. The hydrodynamic instability of fluid interfaces has long centered on the pressure gradient-driven long-wavelength Rayleigh--Taylor instability and the resonance-induced short-wavelength Faraday instability. However, neither instability alone can explain the dynamics when both mechanisms are present. We identify a previously unseen multi-modal instability emerging from their coexistence. When the denser fluid is polydimethylsiloxane, the mixed region at a high density contrast (Atwood number=0.9) spans a vibration amplitude range approximately twice the gravitational acceleration. Using Floquet stability analysis, we show how vibrations govern transitions between the RT and Faraday instabilities, leading to contention between these instabilities rather than resonant enhancement. The initial transient growth is represented by the exponential modal growth of the most unstable Floquet exponent, along with its accompanying periodic behavior. Direct numerical simulations validate these findings and track interface breakup into the multiscale and nonlinear regimes. Specifically, we show that growing RT modes nonlinearly suppress Faraday responses even when the initial growth rate of the Faraday instability is 3.63 times that of RT, so a bidirectional competition hinders their sustained coexistence.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear input-output analysis of transitional shear flows using small-signal finite-gain $\mathcal{L}_p$ stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This SSFG Lp stability theorem can predict permissible forcing amplitudes below which a finite nonlinear input-output gain can be maintained. Our analysis employs Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) and Sum-of-Squares (SOS) as the primary tools to search for a quadratic Lyapunov function of an unforced nonlinear system. The resulting Lyapunov function can certify the SSFG Lp stability of a nonlinear input-output system. We demonstrate the applicability of the SSFG Lp stability theorem using a nine-mode shear flow model with a random body force. The predicted nonlinear input-output Lp gain is consistent with numerical simulations; the Lp norm of the output from numerical simulations remains bounded by the theoretical prediction from SSFG Lp stability theorem, with the gap between simulated and theoretical bounds narrowing as $p \rightarrow \infty$. The input-output gain obtained from the nonlinear SSFG Lp stability theorem is higher than the linear Lp gain. Both nonlinear Lp gain and linear Lp gain are valid for each $p\in [1,\infty]$, and such generalizability leads to much higher upper bounds on input-output gain than those predicted by linear L2 gain. The SSFG Lp stability theorem requires the input forcing to be smaller than a permissible forcing amplitude to maintain finite input-output gain, which is an inherently nonlinear behavior that cannot be predicted by linear input-output analysis. We also identify such permissible forcing amplitude using numerical simulations and bisection search, where below such forcing amplitude the output norm at any time will be lower than a given threshold value. The permissible forcing amplitude identified from the SSFG Lp stability theorem is conservative but also consistent with that obtained by numerical simulations and bisection search.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Vortex Clusters on a Torus</title>

Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field amplification during a turbulent collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02885v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The question of whether a dynamo can be triggered by gravitational collapse is of great interest, especially for the early Universe. Here, we employ supercomoving coordinates to study the magnetic field amplification from decaying turbulence during gravitational collapse. We perform three-dimensional simulations and show that for large magnetic Reynolds numbers there can be exponential growth of the comoving magnetic field with conformal time before the decay of turbulence impedes further amplification. The collapse dynamics only affects the nonlinear feedback from the Lorentz force, which diminishes more rapidly for shorter collapse times, allowing nearly kinematic continued growth. We confirm that helical turbulence is more efficient in driving dynamo action than nonhelical turbulence, but this difference decreases for larger collapse times. We also show that for nearly irrotational flows, dynamo amplification is still possible, but it is always associated with a growth of vorticity -- even if it still remains very small. In nonmagnetic runs, the growth of vorticity is associated with viscosity and grows with the Mach number. In the presence of magnetic fields, vorticity emerges from the curl of the Lorentz force. During a limited time interval, an exponential growth of the comoving magnetic field with conformal time is interpreted as clear evidence of dynamo action.</description>

      <title>Learning Fluid-Structure Interaction Dynamics with Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Immersed Boundary Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18565</link>

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for solving complex fluid dynamics problems, yet their application to fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems with moving boundaries remains largely unexplored. This work addresses the critical challenge of modeling FSI systems with deformable interfaces, where traditional unified PINN architectures struggle to capture the distinct physics governing fluid and structural domains simultaneously. We present an innovative Eulerian-Lagrangian PINN architecture that integrates immersed boundary method (IBM) principles to solve FSI problems with moving boundary conditions. Our approach fundamentally departs from conventional unified architectures by introducing domain-specific neural networks: an Eulerian network for fluid dynamics and a Lagrangian network for structural interfaces, coupled through physics-based constraints. Additionally, we incorporate learnable B-spline activation functions with SiLU to capture both localized high-gradient features near interfaces and global flow patterns. Empirical studies on a 2D cavity flow problem involving a moving solid structure show that while baseline unified PINNs achieve reasonable velocity predictions, they suffer from substantial pressure errors (12.9%) in structural regions. Our Eulerian-Lagrangian architecture with learnable activations (EL-L) achieves better performance across all metrics, improving accuracy by 24.1-91.4% and particularly reducing pressure errors from 12.9% to 2.39%. These results demonstrate that domain decomposition aligned with physical principles, combined with locality-aware activation functions, is essential for accurate FSI modeling within the PINN framework.</description>

      <title>Phase field modelling of the growth and detachment of bubbles in a hydrogen electrolyzer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop and implement numerically a phase field model for the growth and detachment of a gas bubble resting on an electrode and being filled with hydrogen produced by water electrolysis. The bubble is surrounded by a viscous liquid, has a prescribed static contact angle and is also subject to gravitational forces. We compute, as a function of the static contact angle, the time at which the bubble detaches from the substrate and what volume it has at that time. We also investigate de dependence of the detachment time on other parameters such as the applied voltage and the hydrogen ion concentration at the fluid bulk.</description>

      <title>A second-order volumetric boundary treatment for the lattice Boltzmann method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new volumetric-type boundary treatment is introduced for the lattice Boltzmann method. Populations are projected onto a discontinuous piecewise linear basis and streamed using an exact geometrical mapping. The method is implemented in 2D for convex, stationary geometries. Stability is verified through a novel analysis tool based on the eigenvalues of the streaming operation. A convergence rate of $\geq2$ is achieved, indicating improved accuracy over precursor methods. For flow around a 2D airfoil, the method yields better lift and drag predictions.</description>
