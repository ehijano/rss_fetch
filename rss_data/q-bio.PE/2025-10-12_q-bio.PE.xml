      <title>Modeling Predator-Prey Dynamics with Stochastic Differential Equations: Patterns of Collective Hunting and Nonlinear Predation Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate predator-prey school interactions in aquatic environments using a stochastic differential equation (SDE)-based, particle-level model that incorporates attraction, repulsion, alignment, and environmental noise. Two predation strategies-center attack and nearest attack-are examined to assess their effects on prey survival, predator efficiency, and group dynamics. Simulations reveal diverse emergent behaviors such as prey dispersal and regrouping, oscillatory predation with collective defense, and predator encirclement. Results show that collective hunting enhances capture efficiency compared to solitary attacks, but benefits diminish beyond a critical predator group size due to intra-predator competition. This work provides new insights into cooperative predation and introduces a generalizable SDE framework for analyzing predator-prey interactions.</description>

      <title>Decoding Positive Selection in Mycobacterium tuberculosis with Phylogeny-Guided Graph Attention Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positive selection drives the emergence of adaptive mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, shaping drug resistance, transmissibility, and virulence. Phylogenetic trees capture evolutionary relationships among isolates and provide a natural framework for detecting such adaptive signals. We present a phylogeny-guided graph attention network (GAT) approach, introducing a method for converting SNP-annotated phylogenetic trees into graph structures suitable for neural network analysis. Using 500 M. tuberculosis isolates from four major lineages and 249 single-nucleotide variants (84 resistance-associated and 165 neutral) across 61 drug-resistance genes, we constructed graphs where nodes represented isolates and edges reflected phylogenetic distances. Edges between isolates separated by more than seven internal nodes were pruned to emphasise local evolutionary structure. Node features encoded SNP presence or absence, and the GAT architecture included two attention layers, a residual connection, global attention pooling, and a multilayer perceptron classifier. The model achieved an accuracy of 0.88 on a held-out test set and, when applied to 146 WHO-classified "uncertain" variants, identified 41 candidates with convergent emergence across multiple lineages, consistent with adaptive evolution. This work demonstrates the feasibility of transforming phylogenies into GNN-compatible structures and highlights attention-based models as effective tools for detecting positive selection, aiding genomic surveillance and variant prioritisation.</description>

      <title>Symbiosis emergence and abandonment in nature: a coordination game approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ an n-player coordination game to model mutualism emergence and abandonment. We illustrate our findings in the context of the host--host interactions among plants in plant-mycorrhizal fungi (MF) mutualisms. The coordination game payoff structure captures the insight that mutualistic strategies lead to robust advantages only after such "biological markets" reach a certain scale. The game gives rise to three types of Nash equilibria, which correspond to the states derived in studies of the ancestral reconstruction of the mycorrhizal symbiosis in seed plants. We show that all types of Nash equilibria correspond to steady states of a dynamical system describing the underlying evolutionary process. We then employ methods from large deviation theory on discrete-time Markov processes to study stochastic evolutionary dynamics. We provide a sharp analytical characterization of the stochastic steady states and of the transition dynamics across Nash equilibria and employ simulations to illustrate these results in special cases. We find that the mutualism is abandoned and re-established several times through evolutionary time, but the mutualism may persist the majority of time. Changes that reduce the benefit-to-cost ratio associated with the symbiosis increase the likelihood of its abandonment. While the mutualism establishment and abandonment could result from direct transitions across the mutualistic and non-mutualistic states, it is far more likely for such transitions to occur indirectly through intermediate partially mutualistic states. The MF-plant mutualism might be (partially or fully) abandoned by plants even if it provides overall superior fitness.</description>

      <title>Complexity and accessibility of random landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These notes introduce probabilistic landscape models defined on high-dimensional discrete sequence spaces. The models are motivated primarily by fitness landscapes in evolutionary biology, but links to statistical physics and computer science are mentioned where appropriate. Elementary and advanced results on the structure of landscapes are described with a focus on features that are relevant to evolutionary searches, such as the number of local maxima and the existence of fitness-monotonic paths. The recent discovery of submodularity as a biologically meaningful property of fitness landscapes and its consequences for their accessibility is discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Fixation and extinction in time-fluctuating spatially structured metapopulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bacteria evolve in volatile environments and complex spatial structures. Migration, fluctuations and environmental variability therefore have a significant impact on the evolution of microbial populations. Here, we consider a class of spatially explicit metapopulation models arranged as regular (circulation) graphs where wild-type and mutant cells compete in a time-fluctuating environment in which demes (subpopulations) are connected by slow cell migration. The carrying capacity is the same at each deme and endlessly switches between two values associated to harsh and mild environmental conditions. Environmental variability can lead to population bottlenecks, following which the population is prone to fluctuation-induced extinction. Here, we analyse how slow migration, spatial structure, and fluctuations affect the phenomena of fixation and extinction on clique, cycle, and square lattice metapopulations. When the carrying capacity remains large, bottlenecks are weak and deme extinction can be ignored. The dynamics is thus captured by a coarse-grained description within which the probability and mean time of fixation are obtained analytically. This allows us to show that, in contrast to static environments, the mutant fixation probability depends on the rate of migration. We also show that the fixation probability and mean fixation time can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the switching rate. When the carrying capacity is small under harsh conditions, bottlenecks are strong, and the metapopulation evolution is shaped by the coupling of deme extinction and strain competition. This yields rich dynamical scenarios, among which we identify the best conditions to eradicate mutants without dooming the metapopulation to extinction. We offer an interpretation of these findings in the context of an idealised treatment strategy and discuss possible generalisations of our models.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic-statistical inference of mosquito dynamics from mark-release-recapture data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biological control strategies against mosquito-borne diseases--such as the sterile insect technique (SIT), RIDL, and Wolbachia-based releases--require reliable estimates of dispersal and survival of released males. We propose a mechanistic--statistical framework for mark--release--recapture (MRR) data linking an individual-based 2D diffusion model with its reaction--diffusion limit. Inference is based on solving the macroscopic system and embedding it in a Poisson observation model for daily trap counts, with uncertainty quantified via a parametric bootstrap. We validate identifiability using simulated data and apply the model to an urban MRR campaign in El Cano (Havana, Cuba) involving four weekly releases of sterile Aedes aegypti males. The best-supported model suggests a mean life expectancy of about five days and a typical displacement of about 180 m. Unlike empirical fits of survival or dispersal, our mechanistic approach jointly estimates movement, mortality, and capture, yielding biologically interpretable parameters and a principled framework for designing and evaluating SIT-based interventions.</description>

      <title>Agent Based Simulators for Epidemic Modelling: Simulating Larger Models Using Smaller Ones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.02887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agent-based simulators (ABS) are a popular epidemiological modelling tool to study the impact of various non-pharmaceutical interventions in managing an epidemic in a city (or a region). They provide the flexibility to accurately model a heterogeneous population with time and location varying, person-specific interactions as well as detailed governmental mobility restrictions. Typically, for accuracy, each person is modelled separately. This however may make computational time prohibitive when the city population and the simulated time is large. In this paper, we dig deeper into the underlying probabilistic structure of a generic, locally detailed ABS for epidemiology to arrive at modifications that allow smaller models (models with less number of agents) to give accurate statistics for larger ones, thus substantially speeding up the simulation. We observe that simply considering a smaller aggregate model and scaling up the output leads to inaccuracies. We exploit the observation that in the initial disease spread phase, the starting infections create a family tree of infected individuals more-or-less independent of the other trees and are modelled well as a multi-type super-critical branching process. Further, although this branching process grows exponentially, the relative proportions amongst the population types stabilise quickly. Once enough people have been infected, the future evolution of the epidemic is closely approximated by its mean field limit with a random starting state. We build upon these insights to develop a shifted, scaled and restart-based algorithm that accurately evaluates the ABS's performance using a much smaller model while carefully reducing the bias that may otherwise arise. We apply our algorithm for Covid-19 epidemic and theoretically support the proposed algorithm through an asymptotic analysis where the population size increases to infinity.</description>

      <title>FREE: The Foundational Semantic Recognition for Modeling Environmental Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10255v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling environmental ecosystems is critical for the sustainability of our planet, but is extremely challenging due to the complex underlying processes driven by interactions amongst a large number of physical variables. As many variables are difficult to measure at large scales, existing works often utilize a combination of observable features and locally available measurements or modeled values as input to build models for a specific study region and time period. This raises a fundamental question in advancing the modeling of environmental ecosystems: how to build a general framework for modeling the complex relationships among diverse environmental variables over space and time? In this paper, we introduce a framework, FREE, that enables the use of varying features and available information to train a universal model. The core idea is to map available environmental data into a text space and then convert the traditional predictive modeling task in environmental science to a semantic recognition problem. Our evaluation on two societally important real-world applications, stream water temperature prediction and crop yield prediction, demonstrates the superiority of FREE over multiple baselines, even in data-sparse scenarios.</description>
