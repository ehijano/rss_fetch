      <title>Beyond Diagonal RIS Enhanced Cognitive Radio Enabled Multilayer Non-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RIS) have emerged as a transformative technology for enhancing wireless communication by intelligently manipulating the propagation environment. Its interconnected elements offer enhanced control over signal redirection, making it a promising solution for integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs). This paper explores the potential of BD-RIS in improving cognitive radio enabled multilayer non-terrestrial networks. We formulate a joint optimization problem that maximizes the achievable spectral efficiency by optimizing BD-RIS phase shifts and secondary transmitter power allocation while controlling the interference temperature from the secondary network to the primary network. To solve this problem efficiently, we decouple the original problem and propose a novel solution based on an alternating optimization approach. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of BD-RIS in cognitive radio enabled multilayer NTNs.</description>

Abstract: Pharmaceutical process design and development for generic, innovative, or personalized drugs have always been a time consuming, costly, rigorous process, that involves multistage evaluation for better quality control and assurance. Large language models (LLMs), a type of generative artificial intelligence system, can augment laboratory research in the pharmaceutical engineering process by helping scientists to extract knowledge from literature, design parameters, and collect and interpret experimental data, ultimately accelerating scientific discovery. LLMs with prompt engineering technologies change the researcher's thinking protocol from traditional empirical knowledg to streamlined thinking that connects the performance and structured parameters together. In this work, we investigate and evaluate how prompt engineering technologies can enhance the drug design process from different strategies such as zero shot, few shot, chain of thought, etc. The dissolution profile for specific drugs is predicted and suggested from the LLMs model. Furthermore, the fundamental physical properties such as PSD, aspect ratio, and specific surface area could be inversely designed from the LLMs model. Finally, all the results are evaluated and validated by real-world cases to prove the reliability of prompt engineering techniques. This work breaks down any barriers in developing a systematic framework where LLMs assist in formulation design, process control, and decision making. Finally, we conclude the work by discussing open challenges and future research directions in pharmaceutical processes.</description>

      <title>Exhaustive Search for Quantum Circuit Optimization using ZX Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers allow a near-exponential speed-up for specific applications when compared to classical computers. Despite recent advances in the hardware of quantum computers, their practical usage is still severely limited due to a restricted number of available physical qubits and quantum gates, short coherence time, and high error rates. This paper lays the foundation towards a metric independent approach to quantum circuit optimization based on exhaustive search algorithms. This work uses depth-first search and iterative deepening depth-first search. We rely on ZX calculus to represent and optimize quantum circuits through the minimization of a given metric (e.g. the T-gate and edge count). ZX calculus formally guarantees that the semantics of the original circuit is preserved. As ZX calculus is a non-terminating rewriting system, we utilise a novel set of pruning rules to ensure termination while still obtaining high-quality solutions. We provide the first formalization of quantum circuit optimization using ZX calculus and exhaustive search. We extensively benchmark our approach on 100 standard quantum circuits. Finally, our implementation is integrated in the well-known libraries PyZX and Qiskit as a compiler pass to ensure applicability of our results.</description>

      <title>Comparative Study of Spike Encoding Methods for Environmental Sound Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising approach to reduce energy consumption and computational demands, making them particularly beneficial for embedded machine learning in edge applications. However, data from conventional digital sensors must first be converted into spike trains to be processed using neuromorphic computing technologies. The classification of environmental sounds presents unique challenges due to the high variability of frequencies, background noise, and overlapping acoustic events. Despite these challenges, most studies on spike-based audio encoding focus on speech processing, leaving non-speech environmental sounds underexplored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of widely used spike encoding techniques, evaluating their effectiveness on the ESC-10 dataset. By understanding the impact of encoding choices on environmental sound processing, researchers and practitioners can select the most suitable approach for real-world applications such as smart surveillance, environmental monitoring, and industrial acoustic analysis. This study serves as a benchmark for spike encoding in environmental sound classification, providing a foundational reference for future research in neuromorphic audio processing.</description>

      <title>Non Line-of-Sight Optical Wireless Communication using Neuromorphic Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic or event cameras, inspired by biological vision systems, capture changes in illumination with high temporal resolution and efficiency, producing streams of events rather than traditional images. In this paper, we explore the use of neuromorphic cameras for passive optical wireless communication (OWC), leveraging their asynchronous detection of illumination changes to decode data transmitted through reflections of light from objects. We propose a novel system that utilizes neuromorphic cameras for passive visible light communication (VLC), extending the concept to Non Line-of-Sight (NLoS) scenarios through passive reflections from everyday objects. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of using neuromorphic cameras for VLC, characterizing the performance of various modulation schemes, including traditional On-Off Keying (OOK) and advanced N-pulse modulation. We introduce an adaptive N-pulse modulation scheme that dynamically adjusts encoding based on the packet's bit composition, achieving higher data rates and robustness in different scenarios. Our results show that lighter-colored, glossy objects are better for NLoS communication, while larger objects and those with matte finishes experience higher error rates due to multipath reflections.</description>

      <title>To Assess the Impact of Smart Cities on Urbanization Patterns in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between smart city initiatives and evolving urbanization trends in the United States. The research addresses the critical issue of rapid urban growth in the U.S. and explores how innovations within the smart city paradigm influence urban development. Utilizing principles from Urban Complexity Theory, this study identifies four key variables relevant to smart cities and their impact on urbanization: smart city technology, government policy, environmental sustainability, and socioeconomic factors. A mixed-method approach, combining quantitative and qualitative methodologies, was employed. A web-based survey (n=50) utilizing a five-point Likert scale was conducted among residents of Manhattan, New York, and Capitol Hill, Seattle. Results indicate that the implementation of smart city technologies is significantly associated with shifts in population density, land use diversification, and enhanced infrastructure dynamics. Additionally, residents demonstrated preferences for smart cities based on efficient urban mobility, environmental sustainability, and personal socioeconomic improvements. The findings highlight essential considerations for urban planners, policymakers, and employers. This study concludes that incorporating the identified influential factors into strategic urban planning optimizes city development to better accommodate growing urban populations.</description>

      <title>Heracles: A HfO2 Ferroelectric Capacitor Compact Model for Efficient Circuit Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing use of ferroelectric-based technology, extending beyond conventional memory storage applications, necessitates the development of compact models that can be easily integrated into circuit simulation environments. These models assist circuit designers in the design and the early assessment of the performance of their systems. The Heracles model is a physics-based compact model for circuit simulations in a SPICE environment for HfO2-based ferroelectric capacitors (FeCaps). The model has been calibrated based on experimental data obtained from HfO2-based FeCaps. A thermal model with an accurate description of the device parasitics is included to derive precise device characteristics based on first principles. The incorporation of statistical device data enables Monte Carlo analysis based on realistic distributions, thereby rendering the model particularly well-suited for design-technology co-optimization (DTCO). The model's efficacy is further demonstrated in circuit simulations using an integrated circuit with current programming, wherein partial switching of the ferroelectric polarization is observed. Finally, the model was benchmarked in an array simulation, reaching convergence in 1.8 s with an array size of 100 kb.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Optimization with Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to do computation with a potential advantage over classical computers. While a single classical computer transforms one particular binary input into an output after applying one operator to the input, a quantum computer can apply the operator to a superposition of binary strings to provide a superposition of binary outputs, doing computation apparently in parallel. This feature allows quantum computers to speed up the computation compared to classical algorithms. Unsurprisingly, quantum algorithms have been proposed to solve optimization problems in quantum computers. Furthermore, a family of quantum machines called quantum annealers are specially designed to solve optimization problems. In this paper, we provide an introduction to quantum optimization from a practical point of view. We introduce the reader to the use of quantum annealers and quantum gate-based machines to solve optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Spintronic memristors for computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.02879v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ever-increasing amount of data from ubiquitous smart devices fosters data-centric and cognitive algorithms. Traditional digital computer systems have separate logic and memory units, resulting in a huge delay and energy cost for implementing these algorithms. Memristors are programmable resistors with a memory, providing a paradigm-shifting approach towards creating intelligent hardware systems to handle data-centric tasks. Spintronic nanodevices are promising choices as they are high-speed, low-power, highly scalable, robust, and capable of constructing dynamic complex systems. In this Review, we survey spintronic devices from a memristor point of view. We introduce spintronic memristors based on magnetic tunnel junctions, nanomagnet ensemble, domain walls, topological spin textures, and spin waves, which represent dramatically different state spaces. They can exhibit steady, oscillatory, stochastic, and chaotic trajectories in their state spaces, which have been exploited for in-memory logic, neuromorphic computing, stochastic and chaos computing. Finally, we discuss challenges and trends in realizing large-scale spintronic memristive systems for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Spatial-RAG: Spatial Retrieval Augmented Generation for Real-World Spatial Reasoning Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18470v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), which struggle with spatial data retrieval and reasoning. We propose Spatial Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Spatial-RAG), a framework that extends RAG to spatial tasks by integrating sparse spatial retrieval (spatial databases) and dense semantic retrieval (LLM-based similarity). A multi-objective ranking strategy balances spatial constraints and semantic relevance, while an LLM-guided generator ensures coherent responses. Experiments on a real-world tourism dataset show that Spatial-RAG significantly improves spatial question answering, bridging the gap between LLMs and spatial intelligence.</description>
