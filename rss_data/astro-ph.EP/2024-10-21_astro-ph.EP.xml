      <title>On the Dynamical Erasure of Initial Conditions in Multi-Planetary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Do sub-Neptunes assemble close to where we see them or do they form full-fledged farther away from their host star then migrate inwards? We explore this question using the distribution of measured orbital periods, one of the most fundamental observable parameters. Under disk-induced migration, planet occurrence rate is expected to decrease towards shorter orbital periods. Presently, the observed sub-Neptune period distribution is flat in log period, between 10 and 300 days. We show, using N-body integration, how post-disk dynamical instabilities and mergers in multi-planetary systems erase the initial conditions of migration emplaced in period distributions over 10s to 100 Myr timescale, in rough agreement with an observational hint of the abundance of resonant pairs for systems younger than 100 Myr which drops dramatically for more evolved systems. We comment on caveats and future work.</description>

      <title>The Detectability of CH$_4$/CO$_2$/CO and N$_2$O Biosignatures through Reflection Spectroscopy of Terrestrial Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical makeup of Earth's atmosphere during the Archean (4 Ga-2.5 Ga) and Proterozoic eon (2.5 Ga-0.5 Ga) contrast considerably with the present-day: the Archean was rich in carbon dioxide and methane and the Proterozoic had potentially higher amounts of nitrous oxide. CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ in an Archean Earth analog may be a compelling biosignature because their coexistence implies methane replenishment at rates unlikely to be abiotic. However, CH$_4$ can also be produced through geological processes, and setting constraints on volcanic molecules like CO may help address this ambiguity. N$_2$O in a Proterozoic Earth analog may be evidence of life because N$_2$O production on Earth is mostly biological. Motivated by these ideas, we use the code $\mbox{ExoReL$^\Re$}$ to generate forward models and simulate spectral retrievals of an Archean and Proterozoic Earth-like planet to determine the detectability of CH$_4$, CO$_2$, CO, and N$_2$O in their reflected light spectrum for wavelength range 0.25-1.8 $\mu$m. We show that it is challenging to detect CO in an Archean atmosphere for volume mixing ratio (VMR) $\leq$ 10%, but CH$_4$ is readily detectable for both the full wavelength span and truncated ranges cut at 1.7$\mu$m and 1.6$\mu$m, although for the latter two cases the dominant gas of the atmosphere is misidentified. Meanwhile, N$_2$O in a Proterozoic atmosphere is detectable for VMR=$10^{-3}$ and long wavelength cutoff $\geq 1.4\mu$m, but undetectable for VMR $\leq 10^{-4}$ . The results presented here will be useful for the strategic design of the future Habitable Worlds Observatory and the components needed to potentially distinguish between inhabited and lifeless planets.</description>

      <title>Circumplanetary Disks are Rare around Planets at Large Orbital Radii: A Parameter Survey of Flow Morphology around Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the formation and structure of circumplanetary disks (CPDs) varies with planet mass and protoplanetary disk aspect ratio. Using static mesh refinement and a near-isothermal equation of state, we perform a small parameter survey of hydrodynamic simulations with parameters appropriate for disk-embedded protoplanets at moderate to large orbital radii. We find that CPD formation occurs along a continuum, with ``diskiness'' increasing smoothly with planetary mass and decreasing disk aspect ratio. As expected from disk hydrostatic equilibrium arguments, the transition from envelope-dominated to disk-dominated structures is determined to first order by the ratio of the planetary Hill sphere radius to the disk scale height, but planets need to be significantly super-thermal to host classical rotationally supported CPDs. The circularization radius of inflowing gas (as a fraction of the Hill sphere radius) shows an approximately quadratic power-law scaling with the ratio of planetary mass to the thermal mass. Compared to more physically complete radiation hydrodynamic simulations, our runs almost maximize the possibility for classical CPD formation, and hence define a plausible necessary condition for CPDs. The low abundance of detected CPDs in disks where planetary companions are inferred from substructure data may be due to a combination of the large scale height of the protoplanetary disk, and a low frequency of sufficiently massive protoplanets. Unless their CPDs cool below the local protoplanetary disk temperature, most of the wide-orbit giant planet population will be embedded in quasi-spherical envelopes that are hard to detect. Disks, and satellite systems, are more likely to form around smaller orbital separation planets.</description>

      <title>Origin of Ca II emission around polluted white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dozens of white dwarfs with anomalous metal polluted atmospheres (DZ WDs) are known to host dust and gas discs. The line profiles of the Ca II triplet emitted by the gas discs show significant asymmetry. Several minor planets have been discovered orbiting such WDs. The most challenging burden of modelling gas discs around DZ WDs is to simultaneously explain the asymmetry and metal pollution of the WD's atmosphere, while staying consistent with other aspects of the observations, like the morphology of the Ca II lines. This paper aims to construct a self-consistent model to explain the simultaneous WD pollution and Ca II line asymmetry over at least three years. In our model an asteroid disintegrates in an eccentric orbit, periodically entering below the WD's Roche limit. The resulting debris sublimates at a temperature of 1500 K, producing gas that viscously spreads to form a disc. The evolution of the discs is studied over a period of 1.2 years using two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. Synthetic Ca II line profiles are calculated using the surface mass density and velocity distributions provided by the simulations, for the first time taking into account the asymmetric velocity distribution in the discs. An asteroid disintegrating in an eccentric orbit gives rise to the formation of an asymmetric disc and asymmetric Ca II triplet emission. Our model can explain the periodic reversal of the red- and blueshifted peak of the Ca II lines caused by the precession of the disc on timescales of 10.6 to 177.4 days. Our work suggests that the persistence of Ca II asymmetry over decades and its periodic change in the peaks can be explained in two scenarios: a) the asteroid disrupts on a short timescale (couple of orbits), and the gas has a low viscosity range (0.001&lt;alpha&lt;0.05), b) the asteroid disrupts on a timescale of a year, and the viscosity of the gas is required to be high, alpha=0.1.</description>

      <title>A hybrid origin for the Martian atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Martian isotopic record displays a dichotomy in volatile compositions. Interior volatiles from the mantle record a chondritic heritage (e.g., H, N, Kr, Xe) whereas the atmospheric reservoir of Kr and Xe - which do not currently experience escape - record heritage from a solar-like source. Motivated by disparate inferences on the source of Martian atmospheric volatiles (outgassed versus nebular captured), we consider hybrid-source accretionary atmospheres in which a high molecular weight (e.g., CO2-rich) outgassed component is mixed in with the low molecular weight H2/He-rich nebular atmosphere. We conduct calculations of nebular capture with and without a mixed-in high molecular weight outgassed component during the lifetime of the solar nebula. Mixing in an outgassed component enhances the captured nebular inventory by 1-3 orders of magnitude - depending on the outgassed inventory - relative to "pure" nebular capture. These observations and calculations suggest that the Martian atmosphere arose as a hybrid mixture of outgassed and nebular-derived components and that - irrespective of the precise composition of the outgassed component - was mainly composed of molecular hydrogen. The consequences for Martian atmospheric history are discussed.</description>

      <title>Probing Na in giant exoplanets with ESPRESSO and 3D NLTE stellar spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral sodium was the first atom detected in an exoplanetary atmosphere via transmission spectroscopy and remains the most frequently detected species due to its strong doublet in the optical. However, the center-to-limb variation (CLV) of these lines in the host star can bias the Na detection.When combined with the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, the CLV can mimic or obscure planetary absorption features. This work investigates the impact of 3D radiation hydrodynamic stellar atmospheres and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) radiative transfer on the modeling of the CLV+RM effect in single-line transmission spectroscopy, to improve the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres. We produced a grid of 3D NLTE synthetic spectra for Na I for FGK stars within the following parameter space: Teff=4500-6500 K, log g=4.0-5.0 and [Fe/H]=-0.5, 0, 0.5.This grid was then interpolated to match the stellar parameters of four stars hosting giant exoplanets, to correct for the CLV+RM effect in their transmission spectra. We used ESPRESSO archival observations. Our work confirms the Na detections in three systems, namely WASP-52b, WASP-76b, and WASP-127b, improving the accuracy of the measured absorption depth. Furthermore, we find that 3D NLTE stellar models can explain the spectral features in HD 209458b without the need for any planetary absorption. In the grid of synthetic spectra, we observe that the CLV effect is stronger for stars with low Teff and high log g. However, the combined effect of CLV and RM is highly dependent on the orbital geometry of the planet-star system. With the continuous improvement of instrumentation, it is crucial to use the most accurate stellar models to correct for the CLV+RM effect in high-resolution transmission spectra, to achieve the best possible characterization of exoplanet atmospheres. We make our grid of 3D NLTE spectra for Na publicly available.</description>

      <title>Ab initio strewn field for small asteroids impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, nine small near-Earth asteroids were discovered a few hours before the collision with the Earth: these are about one meter in diameter objects that have all disintegrated in the atmosphere, generating bright fireballs without causing damage. In some cases, several meteorites have been recovered. In cases like these, it is not always possible to triangulate the fireball generated by the asteroid's fall to circumscribe the strewn field position. For this reason, it can be important to compute a strewn field "ab initio", i.e. propagating the asteroid's trajectory in the atmosphere starting from the initial conditions obtained directly from the heliocentric orbit, coupled with some reasonable hypothesis about the mean strength and the mass of the fragments to "sample" the strewn field. By adopting a simple fragmentation model coupled with a real atmospheric profile, useful results can be obtained to locate the strewn field, as we will show for the recent falls of asteroids 2024 BX1, 2023 CX1 and 2008 TC3. It was possible to locate the strewn field of our study cases with an uncertainty of the order of one kilometre with the mean strength in the range 0.5-5 MPa and the mass of the possible final fragments in the 1 g - 1 kg range. We have also verified that a pancake phase after fragmentation is unnecessary to locate the strewn field for a small asteroid fall.</description>

      <title>MultIHeaTS: A Fast and Stable Thermal Solver for Multilayered Planetary Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fully implicit scheme is proposed for solving the heat equation in 1D heterogeneous media, available as a computationally efficient open-source Python code. The algorithm uses finite differences on an irregular grid and is unconditionally stable due to the implicit formulation. The thermal solver is validated against a stiff analytical solution, demonstrating its robustness in handling stiff initial conditions. Its general applicability for heterogeneous cases is demonstrated through its use in a planetary surface scenario with nonlinear boundary conditions induced by blackbody thermal emission. MultIHeaTS's advantageous stability allows for computation times up to 100 times faster than Spencer's explicit solver, making it ideal for simulating processes on large timescales. This solver is used to compare the thermal signatures of homogeneous and bilayer profiles on Europa. Results show that homogeneous materials cannot reproduce the thermal signature observed in bilayer profiles, emphasizing the need for multilayer solvers. In order to optimize the scientific return of a space mission, we propose a strategy made of three local time observations that is enough to identify bilayer media, for instance, for the next missions to the Jovian system. A second application of the solver is the estimation of the temperature profile of Europa's near surface (first 10s m) throughout a 1 million yr simulation with varying orbital parameters. The probability distribution of temperature through depth is obtained. Among its various applications, MultIHeaTS serves as the core thermal solver in a multiphysics simulation model detailed in the companion article by C. Mergny &amp; F. Schmidt.</description>

      <title>LunaIcy: Exploring Europa's Icy Surface Microstructure through Multiphysics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multiphysics simulation model incorporating a sintering model coupled with the MultIHeaTS thermal solver was developed to study the evolution of icy moons' microstructure. The sintering process is highly dependent on temperature, and this study represents the first attempt in planetary science to examine the coupled interaction between heat transfer and sintering. Our approach to ice sintering is based upon the literature while offering a refined description of the matter exchange between grains, bonds, and the pore space. By running the numerical framework, we simulate the evolution of ice microstructure on Galilean satellites, specifically tracking the changes in the ice grain and bond radii over time. LunaIcy, our multiphysics model, was applied to study the evolution of Europa's ice microstructure over 1 million yr along its orbit, with a parameter exploration to investigate the diverse configurations of the icy surface. Our results indicate that effective sintering can take place in regions where daily temperatures briefly surpass 115 K, even during short intervals of the day. Such sintering could not have been detected without the diurnal thermal coupling of LunaIcy due to the cold daily mean temperature. In these regions, sintering occurs within timescales shorter than Europa's ice crust age, suggesting that, in present times, their surface is made of an interconnected ice structure.</description>

      <title>The GAPS programme at TNG -- LXIII. Photo-evaporating puzzle: Exploring the enigmatic nature of TOI-5398 b atmospheric signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric characterization is key to understanding exoplanetary systems, offering insights into the planets current and past conditions. By analyzing key lines like H alpha and the He I triplet, we can trace the evolution of planets through atmospheric photo-evaporation. While ultra-hot Jupiters have been the focus for years, attention is shifting toward smaller, colder planets, which are more challenging to study due to weaker signals, requiring more precise techniques. This study aims to characterize the atmosphere of TOI-5398 b, a warm Saturn with a 10.59-day orbit around a young (650 Myr) G-type star. The system also hosts a smaller inner planet, TOI-5398 c, with a 4.77-day orbit. Both planets are ideal for atmospheric studies due to their proximity to the host star, which drives strong photo-evaporation, especially in planet b, whose high transmission spectroscopy metric (288) makes it a prime target. We analyzed data from a transit observed with the HARPS-N and GIANO-B high-resolution spectrographs, using cross-correlation and single-line analysis to search for atomic species. During this observation, planet c was also transiting, so we investigated the source of the signals. Based on photo-evaporation models, we attribute the signal mainly to planet b, which is expected to lose more mass. We detected H alpha and He I triplets, key markers of photo-evaporation, corresponding to atmospheric heights of 2.33 Rp and 1.65 Rp, respectively. The ATES models supported our observations, predicting a similar He I absorption for planet b and suggesting an He/H ratio of 1/99. Additionally, we detected an Na I doublet via single-line analysis, though cross-correlation did not reveal other atomic species.</description>

      <title>Thermal tides on rocky planets through a novel fully analytical solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal tides are atmospheric tides caused by variations in day-night insolation, similar to gravitational tides but with key differences. While both result in delayed mass redistribution, energy dissipation, and angular momentum exchanges between the planet and its host star, thermal tides can drive a planet's dynamics away from the rotational equilibrium states predicted by classical tidal theory. In this work, we present a novel closed-form solution for the thermotidal response of rocky planets. This general solution is derived from first principles, assuming either dry or moist adiabatic temperature profiles for the planet's atmosphere, and can be readily applied to study the long-term evolution of exoplanets in the habitable zones of their host stars. Despite relying on a small number of parameters, the model successfully captures the key features of the thermotidal torque predicted by General Circulation Models (GCMs). It also accurately predicts Earth's current semidiurnal thermotidal response and provides new insights into the evolution of the length of day during the Precambrian era.</description>

      <title>Cthulhu: An Open Source Molecular and Atomic Cross Section Computation Code for Substellar Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric studies of exoplanets and brown dwarfs are a cutting-edge and rapidly evolving area of astrophysics research. Calculating models of exoplanet or brown dwarf spectra requires knowledge of the wavelength-dependent absorption of light (cross sections) by the molecules and atoms in the atmosphere. Here we introduce Cthulhu, a pure Python package that rapidly calculates cross sections from atomic and molecular line lists. Cthulhu includes modules to automatically download molecular line lists from online databases (e.g. ExoMol and HITRAN) and compute cross sections on a user-specified temperature, pressure, and wavenumber grid. Cthulhu requires only CPUs and can run on a user's laptop (for smaller line lists with &lt; 100 million lines) or on a large cluster in parallel (for many billion lines). Cthulhu includes in-depth Jupyter tutorials in the online documentation. Finally, Cthulhu can be used as an educational tool to demystify the process of making cross sections for atmospheric models.</description>

      <title>Identifying new high-confidence polluted white dwarf candidates using Gaia XP spectra and Self-Organizing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification of new white dwarfs (WDs) polluted with heavy elements is important since they provide a valuable tool for inferring chemical properties of putative planetary systems accreting material on their surfaces. The Gaia space mission has provided us with an unprecedented amount of astrometric, photometric, and low resolution (XP) spectroscopic data for millions of newly discovered stellar sources, among them thousands of WDs. In order to find WDs among this data and to identify which ones have metals in their atmospheres, we propose a methodology based on an unsupervised artificial intelligence technique called Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). In our approach a nonlinear high-dimensional dataset is projected on a 2D grid map where similar elements fall into the same neuron.
  By applying this method, we obtained a clean sample of 66,337 WDs. We performed an automatic spectral classification analysis to them, obtaining 143 bona fide polluted WD candidates not previously classified in the literature. The majority of them are cool WDs and we identify in their XP spectra several metallic lines such as Ca, Mg, Na, Li, and K. The fact that we obtain similar precision metrics than those achieved with recent supervised techniques highlights the power of our unsupervised approach to mine the Gaia archives for hidden treasures to follow-up spectroscopically with higher resolution.</description>

      <title>More Likely Than You Think: Inclination-Driving Secular Resonances are Common in Known Exoplanet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09359</link>

Abstract: Multi-planet systems face significant challenges to detection. For example, further orbiting planets have reduced signal-to-noise ratio in radial velocity detection methods, and small mutual inclinations between planets can prevent them from all transiting. One mechanism to excite mutual inclination between planets is secular resonance, where the nodal precession frequencies of the planets align such as to greatly increase the efficiency of angular momentum transport between planets. These resonances can significantly misalign planets from one another, hindering detection, and typically can only occur when there are three or more planets in the system. Naively, systems can only be in resonance for particular combinations of planet semimajor axes and masses; however, effects that alter the nodal precession frequencies of the planets, such as the decay of stellar oblateness, can significantly expand the region of parameter space where resonances occur. In this work, we explore known three-planet systems, determine whether they are in (or were in) secular resonance due to evolving stellar oblateness, and demonstrate the implications of resonance on their detectability and stability. We show that about 20% of a sample of three planet transiting systems seem to undergo these resonances early in their lives.</description>

      <title>BOWIE-ALIGN: A JWST comparative survey of aligned vs misaligned hot Jupiters to test the dependence of atmospheric composition on migration history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A primary objective of exoplanet atmosphere characterisation is to learn about planet formation and evolution, however, this is challenged by degeneracies. To determine whether differences in atmospheric composition can be reliably traced to differences in evolution, we are undertaking a transmission spectroscopy survey with JWST to compare the compositions of a sample of hot Jupiters that have different orbital alignments around F stars above the Kraft break. Under the assumption that aligned planets migrate through the inner disc, while misaligned planets migrate after disc dispersal, the act of migrating through the inner disc should cause a measurable difference in the C/O between aligned and misaligned planets. We expect the amplitude and sign of this difference to depend on the amount of planetesimal accretion and whether silicates accreted from the inner disc release their oxygen. Here, we identify all known exoplanets that are suitable for testing this hypothesis, describe our JWST survey, and use noise simulations and atmospheric retrievals to estimate our survey's sensitivity. With the selected sample of four aligned and four misaligned hot Jupiters, we will be sensitive to the predicted differences in C/O between aligned and misaligned hot Jupiters for a wide range of model scenarios.</description>

      <title>BOWIE-ALIGN: How formation and migration histories of giant planets impact atmospheric compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hot Jupiters present a unique opportunity for measuring how planet formation history shapes present-day atmospheric composition. However, due to the myriad pathways influencing composition, a well-constructed sample of planets is needed to determine whether formation history can be accurately traced back from atmospheric composition. To this end, the BOWIE-ALIGN survey will compare the compositions of 8 hot Jupiters around F stars, 4 with orbits aligned with the stellar rotation axis and 4 misaligned. Using the alignment as an indicator for planets that underwent disc migration or high-eccentricity migration, one can determine whether migration history produces notable differences in composition between the two samples of planets. This paper describes the planet formation model that motivates our observing programme. Our model traces the accretion of chemical components from the gas and dust in the disc over a broad parameter space to create a full, unbiased model sample from which we can estimate the range of final atmospheric compositions. For high metallicity atmospheres (O/H &gt; 10 times solar), the C/O ratios of aligned and misaligned planets diverge, with aligned planets having lower C/O (&lt; 0.25) due to the accretion of oxygen-rich silicates from the inner disc. However, silicates may rain out instead of releasing their oxygen into the atmosphere. This would significantly increase the C/O of aligned planets (C/O &gt; 0.6), inverting the trend between the aligned and misaligned planets. Nevertheless, by comparing statistically significant samples of aligned and misaligned planets, we expect atmospheric composition to constrain how planets form.</description>

      <title>The OATMEAL Survey. I. Low Stellar Obliquity in the Transiting Brown Dwarf System GPX-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the OATMEAL survey, an effort to measure the obliquities of stars with transiting brown dwarf companions. We observed a transit of the close-in ($P_{\rm orb} = 1.74 \,$ days) brown dwarf GPX-1 b using the Keck Planet Finder (KPF) spectrograph to measure the sky-projected angle between its orbital axis and the spin axis of its early F-type host star ($\lambda$). We measured $\lambda = 6.88 \pm 1.72 ^\circ$ (with additional unquantified systematic uncertainty), suggesting an orbit that is prograde and well aligned with the stellar equator. Hot Jupiters around early F stars are frequently found to have highly misaligned orbits, with polar and retrograde orbits being commonplace. It has been theorized that these misalignments stem from dynamical interactions, such as von Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov cycles, and are retained over long timescales due to weak tidal dissipation in stars with radiative envelopes. By comparing GPX-1 to similar systems under the frameworks of different tidal evolution theories, we argued that the rate of tidal dissipation is too slow to have re-aligned the system. This suggests that GPX-1 may have arrived at its close-in orbit via coplanar high-eccentricity migration or migration through an aligned protoplanetary disk. Our result for GPX-1 is one of few measurements of the obliquity of a star with a transiting brown dwarf. By enlarging the number of such measurements and comparing them with hot Jupiter systems, we will more clearly discern the differences between the mechanisms that dictate the formation and evolution of both classes of objects.</description>

      <title>A photochemical PHO network for hydrogen-dominated exoplanet atmospheres</title>

Abstract: Due to the detection of phosphine PH3 in the Solar System gas giants Jupiter and Saturn, PH3 has long been suggested to be detectable in exosolar substellar atmospheres too. However, to date, a direct detection of phosphine has proven to be elusive in exoplanet atmosphere surveys. We construct an updated phosphorus-hydrogen-oxygen (PHO) photochemical network suitable for simulation of gas giant hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. Using this network, we examine PHO photochemistry in hot Jupiter and warm Neptune exoplanet atmospheres at Solar and enriched metallicities. Our results show for HD 189733b-like hot Jupiters that HOPO, PO and P2 are typically the dominant P carriers at pressures important for transit and emission spectra, rather than PH3. For GJ1214b-like warm Neptune atmospheres our results suggest that at Solar metallicity PH3 is dominant in the absence of photochemistry, but is generally not in high abundance for all other chemical environments. At 10 and 100 times Solar, small oxygenated phosphorus molecules such as HOPO and PO dominate for both thermochemical and photochemical simulations. The network is able to reproduce well the observed PH3 abundances on Jupiter and Saturn. Despite progress in improving the accuracy of the PHO network, large portions of the reaction rate data remain with approximate, uncertain or missing values, which could change the conclusions of the current study significantly. Improving understanding of the kinetics of phosphorus-bearing chemical reactions will be a key undertaking for astronomers aiming to detect phosphine and other phosphorus species in both rocky and gaseous exoplanetary atmospheres in the near future.</description>

      <title>Breaking degeneracies in exoplanetary parameters through self-consistent atmosphere-interior modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: A new generation of instruments (e.g., JWST, ELTs, PLATO, Ariel) is providing atmospheric spectra and mass/radius measurements for large exoplanet populations, challenging planetary models used to interpret these findings. Aims: We develop a new model, the Heat Atmosphere Density Evolution Solver (HADES), by coupling an atmosphere and interior model self-consistently and comparing its results to observed data. Methods: Atmospheric calculations are performed under radiative-convective equilibrium, while the interior relies on recent ab initio equations of state. We ensure continuity in the thermal, gravity, and molecular mass profiles between models. Results: The model is applied to the known exoplanet database to characterize intrinsic thermal properties. We find that intrinsic temperatures (T$_{int}$) of 200-400 K, increasing with equilibrium temperature, are needed to explain radius inflation in hot Jupiters. Additionally, we perform atmosphere-interior retrievals using observed spectra and measured parameters for WASP-39 b and 51 Eridani b. For WASP-39 b, spectroscopic data breaks degeneracies in metallicity and Tint, deriving high values: Z = 14.79$^{+1.80}_{-1.91}$ x Solar and T$_{int} = 297.39^{+8.95}_{-16.9}$ K. For 51 Eridani b, we show the importance of using self-consistent models with radius as a constrained parameter, deriving a planet mass M$_{p} = 3.13^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ M$_{J}$ and a core mass M$_{core} = 31.86^{+0.32}_{-0.18}$ M$_{E}$, suggesting formation via core accretion with a "hot start." Conclusions: Self-consistent atmosphere-interior models can efficiently break degeneracies in the structure of transiting and directly imaged exoplanets, offering new insights into exoplanet formation and evolution.</description>
