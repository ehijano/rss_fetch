      <title>QCaMP: A 4-Week Summer Camp Introducing High School Students to Quantum Information Science and Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2024 Quantum Computing, Math and Physics Camp (QCaMP) for Students was a 4-week long summer camp aimed at introducing high school students to quantum concepts and careers, including applications spanning quantum computing, sensing, and communication. The program ran for 7 hours/day, Monday-Friday, July 1-26, and included hands-on modules and activities, professional development, and project-based learning. Here we provide details on the camp curriculum and outcomes based on pre and post knowledge and attitudes assessments.</description>

      <title>Egocentric Mixed-Methods SNA: Analyzing Interviews with Women and/or Queer and LGBT+ Ph.D. Physicists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social network analysis (SNA) has been widely used in physics education research (PER) in recent years, but mostly in a limited range of the available modalities. This paper describes a unique approach to egocentric, mixed-methods SNA applied to qualitative network data obtained from 100 interviews with women and/or queer professional physicists. We focus on our methods for obtaining quantitative network data from these qualitative sources and present novel techniques for analysis of the networks. We also examine the ways in which egocentric and mixed-methods SNA techniques are aligned with critical methods and well-suited to the study of difference, non-normativity, and experiences of marginalization in physics spaces and communities. We explore the limitations and potential applications of these methods and situate this work in the larger context of our study of these interviews. This work bridges a methodological gap between SNA and qualitative work on identity in PER and begins to develop our understanding of the way gender and sexual minority physicists experience support.</description>
