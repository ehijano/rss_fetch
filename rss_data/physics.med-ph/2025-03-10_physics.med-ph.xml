      <title>Optimization models for needle placement in 3D-printed masks for high dose rate brachytherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High dose rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) is an appealing treatment option for superficial cancers that permits the delivery of higher local doses than other radiation modalities without a significant increase in toxicity. In order for HDR-BT to be used in these situations, needles through which the radiation source is passed must be strategically placed in close proximity to the patient's body. Currently, this crucial step is performed manually by physicians or medical physicists. The use of 3D-printed masks customized for individual patients has been advocated as a way to more precisely and securely position these needles, with the potential of producing better and safer treatment plans. In this paper, we propose optimization approaches for positioning needles within 3D-printed masks for HDR-BT, focusing on skin cancers. We numerically show that the models we propose efficiently generate more homogeneous plans than those derived manually and provide an alternative to manual placement that can save planning time and enhance plan quality.</description>

      <title>Comparative Time-Series Analysis of Hip and Shoulder Rotation in Baseball Bat Swings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on the rotation of the hips and shoulders during a baseball bat swing, analyzing the time-series changes in rotational angles, rotational velocities, and axes using marker position data obtained from a motion capture system with 12 infrared cameras. Previous studies have examined factors such as ground reaction forces, muscle activation patterns, rotational energy, angular velocity, and angles during a swing. However, to the best of our knowledge, the hip and shoulder rotational motions have not been adequately visualized or compared. In particular, there is a lack of analysis regarding the coordination and timing differences between hip and shoulder movements during the swing. Therefore, this study aims to quantitatively compare the hip and shoulder rotational movements during the swing between skilled and unskilled players and visualizes the differences between them. Based on the obtained data, the study aims to improve the understanding of bat swing mechanics by visualizing the coordinated body movements during the swing.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Modular Pulse Synthesizer: A High-Power High-Granularity Electronics Solution for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation with Practically Any Pulse Shape for Neural Activation Selectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noninvasive brain stimulation can activate neurons in the brain but requires power electronics with exceptionally high power in the mega-volt-ampere and high frequencies in the kilohertz range. Whereas oscillator circuits offered only one or very few pulse shapes, modular power electronics solved a long-standing problem for the first time and enabled arbitrary software-based design of the temporal shape of stimuli. However, synthesizing arbitrary stimuli with a high output quality requires a large number of modules. Systems with few modules and pulse-width modulation may generate apparently smooth current shapes in the highly inductive coil, but the stimulation effect of the neurons depends on the electric field and the electric field becomes a burst of ultra-brief rectangular pulses. We propose an alternative solution that achieves high-resolution pulse shaping with fewer modules by implementing high-power wide-bandwidth voltage asymmetry. Rather than equal voltage steps, our system strategically assigns different voltages to each module to achieve a near-exponential improvement in resolution. Compared to prior designs, our experimental prototype achieved better output quality, although it uses only half the number of modules.</description>

      <title>The New CMS Measure of Excessive Radiation Dose or Inadequate CT Image Quality: Methods for Size-Adjusted Dose and Their Variabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) has introduced CMS1074v2, a quality measure for computed tomography (CT) that assesses radiation dose and image quality across 18 CT exam categories. This measure mandates the calculation of size-adjusted dose (SAD) using patient effective diameter and predefined size-adjustment coefficients. However, variability in SAD calculation methods raises concerns about standardization, compliance, and clinical applicability. This study evaluates five commonly used methods for estimating effective diameter and their impact on SAD determination in thoracic and abdominal CT protocols. A retrospective analysis of 719 CT exams was performed, comparing SAD values across different calculation approaches. Results indicate significant variability in SAD, with attenuation-based methods overestimating SAD in chest exams and projection-based methods exhibiting greater variability in abdominal exams. The findings highlight potential inconsistencies in CMS-defined dose thresholds and challenges in applying the measure across diverse patient populations and institutional imaging practices. Addressing these inconsistencies is critical for ensuring accurate dose reporting and maintaining diagnostic integrity in CT imaging.</description>

      <title>Low contrast detection and super-resolution in CT images: evaluation of a novel approach based on Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, image analysis techniques used in astrophysics to detect low-contrast signals have been adapted in the processing of Computed Tomography (CT) images, combining Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT) and machine learning techniques. Several CT acquisitions were performed using a phantom containing cylindrical inserts of different diameters producing objects with different contrasts respect to background. The images of the phantom, tilted by a known angle with respect to the tomograph axis (to mimic the casual orientation of a clinical lesion), were acquired at various radiation doses (CTDIvol) and at different slice's thicknesses. The success in detecting the signal in the single image (slice) was always greater than 60%. The axis of each insert has always been correctly identified. A super-resolution 2D image was then generated by projecting the individual slices of the scan along this axis, thus increasing the CNR of the object scanned as a whole. CVT holds great promise for future use in medical imaging, for the identification of low-contrast lesions in homogeneous organs, such as the liver.</description>

      <title>A Simple Sonic Mapping Method Verified by CT Scan Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel sonic mapping method applied to coal samples, verified by CT scan imaging. Cubic coal samples with side lengths of 50-70 mm were subjected to non-destructive sonic tests, measuring both P-wave (Vp) and S-wave (Vs) velocities. Each of the three orthogonal directions (X, Y, and Z) of the cube was divided into 9 regions, resulting in 27 Vp and 27 Vs measurements per sample. From these data, 2D sonic maps were constructed for each direction, and interpolation was employed to refine the mappings. A 3D sonic map was then generated by averaging the 2D maps. The 3D sonic mapping results were compared and validated against high-resolution CT scan images, confirming the reliability of this approach for mapping the internal structure of coal samples.</description>

      <title>A LSTM-Transformer Model for pulsation control of pVADs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods: A method of the pulsation for a pVAD is proposed (AP-pVAD Model). AP-pVAD Model consists of two parts: NPQ Model and LSTM-Transformer Model. (1)The NPQ Model determines the mathematical relationship between motor speed, pressure, and flow rate for the pVAD. (2)The Attention module of Transformer neural network is integrated into the LSTM neural network to form the new LSTM-Transformer Model to predict the pulsation time characteristic points for adjusting the motor speed of the pVAD. Results: The AP-pVAD Model is validated in three hydraulic experiments and an animal experiment. (1)The pressure provided by pVAD calculated with the NPQ Model has a maximum error of only 2.15 mmHg compared to the expected values. (2)The pulsation time characteristic points predicted by the LSTM-Transformer Model shows a maximum prediction error of 1.78ms, which is significantly lower than other methods. (3)The in-vivo test of pVAD in animal experiment has significant improvements in aortic pressure. Animals survive for over 27 hours after the initiation of pVAD operation. Conclusion: (1)For a given pVAD, motor speed has a linear relationship with pressure and a quadratic relationship with flow. (2)Deep learning can be used to predict pulsation characteristic time points, with the LSTM-Transformer Model demonstrating minimal prediction error and better robust performance under conditions of limited dataset sizes, elevated noise levels, and diverse hyperparameter combinations, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Is fitting error a reliable metric for assessing deformable motion correction in quantitative MRI?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative MR (qMR) can provide numerical values representing the physical and chemical properties of the tissues. To collect a series of frames under varying settings, retrospective motion correction is essential to align the corresponding anatomical points or features. Under the assumption that the misalignment makes the discrepancy between the corresponding features larger, fitting error is a commonly used evaluation metric for motion correction in qMR. This study evaluates the reliability of the fitting error metric in cardiac diffusion tensor imaging (cDTI) after deformable registration. We found that while fitting error correlates with the negative eigenvalues, the negative Jacobian Determinant increases with broken cardiomyocytes, indicated by helix angle gradient line profiles. Since fitting error measures the distance between moved points and their re-rendered counterparts, the fitting parameter itself may be adjusted due to poor registration. Therefore, fitting error in deformable registration itself is a necessary but not sufficient metric and should be combined with other metrics.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions to the cancer laser ablation modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present paper deals with the study of the fluence rate over both healthy and tumor tissues in the presence of focal laser ablation (FLA). We propose new analytical solutions for the coupled partial differential equations (PDE) system, which includes the transport equation modeling the light penetration into biological tissue, the bioheat equation modeling the heat transfer and its respective damage. The present building could be the first step to the knowledge of the mathematical framework for biothermophysical problems, as well as the main key to simplify the numerical calculation due to its no cost. We derive exact solutions and simulate results from them. We discuss the potential physical contributions and present respective conclusions about (1) the validness of the diffusion approximation of the radiative transfer equation; (2) the local behavior of the source of scattered photons; (3) the unsteady-state of the fluence rate; and (4) the boundedness of the critical time of the thermal damage to the cancerous tissue. We also discuss some controversial and diverging hypotheses.</description>
