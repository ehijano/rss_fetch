      <title>On the Bergman metric of Cartan-Hartogs domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Bergman metric and introduce the Bergman dual on Cartan-Hartogs (CH) domains. For a bounded domain D in C^n with Bergman kernel K_D, we define the Bergman dual of (D, g_D) as (D*, g_D*), where D* is the maximal domain on which the modified kernel K_D*(z, zbar) = K_D(z, -zbar) is positive, and g_D* is the Kahler metric obtained from K_D*. For a Cartan-Hartogs domain M_{Omega, mu} we prove the equivalence of: (i) M_{Omega, mu} is biholomorphic to the unit ball; (ii) its Bergman metric is a Kahler-Ricci soliton; (iii) after rescaling by a constant factor, the Bergman dual is finitely projectively induced. Conditions (i) and (ii) are Bergman-metric analogues of classical rigidity for Kahler-Einstein metrics (related to Yau's problem and Cheng's conjecture) and to recent rigidity for Kahler-Ricci solitons. Condition (iii) emphasizes the duality viewpoint, inspired by bounded symmetric domains and their compact duals. We also compare our results with other canonical metrics on CH domains, namely g_{Omega, mu} and hat g_{Omega, mu}, and discuss open problems about the maximal domain on which the Bergman dual is defined.</description>

      <title>Appearance of the higher-order Stokes phenomenon in a discrete Airy equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a discrete variant of the Airy equation, formulated as an advance-delay equation, to reveal that discretization induces the higher-order Stokes phenomenon, which is not present in the continuous Airy function and is typically only encountered in solutions to third-order or higher linear homogeneous, or nonlinear, differential equations. Using steepest descent and direct series methods, we derive asymptotic solutions and the Stokes structure. Our analysis shows that discretization produces a more intricate Stokes structure, containing higher-order Stokes phenomena and infinite accumulations of Stokes and anti-Stokes curves. The latter feature is a strictly nonlinear effect in continuous differential equations. We show that this unusual behavior can be generated in a discrete equation from a linear discretization. Numerical simulations confirm the predictions, and a direct comparison with the continuous Airy equation explains how the discretization alters the Stokes structure.</description>

      <title>K\"ahlerness of compact Hermitian surfaces under semi-definite Strominger-Bismut-Ricci curvatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a compact Hermitian surface is K\"ahler under certain non-positivity or non-negativity conditions on Strominger-Bismut-Ricci curvatures. The key tools for achieve these results are new Ricci curvature and Chern number identities for the Strominger-Bismut connection. This work complements and extends earlier results of Yang.</description>

      <title>Functional Equations for Generalized Collatz Dynamics Using Integral Representations and Residue Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on a wide class of Collatz-type arithmetic dynamics, and presents a systematic derivation of recursive formulas and functional equations satisfied by the associated generating functions. The main tools belong to complex analysis, including contour-integral representations, residue calculus, and Cauchy's integral formulas. The basic approach is inspired by Egorychev's method, which has been used so far to establish combinatorial identities. Moreover, this work generalizes existing results and extends the methodology to multiple dimensions using several complex variables.</description>

      <title>Local repulsion between zeros and critical points of the Gaussian Entire Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the zeros and critical points of different indices of the standard Gaussian entire function on the complex plane (whose zero set is stationary). We provide asymptotics for the second order correlations of all the corresponding number statistics on small observation disks, showing various rates of local repulsion. The results have consequences for signal processing, as they show extremely strong repulsion between the local maxima and zeros of spectrograms of noise computed with respect to Gaussian windows.</description>

      <title>Greedy Thiele continued-fraction approximation on continuum domains in the complex plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe an adaptive greedy algorithm for Thiele continued-fraction approximation of a function defined on a continuum domain in the complex plane. The algorithm iteratively selects interpolation nodes from an adaptively refined set of sample points on the domain boundary. We also present new algorithms for evaluating Thiele continued fractions and their accessory weights using only a single floating-point division. Numerical experiments comparing the greedy TCF method with the AAA algorithm on several challenging functions defined on the interval $[-1,1]$ and on the unit circle show that continuum TCF is consistently 2.5 to 8 times faster than AAA.</description>

      <title>On $q$-complete and $q$-concave with corners complex manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0710.3358</link>
      <description>arXiv:0710.3358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is proved that if there exists a positive and continuous function $f$ on an $n$-dimensional complex manifold $X$, $q$-convex with corners outside a compact set $K\subset X$ and which exhausts $X$ from below, then $dim_{\mathbb{C}}H^{p}(X,{\mathcal{F}})&lt;+\infty$ for any coherent analytic sheaf ${\mathcal{F}}$ on $X$ if $p&lt;n-q$. It is known from the theory of Andreotti and Grauert that if a complex space $X$ is $q$-complete, then $X$ is cohomoloogically $q$-complete. Until now it is not known in general if these two conditions are equivalent. The aim of section $4$ of this article is to provide a counterexample to the conjecture posed by Andreotti and Grauert ~\cite{ref2} to show that a cohomologically $q$-complete space is not necessarily $q$-complete. In section $5$ of this article, we will prove that there exist for each pair of integers $(n,q)$ with $2\leq q\leq n-1$ a $q$-complete with corners open subset $D$ of $\mathbb{P}^{n}$ and $\mathcal{F}\in coh(\mathbb{P}^{n})$ such that $D$ is not cohomologically $\hat{q}$-complete with respect to ${\mathcal{F}}$. Here $\hat{q}=n-[\frac{n-1}{q}]$, where $[x]$ denotes the integral part of $x$.</description>

      <title>The local Steiness problem with singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0911.1800</link>
      <description>arXiv:0911.1800v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we prove that if $\Pi: X\rightarrow \Omega$ is an unbranched Riemann domain with $\Omega$ Stein of dimension $n$ and $\Pi$ a locally $q$-complete morphism, then $X$ is cohomologically $q$-complete if $n\geq 3$ and $1\leq q\leq n-2$ or if $\Omega$ has dimension $2$ and $1\leq q\leq 2$. This generalizes a well-known result which is obtained in ~\cite{ref3} for $q=1$ when $X$ and $\Omega$ have isolated singularities and, gives in particular a positive answer to the local Steiness problem, namely if $X$ is a Stein space and $\Omega$ a locally Stein open subset of $X$, then $\Omega$ is Stein.</description>

      <title>Multiple radial SLE(0) and classical Calogero-Sutherland System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21544v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of multiple radial SLE(0) -- a smooth system of curves in a simply connected domain $\Omega$ with marked boundary points $z_1, \ldots, z_n \in \partial \Omega$ and a marked interior point $q$ -- arising as the deterministic limit of random multiple radial SLE($\kappa$) systems.
  We construct multiple radial SLE(0) systems by starting from the stationary relations, which arise heuristically as the $\kappa \to 0$ limit of partition functions. By constructing the field integrals of motion for the Loewner dynamics, we show that the traces of multiple radial SLE(0) systems are the horizontal trajectories of an equivalence class of quadratic differentials. These trajectories have limiting ends at the boundary points $\{z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_n\}$.
  The stationary relations connect the classification of multiple radial SLE(0) systems to the enumeration of critical points of the master function of trigonometric Knizhnik--Zamolodchikov (KZ) equations.
  In the deterministic case $\kappa = 0$, we show that the Loewner dynamics with a common parametrization of capacity form a special class of classical Calogero--Sutherland systems, restricted to a submanifold of phase space defined by the Lax matrix.</description>

      <title>The Mittag-Leffler theorem for proper minimal surfaces and directed meromorphic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a Mittag-Leffler-type theorem with approximation and interpolation for meromorphic curves $M\to \mathbb{C}^n$ ($n\geq 3$) directed by Oka cones in $\mathbb{C}^n$ on any open Riemann surface $M$. We derive a result of the same type for proper conformal minimal immersions $M\to \mathbb{R}^n$. This includes interpolation in the poles and approximation by embeddings, the latter if $n\ge 5$ in the case of minimal surfaces. As applications, we show that complete minimal ends of finite total curvature in $\mathbb{R}^5$ are generically embedded, and characterize those open Riemann surfaces which are the complex structure of a proper minimal surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ of weak finite total curvature.</description>
