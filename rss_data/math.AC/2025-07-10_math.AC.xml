      <title>A DG $\Gamma$-structure on the Generalized Taylor Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free resolutions of ideals in commutative rings provide valuable insights into the complexity of these ideals. In 1966, Taylor constructed a free resolution for monomial ideals in polynomial rings, which Gemeda later showed admits a differential graded (DG) algebra structure. In 2002, Avramov proved that the Taylor resolution admits a DG algebra structure with divided powers. In 2007, Herzog introduced the generalized Taylor resolution, which is usually smaller than the original Taylor resolution. Recently, in 2023, VandeBogert showed that the generalized Taylor resolution also admits a DG algebra structure. In this paper, we extend Avramov's result by proving that the generalized Taylor resolution admits a DG algebra structure with divided powers. Along the way, we correct a sign error in VandeBogert's product formula. We provide applications concerning homotopy Lie algebras and resolutions of squarefree monomial ideals.</description>

      <title>Principal vector-spread Borel ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the class of squarefree principal vector-spread Borel ideals. We compute the minimal primary decomposition of these ideals and thereby we prove that they are sequentially Cohen-Macaulay. As the final conclusion of our results, we completely classify the ideals in our class having the property that their ordinary and symbolic powers coincide.</description>

      <title>On Shilov boundaries, Rees valuations and integral extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore an analogy between, on one hand, the notions of integral closure of ideals and Rees valuations in commutative algebra and, on the other hand, the notions of spectral seminorm and Shilov boundary in nonarchimedean geometry. For any Tate ring $\mathcal{A}$ with a Noetherian ring of definition $\mathcal{A}_{0}$ and pseudo-uniformizer $\varpi\in\mathcal{A}_{0}$, we prove that the Shilov boundary for $\mathcal{A}$ naturally coincides with the set of Rees valuation rings of the principal ideal $(\varpi)_{\mathcal{A}_{0}}$ of $\mathcal{A}_{0}$.
  Furthermore, we characterize the Shilov boundary for a wide class of Tate rings by means of minimal open prime ideals in the subring of power-bounded elements. For affinoid algebras, in the sense of Tate, whose underlying rings are integral domains, this recovers a well-known result of Berkovich. Moreover, under some mild assumptions, we prove stability of our characterization of the Shilov boundary under (completed) integral extensions. In particular, for every mixed-characteristic Noetherian domain $R$, we obtain a description of the Shilov boundary for the Tate ring $\widehat{R^{+}}[p^{-1}]$, where $\widehat{R^{+}}$ is the $p$-adic completion of the absolute integral closure of the domain $R$.</description>

      <title>Mixed Segre zeta functions and their log-concavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study the mixed Segre zeta function of a sequence of homogeneous ideals in a polynomial ring. This function is a power series encoding information about the mixed Segre classes obtained by extending the ideals to projective spaces of arbitrarily large dimension. Our work generalizes and unifies results by Kleiman and Thorup on mixed Segre classes and by Aluffi on Segre zeta functions. We prove that this power series is rational, with poles corresponding to the degrees of the generators of the ideals. We also show that the mixed Segre zeta function only depends on the integral closure of the ideals. Finally, we prove that the homogenization of the numerator of a modification of the mixed Segre zeta function is denormalized Lorentzian in the sense of Br\"and\'en and Huh.</description>

      <title>Walk Matrix-Based Upper Bounds on Generalized Cospectral Mates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of characterizing graphs determined by their spectrum (DS) or generalized spectrum (DGS) has been a longstanding topic of interest in spectral graph theory, originating from questions in chemistry and mathematical physics. While previous studies primarily focus on identifying whether a graph is DGS, we address a related yet distinct question: how many non-isomorphic generalized cospectral mates a graph can have? Building upon recent advances that connect this question to the properties of the walk matrix, we introduce a broad family of graphs and establish an explicit upper bound on the number of non-isomorphic generalized cospectral mates they can have. This bound is determined by the arithmetic structure of the determinant of the walk matrix, offering a refined criterion for quantifying the multiplicity of generalized cospectral graphs. This result sheds new light on the structure of generalized cospectral graphs and provides a refined arithmetic criterion for bounding their multiplicity.</description>

      <title>Test ideals in mixed characteristic: a unified theory up to perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an integral scheme of finite type over a complete DVR of mixed characteristic. We provide a definition of a test ideal which agrees with the multiplier ideal after inverting $p$, is computed from a sufficiently large alteration, agrees with previous mixed characteristic BCM test ideals after completing at any point of residue characteristic $p$ (up to small perturbation), and which satisfies the full suite of expected properties of a multiplier or test ideal. This object is obtained via the $p$-adic Riemann-Hilbert functor.</description>

      <title>Additive subgroups of a module that are saturated with respect to a subset of the ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a subset of a ring $A$, and let $M$ be an $A$-module. We study the additive subgroups $F$ of $M$ such that, for all $x \in M$, if $tx \in F$ for some $t \in T$, then $x \in F$. We call any such subset $F$ of $M$ a $T$-factroid of $M$, which is a kind of dual to the notion of a $T$-submodule of $M$. We connect the notion with the zero-divisors on $M$, various classes of primary and prime ideals of $A$, Euclidean domains, and the recent concepts of unit-additive commutative rings and of Egyptian fractions with respect to a multiplicative subset of a commutative ring. We also introduce a common generalization of local rings and unit-additive rings, called *sublocalizable* rings, and relate them to $T$-factroids.</description>
