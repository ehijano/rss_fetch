      <title>Dynamics of Coupled Metamaterials: Acoustic Black Hole, Local Resonator &amp; Multistable Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vibration attenuation has played a crucial role in engineering structure, wherein metamaterials have found escalated usage. These structures can be cleverly built to be lightweight and have negative mass properties, which can attenuate waves at specific frequency bands. The first part studies wave propagation in meta-beam with coupled acoustic black holes and local resonators, whereas the second part discusses multi-stable nonlinear oscillators in a 1D metamaterial chain.</description>

      <title>Modeling the amplitude and energy decay of a weakly damped harmonic oscillator using the energy dissipation rate and a simple trick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate how to derive the exponential decrease of amplitude and an excellent approximation of the energy decay of a weakly damped harmonic oscillator. This is achieved using a basic understanding of the undamped harmonic oscillator and the connection between the damping force's power and the energy dissipation rate. The trick is to add the energy dissipation rates corresponding to two specific pairs of initial conditions with the same initial energy. In this way, we obtain a first-order differential equation from which we quickly determine the time-dependent amplitude and the energies corresponding to each pair of considered initial conditions. Comparing the results of our model to the exact solutions and energies yielded an excellent agreement. The physical concepts and mathematical tools we utilize are familiar to first-year undergraduates.</description>

      <title>Relativistic theory of the viscosity of fluids across the entire energy spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shear viscosity is a fundamental transport property of matter. Surprisingly, there is no simple analytical theory for the viscosity of relativistic fluids that is able to recover the viscosity of non-relativistic gases as one of its analytical limits. Here we derive a general theory of the viscosity of gases based on the relativistic Langevin equation (deduced from a relativistic Lagrangian) and nonaffine linear response theory. The proposed relativistic theory is able to recover the viscosity of non-relativistic classical gases, with all its key dependencies on mass, temperature, particle diameter and Boltzmann constant, in the limit of Lorentz factor $\gamma=1$. It also unveils the relativistic enhancement of viscosity, which is a fundamental relativistic effect that has been overlooked so far. In the limit of ultrarelativistic fluids, the theory reproduces the cubic increase of viscosity with temperature in agreement with previous estimates for the QGP-type fluid.</description>
