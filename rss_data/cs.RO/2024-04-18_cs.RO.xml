      <title>Unifying Scene Representation and Hand-Eye Calibration with 3D Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representing the environment is a central challenge in robotics, and is essential for effective decision-making. Traditionally, before capturing images with a manipulator-mounted camera, users need to calibrate the camera using a specific external marker, such as a checkerboard or AprilTag. However, recent advances in computer vision have led to the development of \emph{3D foundation models}. These are large, pre-trained neural networks that can establish fast and accurate multi-view correspondences with very few images, even in the absence of rich visual features. This paper advocates for the integration of 3D foundation models into scene representation approaches for robotic systems equipped with manipulator-mounted RGB cameras. Specifically, we propose the Joint Calibration and Representation (JCR) method. JCR uses RGB images, captured by a manipulator-mounted camera, to simultaneously construct an environmental representation and calibrate the camera relative to the robot's end-effector, in the absence of specific calibration markers. The resulting 3D environment representation is aligned with the robot's coordinate frame and maintains physically accurate scales. We demonstrate that JCR can build effective scene representations using a low-cost RGB camera attached to a manipulator, without prior calibration.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Embodied Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embodied agents operating in complex and uncertain environments face considerable challenges. While some advanced agents handle complex manipulation tasks with proficiency, their success often hinges on extensive training data to develop their capabilities. In contrast, humans typically rely on recalling past experiences and analogous situations to solve new problems. Aiming to emulate this human approach in robotics, we introduce the Retrieval-Augmented Embodied Agent (RAEA). This innovative system equips robots with a form of shared memory, significantly enhancing their performance. Our approach integrates a policy retriever, allowing robots to access relevant strategies from an external policy memory bank based on multi-modal inputs. Additionally, a policy generator is employed to assimilate these strategies into the learning process, enabling robots to formulate effective responses to tasks. Extensive testing of RAEA in both simulated and real-world scenarios demonstrates its superior performance over traditional methods, representing a major leap forward in robotic technology.</description>

      <title>Continuous Dynamic Bipedal Jumping via Adaptive-model Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic and continuous jumping remains an open yet challenging problem in bipedal robot control. The choice of dynamic models in trajectory optimization (TO) problems plays a huge role in trajectory accuracy and computation efficiency, which normally cannot be ensured simultaneously. In this letter, we propose a novel adaptive-model optimization approach, a unified framework of Adaptive-model TO and Adaptive-frequency Model Predictive Control (MPC), to effectively realize continuous and robust jumping on HECTOR bipedal robot. The proposed Adaptive-model TO fuses adaptive-fidelity dynamics modeling of bipedal jumping motion for model fidelity necessities in different jumping phases to ensure trajectory accuracy and computation efficiency. In addition, conventional approaches have unsynchronized sampling frequencies in TO and real-time control, causing the framework to have mismatched modeling resolutions. We adapt MPC sampling frequency based on TO trajectory resolution in different phases for effective trajectory tracking. In hardware experiments, we have demonstrated robust and dynamic jumps covering a distance of up to 40 cm (57% of robot height). To verify the repeatability of this experiment, we run 53 jumping experiments and achieve 90% success rate. In continuous jumps, we demonstrate continuous bipedal jumping with terrain height perturbations (up to 5 cm) and discontinuities (up to 20 cm gap).</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning of Multi-robot Task Allocation for Multi-object Transportation with Infeasible Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-object transport using multi-robot systems has the potential for diverse practical applications such as delivery services owing to its efficient individual and scalable cooperative transport. However, allocating transportation tasks of objects with unknown weights remains challenging. Moreover, the presence of infeasible tasks (untransportable objects) can lead to robot stoppage (deadlock). This paper proposes a framework for dynamic task allocation that involves storing task experiences for each task in a scalable manner with respect to the number of robots. First, these experiences are broadcasted from the cloud server to the entire robot system. Subsequently, each robot learns the exclusion levels for each task based on those task experiences, enabling it to exclude infeasible tasks and reset its task priorities. Finally, individual transportation, cooperative transportation, and the temporary exclusion of tasks considered infeasible are achieved. The scalability and versatility of the proposed method were confirmed through numerical experiments with an increased number of robots and objects, including unlearned weight objects. The effectiveness of the temporary deadlock avoidance was also confirmed by introducing additional robots within an episode. The proposed method enables the implementation of task allocation strategies that are feasible for different numbers of robots and various transport tasks without prior consideration of feasibility.</description>

      <title>Terrain-Aware Stride-Level Trajectory Forecasting for a Powered Hip Exoskeleton via Vision and Kinematics Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Powered hip exoskeletons have shown the ability for locomotion assistance during treadmill walking. However, providing suitable assistance in real-world walking scenarios which involve changing terrain remains challenging. Recent research suggests that forecasting the lower limb joint's angles could provide target trajectories for exoskeletons and prostheses, and the performance could be improved with visual information. In this letter, We share a real-world dataset of 10 healthy subjects walking through five common types of terrain with stride-level label. We design a network called Sandwich Fusion Transformer for Image and Kinematics (SFTIK), which predicts the thigh angle of the ensuing stride given the terrain images at the beginning of the preceding and the ensuing stride and the IMU time series during the preceding stride. We introduce width-level patchify, tailored for egocentric terrain images, to reduce the computational demands. We demonstrate the proposed sandwich input and fusion mechanism could significantly improve the forecasting performance. Overall, the SFTIK outperforms baseline methods, achieving a computational efficiency of 3.31 G Flops, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.445 \textpm \ 0.804\textdegree \ and Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.971 \textpm\ 0.025. The results demonstrate that SFTIK could forecast the thigh's angle accurately with low computational cost, which could serve as a terrain adaptive trajectory planning method for hip exoskeletons.

      <title>S4TP: Social-Suitable and Safety-Sensitive Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In public roads, autonomous vehicles (AVs) face the challenge of frequent interactions with human-driven vehicles (HDVs), which render uncertain driving behavior due to varying social characteristics among humans. To effectively assess the risks prevailing in the vicinity of AVs in social interactive traffic scenarios and achieve safe autonomous driving, this article proposes a social-suitable and safety-sensitive trajectory planning (S4TP) framework. Specifically, S4TP integrates the Social-Aware Trajectory Prediction (SATP) and Social-Aware Driving Risk Field (SADRF) modules. SATP utilizes Transformers to effectively encode the driving scene and incorporates an AV's planned trajectory during the prediction decoding process. SADRF assesses the expected surrounding risk degrees during AVs-HDVs interactions, each with different social characteristics, visualized as two-dimensional heat maps centered on the AV. SADRF models the driving intentions of the surrounding HDVs and predicts trajectories based on the representation of vehicular interactions. S4TP employs an optimization-based approach for motion planning, utilizing the predicted HDVs'trajectories as input. With the integration of SADRF, S4TP executes real-time online optimization of the planned trajectory of AV within lowrisk regions, thus improving the safety and the interpretability of the planned trajectory. We have conducted comprehensive tests of the proposed method using the SMARTS simulator. Experimental results in complex social scenarios, such as unprotected left turn intersections, merging, cruising, and overtaking, validate the superiority of our proposed S4TP in terms of safety and rationality. S4TP achieves a pass rate of 100% across all scenarios, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods Fanta of 98.25% and Predictive-Decision of 94.75%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a cooperative inspection system designed to efficiently control and coordinate a team of distributed heterogeneous UAV agents for the inspection of 3D structures in cluttered, unknown spaces. Our proposed approach employs a two-stage innovative methodology. Initially, it leverages the complementary sensing capabilities of the robots to cooperatively map the unknown environment. It then generates optimized, collision-free inspection paths, thereby ensuring comprehensive coverage of the structure's surface area. The effectiveness of our system is demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative results from extensive Gazebo-based simulations that closely replicate real-world inspection scenarios, highlighting its ability to thoroughly inspect real-world-like 3D structures.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Vehicle Using Iterative Reward Prediction in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional trajectory planning methods for autonomous vehicles have several limitations. Heuristic and explicit simple rules make trajectory lack generality and complex motion. One of the approaches to resolve the above limitations of traditional trajectory planning methods is trajectory planning using reinforcement learning. However, reinforcement learning suffers from instability of learning and prior works of trajectory planning using reinforcement learning didn't consider the uncertainties. In this paper, we propose a trajectory planning method for autonomous vehicles using reinforcement learning. The proposed method includes iterative reward prediction method that stabilizes the learning process, and uncertainty propagation method that makes the reinforcement learning agent to be aware of the uncertainties. The proposed method is experimented in the CARLA simulator. Compared to the baseline method, we have reduced the collision rate by 60.17%, and increased the average reward to 30.82 times.</description>

      <title>Caging in Motion: Characterizing Robustness in Manipulation through Energy Margin and Dynamic Caging Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To develop robust manipulation policies, quantifying robustness is essential. Evaluating robustness in general dexterous manipulation, nonetheless, poses significant challenges due to complex hybrid dynamics, combinatorial explosion of possible contact interactions, global geometry, etc. This paper introduces ``caging in motion'', an approach for analyzing manipulation robustness through energy margins and caging-based analysis. Our method assesses manipulation robustness by measuring the energy margin to failure and extends traditional caging concepts for a global analysis of dynamic manipulation. This global analysis is facilitated by a kinodynamic planning framework that naturally integrates global geometry, contact changes, and robot compliance. We validate the effectiveness of our approach in the simulation and real-world experiments of multiple dynamic manipulation scenarios, highlighting its potential to predict manipulation success and robustness.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Dynamics Modeling and Trajectory Planning for a Cable-Trailer System with a Quadruped Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the utilization of dogs in sled-pulling for transportation, we introduce a cable-trailer system with a quadruped robot. The motion planning of the proposed robot system presents challenges arising from the nonholonomic constraints of the trailer, system underactuation, and hybrid interaction through the cable. To tackle these challenges, we develop a hybrid dynamics model that accounts for the cable's taut/slack status. Since it is computationally intense to directly optimize the trajectory, we first propose a search algorithm to compute a sub-optimal trajectory as the initial solution. Then, a novel collision avoidance constraint based on the geometric shapes of objects is proposed to formulate the trajectory optimization problem for the hybrid system. The proposed trajectory planning method is implemented on a Unitree A1 quadruped robot with a customized cable-trailer and validated through experiments.</description>

      <title>An Online Spatial-Temporal Graph Trajectory Planner for Autonomous Vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The autonomous driving industry is expected to grow by over 20 times in the coming decade and, thus, motivate researchers to delve into it. The primary focus of their research is to ensure safety, comfort, and efficiency. An autonomous vehicle has several modules responsible for one or more of the aforementioned items. Among these modules, the trajectory planner plays a pivotal role in the safety of the vehicle and the comfort of its passengers. The module is also responsible for respecting kinematic constraints and any applicable road constraints. In this paper, a novel online spatial-temporal graph trajectory planner is introduced to generate safe and comfortable trajectories. First, a spatial-temporal graph is constructed using the autonomous vehicle, its surrounding vehicles, and virtual nodes along the road with respect to the vehicle itself. Next, the graph is forwarded into a sequential network to obtain the desired states. To support the planner, a simple behavioral layer is also presented that determines kinematic constraints for the planner. Furthermore, a novel potential function is also proposed to train the network. Finally, the proposed planner is tested on three different complex driving tasks, and the performance is compared with two frequently used methods. The results show that the proposed planner generates safe and feasible trajectories while achieving similar or longer distances in the forward direction and comparable comfort ride.</description>

      <title>RISE: 3D Perception Makes Real-World Robot Imitation Simple and Effective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise robot manipulations require rich spatial information in imitation learning. Image-based policies model object positions from fixed cameras, which are sensitive to camera view changes. Policies utilizing 3D point clouds usually predict keyframes rather than continuous actions, posing difficulty in dynamic and contact-rich scenarios. To utilize 3D perception efficiently, we present RISE, an end-to-end baseline for real-world imitation learning, which predicts continuous actions directly from single-view point clouds. It compresses the point cloud to tokens with a sparse 3D encoder. After adding sparse positional encoding, the tokens are featurized using a transformer. Finally, the features are decoded into robot actions by a diffusion head. Trained with 50 demonstrations for each real-world task, RISE surpasses currently representative 2D and 3D policies by a large margin, showcasing significant advantages in both accuracy and efficiency. Experiments also demonstrate that RISE is more general and robust to environmental change compared with previous baselines. Project website: rise-policy.github.io.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-free control strategies such as reinforcement learning have shown the ability to learn control strategies without requiring an accurate model or simulator of the world. While this is appealing due to the lack of modeling requirements, such methods can be sample inefficient, making them impractical in many real-world domains. On the other hand, model-based control techniques leveraging accurate simulators can circumvent these challenges and use a large amount of cheap simulation data to learn controllers that can effectively transfer to the real world. The challenge with such model-based techniques is the requirement for an extremely accurate simulation, requiring both the specification of appropriate simulation assets and physical parameters. This requires considerable human effort to design for every environment being considered. In this work, we propose a learning system that can leverage a small amount of real-world data to autonomously refine a simulation model and then plan an accurate control strategy that can be deployed in the real world. Our approach critically relies on utilizing an initial (possibly inaccurate) simulator to design effective exploration policies that, when deployed in the real world, collect high-quality data. We demonstrate the efficacy of this paradigm in identifying articulation, mass, and other physical parameters in several challenging robotic manipulation tasks, and illustrate that only a small amount of real-world data can allow for effective sim-to-real transfer.

      <title>SPOT: Point Cloud Based Stereo Visual Place Recognition for Similar and Opposing Viewpoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recognizing places from an opposing viewpoint during a return trip is a common experience for human drivers. However, the analogous robotics capability, visual place recognition (VPR) with limited field of view cameras under 180 degree rotations, has proven to be challenging to achieve. To address this problem, this paper presents Same Place Opposing Trajectory (SPOT), a technique for opposing viewpoint VPR that relies exclusively on structure estimated through stereo visual odometry (VO). The method extends recent advances in lidar descriptors and utilizes a novel double (similar and opposing) distance matrix sequence matching method. We evaluate SPOT on a publicly available dataset with 6.7-7.6 km routes driven in similar and opposing directions under various lighting conditions. The proposed algorithm demonstrates remarkable improvement over the state-of-the-art, achieving up to 91.7% recall at 100% precision in opposing viewpoint cases, while requiring less storage than all baselines tested and running faster than all but one. Moreover, the proposed method assumes no a priori knowledge of whether the viewpoint is similar or opposing, and also demonstrates competitive performance in similar viewpoint cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-video models have demonstrated substantial potential in robotic decision-making, enabling the imagination of realistic plans of future actions as well as accurate environment simulation. However, one major issue in such models is generalization -- models are limited to synthesizing videos subject to language instructions similar to those seen at training time. This is heavily limiting in decision-making, where we seek a powerful world model to synthesize plans of unseen combinations of objects and actions in order to solve previously unseen tasks in new environments. To resolve this issue, we introduce RoboDreamer, an innovative approach for learning a compositional world model by factorizing the video generation. We leverage the natural compositionality of language to parse instructions into a set of lower-level primitives, which we condition a set of models on to generate videos. We illustrate how this factorization naturally enables compositional generalization, by allowing us to formulate a new natural language instruction as a combination of previously seen components. We further show how such a factorization enables us to add additional multimodal goals, allowing us to specify a video we wish to generate given both natural language instructions and a goal image. Our approach can successfully synthesize video plans on unseen goals in the RT-X, enables successful robot execution in simulation, and substantially outperforms monolithic baseline approaches to video generation.</description>

Abstract: Many settings in machine learning require the selection of a rotation representation. However, choosing a suitable representation from the many available options is challenging. This paper acts as a survey and guide through rotation representations. We walk through their properties that harm or benefit deep learning with gradient-based optimization. By consolidating insights from rotation-based learning, we provide a comprehensive overview of learning functions with rotation representations. We provide guidance on selecting representations based on whether rotations are in the model's input or output and whether the data primarily comprises small angles.</description>

      <title>Incremental Bootstrapping and Classification of Structured Scenes in a Fuzzy Ontology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We foresee robots that bootstrap knowledge representations and use them for classifying relevant situations and making decisions based on future observations. Particularly for assistive robots, the bootstrapping mechanism might be supervised by humans who should not repeat a training phase several times and should be able to refine the taught representation. We consider robots that bootstrap structured representations to classify some intelligible categories. Such a structure should be incrementally bootstrapped, i.e., without invalidating the identified category models when a new additional category is considered. To tackle this scenario, we presented the Scene Identification and Tagging (SIT) algorithm, which bootstraps structured knowledge representation in a crisp OWL-DL ontology. Over time, SIT bootstraps a graph representing scenes, sub-scenes and similar scenes. Then, SIT can classify new scenes within the bootstrapped graph through logic-based reasoning. However, SIT has issues with sensory data because its crisp implementation is not robust to perception noises. This paper presents a reformulation of SIT within the fuzzy domain, which exploits a fuzzy DL ontology to overcome the robustness issues. By comparing the performances of fuzzy and crisp implementations of SIT, we show that fuzzy SIT is robust, preserves the properties of its crisp formulation, and enhances the bootstrapped representations. On the contrary, the fuzzy implementation of SIT leads to less intelligible knowledge representations than the one bootstrapped in the crisp domain.</description>

      <title>Developing Situational Awareness for Joint Action with Autonomous Vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unanswered questions about how human-AV interaction designers can support rider's informational needs hinders Autonomous Vehicles (AV) adoption. To achieve joint human-AV action goals - such as safe transportation, trust, or learning from an AV - sufficient situational awareness must be held by the human, AV, and human-AV system collectively. We present a systems-level framework that integrates cognitive theories of joint action and situational awareness as a means to tailor communications that meet the criteria necessary for goal success. This framework is based on four components of the shared situation: AV traits, action goals, subject-specific traits and states, and the situated driving context. AV communications should be tailored to these factors and be sensitive when they change. This framework can be useful for understanding individual, shared, and distributed human-AV situational awareness and designing for future AV communications that meet the informational needs and goals of diverse groups and in diverse driving contexts.</description>

      <title>TempBEV: Improving Learned BEV Encoders with Combined Image and BEV Space Temporal Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving requires an accurate representation of the environment. A strategy toward high accuracy is to fuse data from several sensors. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders can achieve this by mapping data from individual sensors into one joint latent space. For cost-efficient camera-only systems, this provides an effective mechanism to fuse data from multiple cameras with different views. Accuracy can further be improved by aggregating sensor information over time. This is especially important in monocular camera systems to account for the lack of explicit depth and velocity measurements. Thereby, the effectiveness of developed BEV encoders crucially depends on the operators used to aggregate temporal information and on the used latent representation spaces. We analyze BEV encoders proposed in the literature and compare their effectiveness, quantifying the effects of aggregation operators and latent representations. While most existing approaches aggregate temporal information either in image or in BEV latent space, our analyses and performance comparisons suggest that these latent representations exhibit complementary strengths. Therefore, we develop a novel temporal BEV encoder, TempBEV, which integrates aggregated temporal information from both latent spaces. We consider subsequent image frames as stereo through time and leverage methods from optical flow estimation for temporal stereo encoding. Empirical evaluation on the NuScenes dataset shows a significant improvement by TempBEV over the baseline for 3D object detection and BEV segmentation. The ablation uncovers a strong synergy of joint temporal aggregation in the image and BEV latent space. These results indicate the overall effectiveness of our approach and make a strong case for aggregating temporal information in both image and BEV latent spaces.</description>

      <title>CelluloTactix: Towards Empowering Collaborative Online Learning through Tangible Haptic Interaction with Cellulo Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online learning has soared in popularity in the educational landscape of COVID-19 and carries the benefits of increased flexibility and access to far-away training resources. However, it also restricts communication between peers and teachers, limits physical interactions and confines learning to the computer screen and keyboard. In this project, we designed a novel way to engage students in collaborative online learning by using haptic-enabled tangible robots, Cellulo. We built a library which connects two robots remotely for a learning activity based around the structure of a biological cell. To discover how separate modes of haptic feedback might differentially affect collaboration, two modes of haptic force-feedback were implemented (haptic co-location and haptic consensus). With a case study, we found that the haptic co-location mode seemed to stimulate collectivist behaviour to a greater extent than the haptic consensus mode, which was associated with individualism and less interaction. While the haptic co-location mode seemed to encourage information pooling, participants using the haptic consensus mode tended to focus more on technical co-ordination. This work introduces a novel system that can provide interesting insights on how to integrate haptic feedback into collaborative remote learning activities in future.</description>

Abstract: Autonomous vessels have emerged as a prominent and accepted solution, particularly in the naval defence sector. However, achieving full autonomy for marine vessels demands the development of robust and reliable control and guidance systems that can handle various encounters with manned and unmanned vessels while operating effectively under diverse weather and sea conditions. A significant challenge in this pursuit is ensuring the autonomous vessels' compliance with the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs). These regulations present a formidable hurdle for the human-level understanding by autonomous systems as they were originally designed from common navigation practices created since the mid-19th century. Their ambiguous language assumes experienced sailors' interpretation and execution, and therefore demands a high-level (cognitive) understanding of language and agent intentions. These capabilities surpass the current state-of-the-art in intelligent systems. This position paper highlights the critical requirements for a trustworthy control and guidance system, exploring the complexity of adapting COLREGs for safe vessel-on-vessel encounters considering autonomous maritime technology competing and/or cooperating with manned vessels.</description>

      <title>Not All Voxels Are Equal: Hardness-Aware Semantic Scene Completion with Self-Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic scene completion, also known as semantic occupancy prediction, can provide dense geometric and semantic information for autonomous vehicles, which attracts the increasing attention of both academia and industry. Unfortunately, existing methods usually formulate this task as a voxel-wise classification problem and treat each voxel equally in 3D space during training. As the hard voxels have not been paid enough attention, the performance in some challenging regions is limited. The 3D dense space typically contains a large number of empty voxels, which are easy to learn but require amounts of computation due to handling all the voxels uniformly for the existing models. Furthermore, the voxels in the boundary region are more challenging to differentiate than those in the interior. In this paper, we propose HASSC approach to train the semantic scene completion model with hardness-aware design. The global hardness from the network optimization process is defined for dynamical hard voxel selection. Then, the local hardness with geometric anisotropy is adopted for voxel-wise refinement. Besides, self-distillation strategy is introduced to make training process stable and consistent. Extensive experiments show that our HASSC scheme can effectively promote the accuracy of the baseline model without incurring the extra inference cost.

Abstract: Underwater Unmanned Vehicles (UUVs) have to constantly compensate for the external disturbing forces acting on their body. Adaptive Control theory is commonly used there to grant the control law some flexibility in its response to process variation. Today, learning-based (LB) adaptive methods are leading the field where model-based control structures are combined with deep model-free learning algorithms. This work proposes experiments and metrics to empirically study the stability of such a controller. We perform this stability analysis on a LB adaptive control system whose adaptive parameters are determined using a Cross-Entropy Deep Learning method.</description>

Abstract: Accurate localization is fundamental for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to carry out precise tasks, such as manipulation and construction. Vision-based solutions using fiducial marker are promising, but extremely challenging underwater because of harsh lighting condition underwater. This paper introduces a gradient-based active camera exposure control method to tackle sharp lighting variations during image acquisition, which can establish better foundation for subsequent image enhancement procedures. Considering a typical scenario for underwater operations where visual tags are used, we proposed several experiments comparing our method with other state-of-the-art exposure control method including Active Exposure Control (AEC) and Gradient-based Exposure Control (GEC). Results show a significant improvement in the accuracy of robot localization. This method is an important component that can be used in visual-based state estimation pipeline to improve the overall localization accuracy.</description>

      <title>How to Benchmark Vision Foundation Models for Semantic Segmentation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent vision foundation models (VFMs) have demonstrated proficiency in various tasks but require supervised fine-tuning to perform the task of semantic segmentation effectively. Benchmarking their performance is essential for selecting current models and guiding future model developments for this task. The lack of a standardized benchmark complicates comparisons. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to study how VFMs should be benchmarked for semantic segmentation. To do so, various VFMs are fine-tuned under various settings, and the impact of individual settings on the performance ranking and training time is assessed. Based on the results, the recommendation is to fine-tune the ViT-B variants of VFMs with a 16x16 patch size and a linear decoder, as these settings are representative of using a larger model, more advanced decoder and smaller patch size, while reducing training time by more than 13 times. Using multiple datasets for training and evaluation is also recommended, as the performance ranking across datasets and domain shifts varies. Linear probing, a common practice for some VFMs, is not recommended, as it is not representative of end-to-end fine-tuning. The benchmarking setup recommended in this paper enables a performance analysis of VFMs for semantic segmentation. The findings of such an analysis reveal that pretraining with promptable segmentation is not beneficial, whereas masked image modeling (MIM) with abstract representations is crucial, even more important than the type of supervision used. The code for efficiently fine-tuning VFMs for semantic segmentation can be accessed through the project page at: https://tue-mps.github.io/benchmark-vfm-ss/.</description>

      <title>Inverse Neural Rendering for Explainable Multi-Object Tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Today, most methods for image understanding tasks rely on feed-forward neural networks. While this approach has allowed for empirical accuracy, efficiency, and task adaptation via fine-tuning, it also comes with fundamental disadvantages. Existing networks often struggle to generalize across different datasets, even on the same task. By design, these networks ultimately reason about high-dimensional scene features, which are challenging to analyze. This is true especially when attempting to predict 3D information based on 2D images. We propose to recast 3D multi-object tracking from RGB cameras as an \emph{Inverse Rendering (IR)} problem, by optimizing via a differentiable rendering pipeline over the latent space of pre-trained 3D object representations and retrieve the latents that best represent object instances in a given input image. To this end, we optimize an image loss over generative latent spaces that inherently disentangle shape and appearance properties. We investigate not only an alternate take on tracking but our method also enables examining the generated objects, reasoning about failure situations, and resolving ambiguous cases. We validate the generalization and scaling capabilities of our method by learning the generative prior exclusively from synthetic data and assessing camera-based 3D tracking on the nuScenes and Waymo datasets. Both these datasets are completely unseen to our method and do not require fine-tuning. Videos and code are available at https://light.princeton.edu/inverse-rendering-tracking/.</description>

      <title>Stay on Track: A Frenet Wrapper to Overcome Off-road Trajectories in Vehicle Motion Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the future motion of observed vehicles is a crucial enabler for safe autonomous driving. The field of motion prediction has seen large progress recently with state-of-the-Art (sotA) models achieving impressive results on large-scale public benchmarks. However, recent work revealed that learning-based methods are prone to predict off-road trajectories in challenging scenarios. These can be created by perturbing existing scenarios with additional turns in front of the target vehicle while the motion history is left unchanged. We argue that this indicates that SotA models do not consider the map information sufficiently and demonstrate how this can be solved by representing model inputs and outputs in a Frenet frame defined by lane centreline sequences. To this end, we present a general wrapper that leverages a Frenet representation of the scene, and that can be applied to SotA models without changing their architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in a comprehensive benchmark using two SotA motion prediction models. Our experiments show that this reduces the off-road rate on challenging scenarios by more than 90% without sacrificing average performance.</description>

Abstract: The robustness of SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithms under challenging environmental conditions is critical for the success of autonomous driving. However, the real-world impact of such conditions remains largely unexplored due to the difficulty of altering environmental parameters in a controlled manner. To address this, we introduce CARLA-Loc, a synthetic dataset designed for challenging and dynamic environments, created using the CARLA simulator. Our dataset integrates a variety of sensors, including cameras, event cameras, LiDAR, radar, and IMU, etc. with tuned parameters and modifications to ensure the realism of the generated data. CARLA-Loc comprises 7 maps and 42 sequences, each varying in dynamics and weather conditions. Additionally, a pipeline script is provided that allows users to generate custom sequences conveniently. We evaluated 5 visual-based and 4 LiDAR-based SLAM algorithms across different sequences, analyzing how various challenging environmental factors influence localization accuracy. Our findings demonstrate the utility of the CARLA-Loc dataset in validating the efficacy of SLAM algorithms under diverse conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robotic adaptation to unanticipated operating conditions is crucial to achieving persistence and robustness in complex real world settings. For a wide range of cutting-edge robotic systems, such as micro- and nano-scale robots, soft robots, medical robots, and bio-hybrid robots, it is infeasible to anticipate the operating environment a priori due to complexities that arise from numerous factors including imprecision in manufacturing, chemo-mechanical forces, and poorly understood contact mechanics. Drawing inspiration from data-driven modeling, geometric mechanics (or gauge theory), and adaptive control, we employ an adaptive system identification framework and demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing the performance of principally kinematic locomotors (those governed by Rayleigh dissipation or zero momentum conservation). We showcase the capability of the adaptive model to efficiently accommodate varying terrains and iteratively modified behaviors within a behavior optimization framework. This provides both the ability to improve fundamental behaviors and perform motion tracking to precision. Notably, we are capable of optimizing the gaits of the Purcell swimmer using approximately 10 cycles per link, which for the nine-link Purcell swimmer provides a factor of ten improvement in optimization speed over the state of the art. Beyond simply a computational speed up, this ten-fold improvement may enable this method to be successfully deployed for in-situ behavior refinement, injury recovery, and terrain adaptation, particularly in domains where simulations provide poor guides for the real world.</description>

Abstract: Solving Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) PDEs numerically enables equilibrial feedback control in two-player differential games, yet faces the curse of dimensionality (CoD). While physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise in alleviating CoD in solving PDEs, vanilla PINNs fall short in learning discontinuous solutions due to their sampling nature, leading to poor safety performance of the resulting policies when values are discontinuous due to state or temporal logic constraints. In this study, we explore three potential solutions to this challenge: (1) a hybrid learning method that is guided by both supervisory equilibria and the HJI PDE, (2) a value-hardening method where a sequence of HJIs are solved with increasing Lipschitz constant on the constraint violation penalty, and (3) the epigraphical technique that lifts the value to a higher dimensional state space where it becomes continuous. Evaluations through 5D and 9D vehicle and 13D drone simulations reveal that the hybrid method outperforms others in terms of generalization and safety performance by taking advantage of both the supervisory equilibrium values and costates, and the low cost of PINN loss gradients.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Algorithms Applied to Ship Trajectory Planning and Behavior Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01194</link>

Abstract: Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithms, notably used for nonholonomic vehicle navigation in complex environments, are often not thoroughly evaluated for their specific challenges. This paper presents a first such comparison study of the variants Potential-Quick RRT* (PQ-RRT*), Informed RRT* (IRRT*), RRT*, and RRT, in maritime single-query nonholonomic motion planning. Additionally, the practicalities of using these algorithms in maritime environments are discussed and outlined. We also contend that these algorithms are beneficial not only for trajectory planning in Collision Avoidance Systems (CAS) but also for CAS verification when used as vessel behavior generators.
  Optimal RRT variants tend to produce more distance-optimal paths but require more computational time due to complex tree wiring and nearest neighbor searches. Our findings, supported by Welch`s t-test at a significance level of Alpha = 0.05, indicate that PQ-RRT* slightly outperform IRRT* and RRT* in achieving shorter trajectory length but at the expense of higher tuning complexity and longer run-times. Based on the results, we argue that these RRT algorithms are better suited for smaller-scale problems or environments with low obstacle congestion ratio. This is attributed to the curse of dimensionality, and trade-off with available memory and computational resources.</description>

      <title>Low Frequency Sampling in Model Predictive Path Integral Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sampling-based model-predictive controllers have become a powerful optimization tool for planning and control problems in various challenging environments. In this paper, we show how the default choice of uncorrelated Gaussian distributions can be improved upon with the use of a colored noise distribution. Our choice of distribution allows for the emphasis on low frequency control signals, which can result in smoother and more exploratory samples. We use this frequency-based sampling distribution with Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) in both hardware and simulation experiments to show better or equal performance on systems with various speeds of input response.</description>

      <title>End-To-End Training and Testing Gamification Framework to Learn Human Highway Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current autonomous stack is well modularized and consists of perception, decision making and control in a handcrafted framework. With the advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and computing resources, researchers have been pushing the development of end-to-end AI for autonomous driving, at least in problems of small searching space such as in highway scenarios, and more and more photorealistic simulation will be critical for efficient learning. In this research, we propose a novel game-based end-to-end learning and testing framework for autonomous vehicle highway driving, by learning from human driving skills. Firstly, we utilize the popular game Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) to collect highway driving data with our proposed programmable labels. Then, an end-to-end architecture predicts the steering and throttle values that control the vehicle by the image of the game screen. The predicted control values are sent to the game via a virtual controller to keep the vehicle in lane and avoid collisions with other vehicles on the road. The proposed solution is validated in GTA V games, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of this end-to-end gamification framework for learning human driving skills.</description>

      <title>FlexMap Fusion: Georeferencing and Automated Conflation of HD Maps with OpenStreetMap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Today's software stacks for autonomous vehicles rely on HD maps to enable sufficient localization, accurate path planning, and reliable motion prediction. Recent developments have resulted in pipelines for the automated generation of HD maps to reduce manual efforts for creating and updating these HD maps. We present FlexMap Fusion, a methodology to automatically update and enhance existing HD vector maps using OpenStreetMap. Our approach is designed to enable the use of HD maps created from LiDAR and camera data within Autoware. The pipeline provides different functionalities: It provides the possibility to georeference both the point cloud map and the vector map using an RTK-corrected GNSS signal. Moreover, missing semantic attributes can be conflated from OpenStreetMap into the vector map. Differences between the HD map and OpenStreetMap are visualized for manual refinement by the user. In general, our findings indicate that our approach leads to reduced human labor during HD map generation, increases the scalability of the mapping pipeline, and improves the completeness and usability of the maps. The methodological choices may have resulted in limitations that arise especially at complex street structures, e.g., traffic islands. Therefore, more research is necessary to create efficient preprocessing algorithms and advancements in the dynamic adjustment of matching parameters. In order to build upon our work, our source code is available at https://github.com/TUMFTM/FlexMap_Fusion.</description>

      <title>AffordanceLLM: Grounding Affordance from Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Affordance grounding refers to the task of finding the area of an object with which one can interact. It is a fundamental but challenging task, as a successful solution requires the comprehensive understanding of a scene in multiple aspects including detection, localization, and recognition of objects with their parts, of geo-spatial configuration/layout of the scene, of 3D shapes and physics, as well as of the functionality and potential interaction of the objects and humans. Much of the knowledge is hidden and beyond the image content with the supervised labels from a limited training set. In this paper, we make an attempt to improve the generalization capability of the current affordance grounding by taking the advantage of the rich world, abstract, and human-object-interaction knowledge from pretrained large-scale vision language models. Under the AGD20K benchmark, our proposed model demonstrates a significant performance gain over the competing methods for in-the-wild object affordance grounding. We further demonstrate it can ground affordance for objects from random Internet images, even if both objects and actions are unseen during training.

      <title>Chance-Constrained Control for Safe Spacecraft Autonomy: Convex Programming Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a robust path-planning framework for safe spacecraft autonomy under uncertainty and develops a computationally tractable formulation based on convex programming. We utilize chance-constrained control to formulate the problem. It provides a mathematical framework to solve for a sequence of control policies that minimizes a probabilistic cost under probabilistic constraints with a user-defined confidence level (e.g., safety with 99.9% confidence). The framework enables the planner to directly control state distributions under operational uncertainties while ensuring the vehicle safety. This paper rigorously formulates the safe autonomy problem, gathers and extends techniques in literature to accommodate key cost/constraint functions that often arise in spacecraft path planning, and develops a tractable solution method. The presented framework is demonstrated via two representative numerical examples: safe autonomous rendezvous and orbit maintenance in cislunar space, both under uncertainties due to navigation error from Kalman filter, execution error via Gates model, and imperfect force models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of robots in their applications heavily depends on the quality of sensory input. However, designing sensor payloads and their parameters for specific robotic tasks is an expensive process that requires well-established sensor knowledge and extensive experiments with physical hardware. With cameras playing a pivotal role in robotic perception, we introduce a novel end-to-end optimization approach for co-designing a camera with specific robotic tasks by combining derivative-free and gradient-based optimizers. The proposed method leverages recent computer graphics techniques and physical camera characteristics to prototype the camera in software, simulate operational environments and tasks for robots, and optimize the camera design based on the desired tasks in a cost-effective way. We validate the accuracy of our camera simulation by comparing it with physical cameras, and demonstrate the design of cameras with stronger performance than common off-the-shelf alternatives. Our approach supports the optimization of both continuous and discrete camera parameters, manufacturing constraints, and can be generalized to a broad range of camera design scenarios including multiple cameras and unconventional cameras. This work advances the fully automated design of cameras for specific robotics tasks.</description>
