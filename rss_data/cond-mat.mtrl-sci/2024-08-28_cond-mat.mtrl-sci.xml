      <title>Effects of Mischmetal Composition and Cooling Rates on the Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of Al-(Ce, La, Nd) Eutectic Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the substitution of cerium (Ce) with mischmetal (MM) in cast Al-MM alloys, focusing on microstructure, hardness, tensile and compression properties, creep resistance, and coarsening resistance. Al-MM alloys with various MM compositions (Ce, Ce-50La, Ce-33La, and Ce-27La-19Nd, weight percent) exhibit near-eutectic and hyper-eutectic microstructures for Al-9MM and Al-12MM compositions, respectively, with similar as-cast hardness (~525 MPa). All Al-9MM alloys show tensile yield stress ~55 MPa, ultimate tensile strength ~130 MPa, and fracture strain ~8%.The microstructural and mechanical properties consistency demonstrates the flexibility of MM compositions in Al-MM alloys. Al-9MM exhibits excellent coarsening resistance, with minimal hardness reduction when exposed to 300 and 350 C for up to 11 weeks, and a modest ~15% hardness reduction at 400 C for 8 weeks, outperforming eutectic Al-12.6Si and Al-6.4Ni alloys. Additionally, Al-9MM shows higher creep resistance at 300 C compared to most precipitate-strengthened Al-Sc-Zr and solid-solution-strengthened Al-Mg/Mn alloys, but is outperformed by eutectic-strengthened Al-6.4Ni and Al-10Ce-5Ni alloys.The effect of casting cooling rate is investigated through wedge casting: Al-9Ce transitions from hypo- to hyper-eutectic as cooling rates decrease, while Al-12Ce consistently shows hyper-eutectic microstructures. Al11Ce3 lamellae become finer and more closely spaced with increasing cooling rates. Al-9Ce maintains steady hardness at high to moderate cooling rates but shows reduced hardness at lower rates, whereas Al-12Ce shows no change in hardness.With a 15% reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions, Al-Ce alloys where Ce is replaced with MM offer comparable mechanical properties and enhanced environmental benefits, highlighting the potential of MM as a sustainable alternative.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Becker-Kistiakowsky-Wilson equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jones-Wilkins-Lee (JWL) equation of state (EOS) is the most popular equation of state used in hydrocodes to model detonation products thermodynamics resulting from high explosives. However, the JWL EOS presents several major difficulties. Namely, its range of validity and convexity is limited as its parameters are adjusted on a given reference curve. When used in conditions where the thermodynamic state varies significantly, computational failure may happen. It occurs frequently in multiphase flow computations when heat and mass transfers with other phases are present, as the resulting thermodynamic state is far from the reference curve used for adjustment. Moreover, the detonation products composition is absent in the JWL formulation. This is another important limitation when additional physics are involved, such as post-combustion, phase transition, or when dealing with non-ideal explosives. In this work, the Becker-Kistiakowsky-Wilson (BKW) EOS is considered instead. The BKW EOS is widely used in thermochemical codes, as parent EOS to provide the reference data used to fit JWL EOS parameters. The BKW EOS present several advantages. Its formulation considers variable gas species in the detonation products. No specific adjustment is needed for a given explosive, and only the detonation products composition requires computational efforts. Its range of validity is large, as the various parameters have been adjusted for each gas species separately. However, the BKW EOS also present difficulties which limit its application in hydrocodes. These difficulties are the aim of the present work. The BKW EOS is currently restricted to thermochemical codes as its mathematical formulation is computationally expensive. It also requires the gas chemical composition to be computed via an appropriate chemical equilibrium solver. In the present work, the computational cost of the BKW EOS is reduced thanks to the thermodynamic relaxation method of Neron et al. (2023). The variable composition of the detonation products is accounted for through specific relaxation terms computed once, with the help of conventional thermochemical codes. The condensed species, such as solid carbon, are modelled with the Cochran-Chan (CC) EOS, having a simpler thermodynamic formulation and being thermodynamically consistent compared to usual EOSs used for condensed species. This multiphase formulation made of BKW gas mixture with variable composition and condensed phases is considered in temperature and pressure equilibrium. It is embedded in a multiphase flow formulation, with the help of the thermodynamic relaxation method mentioned above. It shows comparable computational cost as the JWL formulation, with significantly enhanced physics capabilities and improved robustness.</description>

      <title>A Reassessment of 5f Occupation in Plutonium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A detailed spectroscopic simulation of the original Pu N4,5 and O4,5 X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) has been performed. Additionally, a fundamental flaw in the Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) measurement has been corrected. Thus, the determination of the 5f occupation (n) in elemental Pu has been re-evaluated with the result that n = 5.0 +/- 0.1 for alphaPu and n = 4.9 +/- 0.2 for deltaPu. These values are significantly lower than the value of ~5.5 that was propagated earlier.</description>

      <title>Stability of Wigner crystals and Mott insulators in twisted moir\'e structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) constitute an intriguing platform for studying charge-ordered states including conventional and generalized Wigner crystals as well as Mott insulating states. In this work, we combine a phonon mode expansion of the electronic crystal vibrations with the Lindemann criterion to investigate the quantum and thermal stability of these strongly correlated phases in the exemplary materials of MoSe$_2$ monolayers and twisted MoSe$_2$-WSe$_2$ heterostructures. We find that the moir\'e potential in heterobilayers acts as a harmonic trap, flattening the energy dispersion of phonon excitations and resulting in an order of magnitude larger melting temperatures compared to monolayer Wigner crystals. Furthermore, we explore the tunability of the correlated states with respect to dielectric environment and bilayer stacking. In particular, we show that the reduced screening in free-standing TMDs results in a tenfold increase in the melting temperature compared to hBN-encapsulated TMDs. Moreover, the deeper moir\'e potential in R-type stacked heterostructures makes generalized Wigner crystals more stable than in H-type stacking. Overall, our study provides important microscopic insights on the stability and tunability of charge-ordered states in TMD-based structures.</description>

      <title>Universal MJ Spintronic Model: Navigating a Serendipitous Expedition in the Quantum World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a pair of novel universal MJ spintronic models that precisely mirror the complex spin textures observed in materials. The spin-orbit coupled (SOC) Hamiltonians $\mathcal{H}_{MJ1}$ and $\mathcal{H}_{MJ2}$ reveal a range of novel and intriguing spin phenomena by modulating spin-orbit interactions. These Hamiltonians exemplify two distinct spin textures: $\mathcal{H}_{MJ1}$ distinguishes between unidirectional momentum-independent persistent spin texture (PST) and bidirectional partial PST while $\mathcal{H}_{MJ2}$ portrays a spiral spin texture that can be conceptually tied to the expansion/contraction of the quantum universe in a two-dimensional plane. We also explore the fundamental aspects of earlier analytical models that underpin the construction of the present MJ spintronic model. The physical interpretation of these models is illustrated graphically and the emerging spin phenomena resulting from complex SOC are elucidated using a simple vector model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational modeling is an integral part of catalysis research. With it, new methodologies are being developed and implemented to improve the accuracy of simulations while reducing the computational cost. In particular, specific machine-learning techniques have been applied to build interatomic potential from ab initio results. Here, We report an energy-free machine-learning calculator that combines three individually trained neural networks to predict the energy and atomic forces of particulate matter. Three structures were investigated: a monometallic nanoparticle, a bimetallic nanoalloy, and a supported metal crystallites. Atomic energies were predicted via a graph neural network, leading to a mean absolute error (MAE) within 0.004 eV from Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The task of predicting atomic forces was split over two feedforward networks, one predicting the force's norm and another its direction. The force prediction resulted in a MAE within 0.080 eV/A against DFT results. The interpretability of the graph neural network predictions was demonstrated by underlying the physics of the monometallic particle in the form of cohesion energy.</description>

      <title>Optically Resolved Exchange Splittings in the Doped Van der Waals Ferromagnet CrBr3:Yb3+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chromium-trihalides (CrX3; X = Cl, Br, I) have long served as model systems for understanding magnetism and magneto-optics in ionic crystals, and they have recently also emerged as archetypes of magnetic two-dimensional (2D) Van der Waals materials. Although the physical properties of CrX3 compounds have now been explored in great depth, the use of impurity doping to generate new properties remains surprisingly underexplored. Here we report on the magnetic and magneto-optical properties of lanthanide-doped CrBr3, in which Yb3+ is introduced as a spin-bearing optical point defect. Narrow-line near-infrared dopant photoluminescence is efficiently sensitized by CrBr3-to-Yb3+ energy transfer. Magneto-optical measurements show facile spin manipulation of the paramagnetic Yb3+ impurities by the surrounding CrBr3 lattice. Photoluminescence data reveal that the Kramers spin degeneracies of the ground- and excited-state Yb3+ doublets are spontaneously lifted by strong magnetic exchange with neighboring Cr3+ ions, such that individual Yb3+ spin transitions are easily resolved even at zero external magnetic field. The temperature and field dependence of these splittings can be used to probe both local and long-range spin correlations. These results highlight the use of extrinsic optical impurities to add new spin-photonic functionality to this classic 2D Van der Waals magnet.</description>

      <title>Kinetic and Equilibrium Shapes of Cylindrical Grain Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the shape evolution of rotated, embedded, initially cylindrical grains (with [001] cylinder axis) in Ni under an applied synthetic driving force via molecular dynamics simulations and a continuum, disconnection-based grain boundary migration model. For some initial misorientations, the expanding grains form well-defined, faceted shapes, while for others the shapes remain cylindrical. The embedded grains tend to rotate during grain boundary migration, with the direction of rotation dependent on initial misorientation and direction of growth (expand/shrink). The kinetic shapes, which are bounded by low mobility grain boundary planes, differ from equilibrium shapes (bounded by low energy grain boundaries). The multi-mode disconnection model-based predictions are consistent with the molecular dynamics results for faceting tendency, kinetic grain shape, and grain rotation as a function of misorientation and whether the grains are expanding or contracting. This demonstrates that grain boundary migration and associated grain rotation are mediated by disconnection flow along grain boundaries.</description>

      <title>Polarized Neutron Measurements of the Internal Magnetization of a Ferrimagnet Across its Compensation Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first polarized neutron transmission image of a model Ne\'el ferrimagnetic material, polycrystalline terbium iron garnet (Tb$_{3}$Fe$_{5}$O$_{12}$, TbIG for short), as it is taken through its compensation temperature $T_{comp}$ where, according to the theory of ferrimagnetism, the internal magnetization should vanish. Our polarized neutron imaging data and the additional supporting measurements using neutron spin echo spectroscopy and SQUID magnetometry are all consistent with a vanishing internal magnetization at $T_{comp}$.</description>

      <title>Electron ptychography reveals a ferroelectricity dominated by anion displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sodium niobate, a lead-free ferroic material, hosts delicately-balanced, competing order parameters, including ferroelectric states that can be stabilized by epitaxial strain. Here, we show that the resulting macroscopic ferroelectricity exhibits an unconventional microscopic structure using multislice electron ptychography. This technique overcomes multiple scattering artifacts limiting conventional electron microscopy, enabling both lateral spatial resolution beyond the diffraction limit and recovery of three-dimensional structural information. These imaging capabilities allow us to separate the ferroelectric interior of the sample from the relaxed surface structure and identify the soft phonon mode and related structural distortions with picometer precision. Unlike conventional ferroelectric perovskites, we find that the polar distortion in this material involves minimal distortions of the cation sublattices and is instead dominated by anion displacements. We establish limits on film thickness for interfacial octahedral rotation engineering and directly visualize an incommensurate octahedral rotation pattern, arising from the flat dispersion of the associated phonon mode.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure and Topology in Gulf-edged Zigzag Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With advanced synthetic techniques, a wide variety of well-defined graphene nano-ribbons (GNRs) can be produced with atomic precision. Hence, finding the relation between their structures and properties becomes important for the rational design of GNRs. In this work, we explore the complete chemical space of gulf-edged zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNR-Gs), a subclass of zigzag GNRs in which the zigzag edges miss carbon atoms in a regular sequence. We demonstrate that the electronic properties of ZGNR-Gs depend on four structural parameters: ribbon width, gulf edge size, unit length, and gulf offset. Using tight-binding calculations and the Hubbard model, we find that all ZGNR-Gs are semiconductors with varying band gaps; there are no metals in this class of materials. Notably, when spin polarization is considered, most ZGNR-Gs exhibit antiferromagnetic behavior, with the spin moments and spin-induced band gap opening being stabilized by longer zigzag segments at the edges. Furthermore, we provide simple empirical rules that describe the Z2 topological invariant based on the aforementioned structural parameters. By analyzing the full chemical space of ZGNR-Gs, we offer insights into the design of GNRs with desired electronic, magnetic, and topological properties for nanoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Targetin the partition function of chemically disordered materials with a generative approach based on inverse variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing atomic-scale properties of chemically disordered materials requires an efficient exploration of their vast configuration space. Traditional approaches such as Monte Carlo or Special Quasirandom Structures either entail sampling an excessive amount of configurations or do not ensure that the configuration space has been properly covered. In this work, we propose a novel approach where generative machine learning is used to yield a representative set of configurations for accurate property evaluation and provide accurate estimations of atomic-scale properties with minimal computational cost. Our method employs a specific type of variational autoencoder with inverse roles for the encoder and decoder, enabling the application of an unsupervised active learning scheme that does not require any initial training database. The model iteratively generates configuration batches, whose properties are computed with conventional atomic-scale methods. These results are then fed back into the model to estimate the partition function, repeating the process until convergence. We illustrate our approach by computing point-defect formation energies and concentrations in (U, Pu)O2 mixed-oxide fuels. In addition, the ML model provides valuable insights into the physical factors influencing the target property. Our method is generally applicable to explore other properties, such as atomic-scale diffusion coefficients, in ideally or non-ideally disordered materials like high-entropy alloys.</description>

      <title>Multi-channel machine learning based nonlocal kinetic energy density functional for semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing an accurate kinetic energy density functional (KEDF) remains a major challenge in the field of orbital-free density functional theory. We propose a multi-channel machine learning based physical-constrained nonlocal (CPN) KEDF and implement it within the ABACUS package. The CPN KEDF extends the previously proposed MPN KEDF [Phys. Rev. B 109, 115135 (2024)] to semiconductor systems by integrating information collected from multiple channels, with each channel features specific length scale in real space. The CPN KEDF is systematically tested on semiconductors, including silicon and binary semiconductors. Our findings indicate that the multi-channel architecture is beneficial for machine-learning-based models in capturing the characteristics of semiconductors, particularly in handling covalent bonds. In particular, the CPN5 KEDF, which utilizes five channels, demonstrates excellent accuracy across all tested systems. These results shed new light on designing transferable machine-learning-based KEDF for semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Resolving the pressure induced 'self-insertion' in skutterudite CoSb3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CoSb3, a skutterudite compound, is key in studying thermoelectric materials. Under compression, it undergoes a 'self-insertion' isostructural transition, redistributing large Sb atoms among crystallographic sites. We investigated CoSb3's structural stability up to 70 GPa using single crystal X-ray diffraction and high-resolution X-ray scattering, including Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging. We examined the material in three pressure transmitting media (PTMs), exploring how PTMs and nonhydrostatic stresses affect CoSb3. Notably, the 'self-insertion' transition may reduce or even make compressibility negative. Additionally, we report a previously unknown phase transformation from cubic Im-3 to trigonal R-3 above 40 GPa and discuss the phases' distinctive behaviors.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the reactivity of Si(100)-Cl toward PBr3 by charging Si dangling bonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of the PBr3 molecule with Si dangling bonds (DBs) on a chlorinated Si(100) surface was studied. The DBs were charged in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and then exposed to PBr3 directly in the STM chamber. Uncharged DBs rarely react with molecules. On the contrary, almost all positively charged DBs were filled with molecule fragments. As a result of the PBr3 interaction with the positively charged DB, the molecule dissociated into PBr2 and Br with the formation of a Si-Br bond and PBr2 desorption. These findings show that charged DBs significantly modify the reactivity of the surface towards PBr3. Additionally, we calculated PH3 adsorption on a Si(100)-2x1-H surface with DBs and found that the DB charge also has a significant impact. As a result, we demonstrated that the positively charged DB with a doubly unoccupied state enhances the adsorption of molecules with a lone pair of electrons.</description>

      <title>Silver electrodes are highly selective for CO in CO$_2$ electroreduction due to interplay between voltage dependent kinetics and thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrochemical reduction is a promising way to make use of CO$_2$ as feedstock for generating renewable fuel and valuable chemicals. Several metals can be used in the electrocatalyst to generate CO and formic acid but hydrogen formation is an unwanted side reaction that can even be dominant. The lack of selectivity is in general a significant problem, but silver-based electrocatalysts have been shown to be highly selective for CO with over over 90% faradaic efficiency when the applied voltage is below -1 V vs. RHE. Hydrogen formation is then insignificant and little formate is formed even though it is thermodynamically favored. We present calculations of the activation free energy for the various elementary steps as a function of applied voltage at the three low index facets, Ag(111), Ag(100) and Ag(110), as well as experimental measurements on polycrystalline electrodes, to identify the reason for this high selectivity. The formation of formic acid is suppressed because of the low coverage of adsorbed hydrogen and kinetic hindrance to the formation of the HCOO* intermediate, while *COOH, a key intermediate in CO formation, is thermodynamically unstable until the applied voltage reaches -1 V vs. RHE, at which point the kinetics for its formation are more favorable than for hydrogen. The calculated results are consistent with experimental measurements carried out for acidic conditions and provide an atomic scale insight into the high CO selectivity of silver-based electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Stochastic Discrete Dislocation Dynamics in Ductile Vs Brittle Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects are inevitable during the manufacturing processes of materials. Presence of these defects and their dynamics significantly influence the responses of materials. A thorough understanding of dislocation dynamics of different types of materials under various conditions is essential for analyzing the performance of the materials. Ductility of a material is directly related with the movement and rearrangement of dislocations under applied load. In this work, we look into the dynamics of dislocations in ductile and brittle materials using simplified two dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics (2D-DDD) simulation. We consider Aluminium (Al) and Tungsten (W) as representative examples of ductile and brittle materials respectively. We study the velocity distribution, strain field, dislocation count, and junction formation during interactions of the dislocations within the domain. Furthermore, we study the probability densities of dislocation motion for both materials. In mesoscale, moving dislocations can be considered as particle diffusionm, which are often stochastic and super-diffusive. Classical diffusion models fail to account for these phenomena and the long-range interactions of dislocations. Therefore, we propose the nonlocal transport model for the probability density and obtained the parameters of nonlocal operators using a machine learning framework.</description>

Abstract: A comprehensive study of methods of maximizing Q for slow-wave coplanar waveguides is described. In addition to the widths of the signal conductor and coplanar ground lines and the distance between them, the length, spacing and stacking of the metal layers of the substrate shield strips are also shown to be critical in maximizing performance. Measured results from more than 50 different devices show that a 7X increase in the quality factor (e.g., Q &gt; 70 at 24 GHz in 0.18 {\mu}m CMOS) is achievable using the optimum topology with optimum dimensions.</description>

      <title>Multi-Task Multi-Fidelity Learning of Properties for Energetic Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data science and artificial intelligence are playing an increasingly important role in the physical sciences. Unfortunately, in the field of energetic materials data scarcity limits the accuracy and even applicability of ML tools. To address data limitations, we compiled multi-modal data: both experimental and computational results for several properties. We find that multi-task neural networks can learn from multi-modal data and outperform single-task models trained for specific properties. As expected, the improvement is more significant for data-scarce properties. These models are trained using descriptors built from simple molecular information and can be readily applied for large-scale materials screening to explore multiple properties simultaneously. This approach is widely applicable to fields outside energetic materials.</description>

      <title>Superconducting flip-chip devices using indium microspheres on Au-passivated Nb or NbN as under-bump metallization layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting flip-chip interconnects are crucial for the three-dimensional integration of superconducting circuits in sensing and quantum technology applications. We demonstrate a simplified approach for a superconducting flip chip using commercially available indium microspheres and an in-house-built transfer stage for bonding two chips patterned with superconducting thin films. We use a gold-passivated niobium or niobium nitride layer as an under-bump metallization (UBM) layer between an aluminum-based superconducting layer and the indium interconnect. At millikelvin temperatures, our flip-chip assembly can transport a supercurrent with tens of milliamperes, limited by the smallest geometric feature size and critical current density of the UBM layer. We also show that the indium interconnect itself can carry a supercurrent exceeding 1\,A. Our flip-chip assembly does not require patterning and electroplating of indium, nor does it need a flip-chip bonder. Thus, the presented flip-chip devices can be utilized in applications that require few superconducting interconnects carrying large currents at millikelvin temperatures.</description>

      <title>On-Chip Learning with Memristor-Based Neural Networks: Assessing Accuracy and Efficiency Under Device Variations, Conductance Errors, and Input Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a memristor-based compute-in-memory hardware accelerator for on-chip training and inference, focusing on its accuracy and efficiency against device variations, conductance errors, and input noise. Utilizing realistic SPICE models of commercially available silver-based metal self-directed channel (M-SDC) memristors, the study incorporates inherent device non-idealities into the circuit simulations. The hardware, consisting of 30 memristors and 4 neurons, utilizes three different M-SDC structures with tungsten, chromium, and carbon media to perform binary image classification tasks. An on-chip training algorithm precisely tunes memristor conductance to achieve target weights. Results show that incorporating moderate noise (&lt;15%) during training enhances robustness to device variations and noisy input data, achieving up to 97% accuracy despite conductance variations and input noises. The network tolerates a 10% conductance error without significant accuracy loss. Notably, omitting the initial memristor reset pulse during training considerably reduces training time and energy consumption. The hardware designed with chromium-based memristors exhibits superior performance, achieving a training time of 2.4 seconds and an energy consumption of 18.9 mJ. This research provides insights for developing robust and energy-efficient memristor-based neural networks for on-chip learning in edge applications.</description>

      <title>Nonvolatile magneto-thermal switching driven by vortex trapping in commercial In-Sn solder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magneto-thermal switching (MTS) is a key technology for efficient thermal management. Recently, large MTS with nonvolatility has been observed in Sn-Pb solders [H. Arima et al., Commun. Mater. 5, 34 (2024)] where phase separation, different superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of Sn and Pb, and magnetic-flux trapping are the causes of the nonvolatile MTS. To further understand the mechanism and to obtain the strategy for enhancing switching ratio, exploration of new phase-separated superconductors with nonvolatile MTS is needed. Here, we show that the In52-Sn48 commercial solder is a phase-separated superconducting composite with two Tc and traps vortices after field cooling. A clear signature of nonvolatile MTS was observed at T = 2.5 K. From specific heat analyses, we conclude that the vortices are mainly trapped in the lower-Tc phase ({\gamma}-phase) after field cooling, which is the evidence that vortex trapping also works on achieving nonvolatile MTS in phase-separated superconducting composites.</description>

      <title>High fidelity TiN processing modes for multi-gate Ge-based quantum devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge or spin-qubits can be realized by using gate-defined quantum dots (QDs) in semiconductors in a similar fashion to the processes used in CMOS for conventional field-effect transistors or more recent fin FET technology. However, to realize larger number of gate-defined qubits, multiples of gates with ultimately high resolution and fidelity is required. Electron beam lithography (EBL) offers flexible and tunable patterning of gate-defined spin-qubit devices for studying important quantum phenomena. While such devices are commonly realized by a positive resist process using metal lift-off, there are several clear limitations related to the resolution and the fidelity of patterning. Herein, we report a systematic study of an alternative TiN multi-gates definition approach based on the highest resolution hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) EBL resist and all associated processing modes. The TiN gate arrays formed show excellent fidelity, dimensions down to 15 nm, various densities, and complexities. The processing modes developed were used to demonstrate applicability of this approach to forming multi-gate architectures for two types of spin-qubit devices prototypic to i) NW/fin-type FETs and ii) planar quantum well-type devices, both utilizing epi-grown Ge device layers on Si, where GeSn or Ge are the host materials for the QDs.</description>

Abstract: Designing and fabricating structures with specific mechanical properties requires understanding the intricate relationship between design parameters and performance. Understanding the design-performance relationship becomes increasingly complicated for nonlinear deformations. Though successful at modeling elastic deformations, simulation-based techniques struggle to model large elastoplastic deformations exhibiting plasticity and densification. We propose a neural network trained on experimental data to learn the design-performance relationship between 3D-printable shells and their compressive force-displacement behavior. Trained on thousands of physical experiments, our network aids in both forward and inverse design to generate shells exhibiting desired elastoplastic and hyperelastic deformations. We validate a subset of generated designs through fabrication and testing. Furthermore, we demonstrate the network's inverse design efficacy in generating custom shells for several applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) often neglect long-range interactions, such as electrostatic and dispersion forces. In this work, we introduce a straightforward and efficient method to account for long-range interactions by learning a latent variable from local atomic descriptors and applying an Ewald summation to this variable. We demonstrate that in systems including charged, polar, or apolar molecular dimers, bulk water, and water-vapor interface, standard short-ranged MLIPs can lead to unphysical predictions even when employing message passing. The long-range models effectively eliminate these artifacts, with only about twice the computational cost of short-range MLIPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well recognized that interpreting transport experiment results can be challenging when the samples being measured are spatially nonuniform. However, quantitative understanding on the differences between measured and actual transport coefficients, especially the Hall effects, in inhomogeneous systems is lacking. In this work we use homogenization theory to find exact bounds of the measured or homogenized anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) in inhomogeneous conductors under minimal assumptions. In particular, we prove that the homogenized AHC cannot exceed the bounds of the local AHC. However, in common experimental setups, anomalies that appear to violate the above bounds can occur, with a popular example being the "humps" or "dips" of the Hall hysteresis curves usually ascribed to the topological Hall effect (THE). We give two examples showing how such apparent anomalies could be caused by different types of inhomogeneities and discuss their relevance in experiments.</description>

      <title>Effect of chemical short-range order and percolation on passivation in binary alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a percolation model for face centered cubic binary alloys with chemical short-range order (SRO) to account for chemical ordering/clustering that occurs in nominally random solid solutions. We employ a lattice generation scheme that directly utilizes the first nearest neighbor Warren-Cowley SRO parameter to generate the lattice. We quantify the effects of SRO on the first nearest neighbor three-dimensional (3D) site percolation threshold using the large cell Monte Carlo renormalization group method and find that the 3D site percolation threshold is a function of the SRO parameter. We analyze the effects of SRO on the distribution of the total number of distinct clusters in the percolated structures and find that short-ranged clustering promotes the formation of a dominant spanning cluster. Furthermore, we find that the scaling exponents of percolation are independent of SRO. We also examine the effects of SRO on the 2D-3D percolation crossover and find that the thickness of the thin film for percolation crossover is a function of the SRO parameter. We combine these results to develop a percolation crossover model to understand the electrochemical passivation behavior in binary alloys. The percolation crossover model provides a theoretical framework to understand the critical composition of passivating elements for protective oxide formation.

      <title>Real time observation of oxygen diffusion in CGO thin films using spatially resolved Isotope Exchange Raman Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exploitation of advanced materials for novel energy, health and computing applications requires fundamental understanding of enabling physicochemical mechanisms, including ionic and electronic conductivity, defect formation processes and reaction kinetics. Therefore, access to underlying constants of functional materials via advanced but straightforward experimental techniques is key. We present a novel, cheap and widely applicable approach to analyze oxygen-tracer-diffusion in thin films with unprecedented time resolution based on the novel in situ isotope-exchange Raman spectroscopy (IERS) methodology. Raman spectroscopy is sensitive to changes in the local isotopic composition, manifested by a frequency shift of the oxygen Raman modes. Employing a Raman transparent capping layer allows to establish an in-plane tracer gradient and follow the isotope exchange and diffusion processes via consecutive spatial and time resolved in situ Raman line scans. Mass-transport coefficients are calculated from these isotopic gradients, similar to conventional techniques, but with an additional time-component, not accessible by other techniques. Here, we study gadolinium doped ceria (CGO) thin films, capped with Si3N4 or Al2O3. We report diffusion coefficients within the temperature range of interest for intermediate temperature emerging applications (300-500{\deg}C) and confirm the validity of the measurement procedure and extracted parameters by comparison with FEM simulations and literature results.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism: Exploring New Frontiers in Magnetism and Spintronics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments have introduced a groundbreaking form of collinear magnetism known as "altermagnetism". This emerging magnetic phase is characterized by robust time-reversal symmetry breaking, antiparallel magnetic order, and alternating spin-splitting band structures, yet it exhibits vanishing net magnetization constrained by symmetry. Altermagnetism uniquely integrates traits previously considered mutually exclusive to conventional collinear ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, thereby facilitating phenomena and functionalities previously not achievable within these traditional categories of magnetism. Initially proposed theoretically, the existence of the altermagnetic phase has since been corroborated by a range of experimental studies, which have confirmed its unique properties and potential for applications. This review explores the rapidly expanding research on altermagnets, emphasizing the novel physical phenomena they manifest, methodologies for inducing altermagnetism, and promising altermagnetic materials. The goal of this review is to furnish readers with a comprehensive overview of altermagnetism and to inspire further innovative studies on altermagnetic materials which could potentially revolutionize applications in technology and materials science.</description>

      <title>Vacancy-induced pseudo-gap formation in antiferromagnetic Cr$_{0.86}$ZnSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural defects are important for both solid-state chemistry and physics, as they can have a significant impact on chemical stability and physical properties. Here, we identify a vacancyinduced pseudo-gap formation in antiferromagnetic Cr$_{0.86}$ZnSb. Cr$_{1-x}$ZnSb alloys were studied combining efforts of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental methods to elucidate the effect of vacancies. Detailed analyses (X-ray powder and single crystal diffraction, transmission and secondary scanning electron microscopy) of Cr$_{1-x}$ZnSb, $0&lt;x&lt;0.20$, prompts Cr$_{0.86}$ZnSb as the only stable compound, crystallizing with the MnAlGe-type structure. From DFT calculations, an antiferromagnetic spin configuration of Cr local magnetic moments was found to be favorable for both, the perfectly stoichiometric compound CrZnSb, as well as for Cr$_{0.875}$ZnSb. Magnetic order is observed experimentally for Cr$_{0.86}$ZnSb by temperature- and field-dependent magnetization measurements, revealing a magnetic phase transition near 220 K, which is corroborated by zero-field muon spin relaxation studies. Thermoelectric transport properties exhibit distinct maxima in the temperature-dependent Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity at around 190 K. Analyzing the measured data on the basis of a triple parabolic band model and DFT simulations, their characteristic features are traced back to a pseudo-gap in the electronic structure arising from a particular vacancy arrangement. These findings offer valuable insights into the role of vacancies in defected materials, contributing to the broader understanding of structural defects and their impact on the electronic structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper reviews recent developments in materials science and device physics of high-quality epitaxial films of the transparent perovskite La-doped barium stannate, La:BaSnO$_3$. It presents current efforts in the synthesis science of epitaxial La:BaSnO$_3$ films for achieving reduced defect densities and high electron mobility at room temperature. We discuss the scattering mechanisms and the route towards engineering defect-free epitaxial La:BaSnO$_3$ heterostructures. By combining chemical surface characterization and electronic transport studies, a special emphasis is laid on the proper correlation between the transport properties and the electronic band structure of La:BaSnO$_3$ films and heterostructures. For application purposes, interesting optical properties of La:BaSnO$_3$ films are discussed. Finally, for their potential application in oxide electronics, an overview of current progress in the fabrication of La:BaSnO$_3$-based thin-film field-effect transistors is presented together with recent progress in the the fundamental realization of two-dimensional electron gases with high electron mobility in La:BaSnO$_3$-based heterostructures. Future experimental studies to reveal the potential deployment of La:BaSnO$_3$ films in optoelectronic and transparent electronics are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Consistent machine learning for topology optimization with microstructure-dependent neural network material models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing methods together with topology optimization have enabled the creation of multiscale structures with controlled spatially-varying material microstructure. However, topology optimization or inverse design of such structures in the presence of nonlinearities remains a challenge due to the expense of computational homogenization methods and the complexity of differentiably parameterizing the microstructural response. A solution to this challenge lies in machine learning techniques that offer efficient, differentiable mappings between the material response and its microstructural descriptors. This work presents a framework for designing multiscale heterogeneous structures with spatially varying microstructures by merging a homogenization-based topology optimization strategy with a consistent machine learning approach grounded in hyperelasticity theory. We leverage neural architectures that adhere to critical physical principles such as polyconvexity, objectivity, material symmetry, and thermodynamic consistency to supply the framework with a reliable constitutive model that is dependent on material microstructural descriptors. Our findings highlight the potential of integrating consistent machine learning models with density-based topology optimization for enhancing design optimization of heterogeneous hyperelastic structures under finite deformations.</description>

      <title>Observation of an acoustic topological Euler insulator with meronic waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.03429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological band theory has conventionally been concerned with the topology of bands around a single gap. Only recently non-Abelian {topologies that thrive on involving multiple gaps} were studied, unveiling a new horizon {in topological physics} beyond the conventional paradigm. Here, we report on the first experimental realization of a topological Euler insulator phase with unique meronic characterization in an acoustic metamaterial. We demonstrate that this topological phase has several nontrivial features: First, the system cannot be {described} by conventional topological band theory, but has a nontrivial Euler class that captures the unconventional geometry {of the Bloch} bands {in the Brillouin zone}. Second, we uncover in theory and probe in experiments a meronic configuration of the bulk Bloch states for the first time. Third, using a detailed symmetry {analysis}, we show that the topological Euler insulator evolves from {a non-Abelian topological semimetal phase via the annihilation of Dirac points in pairs in one of the band gaps}. With these nontrivial properties, we establish concretely an unconventional bulk-edge correspondence which is confirmed by directly measuring the edge states via {pump-probe techniques}. Our work thus unveils a nontrivial topological Euler insulator phase with {a unique} meronic {pattern} and paves the way as a platform for {non-Abelian topological} phenomena.</description>

      <title>Inverse Faraday effect in superconductors with potential impurities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I consider a nonlinear response of conventional superconductors contaminated with potential impurities or imperfections to a circular polarized light. I focus on dc contributions to the induced current density which describe the emergence of the static magnetization in a superconductor. This effect is known as inverse Faraday effect. By employing quasiclassical theory of superconductivity I derive an expression for the induced static magnetization as a function of frequency of an external ac field and disorder scattering rate. The scattering of electrons off potential impurities is taken into account within the framework of the self-consistent Born approximation. It is found that the magnitude of the inverse Faraday effect decreases with an increase in disorder scattering rate. I have also discovered that the value of the induced magnetization has a characteristic minimum at a frequency which approximately equals twice the value of the pairing gap in a clean superconductor and shifts to higher values with an increase in disorder scattering rate.</description>

      <title>Charge and spin current pumping by ultrafast demagnetization dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The surprising discovery of ultrafast demagnetization -- where electric field of femtosecond laser pulse couples to electrons of a ferromagnetic (FM) layer causing its magnetization vector {\em to shrink while not rotating}, is also assumed to be accompanied by generation of spin current in the direction orthogonal to electric field. However, understanding of the microscopic origin of such spin current and how efficiently it can be converted into charge current, as the putative source of THz radiation, is lacking despite nearly three decades of intense studies. Here we connect the standard pumping phenomena driven by microwave precession of magnetization vector replacing periodic time-dependence of magnetization precession with nonperiodic time-dependence of demagnetization, as obtained from experiments on ultrafast-light-driven Ni layer. Applying time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's functions, able to evolve such setup with arbitrary time dependence, reveals how demagnetization dynamics pumps both charge and spin currents in directions both parallel and orthogonal to electric field of laser pulse, even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling and thereby induced spin-to-charge conversion mechanisms. Although pumped currents follow $dM_z/dt$ in some setups, this becomes obscured when NM layers are disconnected and pumped currents start to reflect from FM boundaries (as is the case of experimental setups). Finally, we use the Jefimenko equations to compute electromagnetic radiation by charge current pumped in disconnected setup during demagnetization, or later during its slow recovery, unraveling that radiated electric field only in the former time interval exhibits features in 0.1--30 THz frequency range probed experimentally or explored for applications of spintronic THz emitters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering of topological phase transitions driven by a high-frequency time-periodic field is a promising approach to realizing new topological phases of matter distinct from static states. Here, we theoretically investigate Floquet engineering topological phase transitions in the quantum spin Hall $\alpha$-$T_{3}$ system driven by an off-resonant circularly polarized light. In addition to the quantum spin (anomalous) Hall insulator phase with multiple helical (chiral) edge states, spin-polarized topological metallic phases are observed, where the bulk topological band gap of one spin sub-band overlaps with the other gapless spin sub-band. Moreover, with a staggered potential, the topological invariants of the system depend on whether the middle band is occupied because of the breaking of particle-hole symmetry. Our work highlights the significance of Floquet engineering in realizing new topological phases in $\alpha$-$T_{3}$ lattices.</description>

      <title>Considerations on free-surface detachment and bed entrainment of fluvial plastics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03081v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, fluvial plastics have been identified as major threat to aquatic environments and human health. In order to develop adequate mitigation strategies for plastic pollution, a fundamental process understanding of riverine plastic transport is of significant importance. In this context, the implementation of research findings into numerical simulation environments is anticipated to enhance modelling capabilities and to support a rigorous decision making. Recent experimental research has focused on the incipient motion of plastic particles, as well as on the effects of surface tension on plastic concentration profiles. While these investigations have advanced the state-of-the-art knowledge, current literature still displays a lack of basic insights into layer-specific plastic transport physics. In this study, first principles are applied to advance knowledge on free-surface detachment and bed entrainment of fluvial plastics. A novel relationship for the critical surface detachment velocity is derived, followed by the development of a framework that allows to relate plastic Shields parameters to those of natural sediments. Overall, it is anticipated that these developments will trigger new research within the plastics community, and it is hoped that present findings will be implemented into Lagrangian particle tracking software.</description>
