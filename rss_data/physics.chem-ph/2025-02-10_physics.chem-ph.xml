      <title>Paper-based colorimetric sensor for detection of chloride anions in water using an epoxy-silver nanocomposite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An epoxy-silver nanocomposite printed on paper was prepared for colorimetric detection of chloride anions (Cl$^-$) in aqueous solution. This paper-based sensor provides a promising platform with attractive advantages such as simple fabrication, intense colors, fast naked-eye response, and high specificity toward Cl$^-$ detection. The sensor undergoes a color change from yellow-orange to chestnut-brown in the presence of water and turns to green-brown in the presence of Cl$^-$. A good linear relationship ($R^2$=0.9754) between logarithmic Cl$^-$ concentration and the extinction intensity difference at 515 nm was observed at concentrations in the 20-400 mM range with a limit of detection (LOD) of 14 mM, far beyond the usual concentrations at which most of the Cl$^-$ colorimetric sensors are limited. It was also proposed a sensing mechanism based on the oxidative etching of anisotropic silver nanoparticles (from 20 to 250 nm) by Cl$^-$ and subsequent formation of chain-like aggregates, resulting in strong interparticle plasmonic coupling. This paper-based sensor can distinguish Cl$^-$ from other ions such as F$^{-}$, OH$^{-}$, NO$_{3}^{-}$, SO$_{4}^{2-}$, HPO$_{4}^{2-}$, H$_{2}$PO$_{4}^{-}$, H$^{+}$, K$^{+}$, Na$^{+}$, NH$_{4}^{+}$, Zn$^{2+}$, and Co$^{2+}$ and from mixtures of these ions. The nanosensor was also tested to recognize Cl$^{-}$ in seawater and a commercial electrolyte solution, even using volumes as small as 4 $\mu$L, suggesting its easy inclusion in portable devices. This novel colorimetric platform is undoubtedly useful for recognizing Cl$^-$ in environmental and physiological systems.</description>

      <title>Derivation and thermodynamiclly consistent coupling of a Debye-H\"uckel type energy to a steric electrolyte model and application to the apparent molar volume and phase boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to determine the size parameters of a steric electrolyte model from the experimental data of apparent molar volume obtained from mass density measurements. Thereby, we avoid the difficulties associated with modeling the complex structure of the double layer. To this end, we derive a Debye-H\"uckel-like model of the electric ion-ion interaction for non-constant dielectric susceptibility, which does not depend on any kind of charging process due to its foundation in the general framework of non-equilibrium electro-thermodynamics. The derivation, however, leads to a novel thermodynamic consistency condition for the temperature dependence of the susceptibility. Due to its contributions to the total pressure, the consistent coupling of this new contribution to the free energy requires subtle modifications in the derivation of the simple mixing model for electrolytes. The coupled model is then applied to the apparent molar volume for various related monovalent salts over a wider range of salt concentrations and temperatures, and classical tests of the electrolyte theory at phase boundaries are investigated.</description>

      <title>Long-Lived Electronic Coherences from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic coherences can be leveraged to control molecular dynamics, but such control is limited by ultrafast decoherence driven by coupling between electronic excitations and molecular vibrations. With the goal of understanding and controlling electronic coherence in molecules, we introduce a first-principles approach that enables direct simulation of the creation and decay of electronic coherences in molecules. Simulations of long-lived experimentally-observed coherences created upon multiphoton excitation of thiophene reveal coherent electronic motions within a dense manifold of Rydberg states, enabled by their relatively parallel potential energy surfaces.</description>

      <title>The Conundrum of Diffuse Basis Sets: A Blessing for Accuracy yet a Curse for Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffuse atomic orbital basis sets have proven to be essential to obtain accurate interaction energies, especially in regard to non-covalent interactions. However, they also have a detrimental impact on the sparsity of the one-particle density matrix (1-PDM), to a degree stronger than the spatial extent of the basis functions alone could explain. This is despite the fact that the matrix elements of the 1-PDM of insulators (systems with significant HOMO-LUMO gaps) are expected to decay exponentially with increasing real-space distance from the diagonal and the asymptotic decay rate is expected to have a well-defined basis set limit. The observed low sparsity of the 1-PDM appears to be independent of representation and even persists after projecting the 1-PDM onto a real-space grid, leading to the conclusion that this "curse of sparsity" is solely a basis set artifact, which, counterintuitively, becomes worse for larger basis sets, seemingly contradicting the notion of a well-defined basis set limit. We show that this is a consequence of the low locality of the contra-variant basis functions as quantified by the inverse overlap matrix $\mathbf{S}^{-1}$ being significantly less sparse than its covariant dual. Introducing the model system of an infinite non-interacting chain of helium atoms, we are able to quantify the exponential decay rate to be proportional to the diffuseness as well as local incompleteness of the basis set, meaning small and diffuse basis sets are affected the most. Finally, we propose one solution to the conundrum in the form of the complementary auxiliary basis set (CABS) singles correction in combination with compact, low l-quantum-number basis sets, showing promising results for non-covalent interactions.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials for Long-Range Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials have emerged as a revolutionary class of force-field models in molecular simulations, delivering quantum-mechanical accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost and enabling the simulation of large-scale systems over extended timescales. However, they often focus on modeling local environments, neglecting crucial long-range interactions. We propose a Sum-of-Gaussians Neural Network (SOG-Net), a lightweight and versatile framework for integrating long-range interactions into machine learning force field. The SOG-Net employs a latent-variable learning network that seamlessly bridges short-range and long-range components, coupled with an efficient Fourier convolution layer that incorporates long-range effects. By learning sum-of-Gaussian multipliers across different convolution layers, the SOG-Net adaptively captures diverse long-range decay behaviors while maintaining close-to-linear computational complexity during training and simulation via non-uniform fast Fourier transforms. The method is demonstrated effective for a broad range of long-range systems.</description>

      <title>Spin-free orbital entropy, mutual information, and entanglement analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital entropies, pair entropies, and mutual information have become popular tools for analysis of strongly correlated wave functions. They can quantitatively measure how strongly an orbital (e.g. from the DMRG active space) participates in the strong correlation and reveal the entanglement pattern between different orbitals. However, this pattern can become rather complicated and sometimes difficult to interpret for large active spaces and is not invariant with respect to the spin projection ($M_s$) component of the spin multiplet state. We introduce a modified spin-free orbital entropy, pair entropy, and mutual information, which simplify the entanglement analysis and are invariant with respect to $M_s$. By comparison of these quantities with their ``original'' spin-including counterparts one can distinguish static correlation due to spin couplings from the ``genuine'' strong correlation due to a multiconfigurational character of the wave function. We illustrate the approach on a model consisting of a non-interacting dimer of triplet diradicals and on a more realistic example of iron-sulfur bound complexes with one and two iron atoms.</description>

      <title>Vibrationally Assisted Exciton Transfer in Open Quantum Systems with Long-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between coherence and system-environment interactions is at the basis of a wide range of phenomena, from quantum information processing to charge and energy transfer in molecular systems, biomolecules, and photochemical materials. In this work, we use a Frenkel-exciton model with long-range interacting qubits coupled to a damped collective bosonic mode to investigate vibrationally assisted transfer processes in donor-acceptor systems featuring internal substructures analogous to light-harvesting complexes. We find that certain delocalized excitonic states maximize the transfer rate and that the entanglement is preserved during the dissipative transfer over a wide range of parameters. We investigate the transfer reduction by static disorder and by finite temperature and study how transfer efficiency scales as a function of the number of dimerized monomers and the component number of each monomer, finding which excitonic states lead to optimal transfer. Finally, we provide a realistic experimental setting to realize this model in analog trapped-ion quantum simulators. Analog quantum simulation of systems comprising many and increasingly complex monomers could offer valuable insights into the design of light-harvesting materials, particularly in the non-perturbative intermediate parameter regime examined in this study, where classical simulation methods are resource-intensive.</description>

      <title>Towards Accurate Mixed Quantum Classical Simulations of Vibrational Polaritonic Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interest in vibrational polaritonic chemistry, where ground-state chemical kinetics are modified via confined optical modes in a cavity, has surged in recent years. Although models have been developed to understand cavity-modified reactions, fully quantum mechanical simulations remain out of reach for the collective regime that involves many molecules, a critical aspect of the phenomenon. Mixed quantum-classical (MQC) simulations offer a scalable alternative, but their accuracy requires testing and potential improvements even in the single-molecule limit. In this work, we take this step by first introducing the mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH) to address the limitations of traditional MQC methods. Second, we incorporate a quantum treatment of the cavity mode, moving beyond the classical approximations often employed in previous studies. Results for a single-molecule model of vibrational polaritonic chemistry show that combining MASH with a quantum cavity mode yields the most accurate rates. However, this scheme may produce different long-time population dynamics at zero coupling depending on whether the cavity mode is quantized; a problem known as size-inconsistency in MASH. We address this problem proposing the $\epsilon$-MASH approach, which forbids hopping between states with negligible nonadiabatic couplings (NACs). Combining MASH with a quantum cavity mode thus provides a promising approach for scalable and accurate MQC simulations in the collective regime.</description>

      <title>Applying the Liouville-Lanczos Method of Time-Dependent Density-Functional Theory to Warm Dense Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ab initio modeling of dynamic structure factors (DSF) and related density response properties in the warm dense matter (WDM) regime is a challenging computational task. The DSF, convolved with a probing X-ray beam and instrument function, is measured in X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) experiments, which allows for the study of electronic structure properties at the microscopic level. Among the various ab initio methods, linear response time-dependent density functional theory (LR-TDDFT) is a key framework for simulating the DSF. The standard approach in LR-TDDFT for computing the DSF relies on the orbital representation. A significant drawback of this method is the unfavorable scaling of the number of required empty bands as the wavenumber increases, making LR-TDDFT impractical for modeling XRTS measurements over large energy scales, such as in backward scattering geometry. We consider and test an alternative approach that employs the Liouville-Lanczos (LL) method for simulating the DSF. This approach does not require empty states and allows the DSF at large momentum transfer values and over a broad frequency range to be accessed. We compare the results obtained from the LL method with those from the standard LR-TDDFT within the projector augmented-wave formalism for isochorically heated aluminum and warm dense hydrogen. Additionally, we utilize exact path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) results for the imaginary-time density-density correlation function (ITCF) of warm dense hydrogen to rigorously benchmark the LL approach. We discuss the application of the LL method for calculating DSFs and ITCFs at different wavenumbers, the effects of pseudopotentials, and the role of Lorentzian smearing. The successful validation of the LL method under WDM conditions makes it a valuable addition to the ab initio simulation landscape, supporting experimental efforts and advancing WDM theory.</description>

      <title>Optimal multi-time-scale estimates for diluted autocatalytic chemical networks. (1) Introduction and $\sigma^*$-dominant case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autocatalytic chemical networks are dynamical systems whose linearization around zero has a positive Lyapunov exponent; this exponent gives the growth rate of the system in the diluted regime, i.e. for near-zero concentrations. The generator of the dynamics in the kinetic limit is then a Perron-Frobenius matrix, suggesting the use of Markov chain techniques to get long-time asymptotics. This series of works introduces a new, general procedure providing precise quantitative information about such asymptotics, based on estimates for the Lyapunov eigenvalue and eigenvector. The algorithm, inspired from Wilson's renormalization group method in quantum field theory, is based on a downward recursion on kinetic scales, starting from the fastest, and terminating with the slowest rates. Estimates take on the form of simple rational functions of kinetic rates. They are accurate under a separation of scales hypothesis, loosely stating that kinetic rates span many orders of magnitude. We provide here a brief general motivation and introduction to the method, present some simple examples, and derive a number of preliminary results, in particular the estimation of Lyapunov data for a subclass of so-called $\sigma^*$-dominant graphs.</description>

      <title>Equation-of-motion internally contracted multireference unitary coupled-cluster theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate computation of excited states remains a challenge in electronic structure theory, especially for systems with a ground state that requires a multireference treatment. In this work, we introduce a novel equation-of-motion (EOM) extension of the internally contracted multireference unitary coupled-cluster framework (ic-MRUCC), termed EOM-ic-MRUCC. EOM-ic-MRUCC follows the transform-then-diagonalize approach, in analogy to its non-unitary counterpart [Datta and Nooijen, J. Chem. Phys. 137, 204107 (2012)]. By employing a projective approach to optimize the ground state, the method retains additive separability and proper scaling with system size. We show that excitation energies are size intensive if the EOM operator satisfies the "killer" and the projective conditions. Furthermore, we propose to represent changes in reference state upon electron excitation via projected many-body operators that span active orbitals and show that the EOM equations formulated in this way are invariant with respect to active orbital rotations. We test the EOM-ic-MRUCC method truncated to single and double excitations by computing the potential energy curves for several excited states of a BeH$_2$ model system, the HF molecule, and water undergoing symmetric dissociation. Across these systems, our method delivers accurate excitation energies and potential energy curves within 5 m$E_\mathrm{h}$ (ca. 0.14 eV) from full configuration interaction. We find that truncating the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff series to four-fold commutators contributes negligible errors (on the order of $10^{-5}$ $E_\mathrm{h}$ or less), offering a practical route to highly accurate excited-state calculations with reduced computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Broadening the Scope of Neural Network Potentials through Direct Inclusion of Additional Molecular Attributes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most state-of-the-art neural network potentials do not account for molecular attributes other than atomic numbers and positions, which limits its range of applicability by design. In this work, we demonstrate the importance of including additional electronic attributes in neural network potential representations with a minimal architectural change to TensorNet, a state-of-the-art equivariant model based on Cartesian rank-2 tensor representations. By performing experiments on both custom-made and public benchmarking datasets, we show that this modification resolves the input degeneracy issues stemming from the use of atomic numbers and positions alone, while enhancing the model's predictive accuracy across diverse chemical systems with different charge or spin states. This is accomplished without tailored strategies or the inclusion of physics-based energy terms, while maintaining efficiency and accuracy. These findings should furthermore encourage researchers to train and use models incorporating these additional representations.</description>

      <title>Potential of mean force and underscreening of polarizable colloids in concentrated electrolytes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study uses advanced numerical methods to estimate the mean force potential (PMF) between charged, polarizable colloidal particles in dense electrolytes. We observe that when the Debye screening length, $\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}$, is below the hydrated ion size, the PMF shows discernible oscillations of purely electrostatic origin as opposed to chemical affinity, in addition to the expected decay in DLVO theory. Moreover, our findings suggest concentrated electrolytes are significantly less efficient at muting electrostatic interactions in electrostatically stabilized colloidal suspensions, potentially having significant implications for our understanding of colloidal stability and the forces that govern the behavior of concentrated charged soft matter systems beyond DLVO theory.</description>

Abstract: In this work we propose two new, closely related, efficient basis sets for the electronic structure problem. The basis sets are based on the Muffin Tin Orbital (MTO) idea that the eigenstates of the Khon Sham (KS) Hamiltonian may we be expanded in terms of eigenstates of the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian inside the so called Muffin Tin (MT) spheres and Bessel functions in the interstitial multiplied by appropriate spherical Harmonics. Here we use the fact that the solution to the finding the ground state electron density is most often found through an iterative process: where generically on the order of over twenty iterations are taken till the ground state electron density and energy converges to the lowest values allowed by the correlation and exchange functional. We use eigenstate information from the previous iteration loop to choose the energies of the basis set elements used to study the KS Hamiltonian. Furthermore within the Atomic Sphere Approximation (ASA) the energies of the Bessel functions do not matter, as they are cancelled out other than for boundary conditions, and are chosen at zero energy. This is an efficient method aimed at studying the electronic structure of materials with large unit cells especially if they are of close packed form where ASA is particularly accurate.</description>

      <title>Smirk: An Atomically Complete Tokenizer for Molecular Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-based foundation models have become an important part of scientific discovery, with molecular foundation models accelerating advancements in molecular design and materials science. However, existing models are constrained by closed-vocabulary tokenizers which capture only a fraction of molecular space. In this work, we systematically evaluate thirty tokenizers, including 19 chemistry-specific ones, for their coverage of the SMILES molecular representation language, revealing significant gaps. To assess the impact of tokenizer choice, we introduce n-gram language models as a low-cost proxy and validate their effectiveness by training and fine-tuning 18 RoBERTa-style encoders for molecular property prediction. To overcome the limitations of existing tokenizers, we propose two new tokenizers -- Smirk and Smirk-GPE -- with full coverage of the OpenSMILES specification. Our results highlight the need for open-vocabulary modeling and chemically diverse benchmarks in cheminformatics. The proposed tokenizer framework systematically integrates nuclear, electronic, and geometric degrees of freedom; this facilitates applications in pharmacology, agriculture, biology, and energy storage.</description>

      <title>Novel and Simple Method for Broadband Stimulated Raman Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Femtosecond, broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy is a popular approach to measuring molecular dynamics with excellent signal-to-noise and spectral resolution. We present a new method for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy that employs Kerr-instability amplification to amplify the supercontinuum spectrum from sapphire and create a highly tunable Raman probe spectrum spanning from -6000 to 0 cm^(-1). Our method, called Kerr-instability amplification for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy (KAB-SRS) avoids the pitfalls of optical parametric amplifiers by producing a broader and more tunable spectrum at a fraction of the cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by measuring the stimulated Raman loss spectrum of 1-decanol.</description>

      <title>The Interplay of Heterogeneity and Product Detachment in Templated Polymer Copying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Templated copolymerization, in which information stored in the sequence of a heteropolymer template is copied into another polymer product, is the mechanism behind all known methods of genetic information transfer. A key aspect of templated copolymerization is the eventual detachment of the product from the template. A second key feature of natural biochemical systems is that the template-binding free energies of both correctly-matched and incorrect monomers are heterogeneous. Previous work has considered the thermodynamic consequences of detachment, and the consequences of heterogeniety for polymerisation speed and accuracy, but the interplay of both separation and heterogeniety remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate a minimal model of templated copying that simultaneously incorporates both detachment from behind the leading edge of the growing copy and heterogeneous interactions. We first extend existing coarse-graining methods for models of polymerisation to allow for heterogeneous interactions. We then show that heterogeneous copying systems with explicit detachment do not exhibit the subdiffusive behaviour observed in the absence of detachment when near equilibrium. Next, we show that heterogeneity in correct monomer interactions tends to result in slower, less accurate copying, while heterogeneity in incorrect monomer interactions tends to result in faster, more accurate copying, due to an increased roughness in the free energy landscape of either correct or incorrect monomer pairs. Finally, we show that heterogeneity can improve on known thermodynamic efficiencies of homogeneous copying, but these increased thermodynamic efficiencies do not always translate to increased efficiencies of information transfer.</description>

      <title>Octahedral tilt-driven phase transitions in BaZrS$_3$ chalcogenide perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chalcogenide perovskites are lead-free materials for potential photovoltaic or thermoelectric applications. BaZrS$_3$ is the most studied member of this family due to its superior thermal and chemical stability, desirable optoelectronic properties, and low thermal conductivity. Phase transitions of BaZrS$_3$ remain underexplored in the literature, as most experimental characterizations of this material have been performed at ambient conditions where the orthorhombic Pnma phase is reported to be stable. In this work, we study the dynamics of BaZrS$_3$ across a range of temperatures and pressures using an accurate machine-learning interatomic potential trained with data from hybrid density functional theory calculations. At 0 Pa, we find a first-order phase transition from the orthorhombic to tetragonal I4/mcm phase at 610 K, and a second-order transition from the tetragonal to the cubic Pm-3m phase at 880 K. The tetragonal phase is stable over a larger temperature range at higher pressures. To confirm the validity of our model we compare our results with a range of published experimental data and report a prediction for the X-ray diffraction pattern as a function of temperature.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation Dissipation Relations for the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent results demonstrate how deviations from equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be quantified for active field theories by deriving exact fluctuations dissipation relations that involve the entropy production [M. K. Johnsrud and R. Golestanian, arXiv:2409.14977]. Here we develop and employ diagrammatic tools to perform perturbative calculations for a paradigmatic active field theory, the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard (NRCH) model. We obtain analytical results, which serve as an illustration of how to implement the recently developed framework to active field theories, and help to illuminate the specific non-equilibrium characteristics of the NRCH field theory.</description>

      <title>Temperature-dependent radiative lifetime measurement of the $6^1\Sigma_g^+(v=9,J=31)$ state of sodium molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the measurement of radiative lifetimes of the $6^1\Sigma_g^+(v=9,J=31)$ state of gas-phase molecular sodium using a high-resolution double-resonance spectroscopy. Measurements were done using a time-correlated photon counting technique at various pressures and temperatures. Lifetimes were extracted from extrapolations to the zero buffer gas pressure, called Stern-Volmer plot, and the temperature-dependence of the radiative lifetimes were measured over a temperature range from 593 K to 653 K. Our result agrees well within the error limits with the theoretical calculations.</description>
