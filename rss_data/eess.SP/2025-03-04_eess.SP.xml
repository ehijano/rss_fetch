      <title>Fluid Antenna Enabled Over-the-Air Federated Learning: Joint Optimization of Positioning, Beamforming, and User Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) effectively utilizes communication bandwidth, yet it is vulnerable to errors during analog aggregation. While removing users with unfavorable channel conditions can mitigate these errors, it also reduces the available local training data for FL, which in turn hinders the convergence rate of the training process. To tackle this issue, we propose using fluid antenna (FA) techniques to enhance the degrees of freedom within the channel space, ultimately boosting the convergence speed of FL training. Moreover, we develop a novel approach that effectively coordinates uplink receiver beamforming, user selection, and FA positioning to optimize the convergence rate of OTA FL training in dynamic wireless environments. We address this challenging stochastic optimization by reformulating it as a mixed-integer programming problem by utilizing the training loss upper bound. We then introduce a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) method to solve the mixed-integer mixed programming problem. Experimental results indicate that incorporating FA techniques significantly accelerates the training convergence of FL and greatly surpasses conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Observability Investigation for Rotational Calibration of (Global-pose aided) VIO under Straight Line Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online extrinsic calibration is crucial for building "power-on-and-go" moving platforms, like robots and AR devices. However, blindly performing online calibration for unobservable parameter may lead to unpredictable results. In the literature, extensive studies have been conducted on the extrinsic calibration between IMU and camera, from theory to practice. It is well-known that the observability of extrinsic parameter can be guaranteed under sufficient motion excitation. Furthermore, the impacts of degenerate motions are also investigated. Despite these successful analyses, we identify an issue regarding the existing observability conclusion. This paper focuses on the observability investigation for straight line motion, which is a common-seen and fundamental degenerate motion in applications. We analytically prove that pure translational straight line motion can lead to the unobservability of the rotational extrinsic parameter between IMU and camera (at least one degree of freedom). By correcting observability conclusion, our novel theoretical finding disseminate more precise principle to the research community and provide explainable calibration guideline for practitioners. Our analysis is validated by rigorous theory and experiments.</description>

      <title>A Novel Spatiotemporal Correlation Anomaly Detection Method Based on Time-Frequency-Domain Feature Fusion and a Dynamic Graph Neural Network in Wireless Sensor Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention-based transformers have played an important role in wireless sensor network (WSN) timing anomaly detection due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies. However, there are several issues that must be addressed, such as the fact that their ability to capture long-term dependencies is not completely reliable, their computational complexity levels are high, and the spatiotemporal features of WSN timing data are not sufficiently extracted for detecting the correlation anomalies of multinode WSN timing data. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a WSN anomaly detection method that integrates frequency-domain features with dynamic graph neural networks (GNN) under a designed self-encoder reconstruction framework. First, the discrete wavelet transform effectively decomposes trend and seasonal components of time series to solve the poor long-term reliability of transformers. Second, a frequency-domain attention mechanism is designed to make full use of the difference between the amplitude distributions of normal data and anomalous data in this domain. Finally, a multimodal fusion-based dynamic graph convolutional network (MFDGCN) is designed by combining an attention mechanism and a graph convolutional network (GCN) to adaptively extract spatial correlation features. A series of experiments conducted on public datasets and their results demonstrate that the anomaly detection method designed in this paper exhibits superior precision and recall than the existing methods do, with an F1 score of 93.5%, representing an improvement of 2.9% over that of the existing models.</description>

      <title>Tensor-based Model Reduction and Identification for Generalized Memory Polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power amplifiers (PAs) are essential components in wireless communication systems, and the design of their behavioral models has been an important research topic for many years. The widely used generalized memory polynomial (GMP) model suffers from rapid growth in the number of parameters with increasing memory depths and nonlinearity order, which leads to a significant increase in model complexity and the risk of overfitting. In this study, we introduce tensor networks to compress the unknown coefficient tensor of the GMP model, resulting in three novel tensor-based GMP models. These models can achieve comparable performance to the GMP model, but with far fewer parameters and lower complexity. For the identification of these models, we derive the alternating least-squares (ALS) method to ensure the rapid updates and convergence of model parameters in an iterative manner. In addition, we notice that the horizontal slices of the third-order data tensor constructed from the input signals are Vandermonde matrices, which have a numerically low-rank structure. Hence, we further propose the RP-ALS algorithm, which first performs a truncated higher-order singular value decomposition on the data tensor to generate random projections, then conducts the ALS algorithm for the identification of projected models with downscaled dimensions, thus reducing the computational effort of the iterative process. The experimental results show that the proposed models outperform the full GMP model and sparse GMP model via LASSO regression in terms of the reduction in the number of parameters and running complexity.</description>

      <title>Advances in Anti-Deception Jamming Strategies for Radar Systems: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deception jamming has long been a significant threat to radar systems, interfering with search, acquisition, and tracking by introducing false information that diverts attention from the targets of interest. As deception strategies become more sophisticated, the vulnerability of radar systems to these attacks continues to escalate. This paper offers a comprehensive review of the evolution of anti-deception jamming techniques, starting with legacy solutions and progressing to the latest advancements. Current research is categorized into three key areas: prevention strategies, which hinder the ability of jammers to alter radar processing; detection strategies, which alert the system to deception and may classify the type of attack; and mitigation strategies, which aim to reduce or suppress the impact of jamming. Additionally, key avenues for further research are highlighted, with a particular emphasis on distributed, cognitive, and AI-enabled radar systems. We envision this paper as a gateway to the existing literature on anti-deception jamming, a critical area for safeguarding radar systems against evolving threats.</description>

      <title>Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces-Enhanced MIMO OFDM Wideband Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems rely on digital or hybrid digital and analog designs for beamforming against frequency-selective fading, which suffer from high hardware complexity and energy consumption. To address this, this work introduces a fully-analog stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) architecture that directly performs wave-domain beamforming, enabling diagonalization of the end-to-end channel matrix and inherently eliminating inter-antenna interference (IAI) for MIMO OFDM transmission. By leveraging cascaded programmable metasurface layers, the proposed system establishes multiple parallel subchannels, significantly improving multi-carrier transmission efficiency while reducing hardware complexity. To optimize the SIM phase shift matrices, a block coordinate descent and penalty convex-concave procedure (BCD-PCCP) algorithm is developed to iteratively minimize the channel fitting error across subcarriers. Simulation results validate the proposed approach, determining the maximum effective bandwidth and demonstrating substantial performance improvements. Moreover, for a MIMO OFDM system operating at 28 GHz with 16 subcarriers, the proposed SIM configuration method achieves over 300\% enhancement in channel capacity compared to conventional SIM configuration that only accounts for the center frequency.</description>

      <title>Toward AIML Enabled WiFi Beamforming CSI Feedback Compression: An Overview of IEEE 802.11 Standardization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmit beamforming is one of the key techniques used in the existing IEEE 802.11 WiFi standards and future generations such as 11be and 11bn, a.k.a., ultra high reliability (UHR). The paper gives an overview of the current standardization activities regarding the artificial intelligence and machine learning (AIML) enabled beamforming channel state information (CSI) feedback compression technique, defined by the 802.11 AIML topic interest group (TIG). Two key challenges the AIML TIG is going to tackle in the future beamforming standards and four defined key performance indicators (KPIs) for the AIML enabled schemes are discussed in the paper. The two challenges are the CSI feedback overhead and the compression complexity, and the four KPIs are feedback overhead, AIML model sharing overhead, packet error rate and complexity. Moreover, the paper presents a couple of AIML enabled compression schemes accepted by the TIG, such as the K-means and autoencoder based schemes, and uses simulated and analyzed data to explain how these schemes are designed according to the KPIs. Finally, future research directions are indicated for encouraging more researchers and engineers to contribute to this technique and the standardization of the next generation WiFi beamforming.</description>

      <title>A physics-informed Bayesian optimization method for rapid development of electrical machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced slot and winding designs are imperative to create future high performance electrical machines (EM). As a result, the development of methods to design and improve slot filling factor (SFF) has attracted considerable research. Recent developments in manufacturing processes, such as additive manufacturing and alternative materials, has also highlighted a need for novel high-fidelity design techniques to develop high performance complex geometries and topologies. This study therefore introduces a novel physics-informed machine learning (PIML) design optimization process for improving SFF in traction electrical machines used in electric vehicles. A maximum entropy sampling algorithm (MESA) is used to seed a physics-informed Bayesian optimization (PIBO) algorithm, where the target function and its approximations are produced by Gaussian processes (GP)s. The proposed PIBO-MESA is coupled with a 2D finite element model (FEM) to perform a GP-based surrogate and provide the first demonstration of the optimal combination of complex design variables for an electrical machine. Significant computational gains were achieved using the new PIBO-MESA approach, which is 45% faster than existing stochastic methods, such as the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). The FEM results confirm that the new design optimization process and keystone shaped wires lead to a higher SFF (i.e. by 20%) and electromagnetic improvements (e.g. maximum torque by 12%) with similar resistivity. The newly developed PIBO-MESA design optimization process therefore presents significant benefits in the design of high-performance electric machines, with reduced development time and costs.</description>

      <title>Conformal Lyapunov Optimization: Optimal Resource Allocation under Deterministic Reliability Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00486v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces conformal Lyapunov optimization (CLO), a novel resource allocation framework for networked systems that optimizes average long-term objectives, while satisfying deterministic long-term reliability constraints. Unlike traditional Lyapunov optimization (LO), which addresses resource allocation tasks under average long-term constraints, CLO provides formal worst-case deterministic reliability guarantees. This is achieved by integrating the standard LO optimization framework with online conformal risk control (O-CRC), an adaptive update mechanism controlling long-term risks. The effectiveness of CLO is verified via experiments for hierarchal edge inference targeting image segmentation tasks in a networked computing architecture. Specifically, simulation results confirm that CLO can control reliability constraints, measured via the false negative rate of all the segmentation decisions made in the network, while at the same time minimizing the weighted sum of energy consumption and imprecision, with the latter accounting for the rate of false positives.</description>

      <title>Predicting Cascading Failures in Power Systems using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cascading failure studies help assess and enhance the robustness of power systems against severe power outages. Onset time is a critical parameter in the analysis and management of power system stability and reliability, representing the timeframe within which initial disturbances may lead to subsequent cascading failures. In this paper, different traditional machine learning algorithms are used to predict the onset time of cascading failures. The prediction task is articulated as a multi-class classification problem, employing machine learning algorithms. The results on the UIUC 150-Bus power system data available publicly show high classification accuracy with Random Forest. The hyperparameters of the Random Forest classifier are tuned using Bayesian Optimization. This study highlights the potential of machine learning models in predicting cascading failures, providing a foundation for the development of more resilient power systems.</description>

      <title>Net-Zero Integrated Sensing and Communication in Backscatter Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future wireless networks targeted for improving spectral and energy efficiency, are expected to simultaneously provide sensing functionality and support low-power communications. This paper proposes a novel net-zero integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) model for backscatter systems, including an access point (AP), a net-zero device, and a user receiver. We fully utilize the backscatter mechanism for sensing and communication without additional power consumption and signal processing in the hardware device, which reduces the system complexity and makes it feasible for practical applications. To further optimize the system performance, we design a novel signal frame structure for the ISAC model that effectively mitigates communication interference at the transmitter, tag, and receiver. Additionally, we employ distributed antennas for sensing which can be placed flexibly to capture a wider range of signals from diverse angles and distances, thereby improving the accuracy of sensing. We derive theoretical expressions for the symbol error rate (SER) and tag's location detection probability, and provide a detailed analysis of how the system parameters, such as transmit power and tag's reflection coefficient, affect the system performance.</description>

      <title>Rate Splitting Multiple Access for Simultaneous Lightwave Information and Power Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper initiate the application of rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) for simultaneous lightwave information and power transfer (SLIPT), where users require to decode information and harvest energy. We focus on a time-splitting (TS) mode where information decoding and energy harvesting are separated in two different phases. Based on the proposed system model, we design a constrained-concave-convex programming (CCCP) algorithm to solve the optimization problem of maximizing the worst-case rate among users subject to the harvested energy constraint at each user. Specifically, the proposed algorithm exploits transformation of the bilinear function, semidefinite relaxation (SDR), CCCP, and a penalty method to effectively deal with the non-convex constraints and objective function. Numerical results show that our proposed RSMA-aided SLIPT outperforms the existing baselines based on space-division multiple access (SDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA).</description>

      <title>An Approach of Directly Tracking Multiple Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conventional approaches for multiobject tracking (MOT), raw sensor data undergoes several preprocessing stages to reduce data rate and computational complexity. This typically includes coherent processing that aims at maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), followed by a detector that extracts "point" measurements, e.g., the range and bearing of objects, which serve as inputs for sequential Bayesian MOT. While using point measurements significantly simplifies the statistical model, the reduced data rate can lead to a loss of critical, object-related information and, thus, potentially to reduced tracking performance. In this paper, we propose a direct tracking approach that avoids a detector and most preprocessing stages. For direct tracking, we introduce a measurement model for the data-generating process of the sensor data, along with state-transition and birth models for the dynamics and the appearance and disappearance of objects. Based on the new statistical model, we develop a factor graph and particle-based belief propagation (BP) method for efficient sequential Bayesian estimation. Contrary to the track-before-detect (TBD) paradigm which also avoids a detector, direct tracking integrates coherent processing within the Bayesian MOT framework. Numerical experiments based on a passive acoustic dataset demonstrate that the proposed direct approach outperforms state-of-the-art conventional methods that rely on multiple preprocessing stages.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum SAGINs Harnessing Optical RISs: Applications, Advances, and the Road Ahead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) concept is vital for the development of seamless next-generation (NG) wireless coverage, integrating satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles, and manned aircraft along with the terrestrial infrastructure to provide resilient ubiquitous communications. By incorporating quantum communications using optical wireless signals, SAGIN is expected to support a synergistic global quantum Internet alongside classical networks. However, long-distance optical beam propagation requires line-of-sight (LoS) connections in the face of beam broadening and LoS blockages. To overcome blockages among SAGIN nodes, we propose deploying optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ORISs) on building rooftops. They can also adaptively control optical beam diameters for reducing losses. This article first introduces the applications of ORISs in SAGINs, then examines their advances in quantum communications for typical SAGIN scenarios. Finally, the road ahead towards the practical realization of ORIS-aided NG quantum SAGINs is outlined.</description>

      <title>Impact of Fasteners on the Radar Cross-Section performance of Radar Absorbing Air Intake Duct</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An aircraft consists of various cavities including air intake ducts, cockpit, radome, inlet and exhaust of heat exchangers, passage for engine bay/other bay cooling etc. These cavities are prime radar cross-section (RCS) contributors of aircraft. The major such cavity is air intake duct, and it contributes significantly to frontal sector RCS of an aircraft. The RCS reductions of air intake duct is very important to achieve a low RCS (or stealthy) aircraft configuration. In general, radar absorbing materials (RAM) are getting utilized for RCS reduction of air intake duct. It can also be noticed that a large number of fasteners are used for integration of air intake duct with the aircraft structures. The installation of fasteners on RAS may lead to degradation of RCS performance of air intake. However, no such studies are reported in the literature on the impact of rivets on the RCS performance of RAS air intake duct. In this paper, radar absorbing material of thickness 6.25 mm is designed which givens more than -10 dB reflection loss from 4 to 18GHz of frequencies. Next, the effect of rivet installation on these RAS is carried out using three different rivet configurations. The RCS performance of RAS is evaluated for duct of different lengths from 1 to 18GHz of frequencies. In order to see the RCS performance, five different air intake cases are considered The RCS performance with increase in percentage surface area of rivet heads to RAS is reported in detail. At the last, an open-source aircraft CAD model is considered and the RCS performance of RAS air intake with and without rivets is evaluated.</description>

      <title>Confidence Based Asynchronous Integrated Communication and Localization Networks Using Pulsed UWB Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, UWB has garnered widespread attention in academia and industry due to its low power consumption, wide bandwidth, and high time resolution characteristics. This paper introduces the design of an asynchronous IR-UWB integrated communication and localization (ICL) downlink network, which employs unified waveforms to enable simultaneous data transmission and localization. A differential sequential detection strategy has been proposed for data demodulation. To address errors caused by symbol misalignment, a novel symbol confidence metric model is introduced to ensure reliable pulse detection and time-of-arrival (TOA) estimation. Additionally, an asynchronous start-of-frame delimiter (SFD) detection model has been constructed to guide parameter optimization for practical applications. Furthermore, the clock drift estimation has been improved by leveraging the confidence metric within a modified weighted least squares (MWLS) framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves reliable clock drift estimation, communication, and self-localization simultaneously. The operational range of the confidence metric required for these outcomes is also quantified, providing valuable insights for parameter design and system implementation. Finally, the agent localization accuracy can be achieved within 10 cm at over 90\% confidence, with commercial UWB devices according to practical measurements.</description>

      <title>C2S-AE: CSI to Sensing enabled by an Auto-Encoder-based Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation mobile networks are set to utilize integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) as a critical technology, providing significant support for sectors like the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), extended reality (XR), and smart home applications. A key challenge in ISAC implementation is the extraction of sensing parameters from radio signals, a task that conventional methods struggle to achieve due to the complexity of acquiring sensing channel data. In this paper, we introduce a novel auto-encoder (AE)-based framework to acquire sensing information using channel state information (CSI). Specifically, our framework, termed C2S (CSI to sensing)-AE, learns the relationship between CSI and the delay power spectrum (DPS), from which the range information can be readily accessed. To validate our framework's performance, we conducted measurements of DPS and CSI in real-world scenarios and introduced the dataset 'SHU7'. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the framework excels in C2S extrapolation, surpassing existing methods in terms of accuracy for both delay and signal strength of individual paths. This innovative approach holds the potential to greatly enhance sensing capabilities in future mobile networks, paving the way for more robust and versatile ISAC applications.</description>

      <title>RSSI Positioning with Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel received signal strength intensity (RSSI)-based positioning method using fluid antenna systems (FAS), leveraging their inherent channel correlation properties to improve location accuracy. By enabling a single antenna to sample multiple spatial positions, FAS exhibits high correlation between its ports. We integrate this high inter-port correlation with a logarithmic path loss model to mitigate the impact of fast fading on RSSI signals, and derive a simplified multipoint positioning model based on the established relationship between channel correlation and RSSI signal correlation. A maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is then developed, for which we provide a closed-form solution. Results demonstrate that our approach outperforms both traditional least squares (LS) methods and single-antenna systems, achieving accuracy comparable to conventional multi-antenna positioning. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of different antenna structures on positioning performance, offering practical guidance for FAS antenna design.</description>

      <title>Large AI Model for Delay-Doppler Domain Channel Prediction in 6G OTFS-Based Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel prediction is crucial for high-mobility vehicular networks, as it enables the anticipation of future channel conditions and the proactive adjustment of communication strategies. However, achieving accurate vehicular channel prediction is challenging due to significant Doppler effects and rapid channel variations resulting from high-speed vehicle movement and complex propagation environments. In this paper, we propose a novel delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel prediction framework tailored for high-mobility vehicular networks. By transforming the channel representation into the DD domain, we obtain an intuitive, sparse, and stable depiction that closely aligns with the underlying physical propagation processes, effectively reducing the complex vehicular channel to a set of time-series parameters with enhanced predictability. Furthermore, we leverage the large artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict these DD-domain time-series parameters, capitalizing on their advanced ability to model temporal correlations. The zero-shot capability of the pre-trained large AI model facilitates accurate channel predictions without requiring task-specific training, while subsequent fine-tuning on specific vehicular channel data further improves prediction accuracy. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our DD-domain channel prediction framework and the superior accuracy of the large AI model in predicting time-series channel parameters, thereby highlighting the potential of our approach for robust vehicular communication systems.</description>

      <title>Surface Topography as an Energy State: Hamiltonian Description of Functional Properties in Phase Space and Quantification via Optical Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The assessment of tribological processes necessitates comprehensive monitoring and interpretation of surface states, traditionally by topography height values and surface texture parameters. This paper proposes a phase space representation as generic interpretation of surfaces to enhance tribological assessments. By deriving distinctions between two-dimensional and three-dimensional manifolds from phenomenological thermodynamics, we demonstrate the existence of fractal dimensions on physical surfaces. Utilizing the smallest representable wavelength, a coordinate ensemble where each coordinate has a generalized degree of freedom and a differential amount across fractal dimensions is proposed. The metric is interpreted as a time coordinate, allowing the derivative to be seen as velocity. Through geometric dimension analysis, we derive a topographic Hamiltonian via generalized momentum. Each coordinate pair in the ensemble is assigned a location in phase space. Statistical considerations define a symplectic structure and phase space volume. As a use-case, a two-disc experiment demonstrates that topography changes under load can be understood as a self-organization process through thermodynamic reasoning. As a possibility for a direct assessment of the phase space of a surface for monitoring tribological processes, we propose the combination of topographic measuring systems with scattering light measurement. This multi sensor approach offers opportunities for optimizing performance in tribological applications.</description>

      <title>Hierarchically Tunable 6DMA for Wireless Communication and Sensing: Modeling and Performance Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new hierarchically tunable six-dimensional movable antenna (HT-6DMA) architecture for base station (BS) in future wireless networks. The HT-6DMA BS consists of multiple antenna arrays that can flexibly move on a spherical surface, with their three-dimensional (3D) positions and 3D rotations/orientations efficiently characterized in the global spherical coordinate system (SCS) and their individual local SCSs, respectively. As a result, the 6DMA system is hierarchically tunable in the sense that each array's global position and local rotation can be separately adjusted in a sequential manner with the other being fixed, thus greatly reducing their design complexity and improving the achievable performance. In particular, we consider an HT-6DMA BS serving multiple single-antenna users in the uplink communication or sensing potential unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)/drones in a given airway area. Specifically, for the communication scenario, we aim to maximize the average sum rate of communication users in the long term by optimizing the positions and rotations of all 6DMA arrays at the BS. While for the airway sensing scenario, we maximize the minimum received sensing signal power along the airway by optimizing the 6DMA arrays' positions and rotations along with the BS's transmit covariance matrix. Despite that the formulated problems are both non-convex, we propose efficient solutions to them by exploiting the hierarchical tunability of positions/rotations of 6DMA arrays in our proposed model. Numerical results show that the proposed HT-6DMA design significantly outperforms not only the traditional BS with fixed-position antennas (FPAs), but also the existing 6DMA scheme. Furthermore, it is unveiled that the performance gains of HT-6DMA mostly come from the arrays' global position adjustments on the spherical surface, rather than their local rotation adjustments.</description>

      <title>Hybrid MIMO in the Upper Mid-Band: Architectures, Processing, and Energy Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As 6G networks evolve, the upper mid-band spectrum (7 GHz to 24 GHz), or frequency range 3 (FR3), is emerging as a promising balance between the coverage offered by sub-6 GHz bands and the high-capacity of millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies. This paper explores the structure of FR3 hybrid MIMO systems and proposes two architectural classes: Frequency Integrated (FI) and Frequency Partitioned (FP). FI architectures enhance spectral efficiency by exploiting multiple sub-bands parallelism, while FP architectures dynamically allocate sub-band access according to specific application requirements. Additionally, two approaches, fully digital (FD) and hybrid analog-digital (HAD), are considered, comparing shared (SRF) versus dedicated RF (DRF) chain configurations. Herein signal processing solutions are investigated, particularly for an uplink multi-user scenario with power control optimization.
  Results demonstrate that SRF and DRF architectures achieve comparable spectral efficiency; however, SRF structures consume nearly half the power of DRF in the considered setup. While FD architectures provide higher spectral efficiency, they do so at the cost of increased power consumption compared to HAD. Additionally, FI architectures show slightly greater power consumption compared to FP; however, they provide a significant benefit in spectral efficiency (over 4 x), emphasizing an important trade-off in FR3 engineering.</description>

      <title>Channel Semantic Characterization for Integrated Sensing and Communication Scenarios: From Measurements to Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication systems, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is crucial for perceiving and interacting with the environment via electromagnetic propagation, termed channel semantics, to support tasks like decision-making. However, channel models focusing on physical characteristics face
  challenges in representing semantics embedded in the channel, thereby limiting the evaluation of ISAC systems. To tackle this, we present a novel framework for channel modeling from
  the conceptual event perspective. By leveraging a multi-level semantic structure and characterized knowledge libraries, the framework decomposes complex channel characteristics into
  extensible semantic characterization, thereby better capturing the relationship between environment and channel, and enabling more flexible adjustments of channel models for different events without requiring a complete reset. Specifically, we define channel semantics on three levels: status semantics, behavior semantics, and event semantics, corresponding to channel multipaths, channel time-varying trajectories, and channel topology, respectively. Taking realistic vehicular ISAC scenarios as an example, we perform semantic clustering, characterizing status semantics via multipath statistical distributions, modeling behavior semantics using Markov chains for time variation, and representing event semantics through a co-occurrence matrix. Results show the model accurately generates channels while capturing rich semantic information. Moreover, its generalization supports customized semantics.</description>

      <title>Lossy Neural Compression for Geospatial Analytics: A Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decades, there has been an explosion in the amount of available Earth Observation (EO) data. The unprecedented coverage of the Earth's surface and atmosphere by satellite imagery has resulted in large volumes of data that must be transmitted to ground stations, stored in data centers, and distributed to end users. Modern Earth System Models (ESMs) face similar challenges, operating at high spatial and temporal resolutions, producing petabytes of data per simulated day. Data compression has gained relevance over the past decade, with neural compression (NC) emerging from deep learning and information theory, making EO data and ESM outputs ideal candidates due to their abundance of unlabeled data. In this review, we outline recent developments in NC applied to geospatial data. We introduce the fundamental concepts of NC including seminal works in its traditional applications to image and video compression domains with focus on lossy compression. We discuss the unique characteristics of EO and ESM data, contrasting them with "natural images", and explain the additional challenges and opportunities they present. Moreover, we review current applications of NC across various EO modalities and explore the limited efforts in ESM compression to date. The advent of self-supervised learning (SSL) and foundation models (FM) has advanced methods to efficiently distill representations from vast unlabeled data. We connect these developments to NC for EO, highlighting the similarities between the two fields and elaborate on the potential of transferring compressed feature representations for machine--to--machine communication. Based on insights drawn from this review, we devise future directions relevant to applications in EO and ESM.</description>

      <title>Metering Error Estimation of Fast-Charging Stations Using Charging Data Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate electric energy metering (EEM) of fast charging stations (FCSs), serving as critical infrastructure in the electric vehicle (EV) industry and as significant carriers of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, is the cornerstone for ensuring fair electric energy transactions. Traditional on-site verification methods, constrained by their high costs and low efficiency, struggle to keep pace with the rapid global expansion of FCSs. In response, this paper adopts a data-driven approach and proposes the measuring performance comparison (MPC) method. By utilizing the estimation value of state-of-charge (SOC) as a medium, MPC establishes comparison chains of EEM performance of multiple FCSs. Therefore, the estimation of EEM errors for FCSs with high efficiency is enabled. Moreover, this paper summarizes the interfering factors of estimation results and establishes corresponding error models and uncertainty models. Also, a method for discriminating whether there are EEM performance defects in FCSs is proposed. Finally, the feasibility of MPC method is validated, with results indicating that for FCSs with an accuracy grade of 2\%, the discriminative accuracy exceeds 95\%. The MPC provides a viable approach for the online monitoring of EEM performance for FCSs, laying a foundation for a fair and just electricity trading market.</description>

      <title>Uplink Transmission Design for Fluid Antenna-Enabled Multiuser MIMO Systems with Imperfect CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a two-timescale uplink transmission framework for a fluid antenna-enabled multiuser multi-input multi-output system (MIMO-FAS). Antenna positions are optimized based on statistical channel state information (CSI), while beamforming vectors at the base station (BS) adapt to instantaneous CSI. Under a Rician fading channel with imperfect CSI, we establish a linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE)-based channel estimation approach and derive a closed-form expression for the achievable uplink rate using a low-complexity maximal-ratio-combining (MRC) detector. The optimization problem is formulated as a minimum user rate maximization problem by optimizing the fluid antenna positions, subject to the feasible region and the minimum spacing distance constraints. To address this non-convex problem, a genetic algorithm (GA) method is proposed, encoding antenna configurations as population individuals. Additionally, an accelerated gradient ascent algorithm is proposed to enhance computational efficiency. Numerical results validate the mathematical derivations and demonstrate that the proposed two-timescale transmission strategy significantly outperforms traditional FPA systems, with both algorithms achieving enhanced gains.</description>

      <title>Secrecy Rate Maximization for 6G Reconfigurable Holographic Surfaces Assisted Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHS) have emerged as a transformative material technology, enabling dynamic control of electromagnetic waves to generate versatile holographic beam patterns. This paper addresses the problem of secrecy rate maximization for an RHS-assisted systems by joint designing the digital beamforming, artificial noise (AN), and the analog holographic beamforming. However, such a problem results to be non-convex and challenging. Therefore, to solve it, a novel alternating optimization algorithm based on the majorization-maximization (MM) framework for RHS-assisted systems is proposed, which rely on surrogate functions to facilitate efficient and reliable optimization. In the proposed approach, digital beamforming design ensures directed signal power toward the legitimate user while minimizing leakage to the unintended receiver. The AN generation method projects noise into the null space of the legitimate user channel, aligning it with the unintended receiver channel to degrade its signal quality. Finally, the holographic beamforming weights are optimized to refine the wavefronts for enhanced secrecy rate performance Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating significant improvements in secrecy rate compared to the benchmark method.</description>

      <title>PCE-GAN: A Generative Adversarial Network for Point Cloud Attribute Quality Enhancement based on Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point cloud compression significantly reduces data volume but sacrifices reconstruction quality, highlighting the need for advanced quality enhancement techniques. Most existing approaches focus primarily on point-to-point fidelity, often neglecting the importance of perceptual quality as interpreted by the human visual system. To address this issue, we propose a generative adversarial network for point cloud quality enhancement (PCE-GAN), grounded in optimal transport theory, with the goal of simultaneously optimizing both data fidelity and perceptual quality. The generator consists of a local feature extraction (LFE) unit, a global spatial correlation (GSC) unit and a feature squeeze unit. The LFE unit uses dynamic graph construction and a graph attention mechanism to efficiently extract local features, placing greater emphasis on points with severe distortion. The GSC unit uses the geometry information of neighboring patches to construct an extended local neighborhood and introduces a transformer-style structure to capture long-range global correlations. The discriminator computes the deviation between the probability distributions of the enhanced point cloud and the original point cloud, guiding the generator to achieve high quality reconstruction. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, when applying PCE-GAN to the latest geometry-based point cloud compression (G-PCC) test model, it achieves an average BD-rate of -19.2% compared with the PredLift coding configuration and -18.3% compared with the RAHT coding configuration. Subjective comparisons show a significant improvement in texture clarity and color transitions, revealing finer details and more natural color gradients.</description>

      <title>Foundation-Model-Boosted Multimodal Learning for fMRI-based Neuropathic Pain Drug Response Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuropathic pain, affecting up to 10% of adults, remains difficult to treat due to limited therapeutic efficacy and tolerability. Although resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is a promising non-invasive measurement of brain biomarkers to predict drug response in therapeutic development, the complexity of fMRI demands machine learning models with substantial capacity. However, extreme data scarcity in neuropathic pain research limits the application of high-capacity models. To address the challenge of data scarcity, we propose FMM$_{TC}$, a Foundation-Model-boosted Multimodal learning framework for fMRI-based neuropathic pain drug response prediction, which leverages both internal multimodal information in pain-specific data and external knowledge from large pain-agnostic data. Specifically, to maximize the value of limited pain-specific data, FMM$_{TC}$ integrates complementary information from two rs-fMRI modalities: Time series and functional Connectivity. FMM$_{TC}$ is further boosted by an fMRI foundation model with its external knowledge from extensive pain-agnostic fMRI datasets enriching limited pain-specific information. Evaluations with an in-house dataset and a public dataset from OpenNeuro demonstrate FMM$_{TC}$'s superior representation ability, generalizability, and cross-dataset adaptability over existing unimodal fMRI models that only consider one of the rs-fMRI modalities. The ablation study validates the effectiveness of multimodal learning and foundation-model-powered external knowledge transfer in FMM$_{TC}$. An integrated gradient-based interpretation study explains how FMM$_{TC}$'s cross-dataset dynamic behaviors enhance its adaptability. In conclusion, FMM$_{TC}$ boosts clinical trials in neuropathic pain therapeutic development by accurately predicting drug responses to improve the participant stratification efficiency.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Edge Inference in Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Task-oriented integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC) is a key technology for achieving low-latency edge inference and enabling efficient implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS). However, the constrained energy supply at edge devices has emerged as a critical bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-efficient ISCC framework for AI inference at resource-constrained edge devices, where adjustable split inference, model pruning, and feature quantization are jointly designed to adapt to diverse task requirements. A joint resource allocation design problem for the proposed ISCC framework is formulated to minimize the energy consumption under stringent inference accuracy and latency constraints. To address the challenge of characterizing inference accuracy, we derive an explicit approximation for it by analyzing the impact of sensing, communication, and computation processes on the inference performance. Building upon the analytical results, we propose an iterative algorithm employing alternating optimization to solve the resource allocation problem. In each subproblem, the optimal solutions are available by respectively applying a golden section search method and checking the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, thereby ensuring the convergence to a local optimum of the original problem. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ISCC design, showing a significant reduction in energy consumption of up to 40% compared to existing methods, particularly in low-latency scenarios.</description>

      <title>Error Bounds Revisited, and How to Use Bayesian Statistics While Remaining a Frequentist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signal processing makes extensive use of point estimators and accompanying error bounds. These work well up until the likelihood function has two or more high peaks. When it is important for an estimator to remain reliable, it becomes necessary to consider alternatives, such as set estimators. An obvious first choice might be confidence intervals or confidence regions, but there can be difficulties in computing and interpreting them (and sometimes they might still be blind to multiple peaks in the likelihood). Bayesians seize on this to argue for replacing confidence regions with credible regions. Yet Bayesian statistics require a prior, which is not always a natural part of the problem formulation. This paper demonstrates how a re-interpretation of the prior as a weighting function makes an otherwise Bayesian estimator meaningful in the frequentist context. The weighting function interpretation also serves as a reminder that an estimator should always be designed in the context of its intended application; unlike a prior which ostensibly depends on prior knowledge, a weighting function depends on the intended application. This paper uses the time-of-arrival (TOA) problem to illustrate all these points. It also derives a basic theory of region-based estimators distinct from confidence regions.</description>

      <title>Brain Foundation Models: A Survey on Advancements in Neural Signal Processing and Brain Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain foundation models (BFMs) have emerged as a transformative paradigm in computational neuroscience, offering a revolutionary framework for processing diverse neural signals across different brain-related tasks. These models leverage large-scale pre-training techniques, allowing them to generalize effectively across multiple scenarios, tasks, and modalities, thus overcoming the traditional limitations faced by conventional artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in understanding complex brain data. By tapping into the power of pretrained models, BFMs provide a means to process neural data in a more unified manner, enabling advanced analysis and discovery in the field of neuroscience. In this survey, we define BFMs for the first time, providing a clear and concise framework for constructing and utilizing these models in various applications. We also examine the key principles and methodologies for developing these models, shedding light on how they transform the landscape of neural signal processing. This survey presents a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in BFMs, covering the most recent methodological innovations, novel views of application areas, and challenges in the field. Notably, we highlight the future directions and key challenges that need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of BFMs. These challenges include improving the quality of brain data, optimizing model architecture for better generalization, increasing training efficiency, and enhancing the interpretability and robustness of BFMs in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Implicit Generative Modeling by Kernel Similarity Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how the brain encodes stimuli has been a fundamental problem in computational neuroscience. Insights into this problem have led to the design and development of artificial neural networks that learn representations by incorporating brain-like learning abilities. Recently, learning representations by capturing similarity between input samples has been studied to tackle this problem. This approach, however, has thus far been used to only learn downstream features from an input and has not been studied in the context of a generative paradigm, where one can map the representations back to the input space, incorporating not only bottom-up interactions (stimuli to latent) but also learning features in a top-down manner (latent to stimuli). We investigate a kernel similarity matching framework for generative modeling. Starting with a modified sparse coding objective for learning representations proposed in prior work, we demonstrate that representation learning in this context is equivalent to maximizing similarity between the input kernel and a latent kernel. We show that an implicit generative model arises from learning the kernel structure in the latent space and show how the framework can be adapted to learn manifold structures, potentially providing insights as to how task representations can be encoded in the brain. To solve the objective, we propose a novel Alternate Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm and discuss the interpretation of the optimization process. Finally, we discuss how this representation learning problem can lead towards a biologically plausible architecture to learn the model parameters that ties together representation learning using similarity matching (a bottom-up approach) with predictive coding (a top-down approach).</description>

      <title>Optimal Bilinear Equalizer Beamforming Design for Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks with Arbitrary Channel Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the distributed optimal bilinear equalizer (OBE) beamforming design for both the uplink and downlink cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output networks. We consider arbitrary statistics-based channel estimators over spatially correlated Rician fading channels. In the uplink, we derive the achievable spectral efficiency (SE) performance and OBE combining schemes with arbitrary statistics-based channel estimators and compute their respective closed-form expressions. It is insightful to explore that the achievable SE performance is not dependent on the choice of channel estimator when OBE combining schemes are applied over Rayleigh channels. In the downlink, we derive the achievable SE performance expressions with BE precoding schemes and arbitrary statistics-based channel estimators utilized and compute them in closed form. Then, we obtain the OBE precoding scheme leveraging insights from uplink OBE combining schemes.</description>

      <title>High-Q non-invasive Glucose Sensor using MicrostripLine Main Field and Split Ring Resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A high-Q sensor integrating microstrip line (MLIN) main field and split ring resonators is presented for non-invasive glucose sensing. The proposed sensor combines the field-focusing effects of split ring resonators with the enhanced field substrate interaction properties of the MLIN main field, using the reflection coefficient (S11) of an open-ended MLIN with the finger as the substrate and operating at 750 MHz and 1.5 GHz. The permittivity of blood inside the finger depends on the glucose concentration, which in turn affects the S11 of the system. Sensor geometry was optimized using Method-of-Moments simulation before the sensor was fabricated and validated on standard solutions of glucose concentrations between 0 to 126 mg/dL within the physiological range, and a human test subject. In both experiments, a near inverse-linear relationship between the S11 peak magnitude and the glucose concentration was observed, demonstrating the sensitivity of the proposed sensor for detecting changes in blood glucose concentration at physiological conditions.</description>

      <title>FlowDec: A flow-based full-band general audio codec with high perceptual quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose FlowDec, a neural full-band audio codec for general audio sampled at 48 kHz that combines non-adversarial codec training with a stochastic postfilter based on a novel conditional flow matching method. Compared to the prior work ScoreDec which is based on score matching, we generalize from speech to general audio and move from 24 kbit/s to as low as 4 kbit/s, while improving output quality and reducing the required postfilter DNN evaluations from 60 to 6 without any fine-tuning or distillation techniques. We provide theoretical insights and geometric intuitions for our approach in comparison to ScoreDec as well as another recent work that uses flow matching, and conduct ablation studies on our proposed components. We show that FlowDec is a competitive alternative to the recent GAN-dominated stream of neural codecs, achieving FAD scores better than those of the established GAN-based codec DAC and listening test scores that are on par, and producing qualitatively more natural reconstructions for speech and harmonic structures in music.</description>

      <title>Application of the List Viterbi Algorithm for Satellite-based AIS Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Satellites receiving Automatic Identification System (AIS) packets in dense areas are particularly prone to AIS channel overload due to the extensive number of vessels. Thus a failure of detection might be caused by the collisions among AIS messages. To improve the detection capability, we propose to exploit the presence of the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) in AIS frames by using the parallel list Viterbi algorithm (PLVA) instead of the classical Viterbi algorithm (VA) often used for decoding AIS signals. The performance of combining the PLVA with AIS post processing including the CRC is studied with two detectors, one coherent and the other differential, in two channel models: a single-user AWGN channel and a more realistic multiple-access AIS channel. We also show the impact of the PLVA parameters on the success recovery rate. The simulation results show that the resulting procedure can significantly improve the packet error rate (PER) at the cost of a limited increase of the computational complexity. The proposed technique could be applied to improve the performance of interference cancellation receivers by significantly lowering the AIS decoding threshold.</description>

      <title>ECG-EmotionNet: Nested Mixture of Expert (NMoE) Adaptation of ECG-Foundation Model for Driver Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driver emotion recognition plays a crucial role in driver monitoring systems, enhancing human-autonomy interactions and the trustworthiness of Autonomous Driving (AD). Various physiological and behavioural modalities have been explored for this purpose, with Electrocardiogram (ECG) emerging as a standout choice for real-time emotion monitoring, particularly in dynamic and unpredictable driving conditions. Existing methods, however, often rely on multi-channel ECG signals recorded under static conditions, limiting their applicability in real-world dynamic driving scenarios. To address this limitation, the paper introduces ECG-EmotionNet, a novel architecture designed specifically for emotion recognition in dynamic driving environments. ECG-EmotionNet is constructed by adapting a recently introduced ECG Foundation Model (FM) and uniquely employs single-channel ECG signals, ensuring both robust generalizability and computational efficiency. Unlike conventional adaptation methods such as full fine-tuning, linear probing, or low-rank adaptation, we propose an intuitively pleasing alternative, referred to as the nested Mixture of Experts (MoE) adaptation. More precisely, each transformer layer of the underlying FM is treated as a separate expert, with embeddings extracted from these experts fused using trainable weights within a gating mechanism. This approach enhances the representation of both global and local ECG features, leading to a 6% improvement in accuracy and a 7% increase in the F1 score, all while maintaining computational efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed ECG-EmotionNet architecture is evaluated using a recently introduced and challenging driver emotion monitoring dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in nanosatellite technology lead to more Earth-observation satellites in low-Earth orbit. We explore using nanosatellite constellations to achieve low-latency detection for time-critical events, such as forest fires, oil spills, and floods. The detection latency comprises three parts: capture, compute and transmission. Previous solutions reduce transmission latency, but we find that the bottleneck is capture latency, accounting for more than 90% of end-to-end latency. We present a measurement study on how various satellite and ground station design factors affect latency. We offer design guidance to operators on how to choose satellite orbital configurations and design an algorithm to choose ground station locations. For six use cases, our design guidance reduces end-to-end latency by 5.6 to 8.2 times compared to the existing system.</description>

Abstract: Hybrid light fidelity (LiFi) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) indoor networks has been envisioned as a promising technology to alleviate radio frequency spectrum crunch to accommodate the ever-increasing data rate demand in indoor scenarios. The hybrid LiFi/WiFi indoor networks can leverage the advantages of fast data transmission from LiFi and wider coverage of WiFi, thus complementing well with each other and further improving the network performance compared with the standalone networks. However, to leverage the co-existence, several challenges should be addressed, including but not limited to user association, mobility support, and efficient resource allocation. Therefore, the objective of the paper is to design a new user-access point association algorithm to maximize the sum throughput of the hybrid networks. We first mathematically formulate the sum data rate maximization problem by determining the AP selection for each user in indoor networks with consideration of user mobility and practical capacity limitations, which is a nonconvex binary integer programming problem. To solve this problem, we then propose a sequential-proximal policy optimization (S-PPO) based deep reinforcement learning method. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the proposed method by comparing it with exhaustive search (ES), signal strength strategy (SSS), and trust region policy optimization (TRPO) methods. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our solution algorithm can outperform SSS by about 32.25% of the sum throughput and 19.09% of the fairness on average, and outperform TRPO by about 10.34% and 10.23%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Enabling Massive Index Modulation Systems via Combinatorics-Free Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Index modulation (IM) is one of the key enabling technologies for beyond fifth generation (B5G) and sixth generation (6G) wireless systems, attracting attention for its inherent energy and spectral efficiency resulting from conveying information through the indexation of the resources utilized in during signal transmission. However, a remaining critical bottleneck for large-scale IM is the consequently infeasible detection complexity of combinatoric order. Therefore in this article, in order to maximally reap the advantages of IM in large scenarios, we propose a novel message passing (MP) decoder designed under the Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) framework exploiting a novel unit vector decomposition (UVD) of IM signals with purpose-derived novel probability distributions. The proposed method enjoys a low decoding complexity that is independent of previously prohibitive combinatorial factors, while still approach-ing the performance of unfeasible state-of-the-art (SotA) search-based methods. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated via complexity analysis and numerical results for the exemplary piloted generalized quadrature spatial modulation (GQSM) systems of truly massive sizes (up to 96 antennas).</description>

      <title>Optimal Bilinear Equalizer for Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems over Correlated Rician Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the low-complexity optimal bilinear equalizer (OBE) combining scheme design for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output networks with spatially correlated Rician fading channels. We provide a spectral efficiency (SE) performance analysis framework for both the centralized and distributed processing schemes with bilinear equalizer (BE)-structure combining schemes applied. The BE-structured combining is a set of schemes that are constructed by the multiplications of channel statistics-based BE matrices and instantaneous channel estimates. Notably, we derive closed-form achievable SE expressions for centralized and distributed BE-structured combining schemes. We propose one centralized and two distributed OBE schemes: Centralized OBE (C-OBE), Distributed OBE based on Global channel statistics (DG-OBE), and Distributed OBE based on Local channel statistics (DL-OBE), which maximize their respective SE expressions. OBE matrices in these schemes are tailored based on varying levels of channel statistics. Notably, we obtain new and insightful closed-form results for the C-OBE, DG-OBE, and DL-OBE combining schemes. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed OBE schemes can achieve excellent SE, even in scenarios with severe pilot contamination.</description>

Abstract: Although digitalization of future power grids offer several coordination incentives, the reliability and security of information and communication technologies (ICT) hinders its overall performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture Spike Talk via a unified representation of power and information as a means of data normalization using spikes for coordinated control of microgrids. This grid-edge technology allows each distributed energy resource (DER) to execute decentralized secondary control philosophy independently by interacting among each other using power flow along the tie-lines. Inspired from the field of computational neuroscience, Spike Talk basically builds on a fine-grained parallelism on the information transfer theory in our brains, particularly when neurons (modeled as DERs) transmit information (inferred from power streams measurable at each DER) through synapses (modeled as tie-lines). Not only does Spike Talk simplify and address the current bottlenecks of the cyber-physical architectural operation by dismissing the ICT layer, it provides intrinsic operational and cost-effective opportunities in terms of infrastructure development, computations and modeling. Hence, this paper provides a pedagogic illustration of the key concepts and design theories. Since we focus on coordinated control of microgrids in this paper, the signaling accuracy and system performance is studied for several neural coding schemes responsible for converting the real-valued local measurements into spikes.</description>

Abstract: Impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) signals stand out for their high temporal resolution, low cost, and large bandwidth, making them a highly promising option for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. In this paper, we design an ISAC system for a bi-static passive sensing scenario that accommodates multiple targets. Specifically, we introduce two typical modulation schemes, PPM and BPSK, for data transmission. The essential coupling between sensing and communication is examined through the Fisher information matrix (FIM). Accordingly, we introduce a pilot-based decoupling approach that relies on known time-delays, as well as a differential decoupling strategy that uses a known starting symbol position. Finally, we assess the sensing and communication performance under various modulation and demodulation schemes under the constraints of current UWB standards. This assessment utilizes the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for sensing and the Shannon capacity limit for communication, offering theoretical insights into choosing suitable data signal processing methods in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>AnyECG: Foundational Models for Multitask Cardiac Analysis in Real-World Settings</title>

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG), a non-invasive and affordable tool for cardiac monitoring, is highly sensitive in detecting acute heart attacks. However, due to the lengthy nature of ECG recordings, numerous machine learning methods have been developed for automated heart disease detection to reduce human workload. Despite these efforts, performance remains suboptimal. A key obstacle is the inherent complexity of ECG data, which includes heterogeneity (e.g., varying sampling rates), high levels of noise, demographic-related pattern shifts, and intricate rhythm-event associations. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces AnyECG, a foundational model designed to extract robust representations from any real-world ECG data. Specifically, a tailored ECG Tokenizer encodes each fixed-duration ECG fragment into a token and, guided by proxy tasks, converts noisy, continuous ECG features into discrete, compact, and clinically meaningful local rhythm codes. These codes encapsulate basic morphological, frequency, and demographic information (e.g., sex), effectively mitigating signal noise. We further pre-train the AnyECG to learn rhythmic pattern associations across ECG tokens, enabling the capture of cardiac event semantics. By being jointly pre-trained on diverse ECG data sources, AnyECG is capable of generalizing across a wide range of downstream tasks where ECG signals are recorded from various devices and scenarios. The experimental results show that AnyECG achieves an average performance improvement of 6% across four critical tasks-anomaly detection, arrhythmia classification, corrupted lead generation, and ultra-long ECG recognition. AnyECG learns common ECG rhythm from data and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in each of these tasks.</description>

      <title>CBraMod: A Criss-Cross Brain Foundation Model for EEG Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07236v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique to measure and record brain electrical activity, widely used in various BCI and healthcare applications. Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited by specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and generalizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing body of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still leave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full EEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between all EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal dependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of EEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited generalizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats of EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we propose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a criss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural characteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal dependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we utilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode positional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with diverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through patch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10 downstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong capability and generalizability. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/wjq-learning/CBraMod.</description>

      <title>Synesthesia of Machine (SoM)-Driven Analog Precoder Optimization for Enhanced ISAC Performance in Sub-THz Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13532v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is anticipated to be widely used in future sub-terahertz (sub-THz) systems. With the line-of-sight (LoS) propagation characteristics of sub-THz channels, ISAC transmitter design largely parallels analog precoder optimization. However, balancing both sensing and communication functionalities is challenging due to the beam squint effect in sub-THz systems, limiting ISAC performance gains. To overcome this, the unique design flexibility of sub-THz analog hardware is explored to better adapt to the electromagnetic characteristics of sub-THz channels. It is demonstrated that adjusting the equivalent channel through the analog precoder enhances dual-functional gains. Based on this, a near-optimal benchmark for analog precoder optimization is proposed. To address excessive algorithmic complexity, inspiration is drawn from the synesthesia of machine (SoM) to develop a lightweight complex-valued squint-aware network (CSP-Net). This network reduces complexity by utilizing both communication and sensing channel data, with an architecture tailored to specific data and task characteristics. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is validated through simulations.</description>

      <title>Interference-Robust Broadband Rapidly-Varying MIMO Communications: A Knowledge-Data Dual Driven Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel time-efficient framework is proposed for improving the robustness of a broadband multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system against unknown interference under rapidly-varying channels. A mean-squared error (MSE) minimization problem is formulated by optimizing the beamformers employed. Since the unknown interference statistics are the premise for solving the formulated problem, an interference statistics tracking (IST) module is first designed. The IST module exploits both the time- and spatial-domain correlations of the interference-plus-noise (IPN) covariance for the future predictions with data training. Compared to the conventional signal-free space sampling approach, the IST module can realize zero-pilot and low-latency estimation. Subsequently, an interference-resistant hybrid beamforming (IR-HBF) module is presented, which incorporates both the prior knowledge of the theoretical optimization method as well as the data-fed training. Taking advantage of the interpretable network structure, the IR-HBF module enables the simplified mapping from the interference statistics to the beamforming weights. The simulations are executed in high-mobility scenarios, where the numerical results unveil that: 1) the proposed IST module attains promising prediction accuracy compared to the conventional counterparts under different snapshot sampling errors; and 2) the proposed IR-HBF module achieves lower MSE with significantly reduced computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Near-Field and Far-Field Localization with Multiple Holographic MIMO Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Localization methods based on holographic multiple input multiple output (HMIMO) have gained much attention for its potential to achieve high accuracy. By deploying multiple HMIMOs, we can improve the link quality and system coverage. As the scale of HMIMO increases to improve beam control capability, the near-field (NF) region of each HMIMO expands. However, existing multiple HMIMO-enabled methods mainly focus on the far-field (FF) of each HMIMO, which leads to low localization accuracy when applied in the NF. In this paper, a hybrid NF and FF localization method aided by multiple RISs, a low cost implementation of HMIMO, is proposed. In such a scenario, it is difficult to achieve user localization and RIS optimization since the equivalent NF of all RISs expands, which results in high complexity, and we need to handle the interference caused by multiple RISs. To tackle this challenge, we propose a two-phase RIS-enabled localization method that first estimate the relative locations of the user to each RIS and fuse the results to obtain the global estimation. In this way, the algorithm complexity is reduced. We formulate the RIS optimization problem to keep the RIS sidelobe as low as possible to minimize the interference. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through simulations.</description>

Abstract: In the field of artificial intelligence, self-supervised learning has demonstrated superior generalization capabilities by leveraging large-scale unlabeled datasets for pretraining, which is especially critical for wireless communication models to adapt to a variety of scenarios. This paper innovatively treats Channel State Information (CSI) and Channel Impulse Response (CIR) as naturally aligned multi-modal data and proposes the first MIMO wireless channel foundation model, named CSI-CLIP. By effectively capturing the joint representations of both CIR and CSI, CSI-CLIP exhibits remarkable adaptability across scenarios and robust feature extraction capabilities. Experimental results show that in positioning task, CSI-CLIP reduces the mean error distance by 22%; in beam management task, it increases accuracy by 1% compared to traditional supervised methods, as well as in the channel identification task. These improvements not only highlight the potential and value of CSI-CLIP in integrating sensing and communication but also demonstrate its significant advantages over existing techniques. Moreover, viewing CSI and CIR as multi-modal pairs and contrastive learning for wireless channel foundation model open up new research directions in the domain of MIMO wireless communications.</description>

      <title>An Attention-Assisted Multi-Modal Data Fusion Model for Real-Time Estimation of Underwater Sound Velocity</title>

Abstract: The estimation of underwater sound velocity distribution serves as a critical basis for facilitating effective underwater communication and precise positioning, given that variations in sound velocity influence the path of signal transmission. Conventional techniques for the direct measurement of sound velocity, as well as methods that involve the inversion of sound velocity utilizing acoustic field data, necessitate on--site data collection. This requirement not only places high demands on device deployment, but also presents challenges in achieving real-time estimation of sound velocity distribution. In order to construct a real-time sound velocity field and eliminate the need for underwater onsite data measurement operations, we propose a self-attention embedded multimodal data fusion convolutional neural network (SA-MDF-CNN) for real-time underwater sound speed profile (SSP) estimation. The proposed model seeks to elucidate the inherent relationship between remote sensing sea surface temperature (SST) data, the primary component characteristics of historical SSPs, and their spatial coordinates. This is achieved by employing CNNs and attention mechanisms to extract local and global correlations from the input data, respectively. The ultimate objective is to facilitate a rapid and precise estimation of sound velocity distribution within a specified task area. Experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper has lower root mean square error (RMSE) and stronger robustness than other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel indoor positioning approach that leverages antenna radiation pattern characteristics through Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) measurements in a single-antenna system. By rotating the antenna or reconfiguring its radiation pattern, we derive a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) algorithm that achieves near-optimal positioning accuracy approaching the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Through theoretical analysis, we establish three fundamental theorems characterizing the estimation accuracy bounds and demonstrating how performance improves with increased signal-to-noise ratio, antenna rotation count, and radiation pattern variations. Additionally, we propose a two-position measurement strategy that eliminates dependence on receiving antenna patterns. Simulation results validate that our approach provides an effective solution for indoor robot tracking applications where both accuracy and system simplicity are essential considerations.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents the concept, design, channel modeling, beamforming algorithm, prototype fabrication, and experimental measurement of an electromagnetically reconfigurable fluid antenna system (ER-FAS), in which each FAS array element features electromagnetic (EM) reconfigurability. Unlike most existing FAS works that investigate spatial reconfigurability, the proposed ER-FAS enables direct control over the EM characteristics of each element, allowing for dynamic radiation pattern reconfigurability. Specifically, a novel ER-FAS architecture leveraging software-controlled fluidics is proposed, and corresponding wireless channel models are established. A low-complexity greedy beamforming algorithm is developed to jointly optimize the analog phase shift and the radiation state of each array element. The accuracy of the ER-FAS channel model and the effectiveness of the beamforming algorithm are validated through (i) full-wave EM simulations and (ii) numerical spectral efficiency evaluations. Simulation results confirm that the proposed ER-FAS significantly enhances spectral efficiency compared to conventional antenna arrays. To further validate this design, we fabricate hardware prototypes for both the ER-FAS element and array, using Galinstan liquid metal alloy, fluid silver paste, and software-controlled fluidic channels. The simulation results are experimentally verified through prototype measurements conducted in an anechoic chamber. Additionally, indoor communication trials are conducted via a pair of software-defined radios which demonstrate superior received power and bit error rate performance of the ER-FAS prototype. This work presents the first demonstration of a liquid-based ER-FAS in array configuration for enhancing communication systems.</description>

      <title>Analytical Framework for Effective Degrees of Freedom in Near-Field XL-MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15280</link>

Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is an emerging transceiver technology for enabling next-generation communication systems, due to its potential for substantial enhancement in both the spectral efficiency and spatial resolution. However, the achievable performance limits of various promising XL-MIMO configurations have yet to be fully evaluated, compared, and discussed. In this paper, we develop an effective degrees of freedom (EDoF) performance analysis framework specifically tailored for near-field XL-MIMO systems. We explore five representative distinct XL-MIMO hardware designs, including uniform planar array (UPA)-based with infinitely thin dipoles, two-dimensional (2D) continuous aperture (CAP) plane-based, UPA-based with patch antennas, uniform linear array (ULA)-based, and one-dimensional (1D) CAP line segment-based XL-MIMO systems. Our analysis encompasses two near-field channel models: the scalar and dyadic Green's function-based channel models. More importantly, when applying the scalar Green's function-based channel, we derive EDoF expressions in the closed-form, characterizing the impacts of the physical size of the transceiver, the transmitting distance, and the carrier frequency. In our numerical results, we evaluate and compare the EDoF performance across all examined XL-MIMO designs, confirming the accuracy of our proposed closed-form expressions. Furthermore, we observe that with an increasing number of antennas, the EDoF performance for both UPA-based and ULA-based systems approaches that of 2D CAP plane and 1D CAP line segment-based systems, respectively. Moreover, we unveil that the EDoF performance for near-field XL-MIMO systems is predominantly determined by the array aperture size rather than the sheer number of antennas.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Message Passing for Learning on Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05569v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs are crucial for modelling higher-order interactions in real-world data. Hypergraph neural networks (HNNs) effectively utilise these structures by message passing to generate informative node features for various downstream tasks like node classification. However, the message passing module in existing HNNs typically requires a computationally intensive training process, which limits their practical use. To tackle this challenge, we propose an alternative approach by decoupling the usage of hypergraph structural information from the model learning stage. This leads to a novel training-free message passing module, named TF-MP-Module, which can be precomputed in the data preprocessing stage, thereby reducing the computational burden. We refer to the hypergraph neural network equipped with our TF-MP-Module as TF-HNN. We theoretically support the efficiency and effectiveness of TF-HNN by showing that: 1) It is more training-efficient compared to existing HNNs; 2) It utilises as much information as existing HNNs for node feature generation; and 3) It is robust against the oversmoothing issue while using long-range interactions. Experiments based on seven real-world hypergraph benchmarks in node classification and hyperlink prediction show that, compared to state-of-the-art HNNs, TF-HNN exhibits both competitive performance and superior training efficiency. Specifically, on the large-scale benchmark, Trivago, TF-HNN outperforms the node classification accuracy of the best baseline by 10% with just 1% of the training time of that baseline.</description>

      <title>On A Class of Greedy Sparse Recovery Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse signal recovery deals with finding the sparest solution of an under-determined linear system $x = Q s$. In this paper, we propose a novel greedy approach to addressing the challenges from such a problem. Such an approach is based on a characterization of solutions to the system, which allows us to work on the sparse recovery in the $s$-space directly with a given measure. With $l_2$-based measure, an orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-type algorithm is proposed, which significantly outperforms the classical OMP algorithm in terms of recovery accuracy while maintaining comparable computational complexity. An $l_1$-based algorithm, denoted as $\text{Alg}_{GL1}$, is derived. Such an algorithm significantly outperforms the classical basis pursuit (BP) algorithm. Combining with the CoSaMP-strategy for selecting atoms, a class of high performance greedy algorithms is also derived. Extensive numerical simulations on both synthetic and image data are carried out, with which the superior performance of our proposed algorithms is demonstrated in terms of sparse recovery accuracy and robustness against numerical instability of the system matrix $Q$ and disturbance in the measurement $x$.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective Representation for Numbers in Clinical Narratives: A CamemBERT-Bio-Based Alternative to Large-Scale LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The processing of numerical values is a rapidly developing area in the field of Language Models (LLMs). Despite numerous advancements achieved by previous research, significant challenges persist, particularly within the healthcare domain. This paper investigates the limitations of Transformer models in understanding numerical values. \textit{Objective:} this research aims to categorize numerical values extracted from medical documents into eight specific physiological categories using CamemBERT-bio. \textit{Methods:} In a context where scalable methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) are emphasized, we explore lifting the limitations of transformer-based models. We examine two strategies: fine-tuning CamemBERT-bio on a small medical dataset, integrating Label Embedding for Self-Attention (LESA), and combining LESA with additional enhancement techniques such as Xval. Given that CamemBERT-bio is already pre-trained on a large medical dataset, the first approach aims to update its encoder with the newly added label embeddings technique. In contrast, the second approach seeks to develop multiple representations of numbers (contextual and magnitude-based) to achieve more robust number embeddings. \textit{Results:} As anticipated, fine-tuning the standard CamemBERT-bio on our small medical dataset did not improve F1 scores. However, significant improvements were observed with CamemBERT-bio + LESA, resulting in an over 13\% increase. Similar enhancements were noted when combining LESA with Xval, outperforming conventional methods and giving comparable results to GPT-4 \textit{Conclusions and Novelty:} This study introduces two innovative techniques for handling numerical data, which are also applicable to other modalities. We illustrate how these techniques can improve the performance of Transformer-based models, achieving more reliable classification results even with small datasets.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model(LLM) assisted End-to-End Network Health Management based on Multi-Scale Semanticization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network device and system health management is the foundation of modern network operations and maintenance. Traditional health management methods, relying on expert identification or simple rule-based algorithms, struggle to cope with the dynamic heterogeneous networks (DHNs) environment. Moreover, current state-of-the-art distributed anomaly detection methods, which utilize specific machine learning techniques, lack multi-scale adaptivity for heterogeneous device information, resulting in unsatisfactory diagnostic accuracy for DHNs. In this paper, we develop an LLM-assisted end-to-end intelligent network health management framework. The framework first proposes a Multi-Scale Semanticized Anomaly Detection Model (MSADM), incorporating semantic rule trees with an attention mechanism to address the multi-scale anomaly detection problem in DHNs. Secondly, a chain-of-thought-based large language model is embedded in downstream to adaptively analyze the fault detection results and produce an analysis report with detailed fault information and optimization strategies. Experimental results show that the accuracy of our proposed MSADM for heterogeneous network entity anomaly detection is as high as 91.31\%.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Spatial Diversity in Earth-to-Satellite Quantum-Classical Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite being an integral part of the vision of quantum Internet, Earth-to-satellite (uplink) quantum communications have been considered more challenging than their satellite-to-Earth (downlink) counterparts due to the severe channel-loss fluctuations (fading) induced by atmospheric turbulence. The question of how to address the negative impact of fading on Earth-to-satellite quantum communications remains largely an open issue. In this work, we explore the feasibility of exploiting spatial diversity as a means of fading mitigation in Earth-to-satellite Continuous-Variable (CV) quantum-classical optical communications. We demonstrate, via both our theoretical analyses of quantum-state evolution and our detailed numerical simulations of uplink optical channels, that the use of spatial diversity can improve the effectiveness of entanglement distribution through the use of multiple transmitting ground stations and a single satellite with multiple receiving apertures. We further show that the transfer of both large (classically-encoded) and small (quantum-modulated) coherent states can benefit from the use of diversity over fading channels. Our work represents the first quantitative investigation into the use of spatial diversity for satellite-based quantum communications in the uplink direction, showing under what circumstances this fading-mitigation paradigm, which has been widely adopted in classical communications, can be helpful within the context of Earth-to-satellite CV quantum communications.</description>

      <title>Robust Score-Based Quickest Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11094v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Methods in the field of quickest change detection rapidly detect in real-time a change in the data-generating distribution of an online data stream. Existing methods have been able to detect this change point when the densities of the pre- and post-change distributions are known. Recent work has extended these results to the case where the pre- and post-change distributions are known only by their score functions. This work considers the case where the pre- and post-change score functions are known only to correspond to distributions in two disjoint sets. This work employs a pair of "least-favorable" distributions to robustify the existing score-based quickest change detection algorithm, the properties of which are studied. This paper calculates the least-favorable distributions for specific model classes and provides methods of estimating the least-favorable distributions for common constructions. Simulation results are provided demonstrating the performance of our robust change detection algorithm.</description>

      <title>Hybrid STAR-RIS Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15570v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is recognized as one of the key enabling technologies for sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication networks, facilitating diverse emerging applications and services in an energy and cost-efficient manner. This paper proposes a multi-user multi-target ISAC system to enable full-space coverage for communication and sensing tasks. The proposed system employs a hybrid simultaneous transmission and reflection reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) comprising active transmissive and passive reflective elements. In the proposed scheme, the passive reflective elements support communication and sensing links for local communication users and sensing targets situated within the same physical region as the base station (BS), while low-power active transmissive elements are deployed to improve sensing performance and overcome high path attenuation due to multi-hop transmission for distant communication users and sensing targets situated far from of the coverage area of the BS. Moreover, to optimize the transmissive/reflective coefficients of the hybrid STAR-RIS, a semi-definite relaxation (SDR)-based algorithm is proposed. Furthermore, to evaluate communication and sensing performance, signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) and Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) metrics have been derived and investigated via conducting extensive computer simulations.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Analysis of Spatial and Temporal Land Clutter Statistics in SAR Imaging Based on MSTAR Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The statistical analysis of land clutter for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging has become an increasingly important subject for research and investigation. It is also absolutely necessary for designing robust algorithms capable of performing the task of target detection in the background clutter. Any attempt to extract the energy of the desired targets from the land clutter requires complete knowledge of the statistical properties of the background clutter. In this paper, the spatial as well as the temporal characteristics of the land clutter are studied. Since the data for each image has been collected based on a different aspect angle; therefore, the temporal analysis contains variation in the aspect angle. Consequently, the temporal analysis includes the characteristics of the radar cross section with respect to the aspect angle based on which the data has been collected. In order to perform the statistical analysis, several well-known and relevant distributions, namely, Weibull, Log-normal, Gamma, and Rayleigh are considered as prime candidates to model the land clutter. The goodness-of-fit test is based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence metric. The detailed analysis presented in this paper demonstrates that the Weibull distribution is a more accurate fit for the temporal-aspect-angle statistical analysis while the Rayleigh distribution models the spatial characteristics of the background clutter with higher accuracy. Finally, based on the aforementioned statistical analyses and by utilizing the Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithm, we perform target detection in land clutter. The overall verification of the analysis is performed by exploiting the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) data-set, which has been collected in spotlight mode at X-band, and the results are presented.</description>

      <title>Long-Term EEG Partitioning for Seizure Onset Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models have recently shown great success in classifying epileptic patients using EEG recordings. Unfortunately, classification-based methods lack a sound mechanism to detect the onset of seizure events. In this work, we propose a two-stage framework, SODor, that explicitly models seizure onset through a novel task formulation of subsequence clustering. Given an EEG sequence, the framework first learns a set of second-level embeddings with label supervision. It then employs model-based clustering to explicitly capture long-term temporal dependencies in EEG sequences and identify meaningful subsequences. Epochs within a subsequence share a common cluster assignment (normal or seizure), with cluster or state transitions representing successful onset detections. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our method can correct misclassifications, achieving 5\%-11\% classification improvements over other baselines and accurately detecting seizure onsets.</description>

      <title>Computing Capacity-Cost Functions for Continuous Channels in Wasserstein Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10670v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of computing capacity-cost (C-C) functions for continuous channels. Motivated by the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) proximal reformulation of the classical Blahut-Arimoto (BA) algorithm, the Wasserstein distance is introduced to the proximal term for the continuous case, resulting in an iterative algorithm related to the Wasserstein gradient descent. Practical implementation involves moving particles along the negative gradient direction of the objective function's first variation in the Wasserstein space and approximating integrals by the importance sampling (IS) technique. Such formulation is also applied to the rate-distortion (R-D) function for continuous source spaces and thus provides a unified computation framework for both problems.</description>
