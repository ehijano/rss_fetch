      <title>BVE + EKF: A viewpoint estimator for the estimation of the object's position in the 3D task space using Extended Kalman Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RGB-D sensors face multiple challenges operating under open-field environments because of their sensitivity to external perturbations such as radiation or rain. Multiple works are approaching the challenge of perceiving the 3D position of objects using monocular cameras. However, most of these works focus mainly on deep learning-based solutions, which are complex, data-driven, and difficult to predict. So, we aim to approach the problem of predicting the 3D objects' position using a Gaussian viewpoint estimator named best viewpoint estimator (BVE) powered by an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The algorithm proved efficient on the tasks and reached a maximum average Euclidean error of about 32 mm. The experiments were deployed and evaluated in MATLAB using artificial Gaussian noise. Future work aims to implement the system in a robotic system.</description>

      <title>Towards the Development of a Tendon-Actuated Galvanometer for Endoscopic Surgical Laser Scanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a need for precision pathological sensing, imaging, and tissue manipulation in neurosurgical procedures, such as brain tumor resection. Precise tumor margin identification and resection can prevent further growth and protect critical structures. Surgical lasers with small laser diameters and steering capabilities can allow for new minimally invasive procedures by traversing through complex anatomy, then providing energy to sense, visualize, and affect tissue. In this paper, we present the design of a small-scale tendon-actuated galvanometer (TAG) that can serve as an end-effector tool for a steerable surgical laser. The galvanometer sensor design, fabrication, and kinematic modeling are presented and derived. It can accurately rotate up to 30.14 degrees (or a laser reflection angle of 60.28 degrees). A kinematic mapping of input tendon stroke to output galvanometer angle change and a forward-kinematics model relating the end of the continuum joint to the laser end-point are derived and validated.</description>

      <title>Task and Motion Planning for Execution in the Real</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task and motion planning represents a powerful set of hybrid planning methods that combine reasoning over discrete task domains and continuous motion generation. Traditional reasoning necessitates task domain models and enough information to ground actions to motion planning queries. Gaps in this knowledge often arise from sources like occlusion or imprecise modeling. This work generates task and motion plans that include actions cannot be fully grounded at planning time. During execution, such an action is handled by a provided human-designed or learned closed-loop behavior. Execution combines offline planned motions and online behaviors till reaching the task goal. Failures of behaviors are fed back as constraints to find new plans. Forty real-robot trials and motivating demonstrations are performed to evaluate the proposed framework and compare against state-of-the-art. Results show faster execution time, less number of actions, and more success in problems where diverse gaps arise. The experiment data is shared for researchers to simulate these settings. The work shows promise in expanding the applicable class of realistic partially grounded problems that robots can address.</description>

      <title>POAM: Probabilistic Online Attentive Mapping for Efficient Robotic Information Gathering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) models are widely used for Robotic Information Gathering (RIG) in exploring unknown environments due to their ability to model complex phenomena with non-parametric flexibility and accurately quantify prediction uncertainty. Previous work has developed informative planners and adaptive GP models to enhance the data efficiency of RIG by improving the robot's sampling strategy to focus on informative regions in non-stationary environments. However, computational efficiency becomes a bottleneck when using GP models in large-scale environments with limited computational resources. We propose a framework -- Probabilistic Online Attentive Mapping (POAM) -- that leverages the modeling strengths of the non-stationary Attentive Kernel while achieving constant-time computational complexity for online decision-making. POAM guides the optimization process via variational Expectation Maximization, providing constant-time update rules for inducing inputs, variational parameters, and hyperparameters. Extensive experiments in active bathymetric mapping tasks demonstrate that POAM significantly improves computational efficiency, model accuracy, and uncertainty quantification capability compared to existing online sparse GP models.</description>

      <title>Advancing The Robotics Software Development Experience: Bridging Julia's Performance and Python's Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotics programming typically involves a trade-off between the ease of use offered by Python and the run-time performance of C++. While multi-language architectures address this trade-off by coupling Python's ergonomics with C++'s speed, they introduce complexity at the language interface. This paper proposes using Julia for performance-critical tasks within Python ROS 2 applications, providing an elegant solution that streamlines the development process without disrupting the existing Python workflow.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Model-Free Dynamic State Estimation for a Soft Robot Finger Using an Embedded Optical Waveguide Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, an advanced stretchable optical waveguide sensor is implemented into a multidirectional PneuNet soft actuator to enhance dynamic state estimation through a NARX neural network. The stretchable waveguide featuring a semidivided core design from previous work is sensitive to multiple strain modes. It is integrated into a soft finger actuator with two pressure chambers that replicates human finger motions. The soft finger, designed for applications in soft robotic grippers or hands, is viewed in isolation under pneumatic actuation controlled by motorized linear stages. The research first characterizes the soft finger's workspace and sensor response. Subsequently, three dynamic state estimators are developed using NARX architecture, differing in the degree of incorporating the optical waveguide sensor response. Evaluation on a testing path reveals that the full sensor response significantly improves end effector position estimation, reducing mean error by 51\% from 5.70 mm to 2.80 mm, compared to only 21\% improvement to 4.53 mm using the estimator representing a single core waveguide design. The letter concludes by discussing the application of these estimators for (open-loop) model-predictive control and recommends future focus on advanced, structured soft (optical) sensors for model-free state estimation and control of soft robots.</description>

      <title>Gait-Adaptive Navigation and Human Searching in field with Cyborg Insect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on improving the ability of cyborg insects to navigate autonomously during search and rescue missions in outdoor environments. We propose an algorithm that leverages data from an IMU to calculate orientation and position based on the insect's walking gait. These computed factors serve as essential feedback channels across 3 phases of our exploration. Our method functions without relying on external systems. The results of our trials, carried out in both indoor (4.8 x 6.6 m^2) and outdoor (3.5 x 6.0 m^2) settings, show that the cyborg insect is capable of seeking a human without knowing the human's position. This exploration strategy would help to bring terrestrial cyborg insects closer to practical application in real-life search and rescue (SAR) missions.</description>

      <title>Phase-Amplitude Reduction-Based Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose the use of the phase-amplitude reduction method to construct an imitation learning framework. Imitating human movement trajectories is recognized as a promising strategy for generating a range of human-like robot movements. Unlike previous dynamical system-based imitation learning approaches, our proposed method allows the robot not only to imitate a limit cycle trajectory but also to replicate the transient movement from the initial or disturbed state to the limit cycle. Consequently, our method offers a safer imitation learning approach that avoids generating unpredictable motions immediately after disturbances or from a specified initial state. We first validated our proposed method by reconstructing a simple limit-cycle attractor. We then compared the proposed approach with a conventional method on a lemniscate trajectory tracking task with a simulated robot arm. Our findings confirm that our proposed method can more accurately generate transient movements to converge on a target periodic attractor compared to the previous standard approach. Subsequently, we applied our method to a real robot arm to imitate periodic human movements.</description>

      <title>RoboCoder: Robotic Learning from Basic Skills to General Tasks with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has improved the prospects for robotic tasks. However, existing benchmarks are still limited to single tasks with limited generalization capabilities. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark and an autonomous learning framework, RoboCoder aimed at enhancing the generalization capabilities of robots in complex environments. Unlike traditional methods that focus on single-task learning, our research emphasizes the development of a general-purpose robotic coding algorithm that enables robots to leverage basic skills to tackle increasingly complex tasks. The newly proposed benchmark consists of 80 manually designed tasks across 7 distinct entities, testing the models' ability to learn from minimal initial mastery. Initial testing revealed that even advanced models like GPT-4 could only achieve a 47% pass rate in three-shot scenarios with humanoid entities. To address these limitations, the RoboCoder framework integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with a dynamic learning system that uses real-time environmental feedback to continuously update and refine action codes. This adaptive method showed a remarkable improvement, achieving a 36% relative improvement. Our codes will be released.</description>

      <title>Touch100k: A Large-Scale Touch-Language-Vision Dataset for Touch-Centric Multimodal Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Touch holds a pivotal position in enhancing the perceptual and interactive capabilities of both humans and robots. Despite its significance, current tactile research mainly focuses on visual and tactile modalities, overlooking the language domain. Inspired by this, we construct Touch100k, a paired touch-language-vision dataset at the scale of 100k, featuring tactile sensation descriptions in multiple granularities (i.e., sentence-level natural expressions with rich semantics, including contextual and dynamic relationships, and phrase-level descriptions capturing the key features of tactile sensations). Based on the dataset, we propose a pre-training method, Touch-Language-Vision Representation Learning through Curriculum Linking (TLV-Link, for short), inspired by the concept of curriculum learning. TLV-Link aims to learn a tactile representation for the GelSight sensor and capture the relationship between tactile, language, and visual modalities. We evaluate our representation's performance across two task categories (namely, material property identification and robot grasping prediction), focusing on tactile representation and zero-shot touch understanding. The experimental evaluation showcases the effectiveness of our representation. By enabling TLV-Link to achieve substantial improvements and establish a new state-of-the-art in touch-centric multimodal representation learning, Touch100k demonstrates its value as a valuable resource for research.

      <title>Bench2Drive: Towards Multi-Ability Benchmarking of Closed-Loop End-To-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an era marked by the rapid scaling of foundation models, autonomous driving technologies are approaching a transformative threshold where end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) emerges due to its potential of scaling up in the data-driven manner. However, existing E2E-AD methods are mostly evaluated under the open-loop log-replay manner with L2 errors and collision rate as metrics (e.g., in nuScenes), which could not fully reflect the driving performance of algorithms as recently acknowledged in the community. For those E2E-AD methods evaluated under the closed-loop protocol, they are tested in fixed routes (e.g., Town05Long and Longest6 in CARLA) with the driving score as metrics, which is known for high variance due to the unsmoothed metric function and large randomness in the long route. Besides, these methods usually collect their own data for training, which makes algorithm-level fair comparison infeasible.
  To fulfill the paramount need of comprehensive, realistic, and fair testing environments for Full Self-Driving (FSD), we present Bench2Drive, the first benchmark for evaluating E2E-AD systems' multiple abilities in a closed-loop manner. Bench2Drive's official training data consists of 2 million fully annotated frames, collected from 10000 short clips uniformly distributed under 44 interactive scenarios (cut-in, overtaking, detour, etc), 23 weathers (sunny, foggy, rainy, etc), and 12 towns (urban, village, university, etc) in CARLA v2. Its evaluation protocol requires E2E-AD models to pass 44 interactive scenarios under different locations and weathers which sums up to 220 routes and thus provides a comprehensive and disentangled assessment about their driving capability under different situations. We implement state-of-the-art E2E-AD models and evaluate them in Bench2Drive, providing insights regarding current status and future directions.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Language-Based Communication in Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embodied robots which can interact with their environment and neighbours are increasingly being used as a test case to develop Artificial Intelligence. This creates a need for multimodal robot controllers which can operate across different types of information including text. Large Language Models are able to process and generate textual as well as audiovisual data and, more recently, robot actions. Language Models are increasingly being applied to robotic systems; these Language-Based robots leverage the power of language models in a variety of ways. Additionally, the use of language opens up multiple forms of information exchange between members of a human-robot team. This survey motivates the use of language models in robotics, and then delineates works based on the part of the overall control flow in which language is incorporated. Language can be used by human to task a robot, by a robot to inform a human, between robots as a human-like communication medium, and internally for a robot's planning and control. Applications of language-based robots are explored, and finally numerous limitations and challenges are discussed to provide a summary of the development needed for language-based robotics moving forward.

      <title>Data-driven Explainable Controller for Soft Robots based on Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinearity and hysteresis of soft robot motions have posed challenges in accurate soft robot control. Neural networks, especially recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have been widely leveraged for this issue due to their nonlinear activation functions and recurrent structures. Although they have shown satisfying accuracy in most tasks, these black-box approaches are not explainable, and hence, they are unsuitable for areas with high safety requirements, like robot-assisted surgery. Based on the RNN controllers, we propose a data-driven explainable controller (DDEC) whose parameters can be updated online. We discuss the Jacobian controller and kinematics controller in theory and demonstrate that they are only special cases of DDEC. Moreover, we utilize RNN, the Jacobian controller, the kinematics controller, and DDECs for trajectory following tasks. Experimental results have shown that our approach outperforms the other controllers considering trajectory following errors while being explainable. We also conduct a study to explore and explain the functions of each DDEC component. This is the first interpretable soft robot controller that overcomes the shortcomings of both NN controllers and interpretable controllers. Future work may involve proposing different DDECs based on different RNN controllers and exploiting them for high-safety-required applications.</description>

      <title>Redundancy-aware Action Spaces for Robot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint space and task space control are the two dominant action modes for controlling robot arms within the robot learning literature. Actions in joint space provide precise control over the robot's pose, but tend to suffer from inefficient training; actions in task space boast data-efficient training but sacrifice the ability to perform tasks in confined spaces due to limited control over the full joint configuration. This work analyses the criteria for designing action spaces for robot manipulation and introduces ER (End-effector Redundancy), a novel action space formulation that, by addressing the redundancies present in the manipulator, aims to combine the advantages of both joint and task spaces, offering fine-grained comprehensive control with overactuated robot arms whilst achieving highly efficient robot learning. We present two implementations of ER, ERAngle (ERA) and ERJoint (ERJ), and we show that ERJ in particular demonstrates superior performance across multiple settings, especially when precise control over the robot configuration is required. We validate our results both in simulated and real robotic environments.</description>

      <title>MARLander: A Local Path Planning for Drone Swarms using Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving safe and precise landings for a swarm of drones poses a significant challenge, primarily attributed to conventional control and planning methods. This paper presents the implementation of multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) techniques for the precise landing of a drone swarm at relocated target locations. The system is trained in a realistic simulated environment with a maximum velocity of 3 m/s in training spaces of 4 x 4 x 4 m and deployed utilizing Crazyflie drones with a Vicon indoor localization system. The experimental results revealed that the proposed approach achieved a landing accuracy of 2.26 cm on stationary and 3.93 cm on moving platforms surpassing a baseline method used with a Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller with an Artificial Potential Field (APF). This research highlights drone landing technologies that eliminate the need for analytical centralized systems, potentially offering scalability and revolutionizing applications in logistics, safety, and rescue missions.</description>

      <title>Text-to-Drive: Diverse Driving Behavior Synthesis via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating varied scenarios through simulation is crucial for training and evaluating safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles. Yet, the task of modeling the trajectories of other vehicles to simulate diverse and meaningful close interactions remains prohibitively costly. Adopting language descriptions to generate driving behaviors emerges as a promising strategy, offering a scalable and intuitive method for human operators to simulate a wide range of driving interactions. However, the scarcity of large-scale annotated language-trajectory data makes this approach challenging.
  To address this gap, we propose Text-to-Drive (T2D) to synthesize diverse driving behaviors via Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce a knowledge-driven approach that operates in two stages. In the first stage, we employ the embedded knowledge of LLMs to generate diverse language descriptions of driving behaviors for a scene. Then, we leverage LLM's reasoning capabilities to synthesize these behaviors in simulation. At its core, T2D employs an LLM to construct a state chart that maps low-level states to high-level abstractions. This strategy aids in downstream tasks such as summarizing low-level observations, assessing policy alignment with behavior description, and shaping the auxiliary reward, all without needing human supervision. With our knowledge-driven approach, we demonstrate that T2D generates more diverse trajectories compared to other baselines and offers a natural language interface that allows for interactive incorporation of human preference.

      <title>DeepRacer on Physical Track: Parameters Exploration and Performance Evaluation</title>

Abstract: This paper focuses on the physical racetrack capabilities of AWS DeepRacer. Two separate experiments were conducted. The first experiment (Experiment I) focused on evaluating the impact of hyperparameters on the physical environment. Hyperparameters such as gradient descent batch size and loss type were changed systematically as well as training time settings. The second experiment (Experiment II) focused on exploring AWS DeepRacer object avoidance in the physical environment. It was uncovered that in the simulated environment, models with a higher gradient descent batch size had better performance than models with a lower gradient descent batch size. Alternatively, in the physical environment, a gradient descent batch size of 128 appears to be preferable. It was found that models using the loss type of Huber outperformed models that used the loss type of MSE in both the simulated and physical environments. Finally, object avoidance in the simulated environment appeared to be effective; however, when bringing these models to the physical environment, there was a pronounced challenge to avoid objects. Therefore, object avoidance in the physical environment remains an open challenge.</description>

      <title>Tool-Planner: Dynamic Solution Tree Planning for Large Language Model with Tool Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional reasoning capabilities, enabling them to solve various complex problems. Recently, this ability has been applied to the paradigm of tool learning. Tool learning involves providing examples of tool usage and their corresponding functions, allowing LLMs to formulate plans and demonstrate the process of invoking and executing each tool. LLMs can address tasks that they cannot complete independently, thereby enhancing their potential across different tasks. However, this approach faces two key challenges. First, redundant error correction leads to unstable planning and long execution time. Additionally, designing a correct plan among multiple tools is also a challenge in tool learning. To address these issues, we propose Tool-Planner, a task-processing framework based on toolkits. Tool-Planner groups tools based on the API functions with the same function into a toolkit and allows LLMs to implement planning across the various toolkits. When a tool error occurs, the language model can reselect and adjust tools based on the toolkit. Experiments show that our approach demonstrates a high pass and win rate across different datasets and optimizes the planning scheme for tool learning in models such as GPT-4 and Claude 3, showcasing the potential of our method.</description>

      <title>Monocular Localization with Semantics Map for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and robust localization remains a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles. The cost of sensors and limitations in local computational efficiency make it difficult to scale to large commercial applications. Traditional vision-based approaches focus on texture features that are susceptible to changes in lighting, season, perspective, and appearance. Additionally, the large storage size of maps with descriptors and complex optimization processes hinder system performance. To balance efficiency and accuracy, we propose a novel lightweight visual semantic localization algorithm that employs stable semantic features instead of low-level texture features. First, semantic maps are constructed offline by detecting semantic objects, such as ground markers, lane lines, and poles, using cameras or LiDAR sensors. Then, online visual localization is performed through data association of semantic features and map objects. We evaluated our proposed localization framework in the publicly available KAIST Urban dataset and in scenarios recorded by ourselves. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is a reliable and practical localization solution in various autonomous driving localization tasks.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the concept of Active Representation Learning, a novel class of problems that intertwines exploration and representation learning within partially observable environments. We extend ideas from Active Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (active SLAM), and translate them to scientific discovery problems, exemplified by adaptive microscopy. We explore the need for a framework that derives exploration skills from representations that are in some sense actionable, aiming to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of data collection and model building in the natural sciences.</description>

      <title>GenSafe: A Generalizable Safety Enhancer for Safe Reinforcement Learning Algorithms Based on Reduced Order Markov Decision Process Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although deep reinforcement learning has demonstrated impressive achievements in controlling various autonomous systems, e.g., autonomous vehicles or humanoid robots, its inherent reliance on random exploration raises safety concerns in their real-world applications. To improve system safety during the learning process, a variety of Safe Reinforcement Learning (SRL) algorithms have been proposed, which usually incorporate safety constraints within the Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) framework. However, the efficacy of these SRL algorithms often relies on accurate function approximations, a task that is notably challenging to accomplish in the early learning stages due to data insufficiency. To address this problem, we introduce a Genralizable Safety enhancer (GenSafe) in this work. Leveraging model order reduction techniques, we first construct a Reduced Order Markov Decision Process (ROMDP) as a low-dimensional proxy for the original cost function in CMDP. Then, by solving ROMDP-based constraints that are reformulated from the original cost constraints, the proposed GenSafe refines the actions taken by the agent to enhance the possibility of constraint satisfaction. Essentially, GenSafe acts as an additional safety layer for SRL algorithms, offering broad compatibility across diverse SRL approaches. The performance of GenSafe is examined on multiple SRL benchmark problems. The results show that, it is not only able to improve the safety performance, especially in the early learning phases, but also to maintain the task performance at a satisfactory level.</description>

      <title>Class-Aware Cartilage Segmentation for Autonomous US-CT Registration in Robotic Intercostal Ultrasound Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrasound imaging has been widely used in clinical examinations owing to the advantages of being portable, real-time, and radiation-free. Considering the potential of extensive deployment of autonomous examination systems in hospitals, robotic US imaging has attracted increased attention. However, due to the inter-patient variations, it is still challenging to have an optimal path for each patient, particularly for thoracic applications with limited acoustic windows, e.g., intercostal liver imaging. To address this problem, a class-aware cartilage bone segmentation network with geometry-constraint post-processing is presented to capture patient-specific rib skeletons. Then, a dense skeleton graph-based non-rigid registration is presented to map the intercostal scanning path from a generic template to individual patients. By explicitly considering the high-acoustic impedance bone structures, the transferred scanning path can be precisely located in the intercostal space, enhancing the visibility of internal organs by reducing the acoustic shadow. To evaluate the proposed approach, the final path mapping performance is validated on five distinct CTs and two volunteer US data, resulting in ten pairs of CT-US combinations. Results demonstrate that the proposed graph-based registration method can robustly and precisely map the path from CT template to individual patients (Euclidean error: $2.21\pm1.11~mm$).</description>

      <title>Improving Physics-Augmented Continuum Neural Radiance Field-Based Geometry-Agnostic System Identification with Lagrangian Particle Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometry-agnostic system identification is a technique for identifying the geometry and physical properties of an object from video sequences without any geometric assumptions. Recently, physics-augmented continuum neural radiance fields (PAC-NeRF) has demonstrated promising results for this technique by utilizing a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian representation, in which the geometry is represented by the Eulerian grid representations of NeRF, the physics is described by a material point method (MPM), and they are connected via Lagrangian particles. However, a notable limitation of PAC-NeRF is that its performance is sensitive to the learning of the geometry from the first frames owing to its two-step optimization. First, the grid representations are optimized with the first frames of video sequences, and then the physical properties are optimized through video sequences utilizing the fixed first-frame grid representations. This limitation can be critical when learning of the geometric structure is difficult, for example, in a few-shot (sparse view) setting. To overcome this limitation, we propose Lagrangian particle optimization (LPO), in which the positions and features of particles are optimized through video sequences in Lagrangian space. This method allows for the optimization of the geometric structure across the entire video sequence within the physical constraints imposed by the MPM. The experimental results demonstrate that the LPO is useful for geometric correction and physical identification in sparse-view settings.</description>

      <title>Shield Synthesis for LTL Modulo Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) models have achieved remarkable success in various domains. However, these models also tend to demonstrate unsafe behaviors, precluding their deployment in safety-critical systems. To cope with this issue, ample research focuses on developing methods that guarantee the safe behaviour of a given ML model. A prominent example is shielding which incorporates an external component (a "shield") that blocks unwanted behavior. Despite significant progress, shielding suffers from a main setback: it is currently geared towards properties encoded solely in propositional logics (e.g., LTL) and is unsuitable for richer logics. This, in turn, limits the widespread applicability of shielding in many real-world systems. In this work, we address this gap, and extend shielding to LTL modulo theories, by building upon recent advances in reactive synthesis modulo theories. This allowed us to develop a novel approach for generating shields conforming to complex safety specifications in these more expressive, logics. We evaluated our shields and demonstrate their ability to handle rich data with temporal dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach for synthesizing shields for such expressivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image segmentation is crucial for many fields such as agriculture, remote sensing, biomedical imaging, battlefield sensing and astronomy. However, the challenge of hyper and multi spectral imaging is its large data footprint. We propose both a novel camera design and a vision transformer-based (ViT) algorithm that alleviate both the captured data footprint and the computational load for hyperspectral segmentation. Our camera is able to adaptively sample image regions or patches at different resolutions, instead of capturing the entire hyperspectral cube at one high resolution. Our segmentation algorithm works in concert with the camera, applying ViT-based segmentation only to adaptively selected patches. We show results both in simulation and on a real hardware platform demonstrating both accurate segmentation results and reduced computational burden.</description>

Abstract: This work focuses on the problem of distributed optimization in multi-agent cyberphysical systems, where a legitimate agents' iterates are influenced both by the values it receives from potentially malicious neighboring agents, and by its own self-serving target function. We develop a new algorithmic and analytical framework to achieve resilience for the class of problems where stochastic values of trust between agents exist and can be exploited. In this case we show that convergence to the true global optimal point can be recovered, both in mean and almost surely, even in the presence of malicious agents. Furthermore, we provide expected convergence rate guarantees in the form of upper bounds on the expected squared distance to the optimal value. Finally, numerical results are presented that validate our analytical convergence guarantees even when the malicious agents compose the majority of agents in the network and where existing methods fail to converge to the optimal nominal points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Movement primitives are trainable parametric models that reproduce robotic movements starting from a limited set of demonstrations. Previous works proposed simple linear models that exhibited high sample efficiency and generalization power by allowing temporal modulation of movements (reproducing movements faster or slower), blending (merging two movements into one), via-point conditioning (constraining a movement to meet some particular via-points) and context conditioning (generation of movements based on an observed variable, e.g., position of an object). Previous works have proposed neural network-based motor primitive models, having demonstrated their capacity to perform tasks with some forms of input conditioning or time-modulation representations. However, there has not been a single unified deep motor primitive's model proposed that is capable of all previous operations, limiting neural motor primitive's potential applications. This paper proposes a deep movement primitive architecture that encodes all the operations above and uses a Bayesian context aggregator that allows a more sound context conditioning and blending. Our results demonstrate our approach can scale to reproduce complex motions on a larger variety of input choices compared to baselines while maintaining operations of linear movement primitives provide.</description>

Abstract: Robotic affordances, providing information about what actions can be taken in a given situation, can aid robotic manipulation. However, learning about affordances requires expensive large annotated datasets of interactions or demonstrations. In this work, we argue that well-directed interactions with the environment can mitigate this problem and propose an information-based measure to augment the agent's objective and accelerate the affordance discovery process. We provide a theoretical justification of our approach and we empirically validate the approach both in simulation and real-world tasks. Our method, which we dub IDA, enables the efficient discovery of visual affordances for several action primitives, such as grasping, stacking objects, or opening drawers, strongly improving data efficiency in simulation, and it allows us to learn grasping affordances in a small number of interactions, on a real-world setup with a UFACTORY XArm 6 robot arm.</description>

      <title>Reacting like Humans: Incorporating Intrinsic Human Behaviors into NAO through Sound-Based Reactions to Fearful and Shocking Events for Enhanced Sociability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robots' acceptability among humans and their sociability can be significantly enhanced by incorporating human-like reactions. Humans can react to environmental events very quickly and without thinking. An instance where humans show natural reactions is when they encounter a sudden and loud sound that startles or frightens them. During such moments, individuals may instinctively move their hands, turn toward the origin of the sound, and try to determine the event's cause. This inherent behavior motivated us to explore this less-studied part of social robotics. In this work, a multi-modal system composed of an action generator, sound classifier, and YOLO object detector was designed to sense the environment and, in the presence of sudden loud sounds, show natural human fear reactions; and finally, locate the fear-causing sound source in the environment. These valid generated motions and inferences could imitate intrinsic human reactions and enhance the sociability of robots. For motion generation, a model based on LSTM and MDN networks was proposed to synthesize various motions. Also, in the case of sound detection, a transfer learning model was preferred that used the spectrogram of the sound signals as its input. After developing individual models for sound detection, motion generation, and image recognition, they were integrated into a comprehensive "fear" module implemented on the NAO robot. Finally, the fear module was tested in practical application and two groups of experts and non-experts (in the robotics area) filled out a questionnaire to evaluate the performance of the robot. We indicated that the proposed module could convince the participants that the Nao robot acts and reasons like a human when a sudden and loud sound is in the robot's peripheral environment, and additionally showed that non-experts have higher expectations about social robots and their performance.</description>

      <title>Point Cloud Matters: Rethinking the Impact of Different Observation Spaces on Robot Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In robot learning, the observation space is crucial due to the distinct characteristics of different modalities, which can potentially become a bottleneck alongside policy design. In this study, we explore the influence of various observation spaces on robot learning, focusing on three predominant modalities: RGB, RGB-D, and point cloud. We introduce OBSBench, a benchmark comprising two simulators and 125 tasks, along with standardized pipelines for various encoders and policy baselines. Extensive experiments on diverse contact-rich manipulation tasks reveal a notable trend: point cloud-based methods, even those with the simplest designs, frequently outperform their RGB and RGB-D counterparts. This trend persists in both scenarios: training from scratch and utilizing pre-training. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that point cloud observations often yield better policy performance and significantly stronger generalization capabilities across various geometric and visual conditions. These outcomes suggest that the 3D point cloud is a valuable observation modality for intricate robotic tasks. We also suggest that incorporating both appearance and coordinate information can enhance the performance of point cloud methods. We hope our work provides valuable insights and guidance for designing more generalizable and robust robotic models.

      <title>Transformable Gaussian Reward Function for Socially-Aware Navigation with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robot navigation has transitioned from prioritizing obstacle avoidance to adopting socially aware navigation strategies that accommodate human presence. As a result, the recognition of socially aware navigation within dynamic human-centric environments has gained prominence in the field of robotics. Although reinforcement learning technique has fostered the advancement of socially aware navigation, defining appropriate reward functions, especially in congested environments, has posed a significant challenge. These rewards, crucial in guiding robot actions, demand intricate human-crafted design due to their complex nature and inability to be automatically set. The multitude of manually designed rewards poses issues with hyperparameter redundancy, imbalance, and inadequate representation of unique object characteristics. To address these challenges, we introduce a transformable gaussian reward function (TGRF).

      <title>Fast Iterative Region Inflation for Computing Large 2-D/3-D Convex Regions of Obstacle-Free Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convex polytopes have compact representations and exhibit convexity, which makes them suitable for abstracting obstacle-free spaces from various environments. Existing methods for generating convex polytopes always struggle to strike a balance between two requirements, producing high-quality polytope and efficiency. Moreover, another crucial requirement for convex polytopes to accurately contain certain seed point sets, such as a robot or a front-end path, is proposed in various tasks, which we refer to as manageability. In this paper, we show that we can achieve generation of high-quality convex polytope while ensuring both efficiency and manageability simultaneously, by introducing Fast Iterative Regional Inflation (FIRI).FIRI consists of two iteratively executed submodules: Restrictive Inflation (RsI) and computation of the Maximum Volume Inscribed Ellipsoid (MVIE) of convex polytope. By explicitly incorporating constraints that include the seed point set, RsI guarantees manageability. Meanwhile, the iterative monotonic optimization of MVIE, which serves as a lower bound of the volume of convex polytope, ensures high-quality results of FIRI. In terms of efficiency, we design methods tailored to the low-dimensional and multi-constrained nature of both modules, resulting in orders of magnitude improvement compared to generic solvers. Notably, for 2-D MVIE, we present a novel analytical algorithm that achieves linear-time complexity for the first time, further enhancing the efficiency of FIRI in the 2-D scenario. Extensive benchmarks conducted against state-of-the-art methods validate the superior performance of FIRI in terms of quality, manageability, and efficiency. Furthermore, various real-world applications showcase the generality and practicality of FIRI. The high-performance code of FIRI will be open-sourced for the reference of the community.</description>

      <title>Human Stress Response and Perceived Safety during Encounters with Quadruped Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the rise of mobile robot deployments in home and work settings, perceived safety of users and bystanders is understudied in the human-robot interaction (HRI) literature. To address this, we present a study designed to identify elements of a human-robot encounter that correlate with observed stress response. Stress is a key component of perceived safety and is strongly associated with human physiological response. In this study a Boston Dynamics Spot and a Unitree Go1 navigate autonomously through a shared environment occupied by human participants wearing multimodal physiological sensors to track their electrocardiography (ECG) and electrodermal activity (EDA). The encounters are varied through several trials and participants self-rate their stress levels after each encounter. The study resulted in a multidimensional dataset archiving various objective and subjective aspects of a human-robot encounter, containing insights for understanding perceived safety in such encounters. To this end, acute stress responses were decoded from the human participants' ECG and EDA and compared across different human-robot encounter conditions. Statistical analysis of data indicate that on average (1) participants feel more stress during encounters compared to baselines, (2) participants feel more stress encountering multiple robots compared to a single robot and (3) participants stress increases during navigation behavior compared with search behavior.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Generalizability of Assistive Robots Models over Various Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the domain of assistive robotics, the significance of effective modeling is well acknowledged. Prior research has primarily focused on enhancing model accuracy or involved the collection of extensive, often impractical amounts of data. While improving individual model accuracy is beneficial, it necessitates constant remodeling for each new task and user interaction. In this paper, we investigate the generalizability of different modeling methods. We focus on constructing the dynamic model of an assistive exoskeleton using six data-driven regression algorithms. Six tasks are considered in our experiments, including horizontal, vertical, diagonal from left leg to the right eye and the opposite, as well as eating and pushing. We constructed thirty-six unique models applying different regression methods to data gathered from each task. Each trained model's performance was evaluated in a cross-validation scenario, utilizing five folds for each dataset. These trained models are then tested on the other tasks that the model is not trained with. Finally the models in our study are assessed in terms of generalizability. Results show the superior generalizability of the task model performed along the horizontal plane, and decision tree based algorithms.</description>

      <title>Multi-AUV Kinematic Task Assignment based on Self-organizing Map Neural Network and Dubins Path Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07536v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To deal with the task assignment problem of multi-AUV systems under kinematic constraints, which means steering capability constraints for underactuated AUVs or other vehicles likely, an improved task assignment algorithm is proposed combining the Dubins Path algorithm with improved SOM neural network algorithm. At first, the aimed tasks are assigned to the AUVs by improved SOM neural network method based on workload balance and neighborhood function. When there exists kinematic constraints or obstacles which may cause failure of trajectory planning, task re-assignment will be implemented by change the weights of SOM neurals, until the AUVs can have paths to reach all the targets. Then, the Dubins paths are generated in several limited cases. AUV's yaw angle is limited, which result in new assignments to the targets. Computation flow is designed so that the algorithm in MATLAB and Python can realizes the path planning to multiple targets. Finally, simulation results prove that the proposed algorithm can effectively accomplish the task assignment task for multi-AUV system.</description>

      <title>Empowering Embodied Manipulation: A Bimanual-Mobile Robot Manipulation Dataset for Household Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advancements in embodied AI are increasingly enabling robots to tackle complex real-world tasks, such as household manipulation. However, the deployment of robots in these environments remains constrained by the lack of comprehensive bimanual-mobile robot manipulation data that can be learned. Existing datasets predominantly focus on single-arm manipulation tasks, while the few dual-arm datasets available often lack mobility features, task diversity, comprehensive sensor data, and robust evaluation metrics; they fail to capture the intricate and dynamic nature of household manipulation tasks that bimanual-mobile robots are expected to perform. To overcome these limitations, we propose BRMData, a Bimanual-mobile Robot Manipulation Dataset specifically designed for household applications. BRMData encompasses 10 diverse household tasks, including single-arm and dual-arm tasks, as well as both tabletop and mobile manipulations, utilizing multi-view and depth-sensing data information. Moreover, BRMData features tasks of increasing difficulty, ranging from single-object to multi-object grasping, non-interactive to human-robot interactive scenarios, and rigid-object to flexible-object manipulation, closely simulating real-world household applications. Additionally, we introduce a novel Manipulation Efficiency Score (MES) metric to evaluate both the precision and efficiency of robot manipulation methods in household tasks. We thoroughly evaluate and analyze the performance of advanced robot manipulation learning methods using our BRMData, aiming to drive the development of bimanual-mobile robot manipulation technologies. The dataset is now open-sourced and available at https://embodiedrobot.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Sequential memory improves sample and memory efficiency in Episodic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State of the art deep reinforcement learning algorithms are sample inefficient due to the large number of episodes they require to achieve asymptotic performance. Episodic Reinforcement Learning (ERL) algorithms, inspired by the mammalian hippocampus, typically use extended memory systems to bootstrap learning from past events to overcome this sample-inefficiency problem. However, such memory augmentations are often used as mere buffers, from which isolated past experiences are drawn to learn from in an offline fashion (e.g., replay). Here, we demonstrate that including a bias in the acquired memory content derived from the order of episodic sampling improves both the sample and memory efficiency of an episodic control algorithm. We test our Sequential Episodic Control (SEC) model in a foraging task to show that storing and using integrated episodes as event sequences leads to faster learning with fewer memory requirements as opposed to a standard ERL benchmark, Model-Free Episodic Control, that buffers isolated events only. We also study the effect of memory constraints and forgetting on the sequential and non-sequential version of the SEC algorithm. Furthermore, we discuss how a hippocampal-like fast memory system could bootstrap slow cortical and subcortical learning subserving habit formation in the mammalian brain.</description>

      <title>SchurVINS: Schur Complement-Based Lightweight Visual Inertial Navigation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01616v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accuracy and computational efficiency are the most important metrics to Visual Inertial Navigation System (VINS). The existing VINS algorithms with either high accuracy or low computational complexity, are difficult to provide the high precision localization in resource-constrained devices. To this end, we propose a novel filter-based VINS framework named SchurVINS, which could guarantee both high accuracy by building a complete residual model and low computational complexity with Schur complement. Technically, we first formulate the full residual model where Gradient, Hessian and observation covariance are explicitly modeled. Then Schur complement is employed to decompose the full model into ego-motion residual model and landmark residual model. Finally, Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) update is implemented in these two models with high efficiency. Experiments on EuRoC and TUM-VI datasets show that our method notably outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both accuracy and computational complexity. The experimental code of SchurVINS is available at https://github.com/bytedance/SchurVINS.</description>
