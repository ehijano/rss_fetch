      <title>Flocking under Fast and Large Jumps: Stability, Chaos, and Traveling Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a model for flocking given by a $n$-particle system under which each particle jumps forward by a random amount, independently sampled from a given distribution $\theta$, with rate given by a non-increasing function $w$ of its signed distance from the system center of mass. This model was introduced in Bal\'azs et. al. (2014) and some of its properties were studied for the case when $w$ is bounded. In the current work we are interested in the setting where $w$ is unbounded, and this feature results in a stochastic dynamical system for interacting particles with fast and large jumps for which little is available in the literature. We characterize the large $n$ limit (the so-called `fluid limit') of the empirical measure process associated with the system and prove a propagation of chaos result. Next, for the centered $n$-particle system, by constructing suitable Lyapunov functions, we establish existence and uniqueness of stationary distributions and study their tail properties. In the special case where $w$ is an exponential function and $\theta$ is an exponential distribution, by establishing that all stationary solutions of the McKean-Vlasov equation must be the unique fixed point of the equation, we prove a propagation of chaos result at $t=\infty$ and establish convergence of the particle system, starting from stationarity, in the large $n$ limit, to a traveling wave solution of the McKean-Vlasov equation. The proof of this result may be of interest for other interacting particle systems where convexity properties or functional inequalities generally used for establishing such a result are not available. Our work answers several open problems posed in Bal\'azs et. al.</description>

      <title>Stationary Measure of the Open KPZ Equation through the Enaud-Derrida Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works of Barraquand and Le Doussal and Bryc, Kuznetsov, Wang, and Wesolowski gave a description of the open KPZ stationary measure as the sum of a Brownian motion and a Brownian motion reweighted by a Radon-Nikodym derivative. Subsequent work of Barraquand and Le Doussal used the Enaud-Derrida representation of the DEHP algebra to formulate the open ASEP stationary measure in terms of the sum of a random walk and a random walk reweighted by a Radon-Nikodym derivative. They show that this Radon-Nikodym derivative converges pointwise to the Radon-Nikodym derivative that characterizes the open KPZ stationary measure. This article proves that the corresponding sequence of measures converges weakly to the open KPZ stationary measure. This provides an alternative proof of the probabilistic formulation of the open KPZ stationary measure, which avoids dealing explicitly with finite dimensional distributions. We also provide the first construction of the measure on intervals of a general length and for the full range of parameters in the fan region $(u+v&gt;0)$.</description>

      <title>A stochastic differential equation approach for an SIS model with non-linear incidence rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an analytically tractable SIS model with a non-linear incidence rate for the number of infectious individuals described through a stochastic differential equation (SDE). We guarantee the existence of a positive solution, and we study its regularity. We study the persistence and extinction regimes, and we give sufficient conditions under which the disease-free equilibrium point is an asymptotically stable equilibrium point with probability one. We provide sufficient conditions under which the model admits a unique stationary measure. Finally, we illustrate our findings using simulations.</description>

Abstract: We show that two independent elephant random walks on the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}$ meet each other finitely often or infinitely often depends on whether the memory parameter $p$ is strictly larger than $3/4$ or not. Asymptotic results for the distance between them are also obtained.</description>

      <title>A critical drift-diffusion equation: intermittent behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a drift-diffusion process with a time-independent and divergence-free random drift that is of white-noise character. We are interested in the critical case of two space dimensions, where one has to impose a small-scale cut-off for well-posedness, and is interested in the marginally super-diffusive behavior on large scales.
  In the presence of an (artificial) large-scale cut-off at scale L, as a consequence of standard stochastic homogenization theory, there exist harmonic coordinates with a stationary gradient $F_L$; the merit of these coordinates being that under their lens, the drift-diffusion process turns into a martingale.
  It has recently been established that the second moments diverge as $\mathbb{E}|F_L|^2\sim\sqrt{\ln L}$ for $L\uparrow\infty$. We quantitatively show that in this limit, and in the regime of small P\'eclet number, $|F_L|^2/\mathbb{E}|F_L|^2$ is not equi-integrable, and that $\mathbb{E}|{\rm det}F_L|/\mathbb{E}|F_L|^2 $ is small. Hence the Jacobian matrix of the harmonic coordinates is very peaked and non-conformal.
  We establish this asymptotic behavior by characterizing a proxy $\tilde F_L$ introduced in previous work as the solution of an It\^{o} SDE w. r. t. the variable $\ln L$, and which implements the concept of a scale-by-scale homogenization based on a variance decomposition and admits an efficient calculus. For this proxy, we establish $\mathbb{E}|\tilde F_L|^4\gg(\mathbb{E}|\tilde F_L|^2)^2$ and $\mathbb{E}({\rm det}\tilde F_L-1)^2\ll 1$. In view of the former property, we assimilate this phenomenon to intermittency. In fact, $\tilde F_L$ behaves like a tensorial stochastic exponential, and as a field can be assimilated to multiplicative Gaussian chaos.</description>

      <title>Tight matrices and heavy traffic steady state convergence in queueing networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Braverman et al. (2024), the authors prove that the stationary distribution of a multiclass queueing network converges to the stationary distribution of a semimartingale reflecting Brownian motion (SRBM) in heavy traffic. Among the sufficient conditions for the convergence is that the reflection matrix $R$ of the SRBM is "tight". In this paper, we study how we can verify this tightness of $R$. For a $2$-dimensional SRBM, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for $R$ to be tight, while, for a general dimension, we only give sufficient conditions. We then apply these results to the SRBMs arising from the diffusion approximations of multiclass queueing networks with static buffer priority service disciplines that are studied in Braverman et al. (2024). It is shown that $R$ is always tight for this network with two stations if $R$ is defined and completely-S. For the case of more than two stations, it is shown that $R$ is tight for reentrant lines with last-buffer-first-service (LBFS) discipline, but it is not always tight for reentrant line with first-buffer-first-service (FBFS) discipline.</description>

      <title>Absolute moments of the variance-gamma distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain exact formulas for the absolute raw and central moments of the variance-gamma distribution, as infinite series involving the modified Bessel function of the second kind and the modified Lommel function of the first kind. When the skewness parameter is equal to zero (the symmetric variance-gamma distribution), the infinite series reduces to a single term. Moreover, for the case that the shape parameter is a half-integer (in our parameterisation of the variance-gamma distribution), we obtain a closed-form expression for the absolute moments in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions. As a consequence, we deduce new exact formulas for the absolute raw and central moments of the asymmetric Laplace distribution and the product of two correlated zero mean normal random variables, and more generally the sum of independent copies of such random variables.</description>

      <title>Strong Existence and Uniqueness for Singular SDEs Driven by Stable Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the one-dimensional stochastic differential equation
  \begin{equation*}
  X_t = x_0 + L_t + \int_0^t \mu(X_s)ds, \quad t \geq 0,
  \end{equation*} where $\mu$ is a finite measure of Kato class $K_{\eta}$ with $\eta \in (0,\alpha-1]$ and $(L_t)_{t \geq 0}$ is a symmetric $\alpha$-stable process with $\alpha \in (1,2)$. We derive weak and strong well posedness for this equation when $\eta \leq\alpha-1$ and $\eta &lt; \alpha-1$, respectively, and show that the condition $\eta \leq \alpha-1$ is sharp for weak existence. We furthermore reformulate the equation in terms of the local time of the solution $(X_{t})_{t \geq 0}$ and prove its well posedness. To this end, we also derive a Tanaka-type formula for a symmetric, $\alpha$-stable processes with $\alpha \in (1,2)$ that is perturbed by an adapted, right-continuous process of finite variation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the soft Boolean model, a model that interpolates between the Boolean model and long-range percolation, where vertices are given via a stationary Poisson point process. Each vertex carries an independent Pareto-distributed radius and each pair of vertices is assigned another independent Pareto weight with a potentially different tail exponent. Two vertices are now connected if they are within distance of the larger radius multiplied by the edge weight. We determine the tail behaviour of the Euclidean diameter and the number of points of a typical maximally connected component in a subcritical percolation phase. For this, we present a sharp criterion in terms of the tail exponents of the edge-weight and radius distributions that distinguish a regime where the tail behaviour is controlled only by the edge exponent from a regime in which both exponents are relevant. Our proofs rely on fine path-counting arguments identifying the precise order of decay of the probability that far-away vertices are connected.</description>

      <title>The limit of the operator norm for random matrices with a variance profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study symmetric random matrices with variance profile satisfying certain conditions. We establish the convergence of the operator norm of these matrices to the largest element of the support of the limiting empirical spectral distribution. We prove that it is sufficient for the entries of the matrix to have finite only the $4$-th moment or the $4+\epsilon$ moment in order for the convergence to hold in probability or almost surely respectively. Our approach determines the behaviour of the operator norm for random symmetric or non-symmetric matrices whose variance profile is given by a step or a continuous function, random band matrices whose bandwidth is proportional to their dimension, random Gram matrices, triangular matrices and more.</description>

      <title>Dual Representation of Unbounded Dynamic Concave Utilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In several linear spaces of possibly unbounded endowments, we represent the dynamic concave utilities (hence the dynamic convex risk measures) as the solutions of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with unbounded terminal values, with the help of our recent existence and uniqueness results on unbounded solutions of scalar BSDEs whose generators have a linear, super-linear, sub-quadratic or quadratic growth. The Legendre-Fenchel transform (dual representation) of convex functions, the de la vall\'{e}e-Poussin theorem, and Young's and Gronwall's inequalities constitute the main ingredients of these representation results.</description>

      <title>Universality of the Wigner-Gurau limit for random tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a combinatorial approach for studying moments of the resolvent trace for random tensors proposed by Razvan Gurau. Our work is based on the study of hypergraphs and extends the combinatorial proof of moments convergence for Wigner's theorem. This also opens up paths for research akin to free probability for random tensors.
  Specifically, trace invariants form a complete basis of tensor invariants and constitute the moments of the resolvent trace. For a random tensor with entries independent, centered, with the right variance and bounded moments, we prove the convergence of the expectation and bound the variance of the balanced single trace invariant. This implies the universality of the convergence of the associated measure towards the law obtained by Gurau in the Gaussian case, whose limiting moments are given by the Fuss-Catalan numbers. This generalizes Wigner's theorem for random tensors.
  Additionally, in the Gaussian case, we show that the limiting distribution of the $k$-times contracted $p$-order random tensor by a deterministic vector is always the Wigner-Gurau law at order $p-k$, dilated by $\sqrt{\binom{p-1}{k}}$. This establishes a connection with the approach of random tensors through the matrix study of the $p-2$ contractions of the tensor.</description>

      <title>Relative weak compactness in infinite-dimensional Fefferman-Meyer duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $E$ be a Banach space such that $E'$ has the Radon-Nikod\'ym property. The aim of this work is to connect relative weak compactness in the $E$-valued martingale Hardy space $H^{1}(\mu,E)$ to a convex compactness criterion in a weaker topology, such as the topology of uniform convergence on compacts in measure. These results represent a dynamic version of the deep result of Diestel, Ruess, and Schachermayer on relative weak compactness in $L^{1}(\mu,E)$. In the reflexive case, we obtain a Kadec-Pe{\l}czy\'nski dichotomy for $H^{1}(\mu,E)$-bounded sequences, which decomposes a subsequence into a relatively weakly compact part, a pointwise weakly convexly convergent part, and a null part converging to zero uniformly on compacts in measure. As a corollary, we investigate a parameterized version of the vector-valued Koml\'os theorem without the assumption of $H^{1}(\mu,E)$-boundedness.</description>

      <title>Adjoint-Based Projections for Uncertainty Quantification near Stochastically Perturbed Limit Cycles and Tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new boundary-value problem formulation for quantifying uncertainty induced by the presence of small Brownian noise near transversally stable periodic orbits (limit cycles) and quasiperiodic invariant tori of the deterministic dynamical systems obtained in the absence of noise. The formulation uses adjoints to construct a continuous family of transversal hyperplanes that are invariant under the linearized deterministic flow near the limit cycle or quasiperiodic invariant torus. The intersections with each hyperplane of stochastic trajectories that remain near the deterministic cycle or torus over intermediate times may be approximated by a Gaussian distribution whose covariance matrix can be obtained from the solution to the corresponding boundary-value problem. In the case of limit cycles, the analysis improves upon results in the literature through the explicit use of state-space projections, transversality constraints, and symmetry-breaking parameters that ensure uniqueness of the solution despite the lack of hyperbolicity along the limit cycle. These same innovations are then generalized to the case of a quasiperiodic invariant torus of arbitrary dimension. In each case, a closed-form solution to the covariance boundary-value problem is found in terms of a convergent series. The methodology is validated against the results of numerical integration for two examples of stochastically perturbed limit cycles and one example of a stochastically perturbed two-dimensional quasiperiodic invariant torus. Finally, an implementation of the covariance boundary-value problem in the numerical continuation package coco is applied to analyze the small-noise limit near a two-dimensional quasiperiodic invariant torus in a nonlinear deterministic dynamical system in $\mathbb{R}^4$ that does not support closed-form analysis.</description>

      <title>Error Estimation in the Mean-Field Limit of Kinetic Flocking Models with Local Alignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an innovative particle system characterized by moderate interactions, designed to accurately approximate kinetic flocking models that incorporate singular interaction forces and local alignment mechanisms. We establish the existence of weak solutions to the corresponding flocking equations and provide an error estimate for the mean-field limit. This is achieved through the regularization of singular forces and a nonlocal approximation strategy for local alignments. We show that, by selecting the regularization and localization parameters logarithmically with respect to the number of particles, the particle system effectively approximates the mean-field equation.</description>

      <title>Contraction properties and differentiability of $p$-energy forms with applications to nonlinear potential theory on self-similar sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce new contraction properties called the generalized $p$-contraction property for $p$-energy forms as generalizations of many well-known inequalities, such as Clarkson's inequalities, the strong subadditivity and the ``Markov property'' in the theory of nonlinear Dirichlet forms, and show that any $p$-energy form satisfying Clarkson's inequalities is Fr\'{e}chet differentiable. We also verify the generalized $p$-contraction property for $p$-energy forms constructed by Kigami [Mem. Eur. Math. Soc. 5 (2023)] and by Cao--Gu--Qiu [Adv. Math. 405 (2022), no. 108517]. As a general framework of $p$-energy forms taking into consideration the generalized $p$-contraction property, we introduce the notion of $p$-resistance form and investigate fundamental properties for $p$-harmonic functions with respect to $p$-resistance forms. In particular, some new estimates on scaling factors of $p$-energy forms are obtained by establishing H\"{o}lder regularity estimates for harmonic functions, and the $p$-walk dimensions of the generalized Sierpi\'{n}ski carpets and $D$-dimensional level-$l$ Sierpi\'{n}ski gasket are shown to be strictly greater than $p$.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Graphon Theory: Fluctuations, Degeneracies, and Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exchangeable random graphs, which include some of the most widely studied network models, have emerged as the mainstay of statistical network analysis in recent years. Graphons, which are the central objects in graph limit theory, provide a natural way to sample exchangeable random graphs. It is well known that network moments (motif/subgraph counts) identify a graphon (up to an isomorphism), hence, understanding the sampling distribution of subgraph counts in random graphs sampled from a graphon is pivotal for nonparametric network inference. In this paper, we derive the joint asymptotic distribution of any finite collection of network moments in random graphs sampled from a graphon, that includes both the non-degenerate case (where the distribution is Gaussian) as well as the degenerate case (where the distribution has both Gaussian or non-Gaussian components). This provides the higher-order fluctuation theory for subgraph counts in the graphon model. We also develop a novel multiplier bootstrap for graphons that consistently approximates the limiting distribution of the network moments (both in the Gaussian and non-Gaussian regimes). Using this and a procedure for testing degeneracy, we construct joint confidence sets for any finite collection of motif densities. This provides a general framework for statistical inference based on network moments in the graphon model. To illustrate the broad scope of our results we also consider the problem of detecting global structure (that is, testing whether the graphon is a constant function) based on small subgraphs. We propose a consistent test for this problem, invoking celebrated results on quasi-random graphs, and derive its limiting distribution both under the null and the alternative.</description>

      <title>Plug-and-Play Algorithm Convergence Analysis From The Standpoint of Stochastic Differential Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithm is popular for inverse image problem-solving. However, this algorithm lacks theoretical analysis of its convergence with more advanced plug-in denoisers. We demonstrate that discrete PnP iteration can be described by a continuous stochastic differential equation (SDE). We can also achieve this transformation through Markov process formulation of PnP. Then, we can take a higher standpoint of PnP algorithms from stochastic differential equations, and give a unified framework for the convergence property of PnP according to the solvability condition of its corresponding SDE. We reveal that a much weaker condition, bounded denoiser with Lipschitz continuous measurement function would be enough for its convergence guarantee, instead of previous Lipschitz continuous denoiser condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exploit the structure of geometric graphs on Riemannian manifolds to analyze strategic dynamic graphs at the limit, when the number of nodes tends to infinity. This framework allows to preserve intrinsic geometrical information about the limiting graph structure, such as the Ollivier curvature. After introducing the setting, we derive a mean field game system, which models a strategic equilibrium between the nodes. It has the usual structure with the distinction of being set on a manifold. Finally, we establish existence and uniqueness of solutions to the system when the Hamiltonian is quadratic for a class of non-necessarily compact Riemannian manifolds, referred to as manifolds of bounded geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $t \in \mathbb{N}$ and every $i\in[t]$, let $H_i$ be a $d_i$-regular connected graph, with $1&lt;|V(H_i)|\le C$ for some integer $C\ge 2$. Let $G=\square_{i=1}^tH_i$ be the Cartesian product of $H_1, \ldots, H_t$. We show that if $t\ge 5C\log_2C$ then $G$ contains a (nearly-)perfect matching.
  Then, considering the random graph process on $G$, we generalise the result of Bollob\'as on the binary hypercube $Q^t$, showing that with high probability, the hitting times for minimum degree one, connectivity, and the existence of a (nearly-)perfect matching in the $G$-random-process are the same. We develop several tools which may be of independent interest in a more general setting of the typical existence of a perfect matching under percolation.</description>

      <title>Colored Stochastic Multiplicative Processes with Additive Noise Unveil a Third-Order PDE, Defying Conventional FPE and Fick-Law Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on stochastic differential equations (SDE) involving both additive and multiplicative noise has been extensive. In situations where the primary process is driven by a multiplicative stochastic process, additive white noise typically represents an intrinsic and unavoidable fast factor, including phenomena like thermal fluctuations, inherent uncertainties in measurement processes, or rapid wind forcing in ocean dynamics. This work focuses on a significant class of such systems, particularly those characterized by linear drift and multiplicative noise, extensively explored in the literature. Conventionally, multiplicative stochastic processes are also treated as white noise in existing studies. However, when considering colored multiplicative noise, the emphasis has been on characterizing the far tails of the probability density function (PDF), regardless of the spectral properties of the noise. In the absence of additive noise and with a general colored multiplicative SDE, standard perturbation approaches lead to a second-order PDE known as the Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE), consistent with Fick's law. This investigation unveils a notable departure from this standard behavior when introducing additive white noise. At the leading order of the stochastic process strength, perturbation approaches yield a \textit{third-order PDE}, irrespective of the white noise intensity. The breakdown of the FPE further signifies the breakdown of Fick's law. Additionally, we derive the explicit solution for the equilibrium PDF corresponding to this third-order PDE Master Equation. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate significant deviations from outcomes derived using the FPE obtained through the application of Fick's law.</description>

      <title>A Blaschke-Petkantschin formula for linear and affine subspaces with application to intersection probabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a uniformly distributed random linear subspace $L$ and a stochastically independent random affine subspace $E$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, both of fixed dimension. For a natural class of distributions for $E$ we show that the intersection $L\cap E$ admits a density with respect to the invariant measure. This density depends only on the distance $d(o,E \cap L)$ of $L\cap E$ to the origin and is derived explicitly. It can be written as the product of a power of $d(o,E \cap L)$ and a part involving an incomplete beta integral. Choosing $E$ uniformly among all affine subspaces of fixed dimension hitting the unit ball, we derive an explicit density for the random variable $d(o,E \cap L)$ and study the behavior of the probability that $E \cap L$ hits the unit ball in high dimensions. Lastly, we show that our result can be extended to the setting where $E$ is tangent to the unit sphere, in which case we again derive the density for $d(o,E \cap L)$. Our probabilistic results are derived by means of a new integral-geometric transformation formula of Blaschke--Petkantschin type.</description>

      <title>Dean-Kawasaki Equation with Singular Interactions and Applications to Dynamical Ising-Kac Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.12774v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by [Fehrman, Gess; Invent. Math., 2023] and [Fehrman, Gess; Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 2024], we consider the Dean-Kawasaki equation with singular interactions and correlated noise which can be viewed as fluctuating mean-field limits. By imposing the Ladyzhenskaya-Prodi-Serrin condition on the interaction kernel, the existence of probabilistic weak renormalized kinetic solutions is established. Further, under an additional integrability assumption on the divergence of the interaction kernel, a kinetic formulation approach is applied to derive pathwise uniqueness, leading to the strong well-posedness of the equation. As an application, we obtain the well-posedness of a conservative stochastic partial differential equations known as fluctuating Ising-Kac-Kawasaki dynamics, which paves a step on the conjecture concerning nonlinear fluctuations of Kawasaki dynamics proposed by [Giacomin, Lebowitz, Presutti; Math. Surveys Monogr., 1999].</description>

      <title>The Asynchronous DeGroot Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the asynchronous version of the DeGroot dynamics: In a connected graph $G$ with $n$ nodes, each node has an initial opinion in $[0,1]$ and an independent Poisson clock. When a clock at a node $v$ rings, the opinion at $v$ is replaced by the average opinion of its neighbors. It is well known that the opinions converge to a consensus. We show that the expected time $\mathbb E(\tau_\varepsilon)$ to reach $\varepsilon$-consensus is poly$(n)$ in undirected graphs and in Eulerian digraphs, but for some digraphs of bounded degree it is exponential.
  Our main result is that in undirected graphs and Eulerian digraphs, if the degrees are uniformly bounded and the initial opinions are i.i.d., then $\mathbb E(\tau_\varepsilon)=\text{polylog}(n)$ for every fixed $\varepsilon&gt;0$. We give sharp estimates for the variance of the limiting consensus opinion, which measures the ability to aggregate information (``wisdom of the crowd''). We also prove generalizations to non-reversible Markov chains and infinite graphs. New results of independent interest on fragmentation processes and coupled random walks are crucial to our analysis.</description>

Abstract: For a stationary random function $\xi$, sampled on a subset $D$ of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$, we examine the equivalence and orthogonality of two zero-mean Gaussian measures $\mathbb{P}_{1}$ and $\mathbb{P}_{2}$ associated with $\xi$. We give the isotropic analog to the result that the equivalence of $\mathbb{P}_{1}$ and $\mathbb{P}_{2}$ is linked with the existence of a square-integrable extension of the difference between the covariance functions of $\mathbb{P}_{1}$ and $\mathbb{P}_{2}$ from $D$ to $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. We show that the orthogonality of $\mathbb{P}_{1}$ and $\mathbb{P}_{2}$ can be recovered when the set of distances from points of $D$ to the origin is dense in the set of non-negative real numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grafakos systematically proved that $A_\infty$ weights have different characterizations for cubes in Euclidean spaces in his classical text book. Very recently, Duoandikoetxea, Mart\'{\i}n-Reyes, Ombrosi and Kosz discussed several characterizations of the $A_{\infty}$ weights in the setting of general bases. By conditional expectations, we study $A_\infty$ weights in martingale spaces. Because conditional expectations are Radon-Nikod\'{y}m derivatives with respect to sub$\hbox{-}\sigma\hbox{-}$fields which have no geometric structures, we need new ingredients. Under a regularity assumption on weights, we obtain equivalent characterizations of the $A_{\infty}$ weights. Moreover, using weights modulo conditional expectations, we have one-way implications of different characterizations.</description>

      <title>Wong-Zakai approximation for a class of SPDEs with fully local monotone coefficients and its application</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we establish the \textsl{Wong-Zakai approximation} result for a class of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with fully local monotone coefficients perturbed by a multiplicative Wiener noise. This class of SPDEs encompasses various fluid dynamic models and also includes quasi-linear SPDEs, the convection-diffusion equation, the Cahn-Hilliard equation, and the two-dimensional liquid crystal model. It has been established that the class of SPDEs in question is well-posed, however, the existence of a unique solution to the associated approximating system cannot be inferred from the solvability of the original system. We employ a Faedo-Galerkin approximation method, compactness arguments, and Prokhorov's and Skorokhod's representation theorems to ensure the existence of a \textsl{probabilistically weak solution} for the approximating system. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the solution is pathwise unique. Moreover, the classical Yamada-Watanabe theorem allows us to conclude the existence of a \textsl{probabilistically strong solution} (analytically weak solution) for the approximating system. Subsequently, we establish the Wong-Zakai approximation result for a class of SPDEs with fully local monotone coefficients. We utilize the Wong-Zakai approximation to establish the topological support of the distribution of solutions to the SPDEs with fully local monotone coefficients. Finally, we explore the physically relevant stochastic fluid dynamics models that are covered by this work's functional framework.</description>

      <title>A determinantal point process approach to scaling and local limits of random Young tableaux</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain scaling and local limit results for large random Young tableaux of fixed shape $\lambda^0$ via the asymptotic analysis of a determinantal point process due to Gorin and Rahman (2019). More precisely, we prove:
  (1) an explicit description of the limiting surface of a uniform random Young tableau of shape $\lambda^0$, based on solving a complex-valued polynomial equation;
  (2) a simple criteria to determine if the limiting surface is continuous in the whole domain;
  (3) and a local limit result in the bulk of a random Poissonized Young tableau of shape $\lambda^0$.
  Our results have several consequences, for instance: they lead to explicit formulas for the limiting surface of $L$-shaped tableaux, generalizing the results of Pittel and Romik (2007) for rectangular shapes; they imply that the limiting surface for $L$-shaped tableaux is discontinuous for almost-every $L$-shape; and they give a new one-parameter family of infinite random Young tableaux, constructed from the so-called random infinite bead process.</description>

      <title>Density Analysis for coupled forward-backward SDEs with non-Lipschitz drifts and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the existence of a continuous marginal law with respect to the Lebesgue measure for each component $(X,Y,Z)$ of the solution to coupled quadratic forward-backward stochastic differential equations (QFBSDEs) {for which the drift coefficient of the forward component is either bounded and measurable or H\"older continuous. Our approach relies on a combination of the existence of a weak {\it decoupling field} (see \cite{Delarue2}), the integration with respect to space time local time (see \cite{Ein2006}), the analysis of the backward Kolmogorov equation associated to the forward component along with an It\^o-Tanaka trick (see \cite{FlanGubiPrio10})}. The framework of this paper is beyond all existing papers on density analysis for Markovian BSDEs and constitutes a major refinement of the existing results. We also derive a comonotonicity theorem for the control variable in this frame and thus extending the works \cite{ChenKulWei05}, \cite{DosDos13}. As applications of our results, we first analyse the regularity of densities of solution to coupled FBSDEs. In the second example, we consider a regime switching term structure interest rate models (see for e.g., \cite{ChenMaYin17}) for which the corresponding FBSDE has discontinuous drift. Our results enables us to: firstly study classical and Malliavin differentiability of the solutions for such models, secondly the existence of density of such solutions. Lastly we consider a pricing and hedging problem of contingent claims on non-tradable underlying, when the dynamic of the latter is given by a regime switching SDE (i.e., the drift coefficient is allowed to be discontinuous). We obtain a representation of the derivative hedge as the weak derivative of the indifference price function, thus extending the result in \cite{ArImDR10}.</description>

      <title>A note on maximal conditional entropy on Lebesgue spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(X,\mathcal{B},P)$ be a probability space and $\mathit{a}$ be a sub $\sigma$-field that is generated by an increasing sequence of sub $\sigma$-fields $(\mathit{a}_{n})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$. Given $\theta \in \Theta$, where $\Theta$ is some set, let $(X_{n}^{\theta})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a martingale adapted to $(\mathit{a}_{n})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$. Martin (1969) provides sufficient conditions to show that $(X_{n}^{\theta})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges a.s. uniformly on $\Theta$ to a random variable $X^{\theta}$. His results are based on the assumption that there exists an integer $n$ s.t. the conditional entropy given $\mathit{a}_{n}$ is uniformly bounded over the set of finite partitions of $X$ with atoms from $\mathit{a}$. This study complements Martin's results by studying the latter assumption on the maximal conditional entropy in the context of measurable partitions of Lebesgue spaces. We provide conditions under which $\mathit{a}$ conveys too much information for the maximal conditional entropy to be finite. As an example, we consider the space of continuous functions with a compact support, equipped with the Borel $\sigma$-field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the well-posedness of stochastic S-KdV driven by multiplicative noises in $H_x^1\times H_x^1$. To get the local well-posedness, we first develop the bilinear and trilinear Bourgain norm estimates of the nonlinear terms with $b\in\left(0,1/2\right)$. Then, to overcome the lack of the maximum functional estimate, we introduce a series of approximation equations with localized nonlinear terms, which are also cutted-off in both the physical and the Fourier space. By limitations, these approximation equations will help us get a priori estimate in the Bourgain space and finish the proof of the global well-posedness of the initial system.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we consider the mollified stochastic heat equation with flat initial data and the corresponding Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation in dimension $d \geq 3$ when the mollification parameter is turned off. In addition, we assume that the strength of the space-time white noise is small enough, such that the solution of the mollified stochastic heat equation has a finite limiting second moment. In this case, with regard to the mollified KPZ equation, we show that the fluctuation of the mollified KPZ equation about its stationary solution converges in the sense of finite dimensional distributions towards a Gaussian free field. On the other hand, about the mollified stochastic heat equation, we show that the fluctuation of the mollified stochastic heat equation about its stationary solution converges in the sense of finite dimensional convergence towards the product of an i.i.d random field and an independent Gaussian free field. Here the i.i.d random field is generated by the limiting partition function of the continuous directed polymer. As an application, we prove the limiting fluctuations of the partition function and the free energy of the continuous directed polymer.</description>

      <title>Codifferentials and Quasidifferentials of the Expectation of Nonsmooth Random Integrands and Two-Stage Stochastic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.06677v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is devoted to an analysis of exact penalty functions and optimality conditions for nonsmooth two-stage stochastic programming problems. To this end, we first study the co-/quasi-differentiability of the expectation of nonsmooth random integrands and obtain explicit formulae for its co- and quasidifferential under some natural assumptions on the integrand. Then we analyse exact penalty functions for a variational reformulation of two-stage stochastic programming problems and obtain sufficient conditions for the global exactness of these functions with two different penalty terms. In the end of the paper, we combine our results on the co-/quasi-differentiability of the expectation of nonsmooth random integrands and exact penalty functions to derive optimality conditions for nonsmooth two-stage stochastic programming problems in terms of codifferentials.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional genetic and evolution algebras generated by Gibbs measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Genetic and evolution algebras arise naturally from applied probability and stochastic processes. Gibbs measures describe interacting systems commonly studied in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics with applications in several fields. Here, we consider that the algebras are determined by configurations of finite spins on a countable set with their associated Gibbs distributions. The model preserves properties of the finite-dimensional Gibbs algebras found in the literature and extend their results. We introduce infertility in the genetic dynamics when the configurations differ macroscopically. It induces a decomposition of the algebra into a direct sum of fertile ideals with genetic realization.
  The proposed infinite-dimensional algebras are commutative, non-associative, with uncountable basis and zero divisors. The properties of Gibbs measures allow us to deal with the difficulties arising from the algebraic structure and obtain the results presented in this article.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds for integrated information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Originally developed as a theory of consciousness, integrated information theory provides a mathematical framework to quantify the causal irreducibility of systems and subsets of units in the system. Specifically, mechanism integrated information quantifies how much of the causal powers of a subset of units in a state, also referred to as a mechanism, cannot be accounted for by its parts. If the causal powers of the mechanism can be fully explained by its parts, it is reducible and its integrated information is zero. Here, we study the upper bound of this measure and how it is achieved. We study mechanisms in isolation, groups of mechanisms, and groups of causal relations among mechanisms. We put forward new theoretical results that show mechanisms that share parts with each other cannot all achieve their maximum. We also introduce techniques to design systems that can maximize the integrated information of a subset of their mechanisms or relations. Our results can potentially be used to exploit the symmetries and constraints to reduce the computations significantly and to compare different connectivity profiles in terms of their maximal achievable integrated information.</description>

      <title>Behavior of the Minimum Degree Throughout the $d$-process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16111v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $d$-process generates a graph at random by starting with an empty graph with $n$ vertices, then adding edges one at a time uniformly at random among all pairs of vertices which have degrees at most $d-1$ and are not mutually joined. We show that, in the evolution of a random graph with $n$ vertices under the $d$-process with $d$ fixed, with high probability, for each $j \in \{0,1,\dots,d-2\}$, the minimum degree jumps from $j$ to $j+1$ when the number of steps left is on the order of $\ln(n)^{d-j-1}$. This answers a question of Ruci\'nski and Wormald. More specifically, we show that, when the last vertex of degree $j$ disappears, the number of steps left divided by $\ln(n)^{d-j-1}$ converges in distribution to the exponential random variable of mean $\frac{j!}{2(d-1)!}$; furthermore, these $d-1$ distributions are independent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper a set of previous general results for the development of B--series for a broad class of stochastic differential equations has been collected. The applicability of these results is demonstrated by the derivation of B--series for non-autonomous semi-linear SDEs and exponential Runge-Kutta methods applied to this class of SDEs, which is a significant generalization of existing theory on such methods.</description>

      <title>On diffusion-based generative models and their error bounds: The log-concave case with full convergence estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide full theoretical guarantees for the convergence behaviour of diffusion-based generative models under the assumption of strongly log-concave data distributions while our approximating class of functions used for score estimation is made of Lipschitz continuous functions. We demonstrate via a motivating example, sampling from a Gaussian distribution with unknown mean, the powerfulness of our approach. In this case, explicit estimates are provided for the associated optimization problem, i.e. score approximation, while these are combined with the corresponding sampling estimates. As a result, we obtain the best known upper bound estimates in terms of key quantities of interest, such as the dimension and rates of convergence, for the Wasserstein-2 distance between the data distribution (Gaussian with unknown mean) and our sampling algorithm.
  Beyond the motivating example and in order to allow for the use of a diverse range of stochastic optimizers, we present our results using an $L^2$-accurate score estimation assumption, which crucially is formed under an expectation with respect to the stochastic optimizer and our novel auxiliary process that uses only known information. This approach yields the best known convergence rate for our sampling algorithm.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-based system reliability analysis with Gaussian Process Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning-based reliability analysis methods have shown great advancements for their computational efficiency and accuracy. Recently, many efficient learning strategies have been proposed to enhance the computational performance. However, few of them explores the theoretical optimal learning strategy. In this article, we propose several theorems that facilitates such exploration. Specifically, cases that considering and neglecting the correlations among the candidate design samples are well elaborated. Moreover, we prove that the well-known U learning function can be reformulated to the optimal learning function for the case neglecting the Kriging correlation. In addition, the theoretical optimal learning strategy for sequential multiple training samples enrichment is also mathematically explored through the Bayesian estimate with the corresponding lost functions. Simulation results show that the optimal learning strategy considering the Kriging correlation works better than that neglecting the Kriging correlation and other state-of-the art learning functions from the literatures in terms of the reduction of number of evaluations of performance function. However, the implementation needs to investigate very large computational resource.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional bootstrap and asymptotic expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent seminal work of Chernozhukov, Chetverikov and Kato has shown that bootstrap approximation for the maximum of a sum of independent random vectors is justified even when the dimension is much larger than the sample size. In this context, numerical experiments suggest that third-moment match bootstrap approximations would outperform normal approximation even without studentization, but the existing theoretical results cannot explain this phenomenon. In this paper, we first show that Edgeworth expansion, if justified, can give an explanation for this phenomenon. Second, we obtain valid Edgeworth expansions in the high-dimensional setting when the random vectors have Stein kernels. Finally, we prove the second-order accuracy of a double wild bootstrap method in this setting. As a byproduct, we find an interesting blessing of dimensionality phenomenon: The single third-moment match wild bootstrap is already second-order accurate in high-dimensions if the covariance matrix has identical diagonal entries and bounded eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>About the Moments of the Generalized Ulam Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given $\pi \in S_n$, let $Z_{n,k}(\pi)=\sum_{1\leq i_1&lt;\dots&lt;i_k\leq n} \mathbf{1}(\{ \pi_{i_1}&lt;\dots&lt;\pi_{i_k}\}$ denote the number of increasing subsequences of length $k$. Consider the problem of studing the distribution of $Z_{n,k}$ for general $k$ and $n$. For the 2nd moment, Ross Pinsky made a combinatorial study by considering a pair of subsequences $i^{(r)}_1&lt;\dots&lt;i^{(r)}_k$ for $r \in \{1,2\}$, and conditioning on the size of the intersection $j = |\{i_1^{(1)},\dots,i^{(1)}_k\} \cap \{i^{(2)}_1,\dots,i^{(2)}_k\}|$. We obtain the large deviation rate function for $\mathbf{E}[Z_{n,k} Z_{n,\ell}]$ in the asymptotic regime $k\sim \kappa n^{1/2}$, $\ell \sim \lambda n^{1/2}$ as $n \to \infty$, for $\kappa,\lambda \in (0,\infty)$. This uses multivariate generating function techniques, as found in the textbook of Pemantle and Wilson. For higher moments, if one thinks of the ``overlap'' between two subsequences $i^{(r)}_1&lt;\dots&lt;i^{(r)}_k$ for $r \in \{1,2\}$, as the size of their intersection $j$, then an ultrametric ansatz leads to rigorous lower bounds for the higher moments. For the 3rd moment, the replica symmetric ansatz leads to a complete elliptic integral for the generating function, following a method similar to the diagonal method of Furstenberg, Hautus and Klarner.</description>
