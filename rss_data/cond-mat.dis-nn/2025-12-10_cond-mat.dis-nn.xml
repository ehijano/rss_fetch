      <title>Effect of superconductivity on non-uniform magnetization in dirty SF junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study proximity effect in a tunnel junction between a bulk superconductor and a thin disordered ferromagnetic layer on its surface. Cooper pairs penetrating from the superconductor into the ferromagnet tend to destabilize its uniform magnetic order. The competition of this effect and the intrinsic magnetic stiffness of the ferromagnet leads to a second order phase transition between uniform and non-uniform magnetic states. Using the quasiclassical Usadel equation, we derive the Landau functional for this transition and construct the complete phase diagram of the effect. We identify a special point of "resonance" at which the characteristic energy scale of the proximity effect equals the exchange field of the ferromagnet. At this point, the uniform magnetic state is unstable even in the limit of large stiffness. We further explore the parameter regime far beyond the transition and determine the properties of the resulting strongly non-uniform magnetic state.</description>

      <title>Rheological Parameter Identification in Granular Materials Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a promising tool for fluid dynamics, particularly for flow reconstruction and parameter identification. In the context of granular media, accurately estimating rheological parameters remains a major challenge, as it typically requires complex and costly experimental setups. In this work, we propose a PINN-based approach to identify key rheological parameters of granular materials using a simple experiment: the granular column collapse. A proof of concept is presented using synthetic data, where the PINN is trained to infer the flow fields while simultaneously recovering the rheological parameters. Beyond parameter identification, the method also enables reconstruction of the pressure field, which is difficult to access experimentally. The results highlight the potential of PINNs for data-driven rheometry of granular materials and open perspectives for future applications with real experimental data.</description>

      <title>Order parameter for non-mean-field spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel renormalization group (RG) method for non mean-field models of spin glasses, which leads to the emergence of a novel order parameter. Unlike previous approaches where the RG procedure is based on a priori notions on the system, our analysis follows a minimality principle, where no a priori assumption is made. We apply our approach to a spin-glass model built on a hierarchical lattice. In the RG decimation procedure, a novel order parameter spontaneously emerges from the system symmetries, and self-similarity features of the RG transformation only. This order parameter is the projection of the spin configurations on the ground state of the system. Kadanoff's majority rule for ferromagnetic systems is replaced by a more complex scheme, which involves such novel order parameter. The ground state thus acts as a pattern which translates spin configurations from one length scale to another. The rescaling RG procedure is based on a minimal, information-theory approach and, combined with the decimation, it yields a complete RG transformation.
  Below the upper critical dimension, the predictions for the critical exponent $\nu$, which describes the critical divergence of the correlation length, are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations from both this and previous studies. Overall, this study opens new avenues in the understanding of the critical ordering of realistic spin glasses, and it can be applied to spin-glass models on a cubic lattice and nearest-neighbor couplings which directly model spin-glass materials, such as AuFe, CuMn and other magnetic alloys.</description>

      <title>Is disorder a friend or a foe to melting of Wigner-Mott insulators?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wigner crystals are extremely fragile, which is shown to result from very strong geometric frustration germane to long-range Coulomb interactions. Physically, this is manifested by a very small characteristic energy scale for shear density fluctuations, which are gapless excitations in a translationally invariant system. The presence of disorder, however, breaks translational invariance, thus suppressing gapless excitations and pushing them to higher density. We illustrate this general principle by explicit microscopic model calculations, showing that this mechanism very effectively stabilizes disordered Wigner lattices to much higher temperatures and densities than in the clean limit. On the other hand, we argue that in two dimensions disorder significantly ``smears" the melting transition, producing spatial coexistence of solid-like and liquid-like regions -- just as recently observed in STM experiments. Our results paint a new physical picture for melting of Wigner-Mott solids in two dimensions, corresponding to a Mott-Hubbard model with spatially varying local electronic bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Explosive neural networks via higher-order interactions in curved statistical manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions underlie complex phenomena in systems such as biological and artificial neural networks, but their study is challenging due to the scarcity of tractable models. By leveraging a generalisation of the maximum entropy principle, we introduce curved neural networks as a class of models with a limited number of parameters that are particularly well-suited for studying higher-order phenomena. Through exact mean-field descriptions, we show that these curved neural networks implement a self-regulating annealing process that can accelerate memory retrieval, leading to explosive order-disorder phase transitions with multi-stability and hysteresis effects. Moreover, by analytically exploring their memory-retrieval capacity using the replica trick, we demonstrate that these networks can enhance memory capacity and robustness of retrieval over classical associative-memory networks. Overall, the proposed framework provides parsimonious models amenable to analytical study, revealing higher-order phenomena in complex networks.</description>

      <title>Amorphous Solid Model of Vectorial Hopfield Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22787v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a three-dimensional vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative-memory model in which each neuron is a unit vector on $S^2$ and synaptic couplings are $3\times 3$ blocks generated through a vectorial Hebbian rule. The resulting block-structured operator is mathematically analogous to the Hessian of amorphous solids and induces a rigid energy landscape with deep minima for stored patterns. Simulations and spectral analysis show that the vectorial network substantially outperforms the classical binary Hopfield model. For moderate connectivity, the critical storage ratio $\gamma_c$ grows approximately linearly with the coordination number $Z$, while for $Z\gtrsim 40$ a high-connectivity regime emerges in which $\gamma_c$ systematically exceeds the extrapolated low-$Z$ linear fit. At the same time, a persistent spectral gap separates pattern modes from the bulk and basins of attraction enlarge, yielding enhanced robustness to initialization noise. Thus geometric constraints combined with amorphous-solid-inspired structure produce associative memories with superior storage and retrieval performance, especially in the high-connectivity ($Z \gtrsim 20$-$30$) regime.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatics of free energies with fixed variance for high-dimensional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03631v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Systems with many interacting stochastic constituents are fully characterized by their free energy. Computing this quantity is therefore the objective of various approaches, notably perturbative expansions, which are applied in problems ranging from high-dimensional statistics to complex systems. However, a lot of these techniques are complicated to apply in practice because they lack a sufficient organization of the terms of the perturbative series. In this manuscript, we tackle this problem by using Feynman diagrams, extending a framework introduced earlier to the case of free energies at fixed variances. This diagrammatics do not require the theory to expand around to be Gaussian, which allows its application to the free energy of a spin system studied to derive message-passing algorithms by Maillard et al. 2019. We complete their perturbative derivation of the free energy in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, we derive resummations to estimate the entropies of poorly sampled systems requiring only limited statistics and we revisit earlier approaches to compute the free energy of the Ising model, revealing new insights due to the extension of our framework to the free energy at fixed variances. We expect our approach to be particularly useful for problems of high-dimensional statistics, like matrix factorization, and the study of complex networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Glassiness From Efficient Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00087v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show a relation between quantum learning theory and algorithmic hardness. We use the existence of efficient, local learning algorithms for energy estimation -- such as the classical shadows algorithm -- to prove that finding near-ground states of disordered quantum systems exhibiting a certain topological property is impossible in the average case for Lipschitz quantum algorithms. A corollary of our result is that many standard quantum algorithms fail to find near-ground states of these systems, including time-$T$ Lindbladian dynamics from an arbitrary initial state, time-$T$ quantum annealing, phase estimation to $T$ bits of precision, and depth-$T$ variational quantum algorithms, whenever $T$ is less than some universal constant times the logarithm of the system size. To achieve this, we introduce a generalization of the overlap gap property (OGP) for quantum systems that we call the quantum overlap gap property (QOGP). We prove that preparing low-energy states of systems which exhibit the QOGP is intractable for quantum algorithms whose outputs are stable under perturbations of their inputs. We then prove that the QOGP is satisfied for a sparsified variant of the quantum $p$-spin model, giving the first known algorithmic hardness-of-approximation result for quantum algorithms in finding the ground state of a non-stoquastic, noncommuting quantum system. Inversely, we show that the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model does not exhibit the QOGP, consistent with previous evidence that the model is rapidly mixing at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Slow Mixing of the Low Temperature SK Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a short proof that low-temperature dynamics for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model have mixing time exponential in the system size, based on the recently proved existence of gapped spin configurations by (Minzer-Sah-Sawhney 2023, Dandi-Gamarnik-Zdeborov\'a 2023). This result is in contrast with a well established physics prediction which posits a stretched exponential mixing time of order $e^{N^{1/3 \pm o(1)}}$. Our proof clarifies that this prediction cannot apply to mixing from worst case initial conditions, but should presumably be understood to concern dynamics from a suitably random initialization.</description>
