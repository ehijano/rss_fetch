      <title>A Self Propelled Vortex Dipole Model on a Catenoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate vortex dipoles on surfaces of variable negative curvature, focusing on a catenoid of arbitrary throat radius as a concrete example. We construct the effective dynamical system including mutual and geometric self-interaction terms and show that the resulting Hamiltonian dynamics makes dipoles follow catenoid geodesics, in agreement with recent works, Gustafsson (J. Nonlinear Sci. 32, 62, 2022) and by Drivas, Glukhovskiy and Khesin (Int. Math. Res. Not. 2024, 14, 10880-10894). We utilize the symplectic structure to find a conserved momentum map J related to the U(1) symmetry along the azimuthal direction. We verify the conservation of both the Hamiltonian and this momentum for arbitrary throat radius. We then demonstrate direct and exchange scattering of classical vortices on the catenoid, and we contrast this with the collective rotational motion (with azimuthal drift) that arises for chiral pairs. Finally, we build a finite-dipole dynamical system on the catenoid and show that the self-propulsion terms emerge to leading order in the dipole size. This provides a concrete realization, on a curved minimal surface, of the intuitive statement that a finite dipole propels orthogonal to the dipole axis, with a speed modulated by curvature.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of spectral determinants of matrix-valued random Schr\"odinger operators and Dyson Brownian motion in cubic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the moments of $\overline{|\det(H-E)|^q}$ and the associated large deviations of $\log |\det(H-E)|$ where $H$ are random matrix operators involving Laplace operators and random potentials. This includes as a special case Hessians of random elastic manifolds at a generic energy configuration. In one dimension $d=1$ these are $N \times N$ matrix valued random Schr\"odinger operators and $\log | \det(H-E) | $ is the sum of the $N$ associated Lyapunov exponents. Using a mapping to a stochastic matrix Ricatti equation we make a connection between the spectral properties of these operators and the total $N$ particle current of a Dyson Brownian motion (DBM) in a cubic potential. The latter model was studied by Allez and Dumaz [1] who showed that for $N=+\infty$ it exhibits a sharp transition between a phase with non-zero current and a confined (zero current) phase. We compute the barrier-crossing probability of the DBM at large but finite $N$, which gives an estimate of the exponential tail of the average density of states of a matrix Schrodinger operator below the edge of its spectrum. The barrier behaves as $\sim N (-E)^{3/2}$ at large negative energy and vanishes as $\sim N(E^*-E)^{5/4}$ near the edge. For $q=1$ the present work provides an independent derivation of the total complexity of stationary points for an elastic string embedded in $N$ dimension in presence of disorder.</description>

      <title>Mixed superposition rules for Lie systems and compatible geometric structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed superposition rules are, in short, a method to describe the general solutions of a time-dependent system of first-order differential equations, a so-called Lie system, in terms of particular solutions of other ones. This article is concerned with the theory of mixed superposition rules and their connections with geometric structures. We provide methods to obtain mixed superposition rules for systems admitting an imprimitive finite-dimensional Lie algebra of vector fields or given by a semidirect sum. In particular, we develop a novel mixed coalgebra method for Lie systems that are Hamiltonian relative to a Dirac structure, which is quite general, although we restrict to symplectic and contact manifolds in applications. This provides us with practical methods to derive mixed superposition rules and extends the coalgebra method to a new field of application while solving minor technical issues of the known formalism. Throughout the paper, we apply our results to physical systems including Schr\"odinger Lie systems, Riccati systems, time-dependent Calogero-Moser systems with external forces, time-dependent harmonic oscillators, and time-dependent thermodynamical systems, where general solutions can be obtained from reduced system solutions. Our results are finally extended to Lie systems of partial differential equations and a new source of such PDE Lie systems, related to the determination of approximate solutions of PDEs, is provided. An example based on the Tzitz\'eica equation and a related system is given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the multiplicative statistics for a unitary random matrix ensemble with a parameter-dependent deformation inserted in the probability measure. Such deformations had been studied for a bounded or decaying parameter. In this work, we extend the previous results for a growing parameter under a controlled rate, and show that the underlying statistics relate to the lower tail study for the KPZ equation.</description>

      <title>Skinner--Rusk formalism of action-dependent multicontact field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The newly developed multicontact structure, based on contact and multisymplectic geometries, provides a very general geometrical framework suitable for the treatment of action-dependent classical field theories. Having successfully applied it to formulate the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian descriptions of these theories, in the present work, the well-known Skinner--Rusk formalism is presented in this multicontact setting, which allows us to provide a combined version of both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms particularly suitable for the study and description of singular theories. As an application of this last situation, we study a modification of Maxwell's Lagrangian of classical electromagnetism, which incorporates action-dependent terms and allows us to describe electromagnetism in material media.</description>

      <title>Quantum Large Deviations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconsider the quantum analogue of Varadhans Theorem proved by Petz, Raggio and Verbeure. They proved this theorem using standard techniques in quantum statistical mechanics of lattice sys- tems to arrive at a variational formula over states on an operator algebra, which can subsequently be reduced to a variational formula in terms of a single real variable. In this paper a new proof is given using a quantum version of the large deviation analysis together with the Trotter product formula. The proof is subsequently extended to the general case of q non-commuting variables resulting in a variational formula for general mean-field quantum spin systems as first derived by Raggio and Werner.</description>

      <title>Gamma convergence for a phase-field cohesive energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reproducing the key features of fracture behavior under multiaxial stress states is essential for accurate modeling. Experimental evidence indicates that three intrinsic material properties govern fracture nucleation in elastic materials: elasticity, strength, and fracture toughness. Among these, strength remains the most often misunderstood, as it is not a single scalar quantity but rather a full surface in stress space. The flexibility in defining this strength envelope in phase-field models poses significant challenges, especially under complex loading conditions. Existing models in the literature often fail to capture both the qualitative shape and the quantitative fit of experimentally observed strength surfaces. To address this limitation, recent work introduces a new energy functional within a cohesive phase-field framework, specifically designed to control the shape of elastic domains. This model introduces an internal variable to describe the inelastic response. Notably, the strength is decoupled from the internal length, that is not interpreted as a material length scale, as often done in literature, but rather as a purely variational tool. The proposed functional allows for a rigorous variational framework, enabling the use of tools from the calculus of variations. We investigate the Gamma-convergence of the model to a sharp cohesive fracture energy in the one- and two-dimensional (anti-plane) setting, using a finite element discrete formulation and exploiting the strong localization of the damage variable. Notably, unlike classical models where the elastic and fracture energies converge independently, this model exhibits a coupling of all energy terms. We also present numerical simulations exploring the sensitivity of the model to mesh anisotropy, offering insight into both its theoretical robustness and its practical implementation.</description>

      <title>Twists and Gorms and Antifields, oh my!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I define topological twists of supersymmetric field theories in the case when the supercharges involved obey an ``open'' algebra. Using the Batalin--Vilkovisky field--antifield formalism, I construct twisted theories algorithmically from the supersymmetry data, and explain supersymmetric localisation in terms of anticanonical transformations. I also treat equivariant topological twists and explain how BV observables contain the equivariant cohomology of the space of histories. Some results are generalised to theories with two topological supercharges -- such as the ``balanced'' topological field theories of Dijkgraaf and Moore -- using the geometry of ``differential gorms'' of Kochan and \v{S}evera. Finally, I exhibit examples of these constructions, including a $\mathrm{U}(1)$-equivariant topological B-model.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field in vacuum of quantum spinor matter induced by a cosmic string in three-dimensional space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A linear magnetic topological defect (cosmic string) is modeled as a magnetic flux-carrying tube that is impenetrable to external spinor matter. The matter field is quantized in the background of this tube, with the most general set of boundary conditions ensuring both the tube's impenetrability and the self-adjointness of the Dirac Hamiltonian operator. We compute the induced vacuum magnetic flux along the tube in (3+1)-dimensional space-time. It was shown that the requirement for the total induced vacuum magnetic flux to be finite restricts the admissible boundary conditions to only one choice: the MIT quark bag boundary condition. The dependence of the effect on the transverse size of the tube and the flux inside the tube was also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Traceless projection of mixed tensor products, and walled Brauer algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a self-contained procedure for constructing the traceless projection of mixed tensor products (built out of a finite-dimensional complex vector space and its dual). The construction relies on the Schur-Weyl duality for the general linear group and regards rational representations thereof. By identifying the traceless subspace as a particular rational representation, the traceless projector which commutes with the group action can be understood as a uniquely defined idempotent in the centraliser algebra. We also identify and construct the analogue of the traceless projector in the walled Brauer algebras when the latter are semisimple. Among possible applications of the traceless projector, we show how the result applies to mixed tensor products built out of a finite-dimensional hermitian space and its complex conjugate.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving Physics-Informed Neural Network for the Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a flexible framework for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs), yet conventional implementations often fail to preserve key physical invariants during long-term integration. This paper introduces a \emph{structure-preserving PINN} framework for the nonlinear Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) equation, a prototypical model for nonlinear and dispersive wave propagation. The proposed method embeds the conservation of mass and Hamiltonian energy directly into the loss function, ensuring physically consistent and energy-stable evolution throughout training and prediction. Unlike standard \texttt{tanh}-based PINNs~\cite{raissi2019pinn,wang2022modifiedpinn}, our approach employs sinusoidal activation functions that enhance spectral expressiveness and accurately capture the oscillatory and dispersive nature of KdV solitons. Through representative case studies -- including single-soliton propagation (shape-preserving translation), two-soliton interaction (elastic collision with phase shift), and cosine-pulse initialization (nonlinear dispersive breakup) -- the model successfully reproduces hallmark behaviors of KdV dynamics while maintaining conserved invariants. Ablation studies demonstrate that combining invariant-constrained optimization with sinusoidal feature mappings accelerates convergence, improves long-term stability, and mitigates drift without multi-stage pretraining. These results highlight that computationally efficient, invariant-aware regularization coupled with sinusoidal representations yields robust, energy-consistent PINNs for Hamiltonian partial differential equations such as the KdV equation.</description>

Abstract: Weighted Hurwitz numbers arise as coefficients in the power sum expansion of deformed hypergeometric $\tau$--functions. They specialise to essentially all known cases of Hurwitz numbers, including classical, monotone, strictly monotone and completed cycles Hurwitz numbers. In this work, we develop a tropical geometry framework for their study, thus enabling a simultaneous investigation of all these cases. We obtain a correspondence theorem expressing weighted Hurwitz numbers in terms of tropical covers. Using this tropical approach, we generalise most known structural results previously obtained for the aforementioned special cases to all weighted Hurwitz numbers. In particular, we study their polynomiality and derive wall--crossing formulae. Moreover, we introduce elliptic weighted Hurwitz numbers and derive tropical mirror symmetry for these new invariants, i.e. we prove that their generating function is quasimodular and that they may be expressed as Feynman integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short-time dynamics in the $2D$ Blume-Capel model, with a non-conserved order-parameter and short-ranged interactions, is analysed. For non-equilibrium dynamics, both at a critical point in the $2D$ Ising universality class and at the tricritical point, we reproduce the values $\Theta=0.190({5})$ and $\Theta=-0.542({5})$, respectively, of the critical initial slip exponent. These agree with more early estimates and with the Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation. In phase-ordering kinetics, after a quench into the ordered phase, we establish the validity of short-time dynamics. In the $2D$ Ising universality class, we find $\Theta=0.39({1})$ in agreement with the scaling relation $\lambda=d-2\Theta$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and the singular limit of normalized ground states for focusing doubly nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with both standard and concentrated nonlinearities on two-dimensional square grids. First, we provide existence and non-existence results for such ground states depending on the values of the nonlinearity powers and on the structure of the set of vertices where the concentrated nonlinearities are located. Second, we prove that suitable piecewise-affine extensions of such states converge strongly in $H^1(\R^2)$ to ground states of corresponding doubly nonlinear models defined on the whole plane as the length of the edges in the grid tends to zero. This convergence is proved both for limit models with standard nonlinearities only and for models combining standard and singular nonlinearities concentrated on a line or on a strip.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a collection of infinite-dimensional systems with nonholonomic constraints. In finite dimensions the two essentially different types of dynamics, nonholonomic or vakonomic ones, are known to be obtained by taking certain limits of holonomic systems with Rayleigh dissipation, as in [Koz83]. After visualizing this phenomenon for the classical example of a skate on an inclined plane, we discuss its higher-dimensional analogue, the kinematics of a car with $n$ trailers, as well as its limit as $n\to \infty$. We show that its infinite-dimensional version is a snake-like motion of the Chaplygin sleigh with a string, and it is subordinated to an infinite-dimensional Goursat distribution.
  Other examples of nonholonomic and vakonomic systems include subriemannian and Euler-Poincar\'e-Suslov systems on infinite-dimensional Lie groups, the Heisenberg chain, the general Camassa-Holm equation, infinite-dimensional geometry of a nonholonomic Moser theorem, parity-breaking nonholonomic fluids, and potential solutions to Burgers-type equations arising in optimal mass transport.</description>

      <title>Regular actions and semisimplicity of conformal modules over the general conformal algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a regular action in the category of conformal modules over Lie conformal algebras with Virasoro elements. We show that a finite conformal module over the general conformal algebra $\mathfrak{gc}_1$ (resp., $\mathfrak{gc}_N$ with $N\ge2$) is semisimple if and only if there exists a pair of different Virasoro elements (resp., canonical Virasoro elements) with regular actions. Along the way to finding a semisimplicity criteria, we also discuss the classification of Virasoro elements of $\mathfrak{gc}_N$ in-depth, leading us to construct a huge number of new Virasoro conformal modules.</description>

      <title>Similarity Solutions of Shock Formation for First-order Strictly Hyperbolic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shocks due to hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) appear throughout mathematics and science. The canonical example is shock formation in the inviscid Burgers' equation $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=0$. Previous studies have shown that when shocks form for the inviscid Burgers' equation, for positions and times close to the shock singularity, the dynamics are locally self-similar and universal, i.e., dynamics are equivalent regardless of the initial conditions. In this paper, we show that, in fact, shock formation is self-similar and universal for general first-order strictly hyperbolic PDEs in one spatial dimension, and the self-similarity is like that of the inviscid Burgers' equation. An analytical formula is derived and verified for the self-similar universal solution.</description>

      <title>On taming Moffatt-Kimura vortices of doom in the viscous case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we propose a two-layer viscous mechanism for preventing finite time singularity formation in the Moffatt-Kimura model of two counter-rotating vortex rings colliding at a nontrivial angle. In the first layer the scenario is recast within the framework of the study of turbulent dissipation based on a suitably defined `scale of sparseness' of the regions of intense fluid activity. Here it is found that the problem is (at worst) critical, i.e., the upper bound on the scale of sparseness of the vorticity super-level sets is comparable to the lower bound on the radius of spatial analyticity. In the second layer, an additional more subtle mechanism is identified, potentially capable of driving the scale of sparseness into the dissipation range and preventing the formation of a singularity. The mechanism originates in certain analytic cancellation properties of the vortex-stretching term in the sense of compensated compactness in Hardy spaces which then convert information on local mean oscillations of the vorticity direction (boundedness in certain log-composite weighted local bmo spaces) into log-composite faster decay of the vorticity super-level sets.</description>

      <title>Index theory for singular Lagrangian systems and Bessel-type differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of the present manuscript is to develop an index theory for singular Lagrangian systems, with a particular focus on the important class of singular operators given by Bessel type differential operators. The main motivation is to address several challenges posed by singular operators, which appear in a wide range of applications: celestial mechanics (for instance, perturbations in planetary motion), oscillatory systems with time dependent forcing, electromagnetism (such as wave equations in nonuniform media), and quantum mechanics (notably certain Schroedinger equations with periodic potentials).
  We pursue two principal objectives. First, we establish a spectral flow formula and a Morse Index Theorem for gap-continuous paths of singular Sturm Liouville operators. By means of these index formulas, we construct a Morse index theory for a broad class of Bessel type differential operators and apply it to a family of asymptotic solutions of the gravitational n body problem.
  Finally, our new index theory provides new insight into a phenomenon first observed by Rellich concerning the spectrum of one-parameter families of Sturm Liouville operators with varying domains.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic theorem for non-Hermitian quantum systems with non-degenerate real eigenvalues: A proof following Kato's approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adiabatic theorem is one of the most interesting and significant theorem in quantum mechanics. In 1950, T. Kato gave an elegant proof of this result [1]. However, the validation of adiabatic theorem for non-Hermitian quantum systems is unrevealed. In this paper, by following Kato' approach, we prove rigorously that the adiabatic theorem is still valid for non-Hermitian systems with non-degenerate real eigenvalues. Moreover, our proof utilizes the complex Berry phase, instead of the orthogonal projections used in Kato's work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the first-order noncommutative (NC) corrections to the general nonlinear electrodynamics (NLE) Lagrangian depending on two electromagnetic invariants. The NC deformation of Einstein-NLE theory is implemented using the $\partial_t\wedge\partial_\varphi$ Drinfel'd twist and the NC effects are encoded in the matter sector through the Seiberg-Witten map. The resulting equations of motion reflect two distinct sources of nonlinearity in this framework; one arising from replacing Maxwell's electrodynamics with its nonlinear modifications and another from the NC deformations. Assuming a general form of static, spherically symmetric dyonic black hole as a seed solution in the commutative limit, we solve the equations of motion perturbatively to the first order in the NC parameter $a$. Finally, we evaluate the obtained corrections to the metric tensor and gauge potential for several prominent NLE theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a generalized quantum perceptron architecture characterized by an oscillating activation function with a tunable frequency ranging from zero to infinity. Employing analytical techniques from statistical mechanics, we derive the optimal storage capacity and demonstrate that the classical result is recovered in the limit of vanishing frequency. As the frequency increases, however, the architecture exhibits enhanced quantum storage capabilities. Notably, this improvement stems solely from the specific form of the activation function and, in principle, could be emulated within a classical framework. Accordingly, we refer to this enhancement as a pseudo quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Black holes and dualities in string theory compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis addresses three problems arising in type II string theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold. In the first one we study the hypermultiplet moduli space (HM), by working on its twistor space. Using data derived via mirror symmetry and S-duality, we compute NS5-instanton corrections to the HM metric in the one-instanton approximation.
  These corrections are weighted by D4-D2-D0 BPS indices, which coincide with rank 0 Donaldson-Thomas invariants and count the (signed) number of BPS black hole microstates. These invariants exhibit wall-crossing behavior and induce a Riemann-Hilbert problem. This problem can describe many setups, including the D-instanton corrected twistor space of the HM in type II string theory and is of independent mathematical interest. We consider a quantum deformation of the RH problem, induced by the refined BPS indices. Using a formulation of the problem in terms of a non-commutative Moyal star product, we provide a perturbative solution to it. From the adjoint form of this solution, we identify a generating function for coordinates on the still mysterious quantum analog of the twistor space.
  Finally, we study the modular properties of the D4-D2-D0 BPS indices, more precisely of their generating functions. It was previously argued, using S-duality, that the generating functions are higher depth mock modular forms. Moreover, they satisfy a modular completion equation, which fixes their shadow in terms of other (lower rank) generating functions. We start by bringing about a significant simplification to these equations and recovering subtle contributions that were overlooked. Then, we provide (a recipe for) solutions to these modular completion equations, up to all the holomorphic modular ambiguities that need to be fixed independently.For this, we use indefinite generalized theta series and Jacobi-like forms to write the solutions.</description>

      <title>Robust Quantum State Generation in Symmetric Spin Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a parameterized Ising model with long-range symmetric pairwise interactions on a network of spin $\frac{1}{2}$ particles. The system is designed with symmetric dynamics, allowing for the reduction of the state space to a subspace defined by the set of Dicke states. We propose a method for designing robust electromagnetic amplitude pulses based on a moment quantization approach. The introduced parameter accounts for uncertainties in the electromagnetic field, resulting in a family of distinct Hamiltonians. By employing a discretized moment-based quantization technique, we design a control pulse capable of simultaneously steering an infinite collection of dynamical systems to compensate for parameter variations. This approach benefits from the duality between the infinite-dimensional parameterized system and its finite-dimensional trucnated moment dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of this method in achieving states of significant interest in quantum sensing, including the GHZ and W states.</description>

      <title>Parastatistics revealed: Peierls phase twists and shifted conformal towers in interacting periodic chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider interacting paraparticle chains with a constant $R$-matrix where the Hamiltonian sums over the internal degrees (flavors) of the paraparticles. For such flavor-blind Hamiltonians we show a general factorization of the Hilbert space into occupation and flavor parts with the Hamiltonian acting non-trivially only on the former. For open boundaries, the spectrum therefore coincides with that of the occupation Hamiltonian $H_{\rm occ}$ with the flavor part merely adding degeneracies. For periodic boundaries, a cyclic reordering of the flavors leads to a separation of $H_{\rm occ}$ into flux sectors at fixed particle number, thus making the parastatistics directly observable in the energy spectrum. For important exemplary cases, $H_{\rm occ}$ reduces to the XXZ chain with flux allowing for an exact solution. In the gapless regime, this solution shows flux-shifted $c=1$ conformal towers in the low-energy spectrum and a temperature-dependent chemical potential in the bulk thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the invertibility of the relevant single and double layer potentials associated to some generalizations of the Stokes operator on bounded domains. In order to do that, we first develop an ``algebra tool kit'' to deal with limit and jump relations of layer operators. We do that first on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for operators acting on a distribution supported on $\{x_{n} = 0\}$ and then in general on (possibly non-compact manifolds). We use these results to study the limit and jump relations of the layer potential operators associated to our generalized Stokes operators. In turn, we then use these results to prove the Fredholm property of single and double layer potentials of the generalized Stokes operator and even their invertibility when the auxiliary potentials satisfy suitable non-vanishing conditions.</description>

Abstract: The two-sided Bogoliubov inequality for classical and quantum many-body systems is a theorem that provides rigorous bounds on the free-energy cost of partitioning a given system into two or more independent subsystems. This theorem motivates the definition of a quality factor which directly quantifies the degree of statistical-mechanical consistency achieved by a given simulation box size. A major technical merit of the theorem is that, for systems with two-body interactions and a known radial distribution function, the quality factor can be computed by evaluating just two six-dimensional integrals. In this work, we present a numerical algorithm for computing the quality factor and demonstrate its consistency with respect to results in the literature obtained from simulations performed at different box sizes.</description>

Furthermore, we have proven that for the $(2,q)$-Ising-Potts model on the Cayley tree of order $k\geq2$, there are at least 3 translation-invariant splitting Gibbs measures. We also prove that for the $(2,3)$-Ising-Potts model on the Cayley tree, specifically the binary tree, under certain conditions, there are at least 8 translation-invariant splitting Gibbs measures.</description>

      <title>2D or not 2D: a "holographic dictionary'' for Lowest Landau Levels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider 2D fermions on a plane with a perpendicular magnetic field, described by Landau levels. It is wellknown that, semiclassically, restriction to the lowest Landau levels (LLL) implies two constraints on a 4D phase space, that transforms the 2D coordinate space (x,y) into a 2D phase space, thanks to the non-zero Dirac bracket between x and y. A naive application of Dirac's prescription of quantizing LLL in terms of L2 functions of x (or of y) fails because the wavefunctions are functions of x and y. We are able, however, to construct a 1D QM, sitting differently inside the 2D QM, which describes the LLL physics. The construction includes an exact 1D-2D correspondence between the fermion density \rho(x,y) and the Wigner distribution of the 1D QM. In a suitable large N limit, (a) the Wigner distribution is upper bounded by 1, since a phase space cell can have at most one fermion (Pauli exclusion principle) and (b) the 1D-2D correspondence becomes an identity transformation. (a) and (b) imply an upper bound for the fermion density \rho(x,y). We also explore the entanglement entropy (EE) of subregions of the 2D noncommutative space. It behaves differently from conventional 2D systems as well as conventional 1D systems, falling somewhere between the two. The main new feature of the EE, directly attributable to the noncommutative space, is the absence of a logarithmic dependence on the size of the entangling region, even though there is a Fermi surface. In this paper, instead of working directly with the Landau problem, we consider a more general problem, of 2D fermions in a rotating harmonic trap, which reduces to the Landau problem in a special limit. Among other consequences of the emergent 1D physics, we find that post-quench dynamics of the (generalized) LLL system is computed more simply in 1D terms, which is described by well-developed methods of 2D phase space hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Initial-State Typicality in Quantum Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relaxation in open quantum systems is fundamental to quantum science and technologies. Yet, the influence of the initial state on relaxation remains a central, largely unanswered question. Here, by systematically characterizing the relaxation behavior of generic initial states, we uncover a typicality phenomenon in high-dimensional open quantum systems: relaxation becomes nearly initial-state-independent as system size increases under verifiable conditions. Crucially, we prove this typicality for thermalization processes above a size-independent temperature. Our findings extend the typicality to open quantum dynamics, in turn identifying a class of systems where two widely used quantities -- the Liouvillian gap and the maximal relaxation time -- merit re-examination. We formalize this with two new concepts: the 'typical strong Mpemba effect' and the 'typical relaxation time'. Beyond these conceptual advances, our results provide practical implications: a scalable route to accelerating relaxation and a typical mixing-time benchmark that complements conventional worst-case metrics for quantum simulations and state preparation.</description>

      <title>Localisation with on-shell supersymmetry algebras via the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism: Localisation as gauge fixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism provides a powerful technique to deal with gauge and global (super)symmetries that may only hold on shell. We argue that, since global (super)symmetries and gauge symmetries appear on an equal footing in the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, similarly localisation with respect to global (super)symmetries appears on an equal footing with gauge fixing of gauge symmetries; in general, when the gauge-fixing condition is not invariant under the global symmetries, localisation (with respect to a localising fermion) and gauge fixing (with respect to a gauge-fixing fermion) combine into a single operation. Furthermore, this perspective enables supersymmetric localisation using only on-shell supermultiplets, dispensing with auxiliary fields, extending an insight first discovered by Losev and Lysov. We provide the first examples of on-shell localisation for quantum field theories (together with a companion paper by Arvanitakis).</description>

      <title>Getting to the Bottom of Noether's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.14741v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the assumptions behind Noether's theorem connecting symmetries and conservation laws. To compare classical and quantum versions of this theorem, we take an algebraic approach. In both classical and quantum mechanics, observables are naturally elements of a Jordan algebra, while generators of one-parameter groups of transformations are naturally elements of a Lie algebra. Noether's theorem holds whenever we can map observables to generators in such a way that each observable generates a one-parameter group that preserves itself. In ordinary complex quantum mechanics this mapping is multiplication by $\sqrt{-1}$. In the more general framework of unital JB-algebras, Alfsen and Shultz call such a mapping a "dynamical correspondence", and show its presence allows us to identify the unital JB-algebra with the self-adjoint part of a complex C*-algebra. However, to prove their result, they impose a second, more obscure, condition on the dynamical correspondence. We show this expresses a relation between quantum and statistical mechanics, closely connected to the principle that "inverse temperature is imaginary time".</description>

      <title>Spin glass phase at zero temperature in the Edwards-Anderson model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04112v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the analysis of mean-field spin glass models has seen tremendous progress in the last twenty years, lattice spin glasses have remained largely intractable. This article presents the solutions to a number of questions about the Edwards-Anderson model of short-range spin glasses (in all dimensions) that were raised in the physics literature many years ago. First, it is shown that the ground state is sensitive to small perturbations of the disorder, in the sense that a small amount of noise gives rise to a new ground state that is nearly orthogonal to the old one with respect to the site overlap inner product. Second, it is shown that one can overturn a macroscopic fraction of the spins in the ground state with an energy cost that is negligible compared to the size of the boundary of the overturned region - a feature that is believed to be typical of spin glasses but clearly absent in ferromagnets. The third result is that the boundary of the overturned region in dimension $d$ has fractal dimension strictly greater than $d-1$, confirming a prediction from physics. The fourth result is that the expected size of the critical droplet of a bond grows at least like a power of the volume. The fifth result is that the correlations between bonds in the ground state can decay at most like the inverse of the distance. This contrasts with the random field Ising model, where it has been shown recently that the correlation decays exponentially in distance in dimension two. Taken together, these results comprise the first mathematical proof of glassy behavior in a short-range spin glass model.</description>

      <title>Ballistic Transport for Discrete Multi-Dimensional Schr\"odinger Operators With Decaying Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the discrete Schr\"odinger operator $H = -\Delta + V$ on $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z}^d)$ with a decaying potential, in arbitrary lattice dimension $d\in\mathbb{N}^*$, where $\Delta$ is the standard discrete Laplacian and $V_n = o(|n|^{-1})$ as $|n| \to \infty$. We prove that the unitary evolution $e^{-i tH}$ exhibits ballistic transport in the sense that, for any $r &gt; 0$, the weighted $\ell^2-$norm $$\|e^{-i tH}u\|_r:=\left(\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}^d} (1+|n|^2)^{r} |(e^{-i tH}u)_n|^2\right)^\frac12 $$ grows at rate $\simeq t^r$ as $t\to \infty$, provided that the initial state $u$ is in the absolutely continuous subspace and satisfies $\|u\|_r&lt;\infty$.
  The proof relies on commutator methods and a refined Mourre estimate, which yields quantitative lower bounds on transport for operators with purely absolutely continuous spectrum over appropriate spectral intervals. Compactness arguments and localized spectral projections are used to extend the result to perturbed operators, extending the classical result for the free Laplacian to a broader class of decaying potentials.</description>

      <title>Complex rational Ruijsenaars model. The two-particle case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a complex rational degeneration of the hyperbolic Ruijsenaars model emerging in the limit $\omega_1+\omega_2\to 0$ (or $b\to \imath$ in $2d$ CFT) and investigate in detail the two-particle case. Corresponding wave functions are described by complex hypergeometric functions in the Mellin-Barnes representation. Their dual integral representation and reflection symmetry in the coupling constant are established. Besides, a complex limit of the hyperbolic Baxter $Q$-operators is considered. Another complex degeneration of the hyperbolic Ruijsenaars model is obtained by taking a special $\omega_1-\omega_2\to 0$ (or $b\to 1$) limit. Additionally, two new degenerations to the complex Calogero-Sutherland type models are described.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Carrollian manifolds offer an intrinsic geometric framework for the physics in the ultra-relativistic limit. The recently introduced Carrollian Lie algebroids are generalised to the setting of $\rho$-commutative geometry, (also known as almost commutative geometry), where the underlying algebras commute up to a numerical factor. Via $\rho$-Lie-Rinehart pairs, it is shown that the foundational tenets of Carrollian geometry have analogous statements in the almost commutative world. We explicitly build two toy examples: we equip the extended quantum plane and the noncommutative $2$-torus with Carrollian structures. This opens up the rigorous study of noncommutative Carrollian geometry via almost commutative geometry.</description>

      <title>Finsler geometry in anisotropic superconductivity: a Ginzburg-Landau approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a rigorous generalization of the classical Ginzburg--Landau model to smooth, compact Finsler manifolds without boundary. This framework provides a natural analytic setting for describing anisotropic superconductivity within Finsler geometry. The model is constructed via the Finsler--Laplacian, defined through the Legendre transform associated with the fundamental function F, and by employing canonical Finsler measures such as the Busemann--Hausdorff and Holmes--Thompson volume forms. We introduce an anisotropic Ginzburg--Landau functional for complex scalar fields coupled to gauge potentials and establish the existence of minimizers in the appropriate Finsler--Sobolev spaces by the direct method in the calculus of variations. Furthermore, we analyze the asymptotic regime as the Ginzburg--Landau parameter epsilon to 0 and prove a precise Gamma--convergence result: the rescaled energies converge to the Finslerian length functional associated with the limiting vortex filaments. In particular, the limiting vortex energy is shown to equal $\pi$ times the Finslerian length of the corresponding current, thereby extending the classical Bethuel--Brezis--He'lein result to anisotropic settings. These findings demonstrate that Finsler geometry unifies metric anisotropy and variational principles in gauge-field models, broadening the geometric scope of the Ginzburg--Landau theory beyond the Riemannian framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.16503v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a complex simple Lie algebra and $U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$ the corresponding quantum affine algebra. We prove that every irreducible finite-dimensional $U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$-module gives rise to a family of trigonometric solutions of Cherednik's generalized reflection equation. These depend upon the choice of a quantum affine symmetric pair $U_q(\mathfrak{k})\subset U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$. Our result relies on the construction of universal K-matrices for arbitrary quantum symmetric pairs, obtained in our previous work, as well as the fact that every irreducible $U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$-module is generically irreducible under restriction to $U_q({\mathfrak{k}})$. In the case of small modules and Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules, we obtain new solutions of the standard and the transposed reflection equations.</description>

Abstract: In mirror symmetry, after the work by J. Walcher, the number of holomorphic disks with boundary on the real quintic lagrangian in a general quintic threefold is related to the periods of the mirror quintic family with boundary on two homologous rational curves. Following the ideias of H.Movasati, we construct a quasi-affine space parametrizing such objects enhanced with a frame for the relative de Rham cohomology with boundary at the curves compatible with the mixed Hodge structure. We also compute a modular vector field attached to such a parametrization.</description>

      <title>On gauge transformations in twistless-torsional Newton--Cartan geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twistless-torsional Newton--Cartan (TTNC) geometry exists in two variants, type I and type II, which differ by their gauge transformations. In TTNC geometry there exists a specific locally Galilei-invariant function, called by different names in existing literature, that we dub the `locally Galilei-invariant potential'. We show that in both types of TTNC geometry, there always exists a local gauge transformation that transforms the locally Galilei-invariant potential to zero. For type I TTNC geometry, we achieve this due to the corresponding equation for the gauge parameter taking the form of a Hamilton--Jacobi equation. In the case of type II TTNC geometry, we perform subleading spatial diffeomorphisms. In both cases, our arguments rigorously establish the existence of the respective gauge transformation also in case of only finite-degree differentiability of the geometric fields. This improves upon typical arguments for `gauge fixing' in the literature, which need analyticity.
  We consider two applications of our result. First, it generalises a classical result in standard Newton--Cartan geometry. Second, it allows to (locally) parametrise TTNC geometry in two new ways: either in terms of just the space metric and a unit timelike vector field, or in terms of the distribution of spacelike vectors and a positive-definite cometric.</description>

      <title>Fractional diffusion as the limit of a short range potential Rayleigh gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fractional diffusion equation is rigorously derived as a scaling limit from a deterministic Rayleigh gas, where
  particles interact via short range potentials with support of size $\varepsilon$ and the background is distributed in space $\mathbb{R}^3$ according to a Poisson process with intensity $N$ and in velocity according to some fat-tailed distribution. As an intermediate step a linear Boltzmann equation is obtained in the Boltzmann-Grad limit as $\varepsilon$ tends to zero and $N$ tends to infinity with $N \varepsilon^2 =c$. The convergence of the empiric particle dynamics to the Boltzmann-type dynamics is shown using semigroup methods to describe probability measures on collision trees associated to physical trajectories in the case of a Rayleigh gas. The fractional diffusion equation is a hydrodynamic limit for times $t \in [0,T]$, where $T$ and inverse mean free path $c$ can both be chosen as some negative rational power $\varepsilon^{-k}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the hydrodynamic theory, the non-equilibrium dynamics of a many-body system is approximated, at large scales of space and time, by irreversible relaxation to local entropy maximisation. This results in a convective equation corrected by viscous or diffusive terms in a gradient expansion, such as the Navier-Stokes equations. Diffusive terms are evaluated using the Kubo formula, and possibly arising from an emergent noise due to discarded microscopic degrees of freedom. In one dimension of space, diffusive scaling is often broken as noise leads to super-diffusion. But in linearly degenerate hydrodynamics, such as that of integrable models, diffusive behaviors are observed, and it has long be thought that the standard diffusive picture remains valid. In this letter, we show that in such systems, the Navier-Stokes equation breaks down beyond linear response. We demonstrate that diffusive-order corrections do not take the form of a gradient expansion. Instead, they are completely determined by ballistic transport of initial-state fluctuations, and obtained from the non-local two-point correlations recently predicted by the ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory (BMFT); the resulting hydrodynamic equations are reversible. To do so, we establish a regularised fluctuation theory, putting on a firm basis the recent idea that ballistic transport of initial-state fluctuations determines fluctuations and correlations beyond the Euler scale. This extends the idea of ``diffusion from convection'' previously developed to explain the Kubo formula in integrable systems, to generic non-equilibrium settings.</description>

Abstract: Chirality is a property of a gapped phase of matter in two spatial dimensions that can be manifested through non-zero thermal or electrical Hall conductance. In this paper, we prove two no-go theorems that forbid such chirality for a quantum state in a finite dimensional local Hilbert space with strict area law entanglement entropies. As a crucial ingredient in the proofs, we introduce a new quantum information-theoretic primitive called instantaneous modular flow, which has many other potential applications.</description>

      <title>Stable standing waves for Nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01842v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile. We are interested in the existence of stable standing waves by considering the associated $L^2$-minimization problem. The presence of a doping profile causes a difficulty in the proof of the strict sub-additivity. A key ingredient is to establish the strict sub-additivity by adapting a scaling argument, which is inspired by \cite{ZZou}. When the doping profile is a characteristic function supported on a bounded smooth domain, smallness of some geometric quantity related to the domain ensures the existence of stable standing waves.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz inextendibility of weak null singularities from curvature blow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the $C^{0,1}_{\mathrm{loc}}$-inextendibility of weak null singularities without any symmetry assumptions. The proof introduces a new strategy to infer $C^{0,1}_{\mathrm{loc}}$-inextendibility from the blow-up of curvature. The assumed blow-up is expected to be satisfied for weak null singularities in the interior of generic rotating black holes. Thus, we expect the result presented here to directly contribute to the resolution of the $C^{0,1}_{\mathrm{loc}}$-formulation of the strong cosmic censorship conjecture in a neighbourhood of subextremal Kerr.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01800v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend well-known results on the Newtonian limit of Lorentzian metrics to orthonormal frames. Concretely, we prove that, given a one-parameter family of Lorentzian metrics that in the Newtonian limit converges to a Galilei structure, any family of orthonormal frames for these metrics converges pointwise to a Galilei frame, assuming that the two obvious necessary conditions are satisfied: the spatial frame must not rotate indefinitely as the limit is approached, and the frame's boost velocity with respect to some fixed reference observer needs to converge.</description>

      <title>Learning Nonholonomic Dynamics with Constraint Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider learning nonholonomic dynamical systems while discovering the constraints, and describe in detail the case of the rolling disk. A nonholonomic system is a system subject to nonholonomic constraints. Unlike holonomic constraints, nonholonomic constraints do not define a sub-manifold on the configuration space. Therefore, the inverse problem of finding the constraints has to involve the tangent bundle. This paper discusses a general procedure to learn the dynamics of a nonholonomic system through Hamel's formalism, while discovering the system constraint by parameterizing it, given the data set of discrete trajectories on the tangent bundle $TQ$. We prove that there is a local minimum for convergence of the network. We also preserve symmetry of the system by reducing the Lagrangian to the Lie algebra of the selected group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02103v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile. We are interested in the existence of ground state solutions by considering the minimization problem on a Nehari-Pohozaev set. The presence of a doping profile causes several difficulties, especially in the proof of the uniqueness of a maximum point of a fibering map. A key ingredient is to establish the energy inequality. We also establish the relation between ground state solutions and $L^2$-constraint minimizers. When the doping profile is a characteristic function supported on a bounded smooth domain, some geometric quantities related to the domain, such as the mean curvature,are responsible for the existence of ground state solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce two families of random tridiagonal block matrices for which the joint eigenvalue distributions can be computed explicitly. These distributions are novel within random matrix theory, and exhibit interactions among eigenvalue coordinates beyond the typical mean-field log-gas type. Leveraging the matrix models, we go on to describe the point process limits at the edges of the spectrum in two ways: through certain random differential operators, and also in terms of coupled systems of diffusions. Along the way we establish several algebraic identities involving sums of Vandermonde determinant products.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we construct dual PBW bases of the positive and negative subalgebras of the two-parameter quantum groups $U_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g})$ in classical types, as used in our earlier work arXiv:2407.01450. Following the ideas of Leclerc and Clark-Hill-Wang, we introduce the two-parameter shuffle algebra and relate it to the subalgebras above. We then use the combinatorics of dominant Lyndon words to establish the main results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider different pentagon identities realized by the hyperbolic hypergeometric functions and investigate their degenerations to the level of complex hypergeometric functions. In particular, we show that one of the degenerations yields the complex binomial theorem which coincides with the Fourier transformation of the complex analogue of the Euler beta integral. At the bottom we obtain a Fourier transformation formula for the complex gamma function. This is done with the help of a new type of the limit $\omega_1+\omega_2\to 0$ (or $b\to \textrm{i}$ in two-dimensional conformal field theory) applied to the hyperbolic hypergeometric integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement Hamiltonian for free-fermion chains with a particular form of inhomogeneity. The hopping amplitudes and chemical potentials are chosen such that the single-particle eigenstates are related to discrete orthogonal polynomials of the Askey scheme. Due to the bispectral properties of these functions, one can construct an operator which commutes exactly with the entanglement Hamiltonian and corresponds to a linear or parabolic deformation of the physical one. We show that this deformation is interpreted as a local inverse temperature and can be obtained in the continuum limit via methods of conformal field theory. Using this prediction, the properly rescaled eigenvalues of the commuting operator are found to provide a very good approximation of the entanglement spectrum and entropy.</description>

Abstract: Global solution curve and exact multiplicity of positive solutions for a class of fourth-order beam equations with clamped boundary conditions are derived. The results extend atheorem of P. Korman (2004) by allowing the presence of a singularity in the nonlinearity. The paper also establishes an a priori estimate for C^3-norm of positive solutions, which is optimal in Holder regularity. Applications to MEMS/NEMS models are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02692v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove power-law dynamical localization for polynomial long-range hopping lattice operators with uniform electric field under any bounded perturbation. Actually, we introduce new arguments in the study of dynamical localization for long-range models with unbounded potentials, involving the Min-Max Principle and a notion of Power-Law ULE. Unlike existing results in the literature, our approach does not rely on KAM techniques or on Green's function estimates, but rather on the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and the potential. It is worth underlining that our general results can be applied to other models, such as Maryland-type potentials.</description>

      <title>Dynamical spectrum of power-free integers in quadratic number fields and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Power-free integers and related lattice subsets give rise to interesting dynamical systems. They are revisited from a spectral perspective, in the setting of the Halmos--von Neumann theorem. With respect to the natural patch frequency measure, also known as the Mirsky measure, many of these systems have pure-point dynamical spectrum, but trivial topological point spectrum. We calculate the spectra explicitly, in additive notation, and derive their group structure, both for a large class of $\cB$-free lattice systems in $\RR^d$ and for power-free integers in quadratic number fields. Further, in all cases, the eigenfunctions can be given in closed form, via the Fourier--Bohr coefficients of generic elements and their translates, which form a subset of full Mirsky measure. Based on a simple argument via Kolmogorov's strong law of large numbers, we show how the Fourier--Bohr coefficients also provide the eigenfunctions for the unique measure of maximal entropy, and that we get phase consistency for both measures.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of Schr\"odinger equation for potentials with inverse-square singularities: Generalized Trigonometric P\"oschl-Teller model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a renormalization procedure necessary for the complete description of the energy spectra of a one-dimensional stationary Schr\"odinger equation with a potential that exhibits inverse-square singularities. We apply and extend the methods introduced in our recent paper on the hyperbolic P\"oschl-Teller potential (with a single singularity) to its trigonometric version. This potential, defined between two singularities, is analyzed across the entire bidimensional coupling space. The fact that the trigonometric P\"oschl-Teller potential is supersymmetric and shape-invariant simplifies the analysis and eliminates the need for self-adjoint extensions in certain coupling regions. However, if at least one coupling is strongly attractive, the renormalization is essential to construct a discrete energy spectrum family of one or two parameters. We also investigate the features of a singular symmetric double well obtained by extending the range of the trigonometric P\"oschl-Teller potential. It has a non-degenerate energy spectrum and eigenstates with well-defined parity.</description>

      <title>Support of the Brown measure of a family of free multiplicative Brownian motions with non-negative initial condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a family $b_{s,\tau}$ of free multiplicative Brownian motions labeled by a real variance parameter $s$ and a complex covariance parameter $\tau$. We then consider the element $xb_{s,\tau}$, where $x$ is non-negative and freely independent of $b_{s,\tau}$. Our goal is to identify the support of the Brown measure of $xb_{s,\tau}$.
  In the case $\tau =s$, we identify a region $\Sigma_s$ such that the Brown measure is vanishing outside of $\overline{\Sigma}_s$ except possibly at the origin. For general values of $\tau$, we construct a map $f_{s-\tau}$ and define $D_{s,\tau}$ as the complement of $f_{s-\tau}(\overline{\Sigma}_s^c)$. Then the Brown measure is zero outside $D_{s,\tau}$ except possibly at the origin.
  The proof of these results is based on a two-stage PDE analysis, using one PDE (following the work of Driver, Hall, and Kemp) for the case $\tau=s$ and a different PDE (following the work of Hall and Ho) to deform the $\tau=s$ case to general values of $\tau$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a CLT for linear statistics of the form $\langle \mathbf{q},\boldsymbol{\sigma} \rangle$ with quantitative Berry-Esseen bounds, where $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ is an observation from an exponential family with a quadratic form as its sufficient statistic, in the \enquote{high-temperature} regime. We apply our general result to random field Ising models with both discrete and continuous spins. To demonstrate the generality of our techniques, we apply our results to derive both quenched and annealed CLTs in various examples, which include Ising models on some graph ensembles of common interest (Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi, regular, dense bipartite), and the Hopfield spin glass model. Our proofs rely on a combination of Stein's method of exchangeable pairs and Chevet type concentration inequalities.</description>

      <title>Quantum Field Theory on Multifractal Spacetime: Varying Dimension and Ultraviolet Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by various quantum gravity approaches, we explore quantum field theory where spacetime exhibits scaling properties and dimensional reduction with changing energy scales, effectively behaving as a multifractal manifold. Working within canonical quantization, we demonstrate how to properly quantize fields in such a multifractal spacetime. Our analysis reveals that a non-differentiable nature of spacetime is not merely compatible with quantum field theory but significantly enhances its mathematical foundation. Most notably, this approach ensures perturbative UV finiteness and improved behavior of the series expansion and enables rigorous construction of the S-matrix in the interaction picture by breaking vacuum translational invariance. The multifractal structure tames dominant, large-order divergence sources in the perturbative series and resolves the Landau pole problem through asymptotic safety, substantially improving the theory's behavior in the deep ultraviolet regime. Our formulation preserves all established predictions of standard quantum field theory at low energies while offering novel physical behaviors at high energy scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12521v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These are the extended lecture notes for a minicourse presented at the I S\~ao Paulo School on Gravitational Physics discussing the Bondi--Metzner--Sachs (BMS) group, the group of symmetries at null infinity on asymptotically flat spacetimes. The BMS group has found many applications in classical gravity, quantum field theory in flat and curved spacetimes, and quantum gravity. These notes build the BMS group from its most basic prerequisites (such as group theory, symmetries in differential geometry, and asymptotic flatness) up to modern developments. These include its connections to the Weinberg soft graviton theorem, the memory effect, its use to construct Hadamard states in quantum field theory in curved spacetimes, and other ideas. Advanced sections briefly discuss the main concepts behind the infrared triangle in electrodynamics, superrotations, and the Dappiaggi--Moretti--Pinamonti group in expanding universes with cosmological horizons. New contributions by the author concerning asymptotic (conformal) Killing horizons are discussed at the end.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from the Navier-Stokes equation in the $f$-plane approximation, we provide an exact and explicit solution of the governing equations at leading order for fluid flows in the upper layer of the ocean at mid-latitudes, driven by a wind stress. Such a solution highlights the presence of a mean Ekman current superimposed to trochoidal oscillations and a background geostrophic current.</description>

      <title>Infinite Dimensional Topological-Holomorphic Symmetry in Three-Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a three-dimensional quantum field theory with an infinite-dimensional symmetry, realized explicitly through a centrally extended affine graded Lie algebra. This symmetry is a direct three-dimensional generalization of the chiral symmetry in the Wess-Zumino-Witten model. Upon performing radial quantization, we construct the Fock space of the theory and, via a three-dimensional analogue of the state-operator correspondence, we demonstrate that the algebra of local operators is endowed with the structure of a raviolo vertex algebra. Accordingly, this setup provides a framework for extending the methods of two-dimensional conformal field theory to three dimensions, and we expect it to lay the groundwork for exact methods in three-dimensional quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum TBA for refined BPS indices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Refined BPS indices give rise to a quantum Riemann-Hilbert problem that is inherently related to a non-commutative deformation of moduli spaces arising in gauge and string theory compactifications. We reformulate this problem in terms of a non-commutative deformation of a TBA-like equation and obtain its formal solution as an expansion in refined indices. As an application of this construction, we derive a generating function of solutions of the TBA equation in the unrefined case.</description>

      <title>Scientific Machine Learning with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of scientific machine learning, which originally utilized multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), is increasingly adopting Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for data encoding. This shift is driven by the limitations of MLPs, including poor interpretability, fixed activation functions, and difficulty capturing localized or high-frequency features. KANs address these issues with enhanced interpretability and flexibility, enabling more efficient modeling of complex nonlinear interactions and effectively overcoming the constraints associated with conventional MLP architectures. This review categorizes recent progress in KAN-based models across three distinct perspectives: (i) data-driven learning, (ii) physics-informed modeling, and (iii) deep-operator learning. Each perspective is examined through the lens of architectural design, training strategies, application efficacy, and comparative evaluation against MLP-based counterparts. By benchmarking KANs against MLPs, we highlight consistent improvements in accuracy, convergence, and spectral representation, clarifying KANs' advantages in capturing complex dynamics while learning more effectively. In addition to reviewing recent literature, this work also presents several comparative evaluations that clarify central characteristics of KAN modeling and hint at their potential implications for real-world applications. Finally, this review identifies critical challenges and open research questions in KAN development, particularly regarding computational efficiency, theoretical guarantees, hyperparameter tuning, and algorithm complexity. We also outline future research directions aimed at improving the robustness, scalability, and physical consistency of KAN-based frameworks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Hamiltonian framework for nonlocal Lagrangian systems without relying on infinite-derivative expansions. Starting from a (trajectory-based) variational principle and a generalized Noether theorem, we define the canonical momenta and energy. Moreover, we construct a (pre)symplectic form on the kinematic space, and show that its restriction to the phase space (by implementing the constraints) yields a true (pre)symplectic structure encoding the dynamics. Three examples -- a finite nonlocal oscillator, the fully nonlocal Pais-Uhlenbeck model, and a delayed harmonic oscillator -- demonstrate how phase space and the Hamiltonian emerge without explicitly solving the Euler-Lagrange equations.</description>

      <title>Resolvent-Based Optimisation for Invariant Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a robust optimisation framework for computing invariant solutions of wall-bounded flows by recasting the Navier-Stokes equations as a variational problem as established in Ashtari and Schneider, JFM (2023). The approach minimises the residual of the governing equations over a finite time horizon, seeking periodic or equilibrium solutions. A novel contribution is made by including a Galerkin projection onto a basis of divergence-free modes that satisfy the no-slip boundary conditions. This projection not only makes the variational framework applicable to wall-bounded flows but it also yields a low-order representation of the dynamics. The basis is derived from resolvent analysis, which provides an orthonormal set. We demonstrate the method on a 2D3C formulation of rotating plane Couette flow, obtaining exact equilibrium and periodic solutions consistent with direct numerical simulations. The conditioning of the optimisation problem is analysed in detail, showing that convergence rates depend on the stability properties of the targeted solutions. Finally, we highlight a direct link between the conditioning of the optimisation and the structure of the resolvent operator, suggesting a unifying perspective on both the efficiency of the optimisation and the dynamical significance of resolvent modes.</description>

      <title>PO-CKAN:Physics Informed Deep Operator Kolmogorov Arnold Networks with Chunk Rational Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose PO-CKAN, a physics-informed deep operator framework based on Chunkwise Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs), for approximating the solution operators of partial differential equations. This framework leverages a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture that incorporates Chunkwise Rational Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CKAN) sub-networks for enhanced function approximation. The principles of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are integrated into the operator learning framework to enforce physical consistency. This design enables the efficient learning of physically consistent spatio-temporal solution operators and allows for rapid prediction for parametric time-dependent PDEs with varying inputs (e.g., parameters, initial/boundary conditions) after training. Validated on challenging benchmark problems, PO-CKAN demonstrates accurate operator learning with results closely matching high-fidelity solutions. PO-CKAN adopts a DeepONet-style branch--trunk architecture with its sub-networks instantiated as rational KAN modules, and enforces physical consistency via a PDE residual (PINN-style) loss. On Burgers' equation with $\nu=0.01$, PO-CKAN reduces the mean relative $L^2$ error by approximately 48\% compared to PI-DeepONet, and achieves competitive accuracy on the Eikonal and diffusion--reaction benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Higher power polyadic group rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces and systematically develops the theory of polyadic group rings, a higher arity generalization of classical group rings $\mathcal{R}[\mathsf{G}]$. We construct the fundamental operations of these structures, defining the $\mathbf{m}_{r}$-ary addition and $\mathbf{n}_{r} $-ary multiplication for a polyadic group ring $\mathrm{R}^{[\mathbf{m} _{r},\mathbf{n}_{r}]}=\mathcal{R}^{[m_{r},n_{r}]}[\mathsf{G}^{[n_{g}]}]$ built from a nonderived $(m_{r},n_{r})$-ring and a nonderived $n_{g}$-ary group. A central result is the derivation of the "quantization" conditions that interrelate these arities, governed by the arity freedom principle, which also extends to operations with higher polyadic powers. We establish key algebraic properties, including conditions for total associativity and the existence of a zero element and identity. The concepts of the polyadic augmentation map and augmentation ideal are generalized, providing a bridge to the classical theory. The framework is illustrated with explicit examples, solidifying the theoretical constructions. This work establishes a new foundation in ring theory with potential applications in cryptography and coding theory, as evidenced by recent schemes utilizing polyadic structures.</description>

      <title>Rogue waves and large deviations for 2D pure gravity deep water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rogue waves are extreme ocean events characterized by the sudden formation of anomalously large crests, and remain an important subject of investigation in oceanography and mathematics. A central problem is to quantify the probability of their formation under random Gaussian sea initial data. In this work, we rigorously characterize the tail-probability for the formation of rogue waves of the pure gravity water wave equations in deep water, the most accurate quasilinear PDE modeling waves in open ocean. This large deviation result rigorously proves various conjectures from the oceanography literature in the weakly nonlinear regime. Moreover, the result holds up to the optimal timescales allowed by deterministic well-posedness theory. The proof shows that rogue waves most likely arise through "dispersive focusing", where phase quasi-synchronization produces constructive amplification of the water crest. The main difficulty in justifying this mechanism is propagating statistical information over such long timescales, which we overcome by combining normal forms and probabilistic methods. Unlike prior work, this novel approach does not require approximate solutions to be Gaussian. Our general method tracks the tail probability of solutions to Hamiltonian PDEs with an integrable normal form and random Gaussian initial data over very long times, even in the absence of (quasi-)invariant measures.</description>

      <title>Spectral-Geometric Deformations of Function Algebras on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for deforming the algebra of smooth functions on a compact Riemannian manifold based on spectral data rather than group actions or Poisson structures. The deformation is defined through spectral coefficients of the Laplacian and a weight function satisfying a fusion-type cocycle condition, producing a noncommutative product that depends intrinsically on Laplacian spectrum of the manifold. We develop the analytic and algebraic foundations of this construction, establishing associativity, continuity, and the existence of a group structure on admissible weights. We show that the construction is functorial with respect to spectrum-preserving maps of manifolds. This spectral-geometric deformation quantization approach provides a fully intrinsic analytic model of noncommutative geometry based solely on spectral data of the manifold.</description>

      <title>A natural decomposition of the Jacobi equation for some classes of $N$-body problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider several $N$-body problems. The main result is a very simple and natural criterion for decoupling the Jacobi equation for some classes of them. If $E$ is a Euclidean space, and the potential function $U(x)$ for the $N$-body problem is a $C^2$ function defined in an open subset of $E^N$, then the Jacobi equation along a given motion $x(t)$ writes $\ddot J=HU_x(J)$, where the endomorphism $HU_x$ of $E^N$ represents the second derivative of the potential with respect to the mass inner product.
  Our splitting in particular applies to the case of homographic motions by central configurations. It allows then to deduce the well known Meyer-Schmidt decomposition for the linearization of the Euler-Lagrange flow in the phase space, formulated twenty years ago to study the relative equilibria of the planar $N$-body problem. However, our decomposition principle applies in many other classes of $N$-body problems, for instance to the case of isosceles three body problem, in which Sitnikov proved the existence of oscillatory motions.
  As a first concrete application, for the classical three-body problem we give a simple and short proof of a theorem of Y. Ou, ensuring that if the masses verify $\mu=(m_1+m_2+m_3)^2/(m_1m_2+m_2m_3+m_1m_3)&lt;27/8$ then the elliptic Lagrange solutions are linearly unstable for any value of the excentricity.</description>

      <title>Free energy fluctuations in SK and related spin glass models: A literature survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past 50 years, spin glass models have generated a broad range of literature in mathematics, physics, and computer science. There has been much progress in characterizing and proving the limiting free energy of various models, stemming from the original formulas of Parisi. Comparatively less is known about the more detailed topic of free energy fluctuations. This paper concerns a family of models in which there has been considerable progress on fluctuations, namely the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) and spherical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SSK) models, along with their multi-species analogs. We present a survey of the literature on free energy fluctuations in these 2-spin models, discussing results from different temperature regimes, with and without an external field, including results on phase transitions.</description>
