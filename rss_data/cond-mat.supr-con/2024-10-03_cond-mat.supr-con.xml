      <title>Nonlinearity of transparent SNS weak links decreases sharply with length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductor-normal material-superconductor (SNS) junctions are being integrated into microwave circuits for fundamental and applied research goals. The short junction limit is a common simplifying assumption for experiments with SNS junctions, but this limit constrains how small the nonlinearity of the microwave circuit can be. Here, we show that a finite length of the weak link strongly suppresses the nonlinearity compared to its zero-length limit -- the suppression can be up to a factor of ten even when the length remains shorter than the induced coherence length. We tie this behavior to the nonanalytic dependence of nonlinearity on length, which the critical current does not exhibit. Further, we identify additional experimentally observable consequences of nonzero length, and we conjecture that anharmonicity is bounded between zero and a maximally negative value for any non-interacting Josephson junction in the presence of time-reversal symmetry. We promote SNS junction length as a useful parameter for designing weakly nonlinear microwave circuits.</description>

      <title>Direct Imaging of Transition-Edge Sensors with Scanning SQUID Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant advancements have been made in understanding the physics of transition-edge sensors (TESs) over the past decade. However, key questions remain, particularly a detailed understanding of the current-dependent resistance of these detectors when biased within their superconducting transition. We use scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscopy (SSM) to image the local diamagnetic response of aluminum-manganese alloy (Al-Mn) transition-edge sensors (TESs) near their critical temperature of approximately 175 mK. By doing so, we gain insights into how the device dimensions influence TES transition width, which in turn affects device operation and informs optimal device design. Our images reveal that the Al-Mn thin film near the niobium (Nb) leads exhibits an excess diamagnetic response at temperatures several milli-Kelvin (mK) higher than the bulk of the film farther from the contacts. A possible origin of this behavior is a longitudinal proximity effect between the Nb and Al-Mn where the TES acts as a weak link between superconducting leads. We discuss how this effect shapes the temperature dependence of the resistance as the spacing between the leads decreases. This work demonstrates that magnetic imaging with SSM is a powerful tool for local characterization of superconducting detectors.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in the parent infinite-layer nickelate NdNiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report evidence for superconductivity with onset temperatures up to 11 K in thin films of the infinite-layer nickelate parent compound NdNiO$_2$. A combination of oxide molecular-beam epitaxy and atomic hydrogen reduction yields samples with high crystallinity and low residual resistivities, a substantial fraction of which exhibit superconducting transitions. We survey a large series of samples with a variety of techniques, including electrical transport, scanning transmission electron microscopy, x-ray absorption spectroscopy, and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, to investigate the possible origins of superconductivity. We propose that superconductivity could be intrinsic to the undoped infinite-layer nickelates but suppressed by disorder due to its nodal order parameter, a finding which would necessitate a reconsideration of the nickelate phase diagram. Another possible hypothesis is that the parent materials can be hole doped from randomly dispersed apical oxygen atoms, which would suggest an alternative pathway for achieving superconductivity.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Calculation of Superconducting $T_c$ in Superhard B-C-N Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform first-principles electron-phonon calculations to evaluate the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ for ternary superhard metals B$_2$C$_3$N and B$_4$C$_5$N$_3$. These materials are predicted to exhibit a wide distribution of electron-phonon coupling parameters on their multiple Fermi surface sheets, which necessitates solving the anisotropic Eliashberg equations for accurate determination of $T_c$. An ambient-pressure $T_c$ of $\sim 40$ K and $\sim 20$ K is obtained respectively for B$_2$C$_3$N and B$_4$C$_5$N$_3$ from the anisotropic gap equations. The relatively high $T_c$ of these compounds is due in part to their high Debye temperatures associated with superhardness. The materials under study are potentially synthesizable, as their formation energies are comparable to those of other recently synthesized superhard B-C-N compounds. Therefore, studying superhard metals could hold the promise of realizing new higher-$T_c$ superconductors at ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and confinement: A new pairing mechanism in high-TC cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this brief communication, we propose a novel pairing mechanism for high-TC cuprates to explain the 'stripy' pattern of superconductive charge near and at optimal doping levels, which also act as domain walls for the antiferromagnetic order. This new mechanism is based on the phenomenon of entanglement and confinement. The resulting simple intuitive model seems to suggest that entanglement is indeed a new strong pairing mechanism leading to high-TC superconductivity and strange metal behavior above TC . Moreover, our model can accommodate the Meissner effect.</description>

      <title>Electric and Magnetic Field-dependent Tunneling between Coupled Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupled quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) electron systems host rich emergent physics that cannot be accounted for by understanding isolated 1D electron systems alone. Open questions remain about how transport in these arrays can be manipulated by the application of external electric and magnetic fields. In this theoretical study, we consider a pair of coupled nanowires with non-interacting electrons. We find that a metal-insulator transition is induced by an out-of-plane magnetic field and a transverse potential bias on an array of such coupled wires. We demonstrate the existence of distinct conductance features and highlight the crucial role played by the field dependence of the interwire potential barrier on transport properties. These predictions agree well with transport experiments performed on coupled nanowires sketched on an LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface. Since our model makes minimal assumptions, we expect our predictions to hold for a wide class of coupled 1D systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Tuned Metal-Insulator Transition in LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ Nanowire Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wide family of two dimensional (2D) systems, including stripe-phase superconductors, sliding Luttinger liquids, and anisotropic 2D materials, can be modeled by an array of coupled one-dimensional (1D) electron channels or nanowire arrays. Here we report experiments in arrays of conducting nanowires with gate and field tunable interwire coupling, that are programmed at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface. We find a magnetically-tuned metal-to-insulator transition in which the transverse resistance of the nanowire array increases by up to four orders of magnitude. To explain this behavior, we develop a minimal model of a coupled two-wire system which agrees well with observed phenomena. These nanowire arrays can serve as a model systems to understand the origin of exotic behavior in correlated materials via analog quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Topological superconductivity in a spin-orbit coupled Kondo lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the effect of spin-orbit coupling on a two-dimensional Kondo Lattice model, in which conduction electrons are antiferromagnetically coupled to a Yao-Lee spin liquid. When a Rashba spin-orbit interaction and a nearest-neighbor Kondo interaction is introduced, the low-energy Majorana bands become gapped and develop Chern numbers, protecting unidirectionally propagating Majorana edge modes. Our model describes a chiral topological superconductor with fractionalized charge-$e$ order parameter and spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry, which may be of interest for certain heavy fermion superconductors, such as UTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Role of microstructure on flux expulsion of superconducting radio frequency cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trapped residual magnetic flux during the cool-down due to the incomplete Meissner state is a significant source of radio frequency losses in superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities. Here, we show a clear correlation between the niobium microstructure in elliptical cavity geometry and flux expulsion behavior. In particular, a traditionally fabricated Nb cavity half cell from an annealed poly-crystalline Nb sheet after an 800 $^\circ$C heat treatment leads to a bi-modal microstructure that ties in with flux trapping and inefficient flux expulsion. This non-uniform microstructure is related to varying strain profiles along the cavity shape. A novel approach to prevent this non uniform microstructure is presented by fabricating a 1.3 GHz single cell Nb cavity with a cold-worked sheet and subsequent heat treatment leading to better flux expulsion after 800 $^\circ$C/3 h. Microstructural evolution by electron backscattered diffraction-orientation imaging microscopy on cavity cutouts, and flux pinning behavior by dc-magnetization on coupon samples confirms a reduction in flux pinning centers with increased heat treatment temperature. The heat treatment temperature dependent mechanical properties and thermal conductivity are reported. The significant impact of cold-work in this study demonstrates clear evidence for the importance of microstructure required for high-performance superconducting cavities with reduced losses caused by magnetic flux trapping.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body solver using artificial neural networks and its applications to strongly correlated electron systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the evolution of numerical methods, we are now aiming at not only qualitative understanding but also quantitative prediction and design of quantum many-body phenomena. As a novel numerical approach, machine learning techniques have been introduced in 2017 to analyze quantum many-body problems. Since then, proposed various novel approaches have opened a new era, in which challenging and fundamental problems in physics can be solved by machine learning methods. Especially, quantitative and accurate estimates of material-dependent physical properties of strongly correlated matter have now become realized by combining first-principles calculations with highly accurate quantum many-body solvers developed with the help of machine learning methods. Thus developed quantitative description of electron correlations will constitute a key element of materials science in the next generation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Restored Symmetry Protected Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases are fundamental quantum many-body states of matter beyond Landau's paradigm. Here, we introduce the concept of quantum restored SPTs (QRSPTs), where the protecting symmetry is spontaneously broken at each instance in time, but restored after time average over quantum fluctuations, so that topological features re-emerge. To illustrate the concept, we study a one-dimensional fermionic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with fluctuating superconducting order. We solve this problem in several limiting cases using a variety of analytical methods and compare them to numerical (density matrix renormalization group) simulations which are valid throughout the parameter regime. We thereby map out the phase diagram and identify a QRSPT phase with topological features which are reminiscent from (but not identical to) the topology of the underlying free fermion system. The QRSPT paradigm thereby stimulates a new perspective for the constructive design of novel topological quantum many-body phases.</description>

      <title>Amplitude, phase, and topological fluctuations shaping the complex phase diagram of two-dimensional superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the amplitude and phase fluctuations of the Ginzburg-Landau quasiorder parameter for superconductors in two spatial dimensions. Starting from the mean-field critical temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}0}$, we calculate the beyond-mean-field critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$ by including thermal fluctuations of the quasiorder parameter within the Gaussian level. Moreover, from our beyond-mean-field results, we derive the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless critical temperature $T_{\rm BKT}$, which takes into account topological vortex-antivortex excitations in the phase fluctuations as well as the amplitude fluctuations, to obtain the shifts of transition temperatures. We elucidate how the Gaussian thermal fluctuations and phase fluctuations associated with vortex excitations affect thermodynamic properties by determining the $H$-$T$ phase diagram for a type-II superconductor and computing the critical behaviors of the heat capacity, which are experimentally accessible, allowing the characterization of the cascade of different kinds of fluctuations in 2D superconductors.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on the highest phonon frequency and superconducting temperature from fundamental physical constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fundamental physical constants govern key effects in high-energy particle physics and astrophysics, including the stability of particles, nuclear reactions, formation and evolution of stars, synthesis of heavy nuclei and emergence of stable molecular structures. Here, we show that fundamental constants also set an upper bound for the frequency of phonons in condensed matter phases, or how rapidly an atom can vibrate. This bound is in agreement with \textit{ab initio} simulations of atomic hydrogen and high-temperature hydride superconductors, and implies an upper limit to the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in condensed matter. Fundamental constants set this limit to the order of 10$^2-10^3$ K. This range is consistent with our calculations of $T_c$ from optimal Eliashberg functions. As a corollary, we observe that the very existence of the current research of finding $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ at and above $300$ K is due to the observed values of fundamental constants. We finally discuss how fundamental constants affect the observability and operation of other effects and phenomena including phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Superluminal Propagation of Composite Collective Modes in Superconductor-Ferromagnet Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor Josephson junctions are paradigmatic systems for studying the delicate interplay of superconductivity and magnetism via proximity effects as well as their composite excitations. Here, we analyse the collective modes (CM) in such a heterostructure by taking into account the interplay between the de-magnetisation field $H_{dem}$ and the field caused by the anisotropy of the ferromagnet $H_{an}$, which was previously neglected. It turns out that the spectrum of composite collective modes, $\omega(k)$, has a qualitatively different form in the case of $H_{dem}&lt;H_{an}$ and of $H_{dem}&gt;H_{an}$. In the first case, the dependence $\omega(k)$ has the same form as in previous studies, whereas in the second case, the spectrum looks completely different. In particular, for moderate or weak anisotropy in ferromagnet the group velocity of collective modes demonstrates inflection point where the group velocity become infinite and is superluminal. Furthermore, this point separates purely real and complex-conjugate solutions for the collective modes and is also {\it exception point}. We show that the difference of the CMs spectra can be revealed by Fiske experiment, i.\,e.\,by measuring the $I-V$ characteristics in the presence of magnetic field and voltage.</description>

      <title>Inherently dissipative normal currents during thermodynamic changes of state in superconductors: Joule heating vs. magnetocaloric cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08677v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Meissner phase of a superconductor below its critical temperature, an external constant magnetic field is shielded by circulating persistent supercurrents with zero resistance that are formed by Cooper pairs. However, a thermodynamic change of state within this phase at any finite temperature and at finite speed, such as a cooling or a heating, inevitably generates normal currents of thermally excited unpaired charge carriers. These currents are induced by the time-dependent variations in the local magnetic-flux density associated with the imposed change of state. They may not only lead to certain deviations of the magnetic-field distribution from textbook Meissner profiles, but also cause dissipative Joule heating, which appears to be at odds with the expected reversibility in a truly thermodynamic superconducting state. We show that these normal currents also produce a magnetocaloric cooling, which in total instantaneously and precisely compensates for the dissipated heat, thus ensuring overall energy conservation and reversibility in terms of energy. However, the time-dependent Joule heating and magnetocaloric cooling processes are spatially distinct and therefore result in small temperature inhomogeneities that only fade away towards thermodynamic equilibrium after the thermodynamic change of state has halted.</description>

      <title>Cascade switching current detectors based on arrays of Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cascade multiplication is a common technique to enhance the sensitivity of photon detectors. In this study, we demonstrate novel cascade-amplified superconducting detectors utilizing arrays of Josephson junctions. The mutual coupling between junctions induces avalanche-like switching of multiple junctions upon photon absorption, leading to cascade amplification of the readout voltage. We present two prototypes featuring either low-Tc linear Nb/NbxSi1-x/Nb arrays, or high-Tc stacked intrinsic Josephson junctions. Both devices exhibit clear antenna effects in microwave directivities, indicating good impedance matching and absorption efficiency. The combination of high absorption efficiency and large cascade amplification has the potential to produce broadband THz sensors with sensitivity exceeding 10^13 V/W.</description>

      <title>Identifying trivial and Majorana zero-energy modes using the Majorana polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider superconductor-semiconductor hybrids containing both trivial and Majorana zero modes and explore their signatures in the Majorana polarization. In particular, we consider trivial zero energy states due to confinement and disorder, which seem to be very likely experimental scenarios. We show that the Majorana polarization is able to characterize the topological phase transition as well as the emergence of Majorana zero modes even when trivial zero-energy states proliferate. Notably, the Majorana polarization inherits direct information about spatial correlations which are then the key for distinguishing Majorana and trivial zero-modes. We demonstrate the utility of the Majorana polarization in normal-superconductor junctions and superconductor-normal-superconductor Josephson junctions. Our results support the interpretation of the Majorana polarization as a real space topological indicator.</description>
