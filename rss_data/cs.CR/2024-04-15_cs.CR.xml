      <title>Securing Monolithic Kernels using Compartmentalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolithic operating systems, where all kernel functionality resides in a single, shared address space, are the foundation of most mainstream computer systems. However, a single flaw, even in a non-essential part of the kernel (e.g., device drivers), can cause the entire operating system to fall under an attacker's control. Kernel hardening techniques might prevent certain types of vulnerabilities, but they fail to address a fundamental weakness: the lack of intra-kernel security that safely isolates different parts of the kernel. We survey kernel compartmentalization techniques that define and enforce intra-kernel boundaries and propose a taxonomy that allows the community to compare and discuss future work. We also identify factors that complicate comparisons among compartmentalized systems, suggest new ways to compare future approaches with existing work meaningfully, and discuss emerging research directions.</description>

      <title>Identification of a replicable optical security element using laser speckle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optical security element containing an area of random rough relief is proposed. It combines the low cost of mass replication inherent in traditional security holograms with the impossibility of holographic copying, when the wave restored by the hologram is rewritten as a copy of this hologram. The proposed optical element is also protected from contact and photographic copying. Laboratory samples of optical elements were obtained by taking replicas of a rough surface. Identification of the authenticity of optical elements was demonstrated by calculating the cross-correlation of speckle patterns produced by coherent light scattered off different replicas. It is assumed that the proposed security elements can be mass-produced on standard equipment for embossing security holograms.</description>

      <title>JailbreakLens: Visual Analysis of Jailbreak Attacks Against Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has underscored concerns regarding their security vulnerabilities, notably against jailbreak attacks, where adversaries design jailbreak prompts to circumvent safety mechanisms for potential misuse. Addressing these concerns necessitates a comprehensive analysis of jailbreak prompts to evaluate LLMs' defensive capabilities and identify potential weaknesses. However, the complexity of evaluating jailbreak performance and understanding prompt characteristics makes this analysis laborious. We collaborate with domain experts to characterize problems and propose an LLM-assisted framework to streamline the analysis process. It provides automatic jailbreak assessment to facilitate performance evaluation and support analysis of components and keywords in prompts. Based on the framework, we design JailbreakLens, a visual analysis system that enables users to explore the jailbreak performance against the target model, conduct multi-level analysis of prompt characteristics, and refine prompt instances to verify findings. Through a case study, technical evaluations, and expert interviews, we demonstrate our system's effectiveness in helping users evaluate model security and identify model weaknesses.</description>

      <title>Enhancing IoT Malware Detection through Adaptive Model Parallelism and Resource Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread integration of IoT devices has greatly improved connectivity and computational capabilities, facilitating seamless communication across networks. Despite their global deployment, IoT devices are frequently targeted for security breaches due to inherent vulnerabilities. Among these threats, malware poses a significant risk to IoT devices. The lack of built-in security features and limited resources present challenges for implementing effective malware detection techniques on IoT devices. Moreover, existing methods assume access to all device resources for malware detection, which is often not feasible for IoT devices deployed in critical real-world scenarios. To overcome this challenge, this study introduces a novel approach to malware detection tailored for IoT devices, leveraging resource and workload awareness inspired by model parallelism. Initially, the device assesses available resources for malware detection using a lightweight regression model. Based on resource availability, ongoing workload, and communication costs, the malware detection task is dynamically allocated either on-device or offloaded to neighboring IoT nodes with sufficient resources. To uphold data integrity and user privacy, instead of transferring the entire malware detection task, the classifier is divided and distributed across multiple nodes, then integrated at the parent node for detection. Experimental results demonstrate that this proposed technique achieves a significant speedup of 9.8 x compared to on-device inference, while maintaining a high malware detection accuracy of 96.7%.</description>

      <title>Empowering Malware Detection Efficiency within Processing-in-Memory Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread integration of embedded systems across various industries has facilitated seamless connectivity among devices and bolstered computational capabilities. Despite their extensive applications, embedded systems encounter significant security threats, with one of the most critical vulnerabilities being malicious software, commonly known as malware. In recent times, malware detection techniques leveraging Machine Learning have gained popularity. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven particularly efficient in image processing tasks. However, one major drawback of neural network architectures is their substantial computational resource requirements. Continuous training of malware detection models with updated malware and benign samples demands immense computational resources, presenting a challenge for real-world applications. In response to these concerns, we propose a Processing-in-Memory (PIM)-based architecture to mitigate memory access latency, thereby reducing the resources consumed during model updates. To further enhance throughput and minimize energy consumption, we incorporate precision scaling techniques tailored for CNN models. Our proposed PIM architecture exhibits a 1.09x higher throughput compared to existing Lookup Table (LUT)-based PIM architectures. Additionally, precision scaling combined with PIM enhances energy efficiency by 1.5x compared to full-precision operations, without sacrificing performance. This innovative approach offers a promising solution to the resource-intensive nature of malware detection model updates, paving the way for more efficient and sustainable cybersecurity practices.</description>

      <title>On the critical path to implant backdoors and the effectiveness of potential mitigation techniques: Early learnings from XZ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An emerging supply-chain attack due to a backdoor in XZ Utils has been identified. The backdoor allows an attacker to run commands remotely on vulnerable servers utilizing SSH without prior authentication. We have started to collect available information with regards to this attack to discuss current mitigation strategies for such kinds of supply-chain attacks. This paper introduces the critical attack path of the XZ backdoor and provides an overview about potential mitigation techniques related to relevant stages of the attack path.</description>

      <title>Proof-of-Learning with Incentive Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most concurrent blockchain systems rely heavily on the Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanisms for decentralized consensus and security assurance. However, the substantial energy expenditure stemming from computationally intensive yet meaningless tasks has raised considerable concerns surrounding traditional PoW approaches, The PoS mechanism, while free of energy consumption, is subject to security and economic issues. Addressing these issues, the paradigm of Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) seeks to employ challenges of practical significance as PoW, thereby imbuing energy consumption with tangible value. While previous efforts in Proof of Learning (PoL) explored the utilization of deep learning model training SGD tasks as PoUW challenges, recent research has revealed its vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks and the theoretical hardness in crafting a byzantine-secure PoL mechanism. In this paper, we introduce the concept of incentive-security that incentivizes rational provers to behave honestly for their best interest, bypassing the existing hardness to design a PoL mechanism with computational efficiency, a provable incentive-security guarantee and controllable difficulty. Particularly, our work is secure against two attacks to the recent work of Jia et al. [2021], and also improves the computational overhead from $\Theta(1)$ to $O(\frac{\log E}{E})$. Furthermore, while most recent research assumes trusted problem providers and verifiers, our design also guarantees frontend incentive-security even when problem providers are untrusted, and verifier incentive-security that bypasses the Verifier's Dilemma. By incorporating ML training into blockchain consensus mechanisms with provable guarantees, our research not only proposes an eco-friendly solution to blockchain systems, but also provides a proposal for a completely decentralized computing power market in the new AI age.</description>

      <title>SQIAsignHD: SQIsignHD Adaptor Signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptor signatures can be viewed as a generalized form of the standard digital signature schemes where a secret randomness is hidden within a signature. Adaptor signatures are a recent cryptographic primitive and are becoming an important tool for blockchain applications such as cryptocurrencies to reduce on-chain costs, improve fungibility, and contribute to off-chain forms of payment in payment-channel networks, payment-channel hubs, and atomic swaps. However, currently used adaptor signature constructions are vulnerable to quantum adversaries due to Shor's algorithm. In this work, we introduce $\mathsf{SQIAsignHD}$, a new quantum-resistant adaptor signature scheme based on isogenies of supersingular elliptic curves, using SQIsignHD - as the underlying signature scheme - and exploiting the idea of the artificial orientation on the supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol, SIDH, as the underlying hard relation. We, furthermore, show that our scheme is secure in the Quantum Random Oracle Model (QROM).</description>

      <title>Enhancing Security Awareness Through Gamified Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of smart grid (SG) systems, electricity networks have been able to ensure greater efficiency and utility by interconnecting their grids through cloud-based technology. As SGs become increasingly complex, a wide range of security challenges arise, threatening the grid's reliability, safety, efficiency, and stability. The security challenges include the potential exposure of personal data due to hackers intercepting the communications between the SG infrastructure and the smart meters. Security awareness plays a vital role in addressing some of these challenges. However, the traditional training programs are no longer efficient for instilling information security culture in organisations or from an individual user perspective. Gamification is a new concept in the field of information security awareness training (SAT) campaigns that can be introduced to fill in this gap by providing employees with a means of practising and learning about many security flaws and risks that exist within the organisation. Thus, this paper examines the effectiveness of gamification in promoting security awareness among smart meter components for smart grid users/operators. A gaming application is developed as part of the study with the aim of training and evaluating the results through three difficulty levels of questionnaires. Furthermore, the results are evaluated for the three difficulty levels as well as the overall flag captured. It can be demonstrated that the scores of participants in the three levels have improved by 40%, 35% and 29%, respectively. This reflects the awareness of learning within our system.</description>

      <title>GView: A Versatile Assistant for Security Researchers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber security attacks have become increasingly complex over time, with various phases of their kill chain, involving binaries, scripts, documents, executed commands, vulnerabilities, or network traffic.
  We propose a tool, GView, that is designed to investigate possible attacks by providing guided analysis for various file types using automatic artifact identification, extraction, coherent correlation &amp;,inference, and meaningful &amp; intuitive views at different levels of granularity w.r.t. revealed information. The concept behind GView simplifies navigation through all payloads in a complex attack, streamlining the process for security researchers, and Increasing the quality of analysis. GView is generic in the sense it supports a variety of file types and has multiple visualization modes that can be automatically adjusted for each file type alone. Our evaluation shows that GView significantly improves the analysis time of an attack compared to conventional tools used in forensics.</description>

      <title>CodeCloak: A Method for Evaluating and Mitigating Code Leakage by LLM Code Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-based code assistants are becoming increasingly popular among developers. These tools help developers improve their coding efficiency and reduce errors by providing real-time suggestions based on the developer's codebase. While beneficial, these tools might inadvertently expose the developer's proprietary code to the code assistant service provider during the development process. In this work, we propose two complementary methods to mitigate the risk of code leakage when using LLM-based code assistants. The first is a technique for reconstructing a developer's original codebase from code segments sent to the code assistant service (i.e., prompts) during the development process, enabling assessment and evaluation of the extent of code leakage to third parties (or adversaries). The second is CodeCloak, a novel deep reinforcement learning agent that manipulates the prompts before sending them to the code assistant service. CodeCloak aims to achieve the following two contradictory goals: (i) minimizing code leakage, while (ii) preserving relevant and useful suggestions for the developer. Our evaluation, employing GitHub Copilot, StarCoder, and CodeLlama LLM-based code assistants models, demonstrates the effectiveness of our CodeCloak approach on a diverse set of code repositories of varying sizes, as well as its transferability across different models. In addition, we generate a realistic simulated coding environment to thoroughly analyze code leakage risks and evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed mitigation techniques under practical development scenarios.</description>

      <title>Projective Systematic Authentication via Reed-Muller Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of constructing projective systematic authentication schemes based on binary linear codes. In systematic authentication, a tag for authentication is generated and then appended to the information, also referred to as the source, to be sent from the sender. Existing approaches to leverage projective constructions focus primarily on codes over large alphabets, and the projection is simply into one single symbol of the codeword. In this work, we extend the projective construction and propose a general projection process in which the source, which is mapped to a higher dimensional codeword in a given code, is first projected to a lower dimensional vector. The resulting vector is then masked to generate the tag. To showcase the new method, we focus on leveraging binary linear codes and, in particular, Reed-Muller (RM) codes for the proposed projective construction. More specifically, we propose systematic authentication schemes based on RM codes, referred to as RM-Acodes. We provide analytical results for probabilities of deception, widely considered as the main metrics to evaluate the performance of authentication systems. Through our analysis, we discover and discuss explicit connections between the probabilities of deception and various properties of RM codes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this publication, a novel architecture for Proof-of-Useful-Work blockchain consensus which aims to replace hash-based block problems with Monte Carlo simulation-based block problems to donate computational power to real-world HEP experiments is described. Design decisions are detailed and challenges are addressed. The architecture is being implemented using Golang and can be run inside the CbmRoot software environment. The goal is to build a bridge between the disciplines HEP and blockchain to build a novel blockchain network in which the network's computational power is not wasted but instead used to support a scientific experiment while at the same time securing the underlying permissioned blockchain. The blockchain features a token-based cryptocurrency that is rewarded to miners that donate computational power and acts as an additional incentive to participate which traditional volunteer computing can not provide. The implementation named gophy is being implemented in Golang and is expected to be open-sourced before the end of 2024.</description>

      <title>Pirates: Anonymous Group Calls Over Fully Untrusted Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anonymous metadata-private voice call protocols suffer from high delays and so far cannot provide group call functionality. Anonymization inherently yields delay penalties, and scaling signalling and communication to groups of users exacerbates this situation. Our protocol Pirates employs PIR, improves parallelization and signalling, and is the first group voice call protocol that guarantees the strong anonymity notion of communication unobservability. Implementing and measuring a prototype, we show that Pirates with a single server can support group calls with three group members from an 11 concurrent users with mouth-to-ear latency below 365ms, meeting minimum ITU requirements as the first anonymous voice call system. Increasing the number of servers enables bigger group sizes and more participants.</description>

      <title>PrintListener: Uncovering the Vulnerability of Fingerprint Authentication via the Finger Friction Sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fingerprint authentication has been extensively employed in contemporary identity verification systems owing to its rapidity and cost-effectiveness. Due to its widespread use, fingerprint leakage may cause sensitive information theft, enormous economic and personnel losses, and even a potential compromise of national security. As a fingerprint that can coincidentally match a specific proportion of the overall fingerprint population, MasterPrint rings the alarm bells for the security of fingerprint authentication. In this paper, we propose a new side-channel attack on the minutiae-based Automatic Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS), called PrintListener, which leverages users' fingertip swiping actions on the screen to extract fingerprint pattern features (the first-level features) and synthesizes a stronger targeted PatternMasterPrint with potential second-level features. The attack scenario of PrintListener is extensive and covert. It only needs to record users' fingertip friction sound and can be launched by leveraging a large number of social media platforms. Extensive experimental results in realworld scenarios show that Printlistener can significantly improve the attack potency of MasterPrint.</description>

      <title>Make Split, not Hijack: Preventing Feature-Space Hijacking Attacks in Split Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The popularity of Machine Learning (ML) makes the privacy of sensitive data more imperative than ever. Collaborative learning techniques like Split Learning (SL) aim to protect client data while enhancing ML processes. Though promising, SL has been proved to be vulnerable to a plethora of attacks, thus raising concerns about its effectiveness on data privacy. In this work, we introduce a hybrid approach combining SL and Function Secret Sharing (FSS) to ensure client data privacy. The client adds a random mask to the activation map before sending it to the servers. The servers cannot access the original function but instead work with shares generated using FSS. Consequently, during both forward and backward propagation, the servers cannot reconstruct the client's raw data from the activation map. Furthermore, through visual invertibility, we demonstrate that the server is incapable of reconstructing the raw image data from the activation map when using FSS. It enhances privacy by reducing privacy leakage compared to other SL-based approaches where the server can access client input information. Our approach also ensures security against feature space hijacking attack, protecting sensitive information from potential manipulation. Our protocols yield promising results, reducing communication overhead by over 2x and training time by over 7x compared to the same model with FSS, without any SL. Also, we show that our approach achieves &gt;96% accuracy and remains equivalent to the plaintext models.</description>

Abstract: In a nutshell, "the cloud" refers to a collection of interconnected computing resources made possible by an extensive, real-time communication network like the internet. Because of its potential to reduce processing costs, the emerging paradigm of cloud computing has recently attracted a large number of academics. The exponential expansion of cloud computing has made the rapid expansion of cloud services very remarkable. Ensuring the security of personal information in today's interconnected world is no easy task. These days, security is really crucial. Models of security that are relevant to cloud computing include confidentiality, authenticity, accessibility, data integrity, and recovery.

      <title>New Class of Ciphers Using Hardware Entropy Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel, computationally simple method of hiding any message in the stream of random bits by using a secret key. The method is called Bury Among Random Numbers (BARN). A stream of random bits is produced by extracting the entropy of a physical process in a hardware-based true random number generator (TRNG). The process of placing bits of a message into the stream of random bits is governed by the number of random bits skipped between subsequent insertions. The set of numbers that correspond to the steps of BARN is derived from a random number also provided by TRNG. Hence BARN cipher does not depend on any arithmetic function. We propose an effective method of computing random keys from a given number of random bits. We estimate the number of permutations that need to be tested during a brute-force attack on the new cipher for various key lengths. Some practical applications for the new class of symmetrical ciphers are discussed.</description>

      <title>Counteracting Concept Drift by Learning with Future Malware Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accuracy of deployed malware-detection classifiers degrades over time due to changes in data distributions and increasing discrepancies between training and testing data. This phenomenon is known as the concept drift. While the concept drift can be caused by various reasons in general, new malicious files are created by malware authors with a clear intention of avoiding detection. The existence of the intention opens a possibility for predicting such future samples. Including predicted samples in training data should consequently increase the accuracy of the classifiers on new testing data.
  We compare two methods for predicting future samples: (1) adversarial training and (2) generative adversarial networks (GANs). The first method explicitly seeks for adversarial examples against the classifier that are then used as a part of training data. Similarly, GANs also generate synthetic training data. We use GANs to learn changes in data distributions within different time periods of training data and then apply these changes to generate samples that could be in testing data. We compare these prediction methods on two different datasets: (1) Ember public dataset and (2) the internal dataset of files incoming to Avast. We show that while adversarial training yields more robust classifiers, this method is not a good predictor of future malware in general. This is in contrast with previously reported positive results in different domains (including natural language processing and spam detection). On the other hand, we show that GANs can be successfully used as predictors of future malware. We specifically examine malware families that exhibit significant changes in their data distributions over time and the experimental results confirm that GAN-based predictions can significantly improve the accuracy of the classifier on new, previously unseen data.</description>

      <title>Data Analysis Methods Preliminaries for a Photon-based Hardware Random Number Generator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High quality random numbers are necessary in the modern world. Ranging from encryption keys in cyber security to models and simulations for scientific use: it's important that these random numbers are of high quality and quickly attainable. One common solution to the generation of random numbers is that of pseudo-random number generators, or PRNGs. PRNGs generate random numbers by first quantifying some unpredictable phenomena into a number or string and feeding it into an algorithm which yields numbers randomly based on that seed. Easy places to find seeds include the user's mouse movements or the machine's uptime. These are only pseudorandom, however, as if given the same seed twice, the PRNG would generate the same 'random' output. This is great for games like Minecraft, but not so great for cybersecurity encryption key generation. By using a hardware random number generator (HRNG), random numbers that are not susceptible to the flaws found in PRNGs can be attained at a high rate.</description>

      <title>EQO: Exploring Ultra-Efficient Private Inference with Winograd-Based Protocol and Quantization Co-Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Private convolutional neural network (CNN) inference based on secure two-party computation (2PC) suffers from high communication and latency overhead, especially from convolution layers. In this paper, we propose EQO, a quantized 2PC inference framework that jointly optimizes the CNNs and 2PC protocols. EQO features a novel 2PC protocol that combines Winograd transformation with quantization for efficient convolution computation. However, we observe naively combining quantization and Winograd convolution is sub-optimal: Winograd transformations introduce extensive local additions and weight outliers that increase the quantization bit widths and require frequent bit width conversions with non-negligible communication overhead. Therefore, at the protocol level, we propose a series of optimizations for the 2PC inference graph to minimize the communication. At the network level, We develop a sensitivity-based mixed-precision quantization algorithm to optimize network accuracy given communication constraints. We further propose a 2PC-friendly bit re-weighting algorithm to accommodate weight outliers without increasing bit widths. With extensive experiments, EQO demonstrates 11.7x, 3.6x, and 6.3x communication reduction with 1.29%, 1.16%, and 1.29% higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art frameworks SiRNN, COINN, and CoPriv, respectively.</description>

      <title>On the Efficiency of Privacy Attacks in Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed severe privacy risks in federated learning, represented by Gradient Leakage Attacks. However, existing studies mainly aim at increasing the privacy attack success rate and overlook the high computation costs for recovering private data, making the privacy attack impractical in real applications. In this study, we examine privacy attacks from the perspective of efficiency and propose a framework for improving the Efficiency of Privacy Attacks in Federated Learning (EPAFL). We make three novel contributions. First, we systematically evaluate the computational costs for representative privacy attacks in federated learning, which exhibits a high potential to optimize efficiency. Second, we propose three early-stopping techniques to effectively reduce the computational costs of these privacy attacks. Third, we perform experiments on benchmark datasets and show that our proposed method can significantly reduce computational costs and maintain comparable attack success rates for state-of-the-art privacy attacks in federated learning. We provide the codes on GitHub at https://github.com/mlsysx/EPAFL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The random oracle methodology has proven to be a powerful tool for designing and reasoning about cryptographic schemes. In this paper, we focus on the basic problem of correcting faulty or adversarially corrupted random oracles, so that they can be confidently applied for such cryptographic purposes.
  We prove that a simple construction can transform a "subverted" random oracle which disagrees with the original one at a small fraction of inputs into an object that is indifferentiable from a random function, even if the adversary is made aware of all randomness used in the transformation. Our results permit future designers of cryptographic primitives in typical kleptographic settings (i.e., those permitting adversaries that subvert or replace basic cryptographic algorithms) to use random oracles as a trusted black box.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Feistel construction is a fundamental technique for building pseudorandom permutations and block ciphers. This paper shows that a simple adaptation of the construction is resistant, even to algorithm substitution attacks -- that is, adversarial subversion -- of the component round functions. Specifically, we establish that a Feistel-based construction with more than $2000n/\log(1/\epsilon)$ rounds can transform a subverted random function -- which disagrees with the original one at a small fraction (denoted by $\epsilon$) of inputs -- into an object that is \emph{crooked-indifferentiable} from a random permutation, even if the adversary is aware of all the randomness used in the transformation. We also provide a lower bound showing that the construction cannot use fewer than $2n/\log(1/\epsilon)$ rounds to achieve crooked-indifferentiable security.</description>

      <title>SpamDam: Towards Privacy-Preserving and Adversary-Resistant SMS Spam Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce SpamDam, a SMS spam detection framework designed to overcome key challenges in detecting and understanding SMS spam, such as the lack of public SMS spam datasets, increasing privacy concerns of collecting SMS data, and the need for adversary-resistant detection models. SpamDam comprises four innovative modules: an SMS spam radar that identifies spam messages from online social networks(OSNs); an SMS spam inspector for statistical analysis; SMS spam detectors(SSDs) that enable both central training and federated learning; and an SSD analyzer that evaluates model resistance against adversaries in realistic scenarios. Leveraging SpamDam, we have compiled over 76K SMS spam messages from Twitter and Weibo between 2018 and 2023, forming the largest dataset of its kind. This dataset has enabled new insights into recent spam campaigns and the training of high-performing binary and multi-label classifiers for spam detection. Furthermore, effectiveness of federated learning has been well demonstrated to enable privacy-preserving SMS spam detection. Additionally, we have rigorously tested the adversarial robustness of SMS spam detection models, introducing the novel reverse backdoor attack, which has shown effectiveness and stealthiness in practical tests.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap: Automated Analysis of Sancus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Techniques for verifying or invalidating the security of computer systems have come a long way in recent years. Extremely sophisticated tools are available to specify and formally verify the behavior of a system and, at the same time, attack techniques have evolved to the point of questioning the possibility of obtaining adequate levels of security, especially in critical applications. In a recent paper, Bognar et al. have clearly highlighted this inconsistency between the two worlds: on one side, formal verification allows writing irrefutable proofs of the security of a system, on the other side concrete attacks make these proofs waver, exhibiting a gap between models and implementations which is very complex to bridge. In this paper, we propose a new method to reduce this gap in the Sancus embedded security architecture, by exploiting some peculiarities of both approaches. Our technique first extracts a behavioral model by directly interacting with the real Sancus system and then analyzes it to identify attacks and anomalies. Given a threat model, our method either finds attacks in the given threat model or gives probabilistic guarantees on the security of the system. We implement our method and use it to systematically rediscover known attacks and uncover new ones.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Code Vulnerability Detection via Vulnerability-Preserving Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source code vulnerability detection aims to identify inherent vulnerabilities to safeguard software systems from potential attacks. Many prior studies overlook diverse vulnerability characteristics, simplifying the problem into a binary (0-1) classification task for example determining whether it is vulnerable or not. This poses a challenge for a single deep learning-based model to effectively learn the wide array of vulnerability characteristics. Furthermore, due to the challenges associated with collecting large-scale vulnerability data, these detectors often overfit limited training datasets, resulting in lower model generalization performance.
  To address the aforementioned challenges, in this work, we introduce a fine-grained vulnerability detector namely FGVulDet. Unlike previous approaches, FGVulDet employs multiple classifiers to discern characteristics of various vulnerability types and combines their outputs to identify the specific type of vulnerability. Each classifier is designed to learn type-specific vulnerability semantics. Additionally, to address the scarcity of data for some vulnerability types and enhance data diversity for learning better vulnerability semantics, we propose a novel vulnerability-preserving data augmentation technique to augment the number of vulnerabilities. Taking inspiration from recent advancements in graph neural networks for learning program semantics, we incorporate a Gated Graph Neural Network (GGNN) and extend it to an edge-aware GGNN to capture edge-type information. FGVulDet is trained on a large-scale dataset from GitHub, encompassing five different types of vulnerabilities. Extensive experiments compared with static-analysis-based approaches and learning-based approaches have demonstrated the effectiveness of FGVulDet.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Intrusion Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving analytics is designed to protect valuable assets. A common service provision involves the input data from the client and the model on the analyst's side. The importance of the privacy preservation is fuelled by legal obligations and intellectual property concerns. We explore the use case of a model owner providing an analytic service on customer's private data. No information about the data shall be revealed to the analyst and no information about the model shall be leaked to the customer. Current methods involve costs: accuracy deterioration and computational complexity. The complexity, in turn, results in a longer processing time, increased requirement on computing resources, and involves data communication between the client and the server. In order to deploy such service architecture, we need to evaluate the optimal setting that fits the constraints. And that is what this paper addresses. In this work, we enhance an attack detection system based on Convolutional Neural Networks with privacy-preserving technology based on PriMIA framework that is initially designed for medical data.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study of Open Edge Computing Platforms: Ecosystem, Usage, and Security Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging in recent years, open edge computing platforms (OECPs) claim large-scale edge nodes, the extensive usage and adoption, as well as the openness to any third parties to join as edge nodes. For instance, OneThingCloud, a major OECP operated in China, advertises 5 million edge nodes, 70TB bandwidth, and 1,500PB storage. However, little information is publicly available for such OECPs with regards to their technical mechanisms and involvement in edge computing activities. Furthermore, different from known edge computing paradigms, OECPs feature an open ecosystem wherein any third party can participate as edge nodes and earn revenue for the contribution of computing and bandwidth resources, which, however, can introduce byzantine or even malicious edge nodes and thus break the traditional threat model for edge computing. In this study, we conduct the first empirical study on two representative OECPs, which is made possible through the deployment of edge nodes across locations, the efficient and semi-automatic analysis of edge traffic as well as the carefully designed security experiments. As the results, a set of novel findings and insights have been distilled with regards to their technical mechanisms, the landscape of edge nodes, the usage and adoption, and the practical security/privacy risks. Particularly, millions of daily active edge nodes have been observed, which feature a wide distribution in the network space and the extensive adoption in content delivery towards end users of 16 popular Internet services. Also, multiple practical and concerning security risks have been identified along with acknowledgements received from relevant parties, e.g., the exposure of long-term and cross-edge-node credentials, the co-location with malicious activities of diverse categories, the failures of TLS certificate verification, the extensive information leakage against end users, etc.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Federated Unlearning with Certified Client Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Federated Unlearning (FU) has gained attention for addressing the removal of a client's influence from the global model in Federated Learning (FL) systems, thereby ensuring the ``right to be forgotten" (RTBF). State-of-the-art methods for unlearning use historical data from FL clients, such as gradients or locally trained models. However, studies have revealed significant information leakage in this setting, with the possibility of reconstructing a user's local data from their uploaded information. Addressing this, we propose Starfish, a privacy-preserving federated unlearning scheme using Two-Party Computation (2PC) techniques and shared historical client data between two non-colluding servers. Starfish builds upon existing FU methods to ensure privacy in unlearning processes. To enhance the efficiency of privacy-preserving FU evaluations, we suggest 2PC-friendly alternatives for certain FU algorithm operations. We also implement strategies to reduce costs associated with 2PC operations and lessen cumulative approximation errors. Moreover, we establish a theoretical bound for the difference between the unlearned global model via Starfish and a global model retrained from scratch for certified client removal. Our theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that Starfish achieves effective unlearning with reasonable efficiency, maintaining privacy and security in FL systems.</description>

      <title>The Performance of Sequential Deep Learning Models in Detecting Phishing Websites Using Contextual Features of URLs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber attacks continue to pose significant threats to individuals and organizations, stealing sensitive data such as personally identifiable information, financial information, and login credentials. Hence, detecting malicious websites before they cause any harm is critical to preventing fraud and monetary loss. To address the increasing number of phishing attacks, protective mechanisms must be highly responsive, adaptive, and scalable. Fortunately, advances in the field of machine learning, coupled with access to vast amounts of data, have led to the adoption of various deep learning models for timely detection of these cyber crimes. This study focuses on the detection of phishing websites using deep learning models such as Multi-Head Attention, Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), BI-LSTM, and LSTM where URLs of the phishing websites are treated as a sequence. The results demonstrate that Multi-Head Attention and BI-LSTM model outperform some other deep learning-based algorithms such as TCN and LSTM in producing better precision, recall, and F1-scores.</description>

      <title>Larger-scale Nakamoto-style Blockchains Don't Necessarily Offer Better Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive research on Nakamoto-style consensus protocols has shown that network delays degrade the security of these protocols. Established results indicate that, perhaps surprisingly, maximal security is achieved when the network is as small as two nodes due to increased delays in larger networks. This contradicts the very foundation of blockchains, namely that decentralization improves security. In this paper, we take a closer look at how the network scale affects security of Nakamoto-style blockchains. We argue that a crucial aspect has been neglected in existing security models: the larger the network, the harder it is for an attacker to control a significant amount of power. To this end, we introduce a probabilistic corruption model to express the increasing difficulty for an attacker to corrupt resources in larger networks. Based on our model, we analyze the impact of the number of nodes on the (maximum) network delay and the fraction of adversarial power. In particular, we show that (1) increasing the number of nodes eventually violates security, but (2) relying on a small number of nodes does not provide decent security provisions either. We then validate our analysis by means of an empirical evaluation emulating hundreds of thousands of nodes in deployments such as Bitcoin, Monero, Cardano, and Ethereum Classic. Based on our empirical analysis, we concretely analyze the impact of various real-world parameters and configurations on the consistency bounds in existing deployments and on the adversarial power that can be tolerated while providing security. As far as we are aware, this is the first work that analytically and empirically explores the real-world tradeoffs achieved by current popular Nakamoto-style deployments.</description>

      <title>Integrating Multi -WAN, VPN and IEEE 802.3ad for Advanced IPSEC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the emergence of the internet, IPSEC has undergone significant changes due to changes in the type and behavior of users worldwide. IEEE 802.3ad, while considered a key aspect of the IPSEC model, is predictable and can result in potential design flaws, making it relatively easy to access a secure workstation. Thus, it is critical to leverage the benefits of multiple ISPs (multi-WAN) and a link aggregation model and integrate an aspect of randomisation in the network. This facet of the network is highlighted by the proof of concept in the simulation of a double pendulum. The analysis of POC provided a network topology designed to utilize multiple WAN, 802.3ad link aggregation, and other environmental components to create a sense of true randomness within a network system. An analysis of this approach shows that it accounts for the data stream's size, transmission speed, WANs and VPNs' location, and other environmental factors to create a sense of randomness. Based on the proof concept, it can be concluded that attaining randomisation using multi-WAN, VPN, and 802.3ad is a highly effective model for improving IPSEC.</description>

      <title>Towards Building a Robust Toxicity Predictor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent NLP literature pays little attention to the robustness of toxicity language predictors, while these systems are most likely to be used in adversarial contexts. This paper presents a novel adversarial attack, \texttt{ToxicTrap}, introducing small word-level perturbations to fool SOTA text classifiers to predict toxic text samples as benign. ToxicTrap exploits greedy based search strategies to enable fast and effective generation of toxic adversarial examples. Two novel goal function designs allow ToxicTrap to identify weaknesses in both multiclass and multilabel toxic language detectors. Our empirical results show that SOTA toxicity text classifiers are indeed vulnerable to the proposed attacks, attaining over 98\% attack success rates in multilabel cases. We also show how a vanilla adversarial training and its improved version can help increase robustness of a toxicity detector even against unseen attacks.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Log-Location-Scale Regression Using Functional Mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces differentially private log-location-scale (DP-LLS) regression models, which incorporate differential privacy into LLS regression through the functional mechanism. The proposed models are established by injecting noise into the log-likelihood function of LLS regression for perturbed parameter estimation. We will derive the sensitivities utilized to determine the magnitude of the injected noise and prove that the proposed DP-LLS models satisfy $\epsilon$-differential privacy. In addition, we will conduct simulations and case studies to evaluate the performance of the proposed models. The findings suggest that predictor dimension, training sample size, and privacy budget are three key factors impacting the performance of the proposed DP-LLS regression models. Moreover, the results indicate that a sufficiently large training dataset is needed to simultaneously ensure decent performance of the proposed models and achieve a satisfactory level of privacy protection.</description>

      <title>LazyDP: Co-Designing Algorithm-Software for Scalable Training of Differentially Private Recommendation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is widely being employed in the industry as a practical standard for privacy protection. While private training of computer vision or natural language processing applications has been studied extensively, the computational challenges of training of recommender systems (RecSys) with DP have not been explored. In this work, we first present our detailed characterization of private RecSys training using DP-SGD, root-causing its several performance bottlenecks. Specifically, we identify DP-SGD's noise sampling and noisy gradient update stage to suffer from a severe compute and memory bandwidth limitation, respectively, causing significant performance overhead in training private RecSys. Based on these findings, we propose LazyDP, an algorithm-software co-design that addresses the compute and memory challenges of training RecSys with DP-SGD. Compared to a state-of-the-art DP-SGD training system, we demonstrate that LazyDP provides an average 119x training throughput improvement while also ensuring mathematically equivalent, differentially private RecSys models to be trained.</description>

      <title>Private Multiple Linear Computation: A Flexible Communication-Computation Tradeoff</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of private multiple linear computation (PMLC) over a replicated storage system with colluding and unresponsive constraints. In this scenario, the user wishes to privately compute $P$ linear combinations of $M$ files from a set of $N$ replicated servers without revealing any information about the coefficients of these linear combinations to any $T$ colluding servers, in the presence of $S$ unresponsive servers that do not provide any information in response to user queries. Our focus is on more general performance metrics where the communication and computational overheads incurred by the user are not neglected. Additionally, the communication and computational overheads for servers are also taken into consideration. Unlike most previous literature that primarily focused on download cost from servers as a performance metric, we propose a novel PMLC scheme to establish a flexible tradeoff between communication costs and computational complexities.</description>

Abstract: In a XOR-based alternating block cipher the plaintext is masked by a sequence of layers each performing distinct actions: a highly nonlinear permutation, a linear transformation, and the bitwise key addition. When assessing resistance against classical differential attacks (where differences are computed with respect to XOR), the cryptanalysts must only take into account differential probabilities introduced by the nonlinear layer, this being the only one whose differential transitions are not deterministic. The temptation of computing differentials with respect to another difference operation runs into the difficulty of understanding how differentials propagate through the XOR-affine levels of the cipher. In this paper we introduce a special family of braces that enable the derivation of a set of differences whose interaction with every layer of an XOR-based alternating block cipher can be understood. We show that such braces can be described also in terms of alternating binary algebras of nilpotency class two. Additionally, we present a method to compute the automorphism group of these structures through an equivalence between bilinear maps. By doing so, we characterise the XOR-linear permutations for which the differential transitions with respect to the new difference are deterministic, facilitating an alternative differential attack.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Robustness Limits via Scaling-Law and Human-Alignment Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper revisits the simple, long-studied, yet still unsolved problem of making image classifiers robust to imperceptible perturbations. Taking CIFAR10 as an example, SOTA clean accuracy is about $100$%, but SOTA robustness to $\ell_{\infty}$-norm bounded perturbations barely exceeds $70$%. To understand this gap, we analyze how model size, dataset size, and synthetic data quality affect robustness by developing the first scaling laws for adversarial training. Our scaling laws reveal inefficiencies in prior art and provide actionable feedback to advance the field. For instance, we discovered that SOTA methods diverge notably from compute-optimal setups, using excess compute for their level of robustness. Leveraging a compute-efficient setup, we surpass the prior SOTA with $20$% ($70$%) fewer training (inference) FLOPs. We trained various compute-efficient models, with our best achieving $74$% AutoAttack accuracy ($+3$% gain). However, our scaling laws also predict robustness slowly grows then plateaus at $90$%: dwarfing our new SOTA by scaling is impractical, and perfect robustness is impossible. To better understand this predicted limit, we carry out a small-scale human evaluation on the AutoAttack data that fools our top-performing model. Concerningly, we estimate that human performance also plateaus near $90$%, which we show to be attributable to $\ell_{\infty}$-constrained attacks' generation of invalid images not consistent with their original labels. Having characterized limiting roadblocks, we outline promising paths for future research.</description>

      <title>Privacy at a Price: Exploring its Dual Impact on AI Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The worldwide adoption of machine learning (ML) and deep learning models, particularly in critical sectors, such as healthcare and finance, presents substantial challenges in maintaining individual privacy and fairness. These two elements are vital to a trustworthy environment for learning systems. While numerous studies have concentrated on protecting individual privacy through differential privacy (DP) mechanisms, emerging research indicates that differential privacy in machine learning models can unequally impact separate demographic subgroups regarding prediction accuracy. This leads to a fairness concern, and manifests as biased performance. Although the prevailing view is that enhancing privacy intensifies fairness disparities, a smaller, yet significant, subset of research suggests the opposite view. In this article, with extensive evaluation results, we demonstrate that the impact of differential privacy on fairness is not monotonous. Instead, we observe that the accuracy disparity initially grows as more DP noise (enhanced privacy) is added to the ML process, but subsequently diminishes at higher privacy levels with even more noise. Moreover, implementing gradient clipping in the differentially private stochastic gradient descent ML method can mitigate the negative impact of DP noise on fairness. This mitigation is achieved by moderating the disparity growth through a lower clipping threshold.</description>

      <title>On the Optimal Regret of Locally Private Linear Contextual Bandit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contextual bandit with linear reward functions is among one of the most extensively studied models in bandit and online learning research. Recently, there has been increasing interest in designing \emph{locally private} linear contextual bandit algorithms, where sensitive information contained in contexts and rewards is protected against leakage to the general public. While the classical linear contextual bandit algorithm admits cumulative regret upper bounds of $\tilde O(\sqrt{T})$ via multiple alternative methods, it has remained open whether such regret bounds are attainable in the presence of local privacy constraints, with the state-of-the-art result being $\tilde O(T^{3/4})$. In this paper, we show that it is indeed possible to achieve an $\tilde O(\sqrt{T})$ regret upper bound for locally private linear contextual bandit. Our solution relies on several new algorithmic and analytical ideas, such as the analysis of mean absolute deviation errors and layered principal component regression in order to achieve small mean absolute deviation errors.</description>

      <title>Beyond Noise: Privacy-Preserving Decentralized Learning with Virtual Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized learning (DL) enables collaborative learning without a server and without training data leaving the users' devices. However, the models shared in DL can still be used to infer training data. Conventional privacy defenses such as differential privacy and secure aggregation fall short in effectively safeguarding user privacy in DL. We introduce Shatter, a novel DL approach in which nodes create virtual nodes (VNs) to disseminate chunks of their full model on their behalf. This enhances privacy by (i) preventing attackers from collecting full models from other nodes, and (ii) hiding the identity of the original node that produced a given model chunk. We theoretically prove the convergence of Shatter and provide a formal analysis demonstrating how Shatter reduces the efficacy of attacks compared to when exchanging full models between participating nodes. We evaluate the convergence and attack resilience of Shatter with existing DL algorithms, with heterogeneous datasets, and against three standard privacy attacks, including gradient inversion. Our evaluation shows that Shatter not only renders these privacy attacks infeasible when each node operates 16 VNs but also exhibits a positive impact on model convergence compared to standard DL. This enhanced privacy comes with a manageable increase in communication volume.</description>

      <title>VFLGAN: Vertical Federated Learning-based Generative Adversarial Network for Vertically Partitioned Data Publication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the current artificial intelligence (AI) era, the scale and quality of the dataset play a crucial role in training a high-quality AI model. However, good data is not a free lunch and is always hard to access due to privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). A potential solution is to release a synthetic dataset with a similar distribution to that of the private dataset. Nevertheless, in some scenarios, it has been found that the attributes needed to train an AI model belong to different parties, and they cannot share the raw data for synthetic data publication due to privacy regulations. In PETS 2023, Xue et al. proposed the first generative adversary network-based model, VertiGAN, for vertically partitioned data publication. However, after thoroughly investigating, we found that VertiGAN is less effective in preserving the correlation among the attributes of different parties. This article proposes a Vertical Federated Learning-based Generative Adversarial Network, VFLGAN, for vertically partitioned data publication to address the above issues. Our experimental results show that compared with VertiGAN, VFLGAN significantly improves the quality of synthetic data. Taking the MNIST dataset as an example, the quality of the synthetic dataset generated by VFLGAN is 3.2 times better than that generated by VertiGAN w.r.t. the Fr\'echet Distance. We also designed a more efficient and effective Gaussian mechanism for the proposed VFLGAN to provide the synthetic dataset with a differential privacy guarantee. On the other hand, differential privacy only gives the upper bound of the worst-case privacy guarantee. This article also proposes a practical auditing scheme that applies membership inference attacks to estimate privacy leakage through the synthetic dataset.</description>

Abstract: Continuing our analysis of quantum machine learning applied to our use-case of malware detection, we investigate the potential of quantum convolutional neural networks. More precisely, we propose a new architecture where data is uploaded all along the quantum circuit. This allows us to use more features from the data, hence giving to the algorithm more information, without having to increase the number of qubits that we use for the quantum circuit. This approach is motivated by the fact that we do not always have great amounts of data, and that quantum computers are currently restricted in their number of logical qubits.</description>

Abstract: The interest in federated learning has surged in recent research due to its unique ability to train a global model using privacy-secured information held locally on each client. This paper pays particular attention to the issue of client-side model heterogeneity, a pervasive challenge in the practical implementation of FL that escalates its complexity. Assuming a scenario where each client possesses varied memory storage, processing capabilities and network bandwidth - a phenomenon referred to as system heterogeneity - there is a pressing need to customize a unique model for each client. In response to this, we present an effective and adaptable federated framework FedP3, representing Federated Personalized and Privacy-friendly network Pruning, tailored for model heterogeneity scenarios. Our proposed methodology can incorporate and adapt well-established techniques to its specific instances. We offer a theoretical interpretation of FedP3 and its locally differential-private variant, DP-FedP3, and theoretically validate their efficiencies.</description>

      <title>How Far Have We Gone in Stripped Binary Code Understanding Using Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary code analysis plays a pivotal role in various software security applications, such as software maintenance, malware detection, software vulnerability discovery, patch analysis, etc. However, unlike source code, understanding binary code is challenging for reverse engineers due to the absence of semantic information. Therefore, automated tools are needed to assist human players in interpreting binary code. In recent years, two groups of technologies have shown promising prospects: (1) Deep learning-based technologies have demonstrated competitive results in tasks related to binary code understanding, furthermore, (2) Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively pre-trained at the source-code level for tasks such as code understanding and generation. This makes participants wonder about the ability of LLMs in binary code understanding.
  In this work, we propose a benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in real-world reverse engineering scenarios. The benchmark covers two key binary code understanding tasks, including function name recovery and binary code summarization. We gain valuable insights into their capabilities and limitations through extensive evaluations of popular LLMs using our benchmark. Our evaluations reveal that existing LLMs can understand binary code to a certain extent, thereby improving the efficiency of binary code analysis. Our results highlight the great potential of the LLMs in advancing the field of binary code understanding.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly being adopted across various fields, such as medicine, business, autonomous vehicles, and cybersecurity, to analyze vast amounts of data, detect patterns, and make predictions or recommendations. In the field of cybersecurity, these models have made significant improvements in malware detection. However, despite their ability to understand complex patterns from unstructured data, these models are susceptible to adversarial attacks that perform slight modifications in malware samples, leading to misclassification from malignant to benign. Numerous defense approaches have been proposed to either detect such adversarial attacks or improve model robustness. These approaches have resulted in a multitude of attack and defense techniques and the emergence of a field known as `adversarial machine learning.' In this survey paper, we provide a comprehensive review of adversarial machine learning in the context of Android malware classifiers. Android is the most widely used operating system globally and is an easy target for malicious agents. The paper first presents an extensive background on Android malware classifiers, followed by an examination of the latest advancements in adversarial attacks and defenses. Finally, the paper provides guidelines for designing robust malware classifiers and outlines research directions for the future.</description>

      <title>SoK: A Stratified Approach to Blockchain Decentralization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01291v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralization has been touted as the principal security advantage which propelled blockchain systems at the forefront of developments in the financial technology space. Its exact semantics nevertheless remain highly contested and ambiguous, with proponents and critics disagreeing widely on the level of decentralization offered by existing systems. To address this, we put forth a systematization of the current landscape with respect to decentralization and we derive a methodology that can help direct future research towards defining and measuring decentralization. Our approach dissects blockchain systems into multiple layers, or strata, each possibly encapsulating multiple categories, and it enables a unified method for measuring decentralization in each one. Our layers are (1) hardware, (2) software, (3) network, (4) consensus, (5) economics ("tokenomics"), (6) client API, (7) governance, and (8) geography. Armed with this stratification, we examine for each layer which pertinent properties of distributed ledgers (safety, liveness, privacy, stability) can be at risk due to centralization and in what way. We also introduce a practical test, the "Minimum Decentralization Test" which can provide quick insights about the decentralization state of a blockchain system. To demonstrate how our stratified methodology can be used in practice, we apply it fully (layer by layer) to Bitcoin, and we provide examples of systems which comprise one or more "problematic" layers that cause them to fail the MDT. Our work highlights the challenges in measuring and achieving decentralization, and suggests various potential directions where future research is needed.</description>

      <title>Prompt Stealing Attacks Against Text-to-Image Generation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-Image generation models have revolutionized the artwork design process and enabled anyone to create high-quality images by entering text descriptions called prompts. Creating a high-quality prompt that consists of a subject and several modifiers can be time-consuming and costly. In consequence, a trend of trading high-quality prompts on specialized marketplaces has emerged. In this paper, we perform the first study on understanding the threat of a novel attack, namely prompt stealing attack, which aims to steal prompts from generated images by text-to-image generation models. Successful prompt stealing attacks directly violate the intellectual property of prompt engineers and jeopardize the business model of prompt marketplaces. We first perform a systematic analysis on a dataset collected by ourselves and show that a successful prompt stealing attack should consider a prompt's subject as well as its modifiers. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective prompt stealing attack, PromptStealer. It consists of two modules: a subject generator trained to infer the subject and a modifier detector for identifying the modifiers within the generated image. Experimental results demonstrate that PromptStealer is superior over three baseline methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively. We also make some initial attempts to defend PromptStealer. In general, our study uncovers a new attack vector within the ecosystem established by the popular text-to-image generation models. We hope our results can contribute to understanding and mitigating this emerging threat.</description>

      <title>Post-Quantum Hybrid Digital Signatures with Hardware-Support for Digital Twins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital Twins (DT) virtually model cyber-physical objects using Internet of Things (IoT) components (e.g., sensors) to gather and process senstive information stored in the cloud. Trustworthiness of the streamed data is crucial which requires quantum safety and breach resiliency. Digital signatures are essential for scalable authentication and non-repudiation. Yet, NIST PQC signature standards are exorbitantly costly for low-end IoT without considering forward security. Moreover, Post-Quantum (PQ) signatures lack aggregation, which is highly desirable to reduce the transmission and storage burdens in DTs. Hence, there is an urgent need for lightweight digital signatures that offer compromise resiliency and compactness while permitting an effective transition into the PQ era for DTs.
  We create a series of highly lightweight digital signatures called Hardware-ASsisted Efficient Signature (HASES) that meets the above requirements. The core of HASES is a hardware-assisted cryptographic commitment construct oracle (CCO) that permits verifiers to obtain expensive commitments without signer interaction. We created three HASES schemes: PQ-HASES is a forward-secure PQ signature, LA-HASES is an efficient aggregate Elliptic-Curve signature, and HY-HASES is a novel hybrid scheme that combines PQ-HASES and LA-HASES with novel strong nesting and sequential aggregation. HASES does not require a secure-hardware on the signer. We proved that HASES schemes are secure and implemented them on commodity hardware and an 8-bit AVR ATmega2560. Our experiments confirm that PQ-HASES and LA-HASES are two magnitudes of times more signer efficient than their PQ and conventional-secure counterparts, respectively. HY-HASES outperforms NIST PQC and conventional signature combinations, offering a standardcompliant transitional solution for emerging DTs. We open-source HASES schemes for public testing and adaptation.</description>

      <title>Hiding in Plain Sight: Disguising Data Stealing Attacks in Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03013v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Malicious server (MS) attacks have enabled the scaling of data stealing in federated learning to large batch sizes and secure aggregation, settings previously considered private. However, many concerns regarding the client-side detectability of MS attacks were raised, questioning their practicality. In this work, for the first time, we thoroughly study client-side detectability. We first demonstrate that all prior MS attacks are detectable by principled checks, and formulate a necessary set of requirements that a practical MS attack must satisfy. Next, we propose SEER, a novel attack framework that satisfies these requirements. The key insight of SEER is the use of a secret decoder, jointly trained with the shared model. We show that SEER can steal user data from gradients of realistic networks, even for large batch sizes of up to 512 and under secure aggregation. Our work is a promising step towards assessing the true vulnerability of federated learning in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Backdoor Federated Learning by Poisoning Backdoor-Critical Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has been widely deployed to enable machine learning training on sensitive data across distributed devices. However, the decentralized learning paradigm and heterogeneity of FL further extend the attack surface for backdoor attacks. Existing FL attack and defense methodologies typically focus on the whole model. None of them recognizes the existence of backdoor-critical (BC) layers-a small subset of layers that dominate the model vulnerabilities. Attacking the BC layers achieves equivalent effects as attacking the whole model but at a far smaller chance of being detected by state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses. This paper proposes a general in-situ approach that identifies and verifies BC layers from the perspective of attackers. Based on the identified BC layers, we carefully craft a new backdoor attack methodology that adaptively seeks a fundamental balance between attacking effects and stealthiness under various defense strategies. Extensive experiments show that our BC layer-aware backdoor attacks can successfully backdoor FL under seven SOTA defenses with only 10% malicious clients and outperform the latest backdoor attack methods.</description>

      <title>FuzzLLM: A Novel and Universal Fuzzing Framework for Proactively Discovering Jailbreak Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jailbreak vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), which exploit meticulously crafted prompts to elicit content that violates service guidelines, have captured the attention of research communities. While model owners can defend against individual jailbreak prompts through safety training strategies, this relatively passive approach struggles to handle the broader category of similar jailbreaks. To tackle this issue, we introduce FuzzLLM, an automated fuzzing framework designed to proactively test and discover jailbreak vulnerabilities in LLMs. We utilize templates to capture the structural integrity of a prompt and isolate key features of a jailbreak class as constraints. By integrating different base classes into powerful combo attacks and varying the elements of constraints and prohibited questions, FuzzLLM enables efficient testing with reduced manual effort. Extensive experiments demonstrate FuzzLLM's effectiveness and comprehensiveness in vulnerability discovery across various LLMs.</description>

      <title>Radio Frequency Fingerprinting via Deep Learning: Challenges and Opportunities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) techniques promise to authenticate wireless devices at the physical layer based on inherent hardware imperfections introduced during manufacturing. Such RF transmitter imperfections are reflected into over-the-air signals, allowing receivers to accurately identify the RF transmitting source. Recent advances in Machine Learning, particularly in Deep Learning (DL), have improved the ability of RFF systems to extract and learn complex features that make up the device-specific fingerprint. However, integrating DL techniques with RFF and operating the system in real-world scenarios presents numerous challenges, originating from the embedded systems and the DL research domains. This paper systematically identifies and analyzes the essential considerations and challenges encountered in the creation of DL-based RFF systems across their typical development life-cycle, which include (i) data collection and preprocessing, (ii) training, and finally, (iii) deployment. Our investigation provides a comprehensive overview of the current open problems that prevent real deployment of DL-based RFF systems while also discussing promising research opportunities to enhance the overall accuracy, robustness, and privacy of these systems.</description>

      <title>CiFlow: Dataflow Analysis and Optimization of Key Switching for Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Homomorphic encryption (HE) is a privacy-preserving computation technique that enables computation on encrypted data. Today, the potential of HE remains largely unrealized as it is impractically slow, preventing it from being used in real applications. A major computational bottleneck in HE is the key-switching operation, accounting for approximately 70% of the overall HE execution time and involving a large amount of data for inputs, intermediates, and keys. Prior research has focused on hardware accelerators to improve HE performance, typically featuring large on-chip SRAMs and high off-chip bandwidth to deal with large scale data. In this paper, we present a novel approach to improve key-switching performance by rigorously analyzing its dataflow. Our primary goal is to optimize data reuse with limited on-chip memory to minimize off-chip data movement. We introduce three distinct dataflows: Max-Parallel (MP), Digit-Centric (DC), and Output-Centric (OC), each with unique scheduling approaches for key-switching computations. Through our analysis, we show how our proposed Output-Centric technique can effectively reuse data by significantly lowering the intermediate key-switching working set and alleviating the need for massive off-chip bandwidth. We thoroughly evaluate the three dataflows using the RPU, a recently published vector processor tailored for ring processing algorithms, which includes HE. This evaluation considers sweeps of bandwidth and computational throughput, and whether keys are buffered on-chip or streamed. With OC, we demonstrate up to 4.16x speedup over the MP dataflow and show how OC can save 12.25x on-chip SRAM by streaming keys for minimal performance penalty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the development of deep learning, high-value and high-cost models have become valuable assets, and related intellectual property protection technologies have become a hot topic. However, existing model watermarking work in black-box scenarios mainly originates from training-based backdoor methods, which probably degrade primary task performance. To address this, we propose a branch backdoor-based model watermarking protocol to protect model intellectual property, where a construction based on a message authentication scheme is adopted as the branch indicator after a comparative analysis with secure cryptographic technologies primitives. We prove the lossless performance of the protocol by reduction. In addition, we analyze the potential threats to the protocol and provide a secure and feasible watermarking instance for language models.</description>

      <title>LLMs Cannot Reliably Identify and Reason About Security Vulnerabilities (Yet?): A Comprehensive Evaluation, Framework, and Benchmarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been suggested for use in automated vulnerability repair, but benchmarks showing they can consistently identify security-related bugs are lacking. We thus develop SecLLMHolmes, a fully automated evaluation framework that performs the most detailed investigation to date on whether LLMs can reliably identify and reason about security-related bugs. We construct a set of 228 code scenarios and analyze eight of the most capable LLMs across eight different investigative dimensions using our framework. Our evaluation shows LLMs provide non-deterministic responses, incorrect and unfaithful reasoning, and perform poorly in real-world scenarios. Most importantly, our findings reveal significant non-robustness in even the most advanced models like `PaLM2' and `GPT-4': by merely changing function or variable names, or by the addition of library functions in the source code, these models can yield incorrect answers in 26% and 17% of cases, respectively. These findings demonstrate that further LLM advances are needed before LLMs can be used as general purpose security assistants.</description>

      <title>Signing in Four Public Software Package Registries: Quantity, Quality, and Influencing Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many software applications incorporate open-source third-party packages distributed by public package registries. Guaranteeing authorship along this supply chain is a challenge. Package maintainers can guarantee package authorship through software signing. However, it is unclear how common this practice is, and whether the resulting signatures are created properly. Prior work has provided raw data on registry signing practices, but only measured single platforms, did not consider quality, did not consider time, and did not assess factors that may influence signing. We do not have up-to-date measurements of signing practices nor do we know the quality of existing signatures. Furthermore, we lack a comprehensive understanding of factors that influence signing adoption.
  This study addresses this gap. We provide measurements across three kinds of package registries: traditional software (Maven, PyPI), container images (DockerHub), and machine learning models (Hugging Face). For each registry, we describe the nature of the signed artifacts as well as the current quantity and quality of signatures. Then, we examine longitudinal trends in signing practices. Finally, we use a quasi-experiment to estimate the effect that various factors had on software signing practices. To summarize our findings: (1) mandating signature adoption improves the quantity of signatures; (2) providing dedicated tooling improves the quality of signing; (3) getting started is the hard part -- once a maintainer begins to sign, they tend to continue doing so; and (4) although many supply chain attacks are mitigable via signing, signing adoption is primarily affected by registry policy rather than by public knowledge of attacks, new engineering standards, etc. These findings highlight the importance of software package registry managers and signing infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Towards Eliminating Hard Label Constraints in Gradient Inversion Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gradient inversion attacks aim to reconstruct local training data from intermediate gradients exposed in the federated learning framework. Despite successful attacks, all previous methods, starting from reconstructing a single data point and then relaxing the single-image limit to batch level, are only tested under hard label constraints. Even for single-image reconstruction, we still lack an analysis-based algorithm to recover augmented soft labels. In this work, we change the focus from enlarging batchsize to investigating the hard label constraints, considering a more realistic circumstance where label smoothing and mixup techniques are used in the training process. In particular, we are the first to initiate a novel algorithm to simultaneously recover the ground-truth augmented label and the input feature of the last fully-connected layer from single-input gradients, and provide a necessary condition for any analytical-based label recovery methods. Extensive experiments testify to the label recovery accuracy, as well as the benefits to the following image reconstruction. We believe soft labels in classification tasks are worth further attention in gradient inversion attacks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data synthesis has been advocated as an important approach for utilizing data while protecting data privacy. A large number of tabular data synthesis algorithms (which we call synthesizers) have been proposed. Some synthesizers satisfy Differential Privacy, while others aim to provide privacy in a heuristic fashion. A comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of these synthesizers remains elusive due to drawbacks in evaluation metrics and missing head-to-head comparisons of newly developed synthesizers that take advantage of diffusion models and large language models with state-of-the-art marginal-based synthesizers.
  In this paper, we present a systematic evaluation framework for assessing tabular data synthesis algorithms. Specifically, we examine and critique existing evaluation metrics, and introduce a set of new metrics in terms of fidelity, privacy, and utility to address their limitations. Based on the proposed metrics, we also devise a unified objective for tuning, which can consistently improve the quality of synthetic data for all methods. We conducted extensive evaluations of 8 different types of synthesizers on 12 real-world datasets and identified some interesting findings, which offer new directions for privacy-preserving data synthesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the pivotal security threats for the embedded computing systems is malicious software a.k.a malware. With efficiency and efficacy, Machine Learning (ML) has been widely adopted for malware detection in recent times. Despite being efficient, the existing techniques require a tremendous number of benign and malware samples for training and modeling an efficient malware detector. Furthermore, such constraints limit the detection of emerging malware samples due to the lack of sufficient malware samples required for efficient training. To address such concerns, we introduce a code-aware data generation technique that generates multiple mutated samples of the limitedly seen malware by the devices. Loss minimization ensures that the generated samples closely mimic the limitedly seen malware and mitigate the impractical samples. Such developed malware is further incorporated into the training set to formulate the model that can efficiently detect the emerging malware despite having limited exposure. The experimental results demonstrates that the proposed technique achieves an accuracy of 90% in detecting limitedly seen malware, which is approximately 3x more than the accuracy attained by state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Traceable Functional Encryption for Inner Product</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Functional encryption introduces a new paradigm of public key encryption that decryption only reveals the function value of encrypted data. To curb key leakage issues and trace users in FE-IP, a new primitive called traceable functional encryption for inner product (TFE-IP) has been proposed. However, the privacy protection of user's identities has not been considered in the existing TFE-IP schemes. In order to balance privacy and accountability, we propose the concept of privacy-preserving traceable functional encryption for inner product (PPTFE-IP) and give a concrete construction. Our scheme provides the following features: (1) To prevent key sharing, a user's key is bound with both his/her identity and a vector; (2) The key generation center (KGC) and a user execute a two-party secure computing protocol to generate a key without the former knowing anything about the latter's identity; (3) Each user can verify the correctness of his/her key; (4) A user can calculate the inner product of the two vectors embedded in his/her key and in a ciphertext; (5) Only the tracer can trace the identity embedded in a key. The security of our scheme is formally reduced to well-known complexity assumptions, and the implementation is conducted to evaluate its efficiency. The novelty of our scheme is to protect users' privacy and provide traceability if required.</description>

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities (SVs) have become a common, serious, and crucial concern to safety-critical security systems. That leads to significant progress in the use of AI-based methods for software vulnerability detection (SVD). In practice, although AI-based methods have been achieving promising performances in SVD and other domain applications (e.g., computer vision), they are well-known to fail in detecting the ground-truth label of input data (referred to as out-of-distribution, OOD, data) lying far away from the training data distribution (i.e., in-distribution, ID). This drawback leads to serious issues where the models fail to indicate when they are likely mistaken. To address this problem, OOD detectors (i.e., determining whether an input is ID or OOD) have been applied before feeding the input data to the downstream AI-based modules. While OOD detection has been widely designed for computer vision and medical diagnosis applications, automated AI-based techniques for OOD source code data detection have not yet been well-studied and explored. To this end, in this paper, we propose an innovative deep learning-based approach addressing the OOD source code data identification problem. Our method is derived from an information-theoretic perspective with the use of innovative cluster-contrastive learning to effectively learn and leverage source code characteristics, enhancing data representation learning for solving the problem. The rigorous and comprehensive experiments on real-world source code datasets show the effectiveness and advancement of our approach compared to state-of-the-art baselines by a wide margin. In short, on average, our method achieves a significantly higher performance from around 15.27%, 7.39%, and 4.93% on the FPR, AUROC, and AUPR measures, respectively, in comparison with the baselines.</description>

      <title>Less is More: Understanding Word-level Textual Adversarial Attack via n-gram Frequency Descend</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02568</link>

Abstract: Word-level textual adversarial attacks have demonstrated notable efficacy in misleading Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. Despite their success, the underlying reasons for their effectiveness and the fundamental characteristics of adversarial examples (AEs) remain obscure. This work aims to interpret word-level attacks by examining their $n$-gram frequency patterns. Our comprehensive experiments reveal that in approximately 90\% of cases, word-level attacks lead to the generation of examples where the frequency of $n$-grams decreases, a tendency we term as the $n$-gram Frequency Descend ($n$-FD). This finding suggests a straightforward strategy to enhance model robustness: training models using examples with $n$-FD. To examine the feasibility of this strategy, we employed the $n$-gram frequency information, as an alternative to conventional loss gradients, to generate perturbed examples in adversarial training. The experiment results indicate that the frequency-based approach performs comparably with the gradient-based approach in improving model robustness. Our research offers a novel and more intuitive perspective for understanding word-level textual adversarial attacks and proposes a new direction to improve model robustness.</description>

      <title>The Curse of Recursion: Training on Generated Data Makes Models Forget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17493v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stable Diffusion revolutionised image creation from descriptive text. GPT-2, GPT-3(.5) and GPT-4 demonstrated astonishing performance across a variety of language tasks. ChatGPT introduced such language models to the general public. It is now clear that large language models (LLMs) are here to stay, and will bring about drastic change in the whole ecosystem of online text and images. In this paper we consider what the future might hold. What will happen to GPT-{n} once LLMs contribute much of the language found online? We find that use of model-generated content in training causes irreversible defects in the resulting models, where tails of the original content distribution disappear. We refer to this effect as Model Collapse and show that it can occur in Variational Autoencoders, Gaussian Mixture Models and LLMs. We build theoretical intuition behind the phenomenon and portray its ubiquity amongst all learned generative models. We demonstrate that it has to be taken seriously if we are to sustain the benefits of training from large-scale data scraped from the web. Indeed, the value of data collected about genuine human interactions with systems will be increasingly valuable in the presence of content generated by LLMs in data crawled from the Internet.</description>

      <title>A Graph Transformer-Driven Approach for Network Robustness Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning and analysis of network robustness, including controllability robustness and connectivity robustness, is critical for various networked systems against attacks. Traditionally, network robustness is determined by attack simulations, which is very time-consuming and even incapable for large-scale networks. Network Robustness Learning, which is dedicated to learning network robustness with high precision and high speed, provides a powerful tool to analyze network robustness by replacing simulations. In this paper, a novel versatile and unified robustness learning approach via graph transformer (NRL-GT) is proposed, which accomplishes the task of controllability robustness learning and connectivity robustness learning from multiple aspects including robustness curve learning, overall robustness learning, and synthetic network classification. Numerous experiments show that: 1) NRL-GT is a unified learning framework for controllability robustness and connectivity robustness, demonstrating a strong generalization ability to ensure high precision when training and test sets are distributed differently; 2) Compared to the cutting-edge methods, NRL-GT can simultaneously perform network robustness learning from multiple aspects and obtains superior results in less time. NRL-GT is also able to deal with complex networks of different size with low learning error and high efficiency; 3) It is worth mentioning that the backbone of NRL-GT can serve as a transferable feature learning module for complex networks of different size and different downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Concentrated Differential Privacy for Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bandits serve as the theoretical foundation of sequential learning and an algorithmic foundation of modern recommender systems. However, recommender systems often rely on user-sensitive data, making privacy a critical concern. This paper contributes to the understanding of Differential Privacy (DP) in bandits with a trusted centralised decision-maker, and especially the implications of ensuring zero Concentrated Differential Privacy (zCDP). First, we formalise and compare different adaptations of DP to bandits, depending on the considered input and the interaction protocol. Then, we propose three private algorithms, namely AdaC-UCB, AdaC-GOPE and AdaC-OFUL, for three bandit settings, namely finite-armed bandits, linear bandits, and linear contextual bandits. The three algorithms share a generic algorithmic blueprint, i.e. the Gaussian mechanism and adaptive episodes, to ensure a good privacy-utility trade-off. We analyse and upper bound the regret of these three algorithms. Our analysis shows that in all of these settings, the prices of imposing zCDP are (asymptotically) negligible in comparison with the regrets incurred oblivious to privacy. Next, we complement our regret upper bounds with the first minimax lower bounds on the regret of bandits with zCDP. To prove the lower bounds, we elaborate a new proof technique based on couplings and optimal transport. We conclude by experimentally validating our theoretical results for the three different settings of bandits.</description>

      <title>Can LLM-Generated Misinformation Be Detected?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13788v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has made a transformative impact. However, the potential that LLMs such as ChatGPT can be exploited to generate misinformation has posed a serious concern to online safety and public trust. A fundamental research question is: will LLM-generated misinformation cause more harm than human-written misinformation? We propose to tackle this question from the perspective of detection difficulty. We first build a taxonomy of LLM-generated misinformation. Then we categorize and validate the potential real-world methods for generating misinformation with LLMs. Then, through extensive empirical investigation, we discover that LLM-generated misinformation can be harder to detect for humans and detectors compared to human-written misinformation with the same semantics, which suggests it can have more deceptive styles and potentially cause more harm. We also discuss the implications of our discovery on combating misinformation in the age of LLMs and the countermeasures.</description>

      <title>PrivImage: Differentially Private Synthetic Image Generation using Diffusion Models with Semantic-Aware Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12850v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) image data synthesis, which leverages the DP technique to generate synthetic data to replace the sensitive data, allowing organizations to share and utilize synthetic images without privacy concerns. Previous methods incorporate the advanced techniques of generative models and pre-training on a public dataset to produce exceptional DP image data, but suffer from problems of unstable training and massive computational resource demands. This paper proposes a novel DP image synthesis method, termed PRIVIMAGE, which meticulously selects pre-training data, promoting the efficient creation of DP datasets with high fidelity and utility. PRIVIMAGE first establishes a semantic query function using a public dataset. Then, this function assists in querying the semantic distribution of the sensitive dataset, facilitating the selection of data from the public dataset with analogous semantics for pre-training. Finally, we pre-train an image generative model using the selected data and then fine-tune this model on the sensitive dataset using Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD). PRIVIMAGE allows us to train a lightly parameterized generative model, reducing the noise in the gradient during DP-SGD training and enhancing training stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRIVIMAGE uses only 1% of the public dataset for pre-training and 7.6% of the parameters in the generative model compared to the state-of-the-art method, whereas achieves superior synthetic performance and conserves more computational resources. On average, PRIVIMAGE achieves 30.1% lower FID and 12.6% higher Classification Accuracy than the state-of-the-art method. The replication package and datasets can be accessed online.</description>

      <title>The last Dance : Robust backdoor attack via diffusion models and bayesian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05967v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are state-of-the-art deep learning generative models that are trained on the principle of learning forward and backward diffusion processes via the progressive addition of noise and denoising. In this paper, we aim to fool audio-based DNN models, such as those from the Hugging Face framework, primarily those that focus on audio, in particular transformer-based artificial intelligence models, which are powerful machine learning models that save time and achieve results faster and more efficiently. We demonstrate the feasibility of backdoor attacks (called `BacKBayDiffMod`) on audio transformers derived from Hugging Face, a popular framework in the world of artificial intelligence research. The backdoor attack developed in this paper is based on poisoning model training data uniquely by incorporating backdoor diffusion sampling and a Bayesian approach to the distribution of poisoned data.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Nibbler: An Open Red-Teaming Method for Identifying Diverse Harms in Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rise of text-to-image (T2I) generative AI models reaching wide audiences, it is critical to evaluate model robustness against non-obvious attacks to mitigate the generation of offensive images. By focusing on ``implicitly adversarial'' prompts (those that trigger T2I models to generate unsafe images for non-obvious reasons), we isolate a set of difficult safety issues that human creativity is well-suited to uncover. To this end, we built the Adversarial Nibbler Challenge, a red-teaming methodology for crowdsourcing a diverse set of implicitly adversarial prompts. We have assembled a suite of state-of-the-art T2I models, employed a simple user interface to identify and annotate harms, and engaged diverse populations to capture long-tail safety issues that may be overlooked in standard testing. The challenge is run in consecutive rounds to enable a sustained discovery and analysis of safety pitfalls in T2I models.
  In this paper, we present an in-depth account of our methodology, a systematic study of novel attack strategies and discussion of safety failures revealed by challenge participants. We also release a companion visualization tool for easy exploration and derivation of insights from the dataset. The first challenge round resulted in over 10k prompt-image pairs with machine annotations for safety. A subset of 1.5k samples contains rich human annotations of harm types and attack styles. We find that 14% of images that humans consider harmful are mislabeled as ``safe'' by machines. We have identified new attack strategies that highlight the complexity of ensuring T2I model robustness. Our findings emphasize the necessity of continual auditing and adaptation as new vulnerabilities emerge. We are confident that this work will enable proactive, iterative safety assessments and promote responsible development of T2I models.</description>
