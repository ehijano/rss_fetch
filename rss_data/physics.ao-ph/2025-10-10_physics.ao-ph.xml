      <title>Beyond the Training Data: Confidence-Guided Mixing of Parameterizations in a Hybrid AI-Climate Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent systematic errors in Earth system models (ESMs) arise from difficulties in representing the full diversity of subgrid, multiscale atmospheric convection and turbulence. Machine learning (ML) parameterizations trained on short high-resolution simulations show strong potential to reduce these errors. However, stable long-term atmospheric simulations with hybrid (physics + ML) ESMs remain difficult, as neural networks (NNs) trained offline often destabilize online runs. Training convection parameterizations directly on coarse-grained data is challenging, notably because scales cannot be cleanly separated. This issue is mitigated using data from superparameterized simulations, which provide clearer scale separation. Yet, transferring a parameterization from one ESM to another remains difficult due to distribution shifts that induce large inference errors. Here, we present a proof-of-concept where a ClimSim-trained, physics-informed NN convection parameterization is successfully transferred to ICON-A. The scheme is (a) trained on adjusted ClimSim data with subtracted radiative tendencies, and (b) integrated into ICON-A. The NN parameterization predicts its own error, enabling mixing with a conventional convection scheme when confidence is low, thus making the hybrid AI-physics model tunable with respect to observations and reanalysis through mixing parameters. This improves process understanding by constraining convective tendencies across column water vapor, lower-tropospheric stability, and geographical conditions, yielding interpretable regime behavior. In AMIP-style setups, several hybrid configurations outperform the default convection scheme (e.g., improved precipitation statistics). With additive input noise during training, both hybrid and pure-ML schemes lead to stable simulations and remain physically consistent for at least 20 years.</description>

      <title>Climate Knowledge in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for climate-related applications, where understanding internal climatological knowledge is crucial for reliability and misinformation risk assessment. Despite growing adoption, the capacity of LLMs to recall climate normals from parametric knowledge remains largely uncharacterized. We investigate the capacity of contemporary LLMs to recall climate normals without external retrieval, focusing on a prototypical query: mean July 2-m air temperature 1991-2020 at specified locations. We construct a global grid of queries at 1{\deg} resolution land points, providing coordinates and location descriptors, and validate responses against ERA5 reanalysis. Results show that LLMs encode non-trivial climate structure, capturing latitudinal and topographic patterns, with root-mean-square errors of 3-6 {\deg}C and biases of $\pm$1 {\deg}C. However, spatially coherent errors remain, particularly in mountains and high latitudes. Performance degrades sharply above 1500 m, where RMSE reaches 5-13 {\deg}C compared to 2-4 {\deg}C at lower elevations. We find that including geographic context (country, city, region) reduces errors by 27% on average, with larger models being most sensitive to location descriptors. While models capture the global mean magnitude of observed warming between 1950-1974 and 2000-2024, they fail to reproduce spatial patterns of temperature change, which directly relate to assessing climate change. This limitation highlights that while LLMs may capture present-day climate distributions, they struggle to represent the regional and local expression of long-term shifts in temperature essential for understanding climate dynamics. Our evaluation framework provides a reproducible benchmark for quantifying parametric climate knowledge in LLMs and complements existing climate communication assessments.</description>

      <title>Skill of Long-Range Forecasts of Ocean Wave Spectra from the Navy ESPC Version 2 System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the outcome of evaluations of the skill of long-range forecasts from the ocean wave model component of the Navy's global coupled modeling system. Specifically, the model output is taken from a single member of the ensemble system, and we evaluate the skill of predicting seven model "wave height" parameters, computed from: energy in four frequency bands, energy in all bands combined, swell energy, and wind sea energy. The model is evaluated using two methods of "ground truth". The first is a new instrument for measuring wave spectra from space, Surface Waves Investigation and Monitoring (SWIM). The second is analyses from the same model. We propose a new method of band-wise bias correction of the observational dataset, using in situ wave observations, with the numerical wave model used as an intermediary.</description>

      <title>OneForecast: A Universal Framework for Global and Regional Weather Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00338v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate weather forecasts are important for disaster prevention, agricultural planning, etc. Traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods offer physically interpretable high-accuracy predictions but are computationally expensive and fail to fully leverage rapidly growing historical data. In recent years, deep learning models have made significant progress in weather forecasting, but challenges remain, such as balancing global and regional high-resolution forecasts, excessive smoothing in extreme event predictions, and insufficient dynamic system modeling. To address these issues, this paper proposes a global-regional nested weather forecasting framework (OneForecast) based on graph neural networks. By combining a dynamic system perspective with multi-grid theory, we construct a multi-scale graph structure and densify the target region to capture local high-frequency features. We introduce an adaptive messaging mechanism, using dynamic gating units to deeply integrate node and edge features for more accurate extreme event forecasting. For high-resolution regional forecasts, we propose a neural nested grid method to mitigate boundary information loss. Experimental results show that OneForecast performs excellently across global to regional scales and short-term to long-term forecasts, especially in extreme event predictions.

      <title>Resolvent model-based analyses of coherent structures in Langmuir turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the coherent structures in Langmuir turbulence, a state of the ocean surface boundary layer driven by the interactions between water waves and wind-induced shear, via a resolvent framework. Langmuir turbulence is characterised by multiscale vortical structures, notably counter-rotating roll pairs known as Langmuir circulations. While classic linear stability analyses of the Craik-Leibovich equations have revealed key instability mechanisms underlying Langmuir circulations, the vortical rolls characteristic of Langmuir turbulence, the present work incorporates the turbulent mean state and varying eddy viscosity using data from large-eddy simulation (LES) to investigate the turbulence dynamics of fully developed Langmuir turbulence. Scale-dependent resolvent analyses reveal a new formation mechanism of two-dimensional circulating rolls and three-dimensional turbulent coherent vortices through linear amplification of sustained harmonic forcing. Moreover, the integrated energy spectra predicted by the principal resolvent modes in response to broadband harmonic forcing capture the dominant spanwise length scales that are consistent with the LES data. These results demonstrate the feasibility of resolvent analyses in capturing key features of multiscale turbulence-wave interactions in the statistical stationary state of Langmuir turbulence.</description>
