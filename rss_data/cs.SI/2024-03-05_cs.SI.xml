      <title>GIN-SD: Source Detection in Graphs with Incomplete Nodes via Positional Encoding and Attentive Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source detection in graphs has demonstrated robust efficacy in the domain of rumor source identification. Although recent solutions have enhanced performance by leveraging deep neural networks, they often require complete user data. In this paper, we address a more challenging task, rumor source detection with incomplete user data, and propose a novel framework, i.e., Source Detection in Graphs with Incomplete Nodes via Positional Encoding and Attentive Fusion (GIN-SD), to tackle this challenge. Specifically, our approach utilizes a positional embedding module to distinguish nodes that are incomplete and employs a self-attention mechanism to focus on nodes with greater information transmission capacity. To mitigate the prediction bias caused by the significant disparity between the numbers of source and non-source nodes, we also introduce a class-balancing mechanism. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of GIN-SD and its superiority to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>A Quick Framework for Evaluating Worst Robustness of Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robustness is pivotal for comprehending, designing, optimizing, and rehabilitating networks, with simulation attacks being the prevailing evaluation method. Simulation attacks are often time-consuming or even impractical, however, a more crucial yet persistently overlooked drawback is that any attack strategy merely provides a potential paradigm of disintegration. The key concern is: in the worst-case scenario or facing the most severe attacks, what is the limit of robustness, referred to as ``Worst Robustness'', for a given system? Understanding a system's worst robustness is imperative for grasping its reliability limits, accurately evaluating protective capabilities, and determining associated design and security maintenance costs. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of Most Destruction Attack (MDA) based on the idea of knowledge stacking. MDA is employed to assess the worst robustness of networks, followed by the application of an adapted CNN algorithm for rapid worst robustness prediction. We establish the logical validity of MDA and highlight the exceptional performance of the adapted CNN algorithm in predicting the worst robustness across diverse network topologies, encompassing both model and empirical networks.</description>

      <title>GraphPub: Generation of Differential Privacy Graph with High Availability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of graph neural networks (GNN), more and more graph datasets have been published for GNN tasks. However, when an upstream data owner publishes graph data, there are often many privacy concerns, because many real-world graph data contain sensitive information like person's friend list. Differential privacy (DP) is a common method to protect privacy, but due to the complex topological structure of graph data, applying DP on graphs often affects the message passing and aggregation of GNN models, leading to a decrease in model accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel graph edge protection framework, graph publisher (GraphPub), which can protect graph topology while ensuring that the availability of data is basically unchanged. Through reverse learning and the encoder-decoder mechanism, we search for some false edges that do not have a large negative impact on the aggregation of node features, and use them to replace some real edges. The modified graph will be published, which is difficult to distinguish between real and false data. Sufficient experiments prove that our framework achieves model accuracy close to the original graph with an extremely low privacy budget.</description>

      <title>Time to Cite: Modeling Citation Networks using the Dynamic Impact Single-Event Embedding Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the structure and dynamics of scientific research, i.e., the science of science (SciSci), has become an important area of research in order to address imminent questions including how scholars interact to advance science, how disciplines are related and evolve, and how research impact can be quantified and predicted. Central to the study of SciSci has been the analysis of citation networks. Here, two prominent modeling methodologies have been employed: one is to assess the citation impact dynamics of papers using parametric distributions, and the other is to embed the citation networks in a latent space optimal for characterizing the static relations between papers in terms of their citations. Interestingly, citation networks are a prominent example of single-event dynamic networks, i.e., networks for which each dyad only has a single event (i.e., the point in time of citation). We presently propose a novel likelihood function for the characterization of such single-event networks. Using this likelihood, we propose the Dynamic Impact Single-Event Embedding model (DISEE). The \textsc{\modelabbrev} model characterizes the scientific interactions in terms of a latent distance model in which random effects account for citation heterogeneity while the time-varying impact is characterized using existing parametric representations for assessment of dynamic impact. We highlight the proposed approach on several real citation networks finding that the DISEE well reconciles static latent distance network embedding approaches with classical dynamic impact assessments.</description>

      <title>Evolving to the Future: Unseen Event Adaptive Fake News Detection on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of social media, the wide dissemination of fake news on social media is increasingly threatening both individuals and society. In the dynamic landscape of social media, fake news detection aims to develop a model trained on news reporting past events. The objective is to predict and identify fake news about future events, which often relate to subjects entirely different from those in the past. However, existing fake detection methods exhibit a lack of robustness and cannot generalize to unseen events. To address this, we introduce Future ADaptive Event-based Fake news Detection (FADE) framework. Specifically, we train a target predictor through an adaptive augmentation strategy and graph contrastive learning to make more robust overall predictions. Simultaneously, we independently train an event-only predictor to obtain biased predictions. Then we further mitigate event bias by obtaining the final prediction by subtracting the output of the event-only predictor from the output of the target predictor. Encouraging results from experiments designed to emulate real-world social media conditions validate the effectiveness of our method in comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Scaling up Dynamic Edge Partition Models via Stochastic Gradient MCMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The edge partition model (EPM) is a generative model for extracting an overlapping community structure from static graph-structured data. In the EPM, the gamma process (GaP) prior is adopted to infer the appropriate number of latent communities, and each vertex is endowed with a gamma distributed positive memberships vector. Despite having many attractive properties, inference in the EPM is typically performed using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods that prevent it from being applied to massive network data. In this paper, we generalize the EPM to account for dynamic enviroment by representing each vertex with a positive memberships vector constructed using Dirichlet prior specification, and capturing the time-evolving behaviour of vertices via a Dirichlet Markov chain construction. A simple-to-implement Gibbs sampler is proposed to perform posterior computation using Negative- Binomial augmentation technique. For large network data, we propose a stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) algorithm for scalable inference in the proposed model. The experimental results show that the novel methods achieve competitive performance in terms of link prediction, while being much faster.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an integrated approach for identifying key nodes in information propagation networks using advanced artificial intelligence methods. We introduce a novel technique that combines the Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method with the Global Structure Model (GSM), creating a synergistic model that effectively captures both local and global influences within a network. This method is applied across various complex networks, such as social, transportation, and communication systems, utilizing the Global Network Influence Dataset (GNID). Our analysis highlights the structural dynamics and resilience of these networks, revealing insights into node connectivity and community formation. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our AI-based approach in offering a comprehensive understanding of network behavior, contributing significantly to strategic network analysis and optimization.</description>

      <title>Shorts vs. Regular Videos on YouTube: A Comparative Analysis of User Engagement and Content Creation Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: YouTube introduced the Shorts video format in 2021, allowing users to upload short videos that are prominently displayed on its website and app. Despite having such a large visual footprint, there are no studies to date that have looked at the impact Shorts introduction had on the production and consumption of content on YouTube. This paper presents the first comparative analysis of YouTube Shorts versus regular videos with respect to user engagement (i.e., views, likes, and comments), content creation frequency and video categories. We collected a dataset containing information about 70k channels that posted at least one Short, and we analyzed the metadata of all the videos (9.9M Shorts and 6.9M regular videos) they uploaded between January 2021 and December 2022, spanning a two-year period including the introduction of Shorts. Our longitudinal analysis shows that content creators consistently increased the frequency of Shorts production over this period, especially for newly-created channels, which surpassed that of regular videos. We also observe that Shorts target mostly entertainment categories, while regular videos cover a wide variety of categories. In general, Shorts attract more views and likes per view than regular videos, but attract less comments per view. However, Shorts do not outperform regular videos in the education and political categories as much as they do in other categories. Our study contributes to understanding social media dynamics, to quantifying the spread of short-form content, and to motivating future research on its impact on society.</description>

      <title>Cost-Effective Activity Control of Asymptomatic Carriers in Layered Temporal Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The robustness of human social networks against epidemic propagation relies on the propensity for physical contact adaptation. During the early phase of infection, asymptomatic carriers exhibit the same activity level as susceptible individuals, which presents challenges for incorporating control measures in epidemic projection models. This paper focuses on modeling and cost-efficient activity control of susceptible and carrier individuals in the context of the susceptible-carrier-infected-removed (SCIR) epidemic model over a two-layer contact network. In this model, individuals switch from a static contact layer to create new links in a temporal layer based on state-dependent activation rates. We derive conditions for the infection to die out or persist in a homogeneous network. Considering the significant costs associated with reducing the activity of susceptible and carrier individuals, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the disease decay rate while constrained by a limited budget. We propose the use of successive geometric programming (SGP) approximation for this optimization task. Through simulation experiments on Poisson random graphs, we assess the impact of different parameters on disease prevalence. The results demonstrate that our SGP framework achieves a cost reduction of nearly 33% compared to conventional methods based on degree and closeness centrality.</description>

      <title>Polyamorous Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding schedules for pairwise meetings between the members of a complex social group without creating interpersonal conflict is challenging, especially when different relationships have different needs. We formally define and study the underlying optimisation problem: Polyamorous Scheduling.
  In Polyamorous Scheduling, we are given an edge-weighted graph and try to find a periodic schedule of matchings in this graph such that the maximal weighted waiting time between consecutive occurrences of the same edge is minimised. We show that the problem is NP-hard and that there is no efficient approximation algorithm with a better ratio than 13/12 unless P = NP. On the positive side, we obtain an $O(\log n)$-approximation algorithm. We also define a generalisation of density from the Pinwheel Scheduling Problem, "poly density", and ask whether there exists a poly density threshold similar to the 5/6-density threshold for Pinwheel Scheduling [Kawamura, STOC 2024]. Polyamorous Scheduling is a natural generalisation of Pinwheel Scheduling with respect to its optimisation variant, Bamboo Garden Trimming.
  Our work contributes the first nontrivial hardness-of-approximation reduction for any periodic scheduling problem, and opens up numerous avenues for further study of Polyamorous Scheduling.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Efficacy of Heuristic-Based Address Clustering for Bitcoin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring transactions within the Bitcoin blockchain entails examining the transfer of bitcoins among several hundred million entities. However, it is often impractical and resource-consuming to study such a vast number of entities. Consequently, entity clustering serves as an initial step in most analytical studies. This process often employs heuristics grounded in the practices and behaviors of these entities. In this research, we delve into the examination of two widely used heuristics, alongside the introduction of four novel ones. Our contribution includes the introduction of the \textit{clustering ratio}, a metric designed to quantify the reduction in the number of entities achieved by a given heuristic. The assessment of this reduction ratio plays an important role in justifying the selection of a specific heuristic for analytical purposes. Given the dynamic nature of the Bitcoin system, characterized by a continuous increase in the number of entities on the blockchain, and the evolving behaviors of these entities, we extend our study to explore the temporal evolution of the clustering ratio for each heuristic. This temporal analysis enhances our understanding of the effectiveness of these heuristics over time.</description>

      <title>"There is a Job Prepared for Me Here": Understanding How Short Video and Live-streaming Platforms Empower Ageing Job Seekers in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the global unemployment rate has remained persistently high. Compounding this issue, the ageing population in China often encounters additional challenges in finding employment due to prevalent age discrimination in daily life. However, with the advent of social media, there has been a rise in the popularity of short videos and live-streams for recruiting ageing workers. To better understand the motivations of ageing job seekers to engage with these video-based recruitment methods and to explore the extent to which such platforms can empower them, we conducted an interview-based study with ageing job seekers who have had exposure to these short recruitment videos and live-streaming channels. Our findings reveal that these platforms can provide a job-seeking choice that is particularly friendly to ageing job seekers, effectively improving their disadvantaged situation.</description>

      <title>Top-L Most Influential Community Detection Over Social Networks (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13162v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many real-world applications such as social network analysis and online marketing/advertising, the community detection is a fundamental task to identify communities (subgraphs) in social networks with high structural cohesiveness. While previous works focus on detecting communities alone, they do not consider the collective influences of users in these communities on other user nodes in social networks. Inspired by this, in this paper, we investigate the influence propagation from some seed communities and their influential effects that result in the influenced communities. We propose a novel problem, named Top-L most Influential Community DEtection (TopL-ICDE) over social networks, which aims to retrieve top-L seed communities with the highest influences, having high structural cohesiveness, and containing user-specified query keywords. In order to efficiently tackle the TopL-ICDE problem, we design effective pruning strategies to filter out false alarms of seed communities and propose an effective index mechanism to facilitate efficient Top-L community retrieval. We develop an efficient TopL-ICDE answering algorithm by traversing the index and applying our proposed pruning strategies. We also formulate and tackle a variant of TopL-ICDE, named diversified top-L most influential community detection (DTopL-ICDE), which returns a set of L diversified communities with the highest diversity score (i.e., collaborative influences by L communities). We prove that DTopL-ICDE is NP-hard, and propose an efficient greedy algorithm with our designed diversity score pruning. Through extensive experiments, we verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed TopL-ICDE and DTopL-ICDE approaches over real/synthetic social networks under various parameter settings.</description>

      <title>The Face of Populism: Examining Differences in Facial Emotional Expressions of Political Leaders Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online media has revolutionized the way political information is disseminated and consumed on a global scale, and this shift has compelled political figures to adopt new strategies of capturing and retaining voter attention. These strategies often rely on emotional persuasion and appeal, and as visual content becomes increasingly prevalent in virtual space, much of political communication too has come to be marked by evocative video content and imagery. The present paper offers a novel approach to analyzing material of this kind. We apply a deep-learning-based computer-vision algorithm to a sample of 220 YouTube videos depicting political leaders from 15 different countries, which is based on an existing trained convolutional neural network architecture provided by the Python library fer. The algorithm returns emotion scores representing the relative presence of 6 emotional states (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise) and a neutral expression for each frame of the processed YouTube video. We observe statistically significant differences in the average score of expressed negative emotions between groups of leaders with varying degrees of populist rhetoric as defined by the Global Party Survey (GPS), indicating that populist leaders tend to express negative emotions to a greater extent during their public performance than their non-populist counterparts. Overall, our contribution provides insight into the characteristics of visual self-representation among political leaders, as well as an open-source workflow for further computational studies of their non-verbal communication.</description>

      <title>Bures-Wasserstein Means of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding the mean of sampled data is a fundamental task in machine learning and statistics. However, in cases where the data samples are graph objects, defining a mean is an inherently difficult task. We propose a novel framework for defining a graph mean via embeddings in the space of smooth graph signal distributions, where graph similarity can be measured using the Wasserstein metric. By finding a mean in this embedding space, we can recover a mean graph that preserves structural information. We establish the existence and uniqueness of the novel graph mean, and provide an iterative algorithm for computing it. To highlight the potential of our framework as a valuable tool for practical applications in machine learning, it is evaluated on various tasks, including k-means clustering of structured aligned graphs, classification of functional brain networks, and semi-supervised node classification in multi-layer graphs.
