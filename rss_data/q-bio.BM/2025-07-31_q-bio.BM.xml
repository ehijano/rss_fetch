      <title>Factors controlling protein evolvability, at the molecular scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This piece serves two purposes. Firstly, it aims at elucidating the role of epistasis in shaping, at a molecular level, the evolutionary paths of proteins, as well as the extent to which these epistatic effects are the outcome of an as-yet-unidentified epistatic force. Second, it seeks to ascertain the extent to which the principle of least action will enable us to identify which of all potential trajectories has the highest evolutionary efficiency, as well as how variations in factors such as protein robustness and folding rates, resulting from the unavoidability of destabilizing mutations, might influence this critical evolutionary process. The initial findings suggest that protein evolution, at a molecular level, may be more predictable than previously thought, as epistasis and the principle of least action collectively impose constraints on evolutionary paths and trajectories, and consequently, on protein evolvability. Thus, this work should advance our understanding of the main molecular mechanisms that underlie the evolution of mutation-driven proteins and also provide grounds to answer a fundamental evolutionary question: how does Darwinian selection regard all potential trajectories available?</description>

      <title>Lattice Protein Folding with Variational Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the principles of protein folding is a cornerstone of computational biology, with implications for drug design, bioengineering, and the understanding of fundamental biological processes. Lattice protein folding models offer a simplified yet powerful framework for studying the complexities of protein folding, enabling the exploration of energetically optimal folds under constrained conditions. However, finding these optimal folds is a computationally challenging combinatorial optimization problem. In this work, we introduce a novel upper-bound training scheme that employs masking to identify the lowest-energy folds in two-dimensional Hydrophobic-Polar (HP) lattice protein folding. By leveraging Dilated Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) integrated with an annealing process driven by temperature-like fluctuations, our method accurately predicts optimal folds for benchmark systems of up to 60 beads. Our approach also effectively masks invalid folds from being sampled without compromising the autoregressive sampling properties of RNNs. This scheme is generalizable to three spatial dimensions and can be extended to lattice protein models with larger alphabets. Our findings emphasize the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in tackling complex protein folding problems and a broader class of constrained combinatorial optimization challenges.</description>

      <title>MolPIF: A Parameter Interpolation Flow Model for Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in deep learning for molecular generation show promise in accelerating drug discovery. Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) have recently shown impressive performance across diverse chemical tasks, with their success often ascribed to the paradigm of modeling in a low-variance parameter space. However, the Bayesian inference-based strategy imposes limitations on designing more flexible distribution transformation pathways, making it challenging to adapt to diverse data distributions and varied task requirements. Furthermore, the potential for simpler, more efficient parameter-space-based models is unexplored. To address this, we propose a novel Parameter Interpolation Flow model (named PIF) with detailed theoretical foundation, training, and inference procedures. We then develop MolPIF for structure-based drug design, demonstrating its superior performance across diverse metrics compared to baselines. This work validates the effectiveness of parameter-space-based generative modeling paradigm for molecules and offers new perspectives for model design.</description>
