      <title>Measurement of electromagnetic radiation force using a capacitance-bridge interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a mechanical cantilever-based tabletop interferometer to measure the radiation force exerted by light. Using a high-power (~ 1W) pulsed laser beam, we excite mechanical oscillations of a thin metallic cantilever. The cantilever forms a parallel plate capacitor with a printed circuit board trace. Using a capacitance-bridge geometry, we measure small capacitance changes of the order of femto-Farads, induced by the radiation forces of a few nano-Newtons. This experiment uses equipment commonly found in an undergraduate teaching laboratory for physics and electronics while providing insight into electromagnetic wave theory, circuit design for low-noise measurements, and Fourier analysis.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Correctly Interpret Equations with Errors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10966v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models to accurately extract and translate equations from typed student responses into a standard format. This is a useful task as standardized equations can be graded reliably using a Computer Algebra System or a Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver. Therefore physics instructors interested in automated grading would not need to rely on the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Language Models.
  We used two novel frameworks to improve the translations. The first is consensus where a pair of models verify the correctness of the translations. The second is a neuro-symbolic LLM-modulo approach were models receive feedback from an automated reasoning tool. We performed experiments using responses to the Australian Physics Olympaid exam. We report on results, finding that no open-source model was able to translate the student responses at the desired level of accuracy. Future work could involve breaking the task into smaller components before parsing to improve performance, or generalizing the experiments to translate hand-written responses.</description>

      <title>Which Rope Breaks? A Study of Tension Distribution in Multi-Rope Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the tension distribution in systems of mass-less ropes under different loading conditions. For a two-rope system, we demonstrate how the breaking scenario depends on the applied force dynamics: rapid pulling causes the lower rope to break, while gradual pulling leads to upper rope failure. Extending to a three-rope Y-shaped configuration, we identify a critical angle $\theta_{C}=60^{\circ}$ that determines which rope breaks first. When the angle between the upper ropes exceeds this critical value, the upper ropes fail before the lower one. We further analyze how an attached mass at the junction point modifies this critical angle and establish maximum mass limits for valid solutions. Our results provide practical insights for introductory physics students understanding static forces and system stabilities.</description>

      <title>"Ni\~nas At\'omicas" (Atomic Girls): An initiative that generates opportunities for young girls in STEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on an initiative that seeks to encourage high school girls to develop critical thinking and transferable skills widely used in scientific work, as well as to generate a concrete space of opportunities for girls to experience how real science is done. Our "Ni\~nas At\'omicas" workshop combines the teaching of particle physics, electronics, programming and scientific methodology through building and operating a dedicated experiment: a muon counter. Girls from all over Chile can apply to this workshop, where every year they are guided by female scientists for two weeks. We report on the contents and methodology of our workshop and provide details on how to build the muon detector. We report results on muon flux and proper lifetime, two muon properties which can be extracted from the data collected by the girls with the muon detectors they built themselves. Insights into the girl's experiences during the 2024 and 2025 editions of the workshop are also detailed, with the aim to contribute to the wider physics education research and outreach communities.</description>
