      <title>First-principles determination of refractory binary alloy mechanical properties for the microscopic design of complex structural materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elastic tensor provides valuable insight into the mechanical behavior of a material with lattice strain, such as disordered binary alloys. Density functional theory (DFT)-based methods provide a powerful mechanism for computing and probing the microscopic features of elastic tensor-related properties. Here we present results for the rigid-ion and relaxed-ion elastic tensors computed using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), for a comprehensive set of structural refractory body-centered cubic (BCC) binary alloys of molybdenum (Mo), niobium (Nb), tantalum (Ta), and tungsten (W). Intermediate quantities (force-response internal-strain tensor, $\Lambda$, and displacement-response internal-strain tensor, $\Gamma$) needed to compute the relaxed-ion elastic tensor are used here to map heterogeneity in elastic constants at each lattice site in a given alloy and associated relaxation fields. Derived polycrystalline aggregate properties -- the bulk modulus ($B$), shear modulus ($G$), Young's modulus ($E$), and Poisson's ratio ($\nu$) and elastic anisotropy -- are reported as a function of composition for all binaries. Pugh's ratio ($B/G$) and the Cauchy pressure ($C'$) derived from computed elastic moduli are analyzed in order to evaluate the effect of alloying on the mechanical properties of the refractory BCC binary alloys. The computed mechanical properties data for the parent unary materials and binary alloys at systematically-varied Mo, Nb, Ta, and W compositions are in excellent agreement with available experimental data. These results, together with computed microscopic field data, establish a foundation for the principled design of compositionally-complex, high-temperature-structural refractory alloys with desired elastic properties.</description>

      <title>Roles of Structural Coordination and Strain Orientation in the Phase Stability of Ferroelectric HfO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase stabilization continues to be a critical issue in hafnium oxide (HfO$_2$) due to the interdependence of various contributing factors. Using first-principles calculations, we analyze the effects of strain and doping on stabilizing the ferroelectric phase. We found that combining Y-doping, O-vacancy, and compressive biaxial strain, particularly in the (111) orientation, offers an optimal pathway for stabilizing the ferroelectric phase of HfO$_2$. Analysis of structural coordination reveals how compressive strain affects phase competition. Crystallography analysis provides insights into the advantage of the (111) strain orientation compared to the (001) orientation. The impact of dopants is discussed in the context of these findings.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Investigation of Yield-Enhancing Equilibrium Sn$V^-$ Preparation Pathways in N-Doped Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elucidation of the mechanism of Sn$V^-$ formation in diamond is especially important as the Sn$V^-$ color center has the potential to be a superior single-photon emitter when compared to the N$V$ and to other Group IV color centers. The typical formation of the Sn$V$ involves placing Sn in diamond by ion implantation, but the formation of a charged Sn$V$ species requires an additional complication. This complication is related to the energy cost associated with electronic transitions within the host diamond. Effectively, producing the Sn$V^-$ charge state using an electron obtained from a band edge of the host diamond is less energetically favorable than having the Sn$V^-$ receive an electron from a neighboring donor dopant. Among donor dopants, substitutional N (N$_\text{C}$) is always present in even the purest synthetic or natural diamond sample. The mechanism of electron donation by N$_\text{C}$ has been proposed by Collins for charging the N$V$ in diamond and it has been used to interpret many experimental results. Therefore, in this paper we use DFT to explore the pathways for the formation of the Sn$V^-$ charge state due to electron donation arising from the presence of N$_\text{C}$ in the host diamond. Explicitly, defect concentrations are calculated in equilibrium in each of the explored pathways to determine the yield of the Sn$V^-$ throughout each of the pathways. The importance of our work is to suggest experimental ways of enhancing the yield of charged states like the Sn$V^-$ in diamond for transformative applications in optoelectronics and quantum information.</description>

      <title>Alternative harmonic detection approach for quantitative determination of spin and orbital torques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the spin-orbit torque (SOT) in light metal oxide systems is investigated using an experimental approach based on harmonic Hall voltage techniques in out-of-plane (OOP) angular geometry for samples with in-plane magnetic anisotropy. In parallel, an analytical derivation of this alternative OOP harmonic Hall detection geometry has been developed, followed by experimental validation to extract SOT effective fields. In addition, to accurately quantifying SOT, this method allows complete characterization of thermoelectric effects, opening promising avenues for accurate SOT characterization in related systems. In particular, this study corroborates the critical role of naturally oxidized copper interfaced with metallic Cu in the generation of orbital current in Co(2)|Pt(4)|CuOx(3), demonstrating a two-fold increase in damping-like torques compared to a reference sample with an oxidized Al capping layer. These findings offer promising directions for future research on the application aspect of non-equilibrium orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Defect-mediated electron-phonon coupling in halide double perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically active defects often play a crucial role in governing the light emission as well as the electronic properties of materials. Moreover, defect-mediated states in the mid-gap region can trap electrons, thus opening a path for the recombination of electrons and holes in lower energy states that may require phonons in the process. Considering this, we have probed electron-phonon interaction in halide perovskite systems with the introduction of defects and investigated the thermal effect on this interaction. Here, we report Raman spectroscopy study of the thermal evolution of electron-phonon coupling, which is tunable with the crystal growth conditions, in the halide perovskite systems Cs2AgInCl6 and Cs2NaInCl6. The signature of electron-phonon coupling is observed as a Fano anomaly in the lowest frequency phonon mode (51 cm-1) which evolves with temperature. In addition, we observe a broad band in the photoluminescence (PL) measurements for the defect-mediated systems, which is otherwise absent in defect-free halide perovskite. The simultaneous observation of the Fano anomaly in the Raman spectrum and the emergence of the PL band suggests the defect-mediated mid-gap states and the consequent existence of electron-phonon coupling in the double perovskite.</description>

      <title>Deterministic role of chemical bonding in the formation of altermagnetism: Reflection from correlated electron system NiS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a new collinear magnetic state that has traits of both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, has gained significant attention in the last few years and the underlying mechanisms driving this quantum phase are still evolving. Going beyond the phenomenological models and group theoretical analyses, which focus on providing a binary explanation of the presence or absence of the altermagnetic state, in this work, we explored the role of crystal chemical bonding. As the latter successfully integrates the crystal and orbital symmetries and is tunable, it provides a quantitative and more realistic mechanism to explain the formation of altermagnetism. From the first principle calculations and tight-binding models within the framework of the linear combination of atomic orbitals on NiS, belonging to the hexagonal NiAs family (e.g. CrSb, MnTe, etc.), we reveal that the second neighbor interaction between the orbitals of the non-magnetic atoms is the most deterministic in inducing altermagnetism. These second-neighbor bondings modulate the intra-sublattice interactions differently for the opposite spin sublattices. As a consequence, the antiferromagnetic sublattice band degeneracy is lifted and it results in momentum dependent altermagnetic spin split (ASS). We further reveal that the strong altermagnetism is observed in these materials due to the participation of multiple and selective orbitals, both from Ni and S, in the chemical bonding. We proposed twelve antinodal regions in the NiAs type hexagonal crystals, where ASS split is maximum. Specific to NiS, ASS increases with correlation, and for the edge valence and conduction bands it can go beyond 1eV, which makes this compound ideal for carrying out altermagnetic experiments and for exploring non-trivial quantum transport through electron and hole doping. The present study opens up new pathways to tailor tunable altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative self-consistent electron-phonon spectral functions and transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling often dominates the electron spectral functions and carrier transport properties. However, studies of this effect in real materials have largely relied on perturbative one-shot methods due to the lack of a first-principles theoretical and computational framework. Here, we present a self-consistent theory and implementation for the non-perturbative calculations of spectral functions and conductivity due to electron-phonon coupling. Applying this method to monolayer InSe, we demonstrate that self-consistency qualitatively affects the spectral function and transport properties compared to state-of-the-art one-shot calculations and allow one to reconcile experimental angle-resolved photoemission experiments. The developed method can be widely applied to materials with dominant electron-phonon coupling at moderate computational cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological materials have gained significant attention in condensed matter physics due to their unique electronic and transport properties. Three-dimensional (3D) topological materials are characterized by robust electronic states that are protected by symmetries and exhibit peculiar spin textures. They offer a rich platform for for future information technology including spintronics and topological quantum computing. Here, we review the investigation by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) of topological phases such as strong topological insulators, topological crystalline insulators, magnetic topological insulators, and 3D Dirac, Weyl, nodal, and chiral semimetals and address the status of correlated topological insulators and topological superconductors. A special emphasis is laid on examples from the transition metal dichalcogenide family. Moreover, insights from ultrafast pump-probe experiments are reviewed and a brief outlook is provided.</description>

      <title>Thermal Induced Structural Competitiveness and Metastability of Body-centered Cubic Iron under Non-Equilibrium Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure and stability of iron near melting at multi-megabar pressures are of significant interest in high pressure physics and earth and planetary sciences. While the body-centered cubic (BCC) phase is generally recognized as unstable at lower temperatures, its stability relative to the hexagonal close-packed (HCP) phase at high temperatures (approximately 0.5 eV) in the Earth's inner core (IC) remains a topic of ongoing theoretical and experimental debate. Our ab initio calculations show a significant drop in energy, the emergence of a plateau and a local minimum in the potential energy surface, and stabilization of all phonon modes at elevated electron temperatures (&gt;1-1.5 eV). These effects increase the competition among the BCC, HCP, and the face-centered cubic (FCC) phases and lead to the metastability of the BCC structure. Furthermore, the thermodynamic stability of BCC iron is enhanced by its substantial lattice vibration entropy. This thermally induced structural competitiveness and metastability under non-equilibrium conditions provide a clear theoretical framework for understanding iron phase relations and solidification processes, both experimentally and in the IC.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal neutral ferroelectric domain walls in BiFeO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a peculiar phenomenon of non-reciprocal domain wall pairs and illustrate the implications in ab-initio-based atomistic computational experiments with (112)-oriented planar R180 domain walls within the canonical multiferroic ferroelectric crystal of BiFeO3. Results show that parallel walls on the opposite sides of a given domain within a simply twinned lamellar domain structure can have considerably different polarization and oxygen octahedra tilt profiles, different thickness and energy densities. The spontaneous formation of zigzag walls and triangular domains suggests that these domain walls are actually the lowest energy planar R180 walls in pure insulating BiFeO3 crystals and films.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Chromium Impurities in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromium is a common transition-metal impurity that is easily incorporated during crystal growth. It is perhaps best known for giving rise to the 694.3 nm (1.786 eV) emission in Cr-doped Al$_2$O$_3$, exploited in ruby lasers. Chromium has also been found in monoclinic gallium oxide, a wide-bandgap semiconductor being pursued for power electronics. In this work, we thoroughly characterize the behavior of Cr in Ga$_2$O$_3$ through theoretical and experimental techniques. $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ samples are grown with the floating zone method and show evidence of a sharp photoluminescence signal, reminiscent of ruby. We calculate the energetics of formation of Cr from first principles, demonstrating that Cr preferentially incorporates as a neutral impurity on the octahedral site. Cr possesses a quartet ground-state spin and has an internal transition with a zero-phonon line near 1.8 eV. By comparing the calculated and experimentally measured luminescence lineshape function, we elucidate the role of coupling to phonons and uncover features beyond the Franck-Condon approximation. The combination of strong emission with a small Huang-Rhys factor of 0.05 and a technologically relevant host material render Cr in Ga$_2$O$_3$ attractive as a quantum defect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials provide a sustainable way to convert waste heat into electricity. However, data-driven discovery and optimization of these materials are challenging because of a lack of a reliable database. Here we developed a comprehensive database of 7,123 thermoelectric compounds, containing key information such as chemical composition, structural detail, seebeck coefficient, electrical and thermal conductivity, power factor, and figure of merit (ZT). We used the GPTArticleExtractor workflow, powered by large language models (LLM), to extract and curate data automatically from the scientific literature published in Elsevier journals. This process enabled the creation of a structured database that addresses the challenges of manual data collection. The open access database could stimulate data-driven research and advance thermoelectric material analysis and discovery.</description>

      <title>Efficient training of machine learning potentials for metallic glasses: CuZrAl validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interatomic potentials play a vital role in revealing microscopic details and structure-property relations, which are fundamental for multiscale simulations and to assist high-throughput experiments. For metallic glasses, developing these potentials is challenging due to the complexity of their unique disordered structure. As a result, chemistry-specific interaction potentials for this important class of materials are often missing. Here, we solve this gap by implementing an efficient methodology for designing machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for metallic glasses, and we benchmark it with the widely studied CuZrAl system. By combining a Lennard-Jones surrogate model with swap-Monte Carlo sampling and Density Functional Theory (DFT) corrections, we capture diverse amorphous structures from 14 decades of supercooling. These distinct structures provide robust and efficient training of the model and applicability to the wider spectrum of energies. This approach reduces the need for extensive DFT and ab initio optimization datasets, while maintaining high accuracy. Our MLIP shows results comparable to the classical Embedded Atom Method (EAM) available for CuZrAl, in predicting structural, energetic, and mechanical properties. This work paves the way for the development of new MLIPs for complex metallic glasses, including emerging multicomponent and high entropy metallic glasses.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Commensurate and Incommensurate Antiferromagnetic Groundstates in Co$_x$NbSe$_2$ Single Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Co$_x$NbSe$_2$, crystal symmetry, and cobalt site occupation drive the formation of two distinct magnetic phases. At $x = 1/4$, the centrosymmetric structure ($P$6$_3$/$mmc$) promotes Co-Co interactions leading to the formation of an $A$-type antiferromagnetic structure phase with a transition temperature of $T_N^A$ = 169 K. At $x = 1/3$, the non-centrosymmetric structure ($P$6$_3$22) induces a lower-temperature magnetic phase with $T_N^S$ = 28 K. We report the coexistence of both substructures within a superlattice, with a nuclear propagation vector of (1/3, 1/3, 0) relative to the host lattice. Single crystals of Co$_{0.28}$NbSe$_2$ exhibit both magnetic transitions, with $T_N^A$ corresponding to the $x \sim 1/4$ phase and $T_N^S$ corresponding to the $x \sim 1/3$ phase. Magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements confirm these transitions, although only the high-temperature $T_N^A$ phase significantly affects resistivity. We successfully isolate each phase in powder samples, while single crystals with an intercalation ratio of $x = 0.28$ display the coexistence of both phases in a single sample. Using single-crystal neutron diffraction, we solved the magnetic structure of the high-temperature centrosymmetric phase ($T_N^A$), and neutron powder diffraction revealed the double-$q$ magnetic structure of the low-temperature noncentrosymmetric phase ($T_N^S$)</description>

      <title>Constriction and contact impedance of ceramic solid electrolytes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of solid-state batteries is hindered by the degradation of the solid-solid interface during cycling which can cause void formation and contact loss. Here, we systematically investigate the effect of unrecoverable and real interfacial contact area at the electrode/Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl interface on the impedance spectrum. By varying applied stack pressures and controlling contact geometries, we identify their distinct signatures in the impedance spectrum and quantify their influence on the interfacial resistance and effective ionic conductivity of the solid electrolyte. Experimental results demonstrate that higher pressures and improved contact areas significantly reduce interfacial resistance. The interfacial resistance scales with pressure according to power law with exponent of -0.5, providing insights into the variation of real contact area. Further, distributed contacts lead to lower impedance compared to concentrated contacts due to smaller potential gradients and a more uniform potential distribution. Our simulations predict interfacial resistances of the contact geometries in agreement with experiments. Our work emphasizes the distinct roles of unrecoverable and recoverable contact losses in controlling the impedance of solid-state batteries.</description>

      <title>Theory of Transient Heat Conduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast and nanoscale heat conduction demands a unified theoretical framework that rigorously bridges macroscopic transport equations with microscopic material properties derived from statistical physics.Existing empirical generalizations of Fourier's law often lack a solid microscopic foundation, failing to connect observed non-Fourier behavior with underlying atomic scale mechanisms. In this work, we present a time-domain theory of transient heat conduction rooted in Zwanzig's statistical theory of irreversible processes. Central to this framework is the time-domain transport function, Z(t), defined through equilibrium time-correlation functions of heat fluxes. This function generalizes the conventional concept of steady-state thermal conductivity, governing the transition of conduction dynamics from onset second sound type wave propagation at finite speeds to diffusion-dominated behavior across broad temporal and spatial scales. Unlike phonon hydrodynamic models that rely on mesoscopic constructs such as phonon drift velocity, our approach provides a quantitative and microscopic description of intrinsic memory effects in transient heat fluxes and applies universally to bulk materials at any temperature or length scale. By integrating atomistic-scale first-principles calculations with continuum-level macroscopic equations, this framework offers a robust foundation for numerical simulations of transient temperature fields. Furthermore, it facilitates the interpretation and design of transient thermal grating experiments using nanometer-scale heat sources and ultrafast laser systems in the extreme ultraviolet and x-ray wavelength ranges, advancing our understanding of heat dissipation dynamics.</description>

      <title>BiFeO$_3$ nanoparticles at low-temperature using atomistic simulations -- surface charge distribution and terminations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes how the ferroelectric properties of cubic-like BiFeO$_3$ nanoparticles are affected by different terminations and charge distributions at the surface using ab-initio-based atomistic computational experiments. Our findings unveil multiple multidomain configurations and illustrate how the different order parameters evolve towards the surface. Interestingly, for neutral terminations, a non-rhombohedral phase of BiFeO$_3$ with a stripe-like polarization arrangement was stabilized. We evaluate the polarization, oxygen octahedra rotation, and volume variation for all the configurations obtained, taking advantage of the atomic-scale details provided by the methods used in this study.</description>

      <title>Essentially degenerate hidden nodal lines in two-dimensional magnetic layer groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the theory of group representations, the types of band degeneracy can be divided into accidental degeneracy and essential degeneracy. The essentially degenerate nodal lines (NLs) are typically resided on the high-symmetry lines of the Brillouin zone. Here, we propose a type of NL in two dimension that is essentially degenerate but is hidden within the high-symmetry planes, making it less observable, dubbed a hidden-essential nodal line (HENL). The existence of HENL is guaranteed as long as the system hosts a horizontal glide-mirror symmetry, hence such NLs can be widely found in both non-magnetic and magnetic systems. We perform an exhaustive search over all 528 magnetic layer groups (MLGs) for HENL that can be enforced by glide-mirror symmetry with both spinless and spinfull systems. We find that 122 candidate MLGs host spinless HENL, while 63 candidate MLGs demonstrate spinful HENL. In addition, we reveal that horizontal mirror and time-reversal symmetry in type-II and type-IV MLGs with spin-orbital coupling can enforce HENL formed. The 15 corresponding candidate MLGs have also been presented. Furthemore, we derive a few typical lattice models to characterize the existence for the HENL. For specific electronic fillings in real materials, namely 4$N$+2 in spinless systems (and 2$N$+1 in spinful systems), the presence of the HENLs in candidate MLGs is required regardless of the details of the systems. Using \emph{ab-initio} calculations, we further identify possible material candidates that realize spinless and spinful HENL. Moreover, spinful HENLs exhibit a novel persistent spin texture wih the characteristic of momentum-independent spin configuration. Our findings uncover a new type of topological semimetal state and offer an ideal platform to study the related physics of HENLs.</description>

      <title>Spin Hall effect in 3d ferromagnetic metals for field-free switching of perpendicular magnetization: A first-principles investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic metals, with the potential to generate spin current with unconventional spin polarization via the spin Hall effect, offer promising opportunities for field-free switching of perpendicular magnetization and for the spin-orbit torque devices. In this study, we investigate two distinct spin Hall mechanisms in 3d ferromagnetic metals including spin-orbit coupling driven spin Hall effect in Fe, Co, Ni and their alloys, and non-relativistic spin Hall effect arising from anisotropic spin-polarized transport by taking L10-MnAl as an example. By employing first-principles calculations, we examine the temperature and alloy composition dependence of spin Hall conductivity in Fe, Co, Ni and their alloys. Our results reveal that the spin Hall conductivities with out-of-plane spin polarization in 3d ferromagnetic metals are at the order of 1000 \frac{\hbar}{2e} \left( \Omega \, \text{cm} \right)^{-1} at 300 K, but with a relatively low spin Hall angles around 0.01~0.02 due to the large longitudinal conductivity. For L10-MnAl(101), the non-relativistic spin Hall conductivity can reach up to 10000\frac{\hbar}{2e} \left( \Omega \, \text{cm} \right)^{-1}, with a giant spin Hall angle around 0.25 at room temperature. By analyzing the magnetization switching process, we demonstrate deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization without an external magnetic field by using 3d ferromagnetic metals as spin current sources. Our work may provide an unambiguous understanding on spin Hall effect in ferromagnetic metals and pave the way for their potential applications in related spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Genuine and Robust Magnetoelectric Coupling Effect in van der Waals Multiferroic Tunnel Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals multiferroic tunnel junctions (vdW-MFTJs) are promising candidates for data storage devices due to their tunable thickness and capability to exhibit multiple nonvolatile resistance states. However, existing vdW-MFTJs utilize ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism independently, failing to achieve true magnetoelectric coupling, which leads to unnecessary energy dissipation. Here, we propose an innovative vdW-MFTJ design based on a CrBr$_3$/MnPSe$_3$/CrBr$_3$ vertical heterostructure, enabling genuine magnetoelectric coupling without relying on atomic migration induced by inversion symmetry breaking for ferroelectric polarization reversal. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the spin-polarized quantum transport properties of the proposed structure. By integrating asymmetric PtTe$_2$/alkali-metal (Li/Na/K)-doped/intercalated CrBr$_3$ electrodes, the device demonstrates exceptional performance, with a maximum tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) exceeding $8.1\times10^5$\% and tunneling electroresistance (TER) reaching 2499\%, while the spin-filtering channels can be flexibly controlled by the magnetization direction of the magnetic free layer, achieving perfect spin-filtering over a broad bias voltage range. Applying an external bias voltage further enhances these metrics, increasing TMR to $3.6\times 10^7$\% and TER to 9990\%. Notably, a pronounced negative differential resistance (NDR) effect is observed, yielding an unprecedented peak-to-valley ratio (PVR) of $9.55\times10^9$\%, the highest value reported to date. These extraordinary characteristics highlight the potential of vdW-MFTJs for ultra-efficient electronic switching, a key feature for next-generation spintronic devices. Our findings provide a solid theoretical foundation for designing and developing high-performance magnetic storage and logic technologies.</description>

      <title>Role of Chalcogen atoms in In Situ Exfoliation for Large-Area 2D Semiconducting Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides have emerged as a promising platform for next-generation optoelectronic and spintronic devices. Mechanical exfoliation using adhesive tape remains the dominant method for preparing 2D materials of highest quality, including transition metal dichalcogenides, but always results in small-sized flakes. This limitation poses a significant challenge for investigations and applications where large scale flakes are needed. To overcome these constraints, we explored the preparation of 2D WS2 and WSe2 using a recently developed kinetic in situ single-layer synthesis method (KISS). In particular, we focused on the influence of different substrates, Au and Ag, and chalcogen atoms, S and Se, on the yield and quality of the 2D films. The crystallinity and spatial morphology of the 2D films were characterized using optical microscopy and atomic force microscopy, providing a comprehensive assessment of exfoliation quality. Low-energy electron diffraction verified that there is no preferential orientation between the 2D film and the substrate, while optical microscopy revealed that WSe2 consistently outperformed WS2 in producing large monolayers, regardless of the substrate used. Finally, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrate that no covalent bonds are formed between the 2D material and the underlying substrate. These results identify KISS method as a non-destructive approach for a more scalable approach of high-quality 2D transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Understanding Memristive Behavior: An Atomistic Study of the Influence of Grain Boundaries on Surface and Out-of-Plane Diffusion of Metallic Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic migration from metallic contacts, and subsequent filament formation, is recognised as a prevailing mechanism leading to resistive switching in memristors based on two-dimensional materials (2DMs). This study presents a detailed atomistic examination of the migration of different metal atoms across the grain boundaries (GBs) of 2DMs, employing Density Functional Theory in conjunction with Non-Equilibrium Green's Function transport simulations. Various types of metallic atoms, Au, Cu, Al, Ni, and Ag, are examined, focusing on their migration both in the out-of-plane direction through a MoS\textsubscript{2} layer and along the surface of the MoS\textsubscript{2} layer, pertinent to filament formation in vertical and lateral memristors, respectively. Different types of GBs usually present in MoS\textsubscript{2} are considered to assess their influence on the diffusion of metal atoms. The findings are compared with structures based on pristine MoS\textsubscript{2} and those with mono-sulfur vacancies, aiming to understand the key elements that affect the switching performance of memristors. Furthermore, transport simulations are carried out to evaluate the effects of GBs on both out-of-plane and in-plane electron conductance, providing valuable insights into the resistive switching ratio.</description>

      <title>Strain Mediated Voltage Control of Magnetic Anisotropy and Magnetization Reversal in Bismuth Substituted Yttrium Iron Garnet Films and Meso-structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on magnetic anisotropy modulation in Bismuth substituted Yttrium Iron Garnet (Bi-YIG) thin films and mesoscale patterned structures deposited on a PMN-PT substrate with the application of voltage-induced strain. The Bi content is selected for low coercivity and higher magnetostriction than that of YIG, yielding significant changes in the hysteresis loops through the magnetoelastic effect. The piezoelectric substrate is poled along its thickness, which is the [011] direction, by applying a voltage across the PMN-PT/SiO2/Bi-YIG/Pt heterostructure. In-situ magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy (MOKE) shows the modulation of magnetic anisotropy with voltage-induced strain. Furthermore, voltage control of the magnetic domain state of the Bi-YIG film at a fixed magnetic field produces a 90{\deg} switching of the magnetization easy axis above a threshold voltage. The magnetoelectric coefficient of the heterostructure is 1.05x10^(-7)s/m which is competitive with that of other ferromagnetic oxide films on ferroelectric substrates such as La0.67Sr0.33MnO3/PMNPT and YIG/PMN-PZT. Voltage-control of magnetization reversal fields in 5-30 microns wide dots and racetracks of Bi-YIG show potential for energy efficient non-volatile memory and neuromorphic computing devices.</description>

      <title>Kagome Metal GdNb$_6$Sn$_6$: A 4d Playground for Topological Magnetism and Electron Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic kagome metals have garnered considerable attention as an ideal platform for investigating intrinsic topological structures, frustrated magnetism, and electron correlation effects. In this work, we present the synthesis and detailed characterization of GdNb$_6$Sn$_6$, a metal that features a niobium-based kagome lattice and a frustrated triangular gadolinium network. The compound adopts the HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$-type crystal structure, with lattice parameters of a = b = 5.765(4) {\AA} and c = 9.536(8) {\AA}. Magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements reveal a magnetic transition near 2.3 K. Electrical transport data confirm metallic behavior, unsaturated positive magnetoresistance, and a hole-dominated multiband Hall effect. Furthermore, first-principles calculations indicate that Nb-4d orbitals predominantly contribute to the electronic states near the Fermi energy, with the band structure showing multiple topologically nontrivial crossings around the Fermi surface. This study also compares GdNb$_6$Sn$_6$ with GdV$_6$Sn$_6$, highlighting their similarities and differences. Our findings pave the way for exploring RNb$_6$Sn$_6$ (R = rare earth) with customized substitutions of R sites to fine-tune their properties.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven Insights into Excitonic Effects in 2D Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding excitonic effects in two-dimensional (2D) materials is critical for advancing their potential in next-generation electronic and photonic devices. In this study, we introduce a machine learning (ML)-based framework to predict exciton binding energies in 2D materials, offering a computationally efficient alternative to traditional methods such as many-body perturbation theory (GW) and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Leveraging data from the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB), our ML models establish connections between cheaply available material descriptors and complex excitonic properties, significantly accelerating the screening process for materials with pronounced excitonic effects. Additionally, Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression was employed to efficiently filter materials with largest exciton binding energies, further enhancing the discovery process. Although developed for 2D systems, this approach is versatile and can be extended to three-dimensional materials, broadening its applicability in materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Native antisite defects in h-BN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an excellent host for solid-state single phonon emitters. Experimental observed emission ranges from infrared to ultraviolet. The emission centers are generally attributed to either intrinsic or extrinsic point defects embedded into hBN. Nevertheless, the microscopic structure of most of these defect emitters is uncertain. Here, through density-functional theory calculations we studied the native antisite defects in hBN. We find that the neutral boron antisite might be a nonmagnetic single photon source with zero-phonon-line (ZPL) at 1.58 eV and such a lineshape that is often observed in experiments. Furthermore, the positively charged nitrogen antisite might be associated with a dim color center recently observed as a blue emitter with ZPL at 2.63 eV. These simple single substitution defects indicate the existence of out-of-plane phonon mode which significantly affects the optical properties. Our results could provide useful information for identification of quantum emitters in hBN.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale observation of $d$-$\pi$-$d$ spin coupling in coordination structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin coupling between magnetic metal atoms and organic radicals plays a pivotal role in high-performance magnetic materials. The complex interaction involving multi-spin centers in bulk materials makes it challenging to study spin coupling at the atomic scale. Here, we investigate the $d$-$\pi$-$d$ spin interaction in well-defined metal-organic coordinated structures composed of two iron (Fe) atoms and four all-trans retinoic acid (ReA) molecules, using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The ReA molecule is turned into a spin-$1/2$ radical state by dehydrogenation, facilitating strong magnetic coupling with the coordinated Fe atoms. Comprehensive theoretical analysis, based on density functional theory and valence bond theory, further elucidates the intrinsic mechanism of ferrimagnetic spin coupling in the coordination structure. Specifically, simultaneous antiferromagnetic coupling of Fe dimer to ReA radicals parallelizes the dimer spin orientation. This work contributes to the fundamental understanding of spin interaction in metal-organic coordination structures and provides microscopic insights for designing advanced magnetic materials.</description>

Abstract: Grain boundaries affect properties of polycrystalline materials. The influence of a boundary is largely determined by its energy. Grain boundary energy is often portrayed as a function of macroscopic boundary parameters representing grain misorientation and boundary plane inclination. In grain boundary simulation and modeling, many studies neglect structural multiplicity of boundaries, i.e., existence of metastable states, and focus on minimum energy. The minimum energy function restricted to constant misorientation should satisfy Herring's condition for interface stability. This requirement has been ignored in recent works on grain boundary energy functions. Example violations of the stability condition are shown. Moreover, a simple and natural procedure for constructing a continuous function satisfying the condition is described. Cusps in the energy as a function of boundary plane inclinations arise because of the imposition of the stability condition, and their locations and shapes result from properties of input data. An example of applying the procedure to simulated data is presented.</description>

      <title>Pyramidal charged domain walls in ferroelectric BiFeO$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain structures play a crucial role in the electric, mechanical and other properties of ferroelectric materials. In this study, we uncover the physical origins of the enigmatic zigzag domain structure in the prototypical multiferroic material BiFeO$_3$. Using phase-field simulations within the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire framework, we demonstrate that spatially-homogeneous defect charges result in domain structures that closely resemble those observed experimentally. The acquired understanding of the underlying physics of pyramidal-domain formation may enable the engineering of new materials with self-assembled domain structures exhibiting defined domain periodicity at the nanometre scale, opening avenues for advanced applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diatoms have been described as nanometer-born lithographers because of their ability to create sophisticated three-dimensional amorphous silica exoskeletons. The hierarchical architecture of these structures provides diatoms with mechanical protection and the ability to filter, float, and manipulate light. Therefore, they emerge as an extraordinary model of multifunctional materials from which to draw inspiration. In this paper, we use numerical simulations, analytical models, and experimental tests to unveil the structural and fluid dynamic efficiency of the Coscinodiscus species diatom. Then we propose a novel 3D printable multifunctional biomimetic material for applications such as porous filters, heat exchangers, drug delivery systems, lightweight structures, and robotics. Our results demonstrate the role of Nature as a material designer for efficient and tunable systems and highlight the potential of diatoms for engineering materials innovation. Additionally, the results reported in this paper lay the foundation to extend the structure-property characterization of diatoms.</description>

      <title>Strain-Induced Activation of Symmetry-Forbidden Exciton-Phonon Couplings for Enhanced Phonon-Assisted Photoluminescence in MoS$_2$ Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon-assisted photoluminescence (PL) in molybdenum-based two-dimensional dichalcogenides is typically weak due to the dormant phonon coupling with optically inactive momentum-dark (intervalley) excitons, unlike in tungsten-based dichalcogenides where such processes are more prominent. Despite this inefficiency, we revisit excitons in MoS$_2$ using rigorous finite-momentum Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations to identify ways to enhance phonon-assisted recombination channels. Our ab-initio results, complemented by group-theoretic analyses, reveal that while unstrained MoS$_2$ exhibits no phonon-assisted PL emissions at cryogenic temperatures due to forbidden A$^{\prime\prime}$ phonon modes, biaxial strain opens a pathway to significantly intensify this emission by activating hole-phonon A$^{\prime}$-mediated scattering channels. By calculating allowed exciton-phonon matrix elements and scattering rates, we demonstrate how strain redistributes oscillator strengths toward radiative recombination. These findings provide a promising route to improving PL emission efficiency in various metal dichalcogenide monolayers through strain engineering and offer valuable insights for further exploration of exciton-phonon dynamics, including time-resolved spectroscopic studies.</description>

      <title>Magnon-Phonon Coupling in Layered Antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fully analytical model of hybridization between magnon, and phonons observed experimentally in magneto-Raman scattering in van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnets (AFM). Here, the representative material, FePS3, has been shown to be a quasi-two-dimensional-Ising antiferromagnet, with additional features of spin-phonon coupling in the Raman spectra emerging below the N\'eel temperature (TN) of approximately 120 K. Using magneto-Raman spectroscopy as an optical probe of magnetic structure, we show that one of these Raman-active modes in the magnetically ordered state is a magnon with a frequency of 3.7 THz (~ 122 cm-1). In addition, one magnon band and three phonon bands are coupled via the magneto-elastic coupling evidenced by anti-crossing in the complete spectra. We consider a simple model involving only in-plane nearest neighbor exchange couplings (designed to give rise to a similar magnetic structure) and perpendicular anisotropy in presence of an out-of-plane magnetic field. Exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian leads to energy bands which show that the interaction term gives rise to avoided crossings between the hybridized magnon and phonon branches. Realizing magnon-phonon coupling in two-dimensional (2D) AFMs is important for the verification of the theoretical predictions on exotic quantum transport phenomena like spin-caloritronics, topological magnonics, etc.</description>

      <title>On-the-Fly Path Planning of Compositional Gradients in High Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional gradients have recently experienced an explosion in activity due to advances in manufacturing, where compositions can now be spatially varied on-the-fly during fabrication. In addition, modern computational thermodynamics has reached sufficient maturity -- with respect to property databases and the availability of commercial software -- that gradients can be designed with specific sets of properties. Despite these successes, there are practical limitations on the calculation speeds of these thermodynamic tools that make it intractable to model every element in an alloy. As a result, most path planning is carried out via surrogate models on simplified systems (e.g., approximating Inconel 718 as Ni$_{59}$Cr$_{23}$Fe$_{18}$ instead of Ni$_{53}$Cr$_{23}$Fe$_{18}$Nb$_{3}$Mo$_{2}$Ti$_{1}$). In this work, we demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome using a combination of on-the-fly sampling and a conjectured corollary of the lever rule for transformations of isothermal paths in arbitrary compositional dimensions. We quantitatively benchmark the effectiveness of this new method and find that it can be as much as 106 times more efficient than surrogate modeling.</description>

      <title>Deep learning optimal molecular scintillators for dark matter direct detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct searches for sub-GeV dark matter are limited by the intrinsic quantum properties of the target material. In this proof-of-concept study, we argue that this problem is particularly well suited for machine learning. We demonstrate that a simple neural architecture consisting of a variational autoencoder and a multi-layer perceptron can efficiently generate unique molecules with desired properties. In specific, the energy threshold and signal (quantum) efficiency determine the minimum mass and cross section to which a detector can be sensitive. Organic molecules present a particularly interesting class of materials with intrinsically anisotropic electronic responses and $\mathcal{O}$(few) eV excitation energies. However, the space of possible organic compounds is intractably large, which makes traditional database screening challenging. We adopt excitation energies and proxy transition matrix elements as target properties learned by our network. Our model is able to generate molecules that are not in even the most expansive quantum chemistry databases and predict their relevant properties for high-throughput and efficient screening. Following a massive generation of novel molecules, we use clustering analysis to identify some of the most promising molecular structures that optimise the desired molecular properties for dark matter detection.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac spin liquid in the generalized Shastry-Sutherland model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multimethod investigation into the nature of the recently reported quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase in the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice. A comprehensive projective symmetry group classification of fermionic mean-field Ans\"atze on this lattice yields 46 U(1) and 80 $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ states. Motivated by density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations suggesting that the Shastry-Sutherland model and the square-lattice $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet putatively share the same QSL phase, we establish a mapping of our Ans\"atze to those of the square lattice. This enables us to identify the equivalent of the square-lattice QSL (Z2A$zz$13) in the Shastry-Sutherland system. Employing state-of-the-art variational Monte Carlo calculations with Gutzwiller-projected wavefunctions improved upon by Lanczos steps, we demonstrate the excellent agreement of energies and correlators between a gapless (Dirac) $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ spin liquid -- characterized by only few parameters -- and approaches based on neural quantum states and DMRG. Furthermore, the real-space spin-spin correlations are shown to decay with the same power law as in the $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$ square lattice model, which also hosts a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac spin liquid. Finally, we apply the recently developed Keldysh formulation of the pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group to compute the dynamical spin structure factor; these correlations exhibit the features expected due to Dirac cones in the excitation spectrum, thus providing strong independent evidence for a Dirac QSL ground state. Our finding of a $d$-wave pairing $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac QSL is consistent with the recently observed signatures of QSL behavior in Pr$_2$Ga$_2$BeO$_7$ and outlines predictions for future experiments.</description>

Abstract: Quantum geometry, characterized by the quantum geometric tensor, is pivotal in diverse physical phenomena in quantum materials. In condensed matter systems, quantum geometry refers to the geoemtric properties of Bloch states in the Brillouin zone. This pedagogical review provides an accessible introduction to the concept of quantum geometry, emphasizing its extensive implications across multiple domains. Specifically, we discuss the role of quantum geometry in optical responses, Landau levels, and fractional Chern insulators, as well as its influence on superfluid weight, spin stiffness, exciton condensates, electron-phonon coupling, etc. By integrating these topics, we underscore the pervasive significance of quantum geometry in understanding emergent behaviors in quantum materials. Finally, we present an outlook on open questions and potential future directions, highlighting the need for continued exploration in this rapidly developing field.</description>

      <title>Universal Wilson loop Bound of Quantum Geometry: $Z_2$ Bound and Physical Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the absolute Wilson loop winding and prove that it bounds the quantum metric from below. This Wilson loop lower bound naturally reproduces the known Chern and Euler bounds of the quantum metric, and provides an explicit lower bound of the quantum metric due to the time-reversal protected $Z_2$ index, answering a hitherto open question. In general, the Wilson loop lower bound can be applied to any other topological invariants characterized by Wilson loop winding, such as the particle-hole $Z_2$ index. As physical consequences of the $Z_2$ bound, we show that the time-reversal $Z_2$ index bounds superfluid weight and optical conductivity from below, and bounds the direct gap of a band insulator from above.</description>

      <title>Development of a linac-based LEPD experimental station for surface structure analysis and coordination with synchrotron radiation ARPES</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the development of a low-energy positron diffraction (LEPD) experimental station for surface structure analysis using a linac-based slow-positron beam. LEPD, the positron counterpart of low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), offers higher accuracy in surface structure determination. The station enables acquisition of LEPD I-V curves within a few hours, allowing measurements before surface degradation occurs. It consists of two ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chambers: one for sample preparation and the other for LEPD observations. The preparation chamber includes an Ar+ sputtering system, a triple-pocket electron beam evaporator, three gas introduction systems, additional user-configurable ports, and a LEED/Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) system. Sample manipulators enable rapid cooling, precise positioning, and orientation adjustments. In the preparation chamber, the manipulator also supports direct current heating up to 1200 {\deg}C. The sample holder is compatible with the LEPD station at SPF-A4 and the ARPES station at PF BL-13B, both located at the Tsukuba campus of the Institute of Materials Structure Science (IMSS), KEK. Design concepts and experimental demonstrations are presented.</description>

Abstract: Patterned magnetic nanostructures are advanced materials characterized by their unique magnetic properties at the nanoscale, which are the result of tailored geometric configurations and compositional engineering. As interest in nanotechnology continues to grow exponentially, the exploration of patterned magnetic nanostructures turns into a vibrant and critical area of study for both industry professionals and academic researchers. Here, we review investigations of standing spin waves (collective spin precessions) in magnetic elements by the technique of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). The presentation encompasses earlier studies of arrays of magnetic nanodisks and nanoringes by cavity-based FMR as well as more recent studies of individual nanodisks and 3D nanovolcanoes by a broadband FMR method which implies the use of a coplanar waveguide. Overall, the manuscript outlines the development of FMR studies along the two major lines: (i) downscaling from multiple to individual magnetic nanoelements and (ii) extending planar nanomagnets into the third dimension.</description>

      <title>Analytical model of metasurfaces comprising meta-atoms with anisotropic polarizabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A general analytical approach to the study of electromagnetic resonances of metasurfaces consisting of meta-atoms with anisotropic electric and magnetic dipole polarizabilities and irradiated with obliquely incident light is developed in the direct dipole-moment representation. The presented approach allows us to clearly trace and explain the features of the electromagnetic coupling between electric and magnetic dipole moments in the metasurface and to identify its role in the formation of optical resonances. For these purposes, the dependence of the dipole lattice sums on the angle of illumination is also presented. Expressions for the transmittance and reflectivity corresponding to the specular reflectance are presented with explicit inclusion of the dipole moments of particles in the array, which allows using these expressions for multipole analysis of purely numerical results concerning the optical response of metasurfaces. The developed analytical method is tested to characterize the spectral resonances of dielectric metasurfaces composed of rectangular silicon nanoprisms. In addition, we discuss the relationship and similarity between the results of coupled dipole and coupled dipole-quadrupole methods. Our analytical representation of electromagnetic dipole coupling is an insightful and fast method for the characterization of collective resonances in metasurfaces under illumination at oblique incidence. It could be especially useful for designing planar nanophotonic devices consisting of arbitrary-shaped building blocks and operating under special irradiation conditions.</description>

Abstract: Almost a century on from the culmination of the first revolution in quantum physics, we are poised for another. Even as we engage in the creation of impactful quantum technologies, it is imperative for us to face the challenges in understanding the phenomenology of various emergent forms of quantum matter. This will involve building on decades of progress in quantum condensed matter physics, and going beyond the well-established Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson paradigm for quantum matter. We outline and discuss several outstanding challenges, including the need to explore and identify the organisational principles that can guide the development of theories, key experimental phenomenologies that continue to confound, and the formulation of methods that enable progress. These efforts will enable the prediction of new quantum materials whose properties facilitate the creation of next generation technologies.</description>

      <title>A Novel Velocity Discretization for Lattice Boltzmann Method: Application to Compressible Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) has emerged as a powerful tool in computational fluid dynamics and material science. However, standard LBM formulation imposes some limitations on the applications of the method, particularly compressible fluids. In this paper, we introduce a new velocity discretization method to overcome some of these challenges. In this new formulation, the particle populations are discretized using a bump function that has a mean and a variance. This introduces enough independent degrees of freedom to set the equilibrium moments to the moments of Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution up to and including the third moments. Consequently, the correct macroscopic fluid dynamics equations for compressible fluids are recovered. We validate our method using several benchmark simulations.</description>

      <title>Photon-photon coupling induced bound state in the continuum and transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the coherent and dissipative coupling realized in the hybrid photonic resonators that have been achieved via the constructive and destructive interference of the photonic resonator fields with the radiation of a common transmission line fed with microwave photons. In the dissipative coupling regime we have found the coexistence of a peculiar phenomenon bound state in the continuum (BIC) near the crossing of frequency of the uncoupled resonators by satisfying the Friedrich-Wintgen BICs condition. Again just by rotating one of the samples and with the dynamic adjustment of a parameter we have achieved coupling induced transparency between the photonic resonators. This transition from BIC in the absorption regime to transparency opens avenues for different sorts of plain or programmable oscillators, filters, quantum information processors, sensors etc.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Raman scattering and lattice orientation identification of 2M-WS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic materials with low symmetries hold significant promise for next-generation electronic and quantum devices. 2M-WS2, a candidate for topological superconductivity, has garnered considerable interest. However, a comprehensive understanding of how its anisotropic features contribute to unconventional superconductivity, along with a simple, reliable method to identify its crystal orientation, remains elusive. Here, we combine theoretical and experimental approaches to investigate angle- and polarization-dependent anisotropic Raman modes of 2M-WS2. Through first-principles calculations, we predict and analyze phonon dispersion and lattice vibrations of all Raman modes in 2M-WS2. We establish a direct correlation between their anisotropic Raman spectra and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images. Finally, we demonstrate that anisotropic Raman spectroscopy can accurately determine the crystal orientation and twist angle between two stacked 2M-WS2 layers. Our findings provide insights into the electron-phonon coupling and anisotropic properties of 2M-WS2, paving the way for the use of anisotropic materials in advanced electronic and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Active and transfer learning with partially Bayesian neural networks for materials and chemicals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active learning, an iterative process of selecting the most informative data points for exploration, is crucial for efficient characterization of materials and chemicals property space. Neural networks excel at predicting these properties but lack the uncertainty quantification needed for active learning-driven exploration. Fully Bayesian neural networks, in which weights are treated as probability distributions inferred via advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, offer robust uncertainty quantification but at high computational cost. Here, we show that partially Bayesian neural networks (PBNNs), where only selected layers have probabilistic weights while others remain deterministic, can achieve accuracy and uncertainty estimates on active learning tasks comparable to fully Bayesian networks at lower computational cost. Furthermore, by initializing prior distributions with weights pre-trained on theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that PBNNs can effectively leverage computational predictions to accelerate active learning of experimental data. We validate these approaches on both molecular property prediction and materials science tasks, establishing PBNNs as a practical tool for active learning with limited, complex datasets.</description>

      <title>D-HAT: a Diatom-inspired structure for a Helmet concept Against Trauma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary objective of helmet design continues to be the prevention of traumatic brain injuries. Yet, achieving an optimal user experience, including aspects such as fit, thermal comfort, breathability, waterproofing, and reusability, is increasingly significant. Thus, designing helmets with multifunctional performance represents the latest technological frontier for safety devices. This study draws inspiration from the morphology of Coscinodiscus species diatoms to develop a biomimetic material replicating their cellular structure and multifunctionality. Unlike its biological counterpart, the synthetic material is engineered as the inner liner for multi impact helmets, suited for urban sports and micro mobility applications. The architecture of the material is modeled using computer aided design tools, and its energy absorption capabilities are analyzed through finite element modeling and quasi static compression tests on 3D printed elastomeric samples. Performance optimization is achieved through a parametric approach. The results demonstrate that the material exhibits energy absorption comparable to cellular materials like honeycombs, while offering lightweight properties, breathability, and resistance to atmospheric agents. This biomimetic design marks a significant advancement in high performance safety equipment.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional quantum anomalous Hall effect in Weyl semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is a quantum phenomenon in which a two-dimensional system exhibits a quantized Hall resistance $h/e^2$ in the absence of magnetic field, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $e$ is the electron charge. In this work, we extend this novel phase to three dimensions and thus propose a three-dimensional QAHE exhibiting richer and more versatile transport behaviors. We first confirm this three-dimensional QAHE through the quantized Chern number, then establish its bulk-boundary correspondence, and finally reaffirm it via the distinctive transport properties. Remarkably, we find that the three-dimensional QAHE hosts two chiral surface states along one spatial direction while a pair of chiral hinge states along another direction, and the location of the hinge states depends sensitively on the Fermi energy. These two types of boundary states are further connected through a perpendicular chiral surface states, whose chirality is also Fermi energy dependent. Consequently, depending on the transport direction, its Hall resistance can quantize to $0$, $h/e^2$, or $\pm h/e^2$ when the Fermi energy is tuned across the charge neutral point. This three-dimensional QAHE not only fill the gap in the Hall effect family but also holds significant potentials in device applications such as in-memory computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09808v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many dipolar topological structures have been experimentally demonstrated in (PbTiO$_3$)$_n$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_n$ superlattices, such as flux-closure, vortice, and skyrmion. In this work, we employ deep potential molecular dynamics (MD) to investigate the dynamical response of the (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_{10}$ superlattice, supporting polar vortex arrays, to temperature and electric field at the atomic level. Our simulations reveal a unique phase transition sequence from ferroelectric-like to antiferroelectric-like to paraelectric in the in-plane direction as temperature increases. In the ferroelectric-like state, we observe field-driven reversible switching of in-plane polarization coupled with out-of-plane movements of vortex cores during MD simulations. In the antiferroelectric-like region, the polarization-electric field hysteresis loop exhibits a superparaelectric feature, showing nearly no loss. This behavior is attributed to a strong recovering force to form polar vortex arrays, dictated by the electrical and mechanical boundary conditions within the superlattice. The (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_{10}$ superlattice in the antiferroelectric-like state also demonstrates large in-plane susceptibility and tunability. The effect of Pb doping in the SrTiO$_3$ layer on the topological structural transition in the superlattice is investigated. The weakened depolarization field in the PbTiO$_3$ layers leads to new dipolar configurations, such as enlarged skyrmion bubble within $c$ domains in (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(Pb$_{0.4}$Sr$_{0.6}$TiO$_3$)$_{10}$, and we quantify their thermal and electrical responses through MD simulations. These quantitative atomistic insights will be useful for the controlled optimization of perovskite superlattices for various device applications.</description>

      <title>Tuning electronic and optical properties of 2D polymeric C$_{60}$ by stacking two layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Benefiting from improved stability due to stronger interlayer van der Waals interactions, few-layer fullerene networks are experimentally more accessible compared to monolayer polymeric C$_{60}$. However, there is a lack of systematic theoretical studies on the material properties of few-layer C$_{60}$ networks. Here, we compare the structural, electronic and optical properties of bilayer and monolayer fullerene networks. The band gap and band-edge positions remain mostly unchanged after stacking two layers into a bilayer, enabling the bilayer to be almost as efficient a photocatalyst as the monolayer. The effective mass ratio along different directions is varied for conduction band states due to interlayer interactions,leading to enhanced anisotropy in carrier transport. Additionally, stronger exciton absorption is found in the bilayer than that in the monolayer over the entire visible light range, rendering the bilayer a more promising candidate for photovoltaics. Moreoever, the polarisation dependence of optical absorption in the bilayer is increased in the red-yellow light range, offering unique opportunities in photonics and display technologies with tailored optical properties over specific directions. Our study provides strategies to tune electronic and optical properties of 2D polymeric C$_{60}$ via the introduction of stacking degrees of freedom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex ferromagnetic oxides such as La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) offer pathways for creating energy efficient spintronic devices with new functionalities. LSMO exhibits high-temperature ferromagnetism, half metallicity, sharp resonance linewidth, low damping and a large anisotropic magnetoresistance response. Combined with Pt, a proven material with high spin-charge conversion efficiency, LSMO can be used to create robust nano-oscillators for neuromorphic computing. Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and device level spin-pumping FMR measurements are performed to investigate the magnetization dynamics and spin transport in NdGaO3(110)/LSMO(15 nm)/Pt(0 and 5 nm) thin films ranging from 300K to 90K and compare the device performance with Py(7 nm)/Pt(5 nm) sample. The spin current pumped into Pt is quantified to determine the temperature dependent influence of interfacial interactions. The generated spin current in the micro-device is maximum at 170K for the optimally grown LSMO/Pt films. Additionally, this bilayer system exhibits low magnetic Gilbert damping (0.002), small linewidth (12 Oe) and a large spin Hall angle ($\approx$ 3.2%) at 170K. By fine-tuning the LSMO/Pt interface quality and integrating it into the device structure, the system exhibits a fourfold enhancement in signal output for LSMO/Pt devices compared to the Pt/Py system. Such robust device level performance can pave way for energy-efficient spintronic based devices.</description>

      <title>On the construction of explicit analytical driving forces for crack nucleation in the phase field approach to brittle fracture with application to Mohr-Coulomb and Drucker-Prager strength surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A series of recent papers have modified the classical variational phase-field fracture models to successfully predict both the nucleation and propagation of cracks in brittle fracture under general loading conditions. This is done through the introduction of a consistent crack nucleation driving force in the phase field governing equations, which results in the model being able to capture both the strength surface and fracture toughness of the material. This driving force has been presented in the literature for the case of Drucker-Prager strength surface and specific choice of stress states on the strength surface that are captured exactly for finite values of the phase field regularization length parameter $\varepsilon$. Here we present an explicit analytical expression for this driving force given a general material strength surface when the functional form of the strength locus is linear in the material parameter coefficients. In the limit $\varepsilon \to 0$, the formulation reproduces the exact material strength surface and for finite $\varepsilon$ the strength surface is captured at any n 'distinct' points on the strength surface where n is the minimum number of material coefficients required to describe it. The presentation of the driving force in the current work facilitates the easy demonstration of its consistent nature. Further, in the equation governing crack nucleation, the toughness in the classical models is shown to be replaced by an effective toughness in the modified theory, that is dependent on the stress. The derived analytical expressions are verified via application to the widely employed Mohr-Coulomb and Drucker-Prager strength surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17232v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent research interests in the non-relativistic spin splitting of electronic band structures have led to the exploration of altermagnets and other compensated magnets. Here, we show that various types of non-relativistic spin splitting can be robustly induced by constructing Van der Waals heterostructures consisting of materials with intra-plane anti-ferromagnetic orders and suitable substrates. Using MnPX$_3$ (X = S or Se) as an example, which has a N\'eel magnetic order, we demonstrate that altermagnetic spin splitting can arise in the AA-stacking MnPX$_3$/MPX$_3$ (M = Cd, Mg, or Zn) heterostructures. For the AB-stacking heterostructures that are semiconducting, ferrimagnetic-type spin splitting emerges, and the fully compensated magnetization is protected by the Luttinger theorem. By combining with a Van der Waals ferroelectric substrate like CuInP$_2$S$_6$, MnPX$_3$-based heterostructures can show tunable spin splitting and spin-related properties that depend on the electronic band structures and ferroelectric polarization, which can be non-volatilely reversed by applying an out-of-plane electric field. Our study provides a route to induce tunable non-relativistic spin splitting in experimentally synthesizable two-dimensional magnets.</description>

Abstract: Predictive simulation of surface chemistry is of paramount importance for progress in fields from catalysis to electrochemistry and clean energy generation. Ab-initio quantum many-body methods should be offering deep insights into these systems at the electronic level, but are limited in their efficacy by their steep computational cost. In this work, we build upon state-of-the-art correlated wavefunctions to reliably converge to the `gold standard' accuracy in quantum chemistry for application to extended surface chemistry. Efficiently harnessing graphics processing unit acceleration along with systematically improvable multiscale resolution techniques, we achieve linear computational scaling up to 392 atoms in size. These large-scale simulations demonstrate the importance of converging to these extended system sizes, achieving a validating handshake between simulations with different boundary conditions for the interaction of water on a graphene surface. We provide a new benchmark for this water-graphene interaction that clarifies the preference for water orientations at the graphene interface. This is extended to the adsorption of carbonaceous molecules on chemically complex surfaces, including metal oxides and metal-organic frameworks, where we consistently achieve chemical accuracy compared to experimental references, and well inside the scatter of traditional density functional material modeling approaches. This pushes the state of the art for simulation of molecular adsorption on surfaces, and marks progress into a post-density functional era for more reliable and improvable approaches to first-principles modeling of surface problems at an unprecedented scale and accuracy using ab-initio quantum many-body methods.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an Ultra-Stable Antiferromagnetic Two-Dimensional CrF3 Phase with Anisotropic Quasi-1D Mechanical, Electronic, and Thermal Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an ultra-stable antiferromagnetic two-dimensional (2D) CrF3 phase that is energetically more favorable than the traditionally assumed hexagonal structure. Using first-principles calculations and evolutionary structure searches, we identify a new low-energy rectangular configuration of CrF3 with remarkable anisotropic properties. Mechanically, this phase exhibits zero in-plane Poisson's ratio, a rare negative out-of-plane Poisson's ratio, and quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) behavior characterized by minimal coupling between orthogonal directions. Electronically, CrF3 shows quasi-1D transport with two independent conduction bands near the Fermi level, tunable via uniaxial strain. The calculated bandgap is 3.05 eV, which can be modulated under strain, enabling control over its electronic properties. The material also displays out-of-plane antiferromagnetic ordering with a magnetic anisotropy energy of 0.098 meV per Cr atom and an estimated Neel temperature of 20 K. Additionally, we investigate the thermal conductivity of monolayer rectangular CrF3 (r-CrF3), revealing significant anisotropy in heat transport. The thermal conductivity along the y-axis is approximately 60.5 W/mK at 300 K, much higher than along the x-axis at 13.2 W/mK. The thermal anisotropic factor is 4.58, surpassing that of other 2D materials like black phosphorene, WTe2, and arsenene, highlighting r-CrF3's potential for advanced directional heat management. Consequently, the rectangular CrF3 phase is a promising candidate for applications in spintronics, strain-engineered nanoelectronics, mechanical metamaterials, and thermal management technologies.</description>

      <title>The balance between paraelectricity and ferroelectricity in non-chiral smectic homologs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-chiral liquid crystals (LCs) exhibiting ferroelectricity, distinguished by their dynamic responsiveness to external stimuli and high spontaneous polarization, provide renewed impetus for research into this area of soft matter and open novel application possibilities. Consequently, identifying structural elements within LC compounds that promote ferroelectricity in non-chiral systems is of critical importance. In this work, two homologs of rod-like compounds, with phenyl and ester groups in the rigid core substituted by fluorine atoms, differing by a single methylene unit, were synthesized and comprehensively analyzed using complementary experimental techniques and quantum-mechanical modeling. This systematic study presents the first documented instance in which such a minimal structural modification markedly influences the polarity of smectic phases in two homologs, without substantially altering phase transition temperatures, particularly the sequence and temperature ranges of smectic and nematic phases. Additionally, findings reveal that the longer homolog, which exhibits paraelectric phases, demonstrates a pronounced capacity to maintain ferroelectric phases in mixtures. These results provide new insights into the critical structure-property relationships between molecular architecture and ferroelectric characteristics in LCs, facilitating the targeted design of non-chiral compounds with polar phases. Moreover, the properties of the studied mixtures underscore the potential to develop multicomponent LC mixtures with stable ferroelectric properties in a broad temperature range, a feature of considerable significance for practical applications.</description>

Abstract: The wear resistance of magnesium and its alloys is very poor due to their inherent low hardness and poor tribological properties. Improving the wear resistance of magnesium and its alloys plays a significant role in expanding their application range. Various surface treatments have been used to produce protective coatings or layers for solving this problem. In this work, the Mg(OH)$_2$ layer with a thickness about 25 microns was directly formed on AZ91 magnesium alloy by oxidizing in superheated water vapor. SEM and XRD were employed to characterize the microstructure and phase composition of oxidized layer. The effect of oxidized layer on the friction and wear properties of magnesium alloy against the bearing steel ball were evaluated by using a reciprocating friction and wear test apparatus. The results showed that layer exhibited low friction coefficients and extremely small wear loss compared to the untreated substrate.
  Keywords: Magnesium alloy; Mg(OH)$_2$ layer; superheated water vapor; wear resistance.</description>

      <title>First-principles Spin and Optical Properties of Vacancy Clusters in Lithium Fluoride</title>

Abstract: Vacancy-cluster color centers in lithium fluoride have been studied in detail both theoretically and experimentally for over a century, giving rise to various applications in solid-state lasers, broadband photonic devices, and radiation dosimeters. These color centers are also attractive candidate platforms for applications in quantum information science, due to their spin properties and strong coupling to the crystal lattice, which allows their properties to be easily tuned. Here we present hybrid functional calculations of common vacancy defects in lithium fluoride, including their energetic, spin, and optical properties. We show that for a wide range of hybrid functional parameters tuned to match the experimental band gap, certain defects have little variation in their predicted optical properties. We further demonstrate that the parameters needed to satisfy the generalized Koopman's theorem and correctly position defect levels within the gap, can vary dramatically, even for different charge states of the same defect. Our work establishes the accuracy of the computationally lightweight hybrid-functional approach for predicting the optical and energetic properties of color centers in polar materials.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Dirac Quantum Spin Liquid in YbZn2GaO5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.20040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of a quantum spin liquid (QSL), a state of matter that can result when electron spins are highly correlated but do not become ordered, has been the subject of a considerable body of research in condensed matter physics. Spin liquid states have been proposed as hosts for high-temperature superconductivity and can host topological properties with potential applications in quantum information science. The excitations of most quantum spin liquids are not conventional spin waves but rather quasiparticles known as spinons, whose existence is well established experimentally only in one-dimensional systems; the unambiguous experimental realization of QSL behavior in higher dimensions remains challenging. Here, we investigate the novel compound YbZn2GaO5, which hosts an ideal triangular lattice of effective spin-1/2 moments with no detectable inherent chemical disorder. Thermodynamic and inelastic neutron scattering measurements performed on high-quality single crystal samples of YbZn2GaO5 exclude the possibility of long-range magnetic ordering down to 0.06 K, demonstrate a quadratic power law for the specific heat and reveal a continuum of magnetic excitations in parts of the Brillouin zone. Both low-temperature thermodynamics and inelastic neutron scattering spectra suggest that YbZn2GaO5 is a U(1) Dirac QSL with spinon excitations concentrated at certain points in the Brillouin zone. We advanced these results by performing additional specific heat measurements under finite fields, further confirming the theoretical expectations for a Dirac QSL on the triangular lattice of YbZn2GaO5.</description>

      <title>Direct Visualization of a Disorder Driven Electronic Smectic Phase in Dirac Nodal Line Semimetal GdSbTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18893v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic liquid crystal (ELC) phases are spontaneous symmetry breaking states believed to arise from strong electron correlation in quantum materials such as cuprates and iron pnictides. Here, we report a direct observation of a smectic phase in a weakly correlated Dirac nodal line (DNL) semimetal GdSbxTe2-x. Incommensurate smectic charge modulation and intense local unidirectional nanostructure are visualized by using spectroscopic imaging - scanning tunneling microscopy. As topological materials with symmetry protected Dirac or Weyl fermions are mostly weakly correlated, the discovery of such an ELC phase are anomalous and raise questions on the origin of their emergence. Specifically, we demonstrate how chemical substitution generates these symmetry breaking phases before the system undergoes a charge density wave (CDW) - orthorhombic structural transition. Our results highlight the importance of impurities in realizing ELC phases and present a new material platform for exploring the interplay among quenched disorder, topology and electron correlation.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous Response and Quantum Geometry of Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07052v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the time-dependent Quantum Geometric Tensor (tQGT) as a comprehensive tool for capturing the geometric character of insulators observable within linear response. We show that tQGT describes the zero-point motion of bound electrons and acts as a generating function for generalized sum rules of electronic conductivity. It therefore enables a systematic framework for computing the instantaneous response of insulators, including optical mass, orbital angular momentum, and dielectric constant. This construction guarantees a consistent approximation across these quantities upon restricting the number of occupied and unoccupied states in a low-energy description of an infinite quantum system. We outline how quantum geometry can be generated in periodic systems by lattice interference and examine spectral weight transfer from small frequencies to high frequencies by creating geometrically frustrated flat bands.</description>

      <title>Spinless topological chirality from Umklapp scattering in twisted 3D structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spinless systems exhibit unique topological characteristics compared to spinful ones, stemming from their distinct algebra. Without chiral interactions typically linked to spin, an intriguing yet unexplored interplay between topological and structural chirality may be anticipated. Here we discover spinless topological chiralities solely from structural chiralities that lie in the 3D spatial patterning of structureless units, exemplified using two types of twisted graphite systems. In a 3D screw twisted structure without periodicity in all directions, we find a chiral Weyl semimetal phase where bulk topology and chiral surface states are both determined by the screw direction. And in a 3D periodic structure formed with layer-alternating twist angle signs, a higher-order Dirac semimetal with chiral hinge states is discovered. Underlying these novel topological states is the intervalley Umklapp scattering that captures the chirality of the twisted interfaces, leading effectively to a sign-flipped chiral interlayer hopping, thereby introducing $\pi$-flux Z2 lattice gauge field that alters the symmetry algebra. Our findings point to a new pathway for engineering topological chirality through patterning twisted arrays of featureless units, which can expand the design principles for topological photonics and acoustics.</description>

      <title>Electrically pumped h-BN single-photon emission in van der Waals heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic defects in solids offer a versatile basis to study and realize quantum phenomena and information science in various integrated systems. All-electrical pumping of single defects to create quantum light emission has been realized in several platforms including color centers in diamond and silicon carbide, which could lead to the circuit network of electrically triggered single-photon sources. However, a wide conduction channel which reduces the carrier injection per defect site has been a major obstacle. Here, we realize a device concept to construct electrically pumped single-photon emission using a van der Waals stacked structure with atomic plane precision. Defect-induced tunneling currents across graphene and NbSe2 electrodes sandwiching an atomically thin h-BN layer allow robust and persistent generation of non-classical light from h-BN. The collected emission photon energies range between 1.4 and 2.9 eV, revealing the electrical excitation of a variety of atomic defects. By analyzing the dipole axis of observed emitters, we further confirm that emitters are crystallographic defect structures of h-BN crystal. Our work facilitates implementing efficient and miniaturized single-photon devices in van der Waals platforms toward applications in quantum optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Fast and scalable finite-element based approach for density functional theory calculations using projector-augmented wave method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a computationally efficient methodology that utilizes a local real-space formulation of the projector augmented wave (PAW) method discretized with a finite-element (FE) basis to enable accurate and large-scale electronic structure calculations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-space approach for DFT calculations, combining the efficiency of PAW formalism involving smooth electronic fields with the ability of systematically improvable higher-order finite-element basis to achieve significant computational gains. In particular, we have developed efficient strategies for solving the underlying FE discretized PAW generalized eigenproblem by employing the Chebyshev filtered subspace iteration approach to compute the desired eigenspace in each self-consistent field iteration. These strategies leverage the low-rank perturbation of the FE basis overlap matrix in conjunction with reduced order quadrature rules to invert the discretized PAW overlap matrix while also exploiting the sparsity of both the local and non-local parts of the discretized PAW Hamiltonian and overlap matrices. Using the proposed approach, we benchmark the accuracy and performance on various representative examples involving periodic and non-periodic systems with plane-wave-based PAW implementations. Furthermore, we also demonstrate a considerable computational advantage ($\sim$ 5$\times$ -- 10$\times$) over state-of-the-art plane-wave methods for medium to large-scale systems ($\sim$ 6,000 -- 35,000 electrons). Finally, we show that our approach (PAW-FE) significantly reduces the degrees of freedom to achieve the desired accuracy, thereby enabling large-scale DFT simulations ($&gt;$ 50,000 electrons) at an order of magnitude lower computational cost compared to norm-conserving pseudopotential calculations using finite-element discretized calculations.</description>

      <title>Itinerant Ferromagnetism from One-Dimensional Mobility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a universal kinetic mechanism for a half-metallic ferromagnet -- a metallic state with full spin polarization -- arising from strong on-site Coulomb repulsions between particles that exhibit constrained one-dimensional (1D) dynamics. We illustrate the mechanism in the context of a solvable model on a Lieb lattice in which doped electrons have 1D mobility. Such 1D motion is shown to induce only multi-spin ring exchanges of even parity, which mediate ferromagnetism and result in a unique half-metallic ground state. In contrast to the Nagaoka mechanism of ferromagnetism, this result pertains to any doped electron density in the {\it thermodynamic} limit. We explore various microscopic routes to such (approximate) 1D dynamics, highlighting two examples: doped holes in the strong-coupling limit of the Emery model and vacancies in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. Finally, we demonstrate an intriguing exact equivalence between the bosonic and fermionic versions of these models, which implies a novel mechanism for the conjectured Bose metallic phase.</description>

      <title>Heavy Hole vs. Light Hole Spin Qubits: A Strain-Driven Study of SiGe/Ge and GeSn/Ge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16734v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates and compares the impact of strain on heavy hole (HH) spin qubits in SiGe/Ge and light hole (LH) spin qubits in GeSn/Ge heterostructures, focusing on energy states, g-factor, Rabi frequency, spin relaxation, and dephasing times. By exploring the distinct properties of HH and LH spin qubits under strain, we demonstrate how strain serves as a tunable parameter to optimize qubit performance. The study highlights that LH spin qubits in Ge quantum dots exhibit lower relaxation rates and higher Rabi frequencies, offering significant advantages for addressing current challenges in gate-defined spin qubits. A significant difference is observed in the g-factor anisotropy, where for HHs the out-of-plane g-factor is larger than the in-plane g-factor, whereas for LHs, the in-plane g-factor dominates both in GeSn/Ge and SiGe/Ge quantum dots. This comparative analysis provides a deeper understanding of HH and LH spin dynamics, advancing the development of scalable quantum technologies based on strained Ge systems.</description>

      <title>PyAtoms: An interactive tool for rapidly simulating atomic scanning tunneling microscopy images of 2D materials, moir\'e systems and superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present PyAtoms, an interactive open-source software that quickly and easily simulates atomic-scale scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials, moir\'{e} systems, and superlattices. Rooted in a Fourier-space description of ideal atomic lattice images, PyAtoms is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) with robust capabilities for tuning lattice parameters (lattice constants, strain, number of layers, twist angles) and STM imaging parameters (pixels, scan size, scan angle) and provides time estimates for spectroscopic measurements. These capabilities allow users to efficiently plan time-consuming STM experiments. We provide an overview of PyAtoms' current features, describe its underlying mathematical principles, and then demonstrate simulations of several 2D materials including graphene with variable sub-lattice asymmetry, twisted tri-layer graphene moir\'{e} systems, and charge- and bond-density wave systems (2$H$-NbSe$_2$, 1$T$-TaS$_2$, Kekul\'{e}-distorted graphene, K$_{0.3}$MoO$_3$). Finally, we show that PyAtoms can be used as a useful educational tool in entry- and senior-level physics courses.</description>
