      <title>A Harris theorem for enhanced dissipation, and an example of Pierrehumbert</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many situations, the combined effect of advection and diffusion greatly increases the rate of convergence to equilibrium -- a phenomenon known as enhanced dissipation. Here we study the situation where the advecting velocity field generates a random dynamical system satisfying certain Harris conditions. If $\kappa$ denotes the strength of the diffusion, then we show that with probability at least $1 - o(\kappa^N)$ enhanced dissipation occurs on time scales of order $|\ln \kappa|$, a bound which is known to be optimal. Moreover, on long time scales, we show that the rate of convergence to equilibrium is almost surely independent of diffusivity. As a consequence we obtain enhanced dissipation for the randomly shifted alternating shears introduced by Pierrehumbert '94.</description>

      <title>Billiards in polyhedra: a method to convert 2-dimensional uniformity to 3-dimensional uniformity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The class of 2-dimensional non-integrable flat dynamical systems has a rather extensive literature with many deep results, but the methods developed for this type of problems, both the traditional approach via Teichm\"{u}ller geometry and our recent shortline-ancestor method, appear to be exclusively plane-specific. Thus we know very little of any real significance concerning 3-dimensional systems.
  Our purpose here is to describe some very limited extensions of uniformity in 2 dimensions to uniformity in 3 dimensions. We consider a 3-manifold which is the cartesian product of the regular octagonal surface with the unit torus. This is a restricted system, in the sense that one of the directions is integrable. However, this restriction also allows us to make use of a transference theorem for arithmetic progressions established earlier by Beck, Donders and Yang.</description>

      <title>Uniformity of geodesic flow in non-integrable 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Almost nothing is known concerning the extension of $3$-dimensional Kronecker--Weyl equidistribution theorem on geodesic flow from the unit torus $[0,1)^3$ to non-integrable finite polycube translation $3$-manifolds.
  In the special case when a finite polycube translation $3$-manifold is the cartesian product of a finite polysquare translation surface with the unit torus $[0,1)$, we have developed a splitting method with which we can make some progress. This is a somewhat restricted system, in the sense that one of the directions is integrable.
  We then combine this with a split-covering argument to extend our results to some other finite polycube translation $3$-manifolds which satisfy a rather special condition and where none of the $3$ directions is integrable.</description>

      <title>Efficacy of the Sterile Insect Technique in the presence of inaccessible areas: A study using two-patch models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is one of the sustainable strategies for the control of disease vectors, which consists of releasing sterilized males that will mate with the wild females, resulting in a reduction and, eventually a local elimination, of the wild population. The implementation of the SIT in the field can become problematic when there are inaccessible areas where the release of sterile insects cannot be carried out directly, and the migration of wild insects from these areas to the treated zone may influence the efficacy of this technique. However, we can also take advantage of the movement of sterile individuals to control the wild population in these unreachable places. In this paper, we derive a two-patch model for Aedes mosquitoes where we consider the discrete diffusion between the treated area and the inaccessible zone. We investigate two different release strategies (constant and impulsive periodic releases), and by using the monotonicity of the model, we show that if the number of released sterile males exceeds some threshold, the technique succeeds in driving the whole population in both areas to extinction. This threshold depends on not only the biological parameters of the population but also the diffusion between the two patches.</description>

      <title>Divisibility of Integer Laurent Polynomials, Homoclinic Points, and Lacunary Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f$, $p$, and $q$ be Laurent polynomials with integer coefficients in one or several variables, and suppose that $f$ divides $p+q$. We establish sufficient conditions to guarantee that $f$ individually divides $p$ and $q$. These conditions involve a bound on coefficients, a separation between the supports of $p$ and $q$, and, surprisingly, a requirement on the complex variety of $f$ called atorality satisfied by many but not all polynomials.
  Our proof involves a related dynamical system and the fundamental dynamical notion of homoclinic point. Without the atorality assumption our methods fail, and it is unknown whether our results hold without this assumption.</description>

      <title>Horn maps of semi-parabolic H\'enon maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that horn maps associated to quadratic semi-parabolic fixed points of H\'enon maps, first introduced by Bedford, Smillie, and Ueda, satisfy a weak form of the Ahlfors island property. As a consequence, two natural definitions of their Julia set (the non-normality locus of the family of iterates and the closure of the set of the repelling periodic points) coincide. As another consequence, we also prove that there exist small perturbations of semi-parabolic H\'enon maps for which the Hausdorff dimension of the forward Julia set $J^+$ is arbitrarily close to 4.</description>

      <title>Designing Poisson Integrators Through Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a general method to construct Poisson integrators, i.e., integrators that preserve the underlying Poisson geometry. We assume the Poisson manifold is integrable, meaning there is a known local symplectic groupoid for which the Poisson manifold serves as the set of units. Our constructions build upon the correspondence between Poisson diffeomorphisms and Lagrangian bisections, which allows us to reformulate the design of Poisson integrators as solutions to a certain PDE (Hamilton-Jacobi). The main novelty of this work is to understand the Hamilton-Jacobi PDE as an optimization problem, whose solution can be easily approximated using machine learning related techniques. This research direction aligns with the current trend in the PDE and machine learning communities, as initiated by Physics- Informed Neural Networks, advocating for designs that combine both physical modeling (the Hamilton-Jacobi PDE) and data.</description>

Abstract: We prove that every locally compact second countable group $G$ arises as the outer automorphism group Out $M$ of a II$_1$ factor, which was so far only known for totally disconnected groups, compact groups and a few isolated examples. We obtain this result by proving that every locally compact second countable group is a centralizer group, a class of Polish groups that may all be realized as Out $M$ and for which we prove several basic properties and characterizations.</description>

Abstract: We compare the dimension of a non-invertible self-affine set to the dimension of the respective invertible self-affine set. In particular, for generic planar self-affine sets, we show that the dimensions coincide when they are large and differ when they are small. Our study relies on thermodynamical formalism where, for dominated and irreducible matrices, we completely characterize the behavior of the pressures.</description>

      <title>Predicting the emergence of localised dihedral patterns in models for dryland vegetation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Localised patterns are often observed in models for dryland vegetation, both as peaks of vegetation in a desert state and as gaps within a vegetated state, known as `fairy circles'. Recent results from radial spatial dynamics show that approximations of localised patterns with dihedral symmetry emerge from a Turing instability in general reaction--diffusion systems, which we apply to several vegetation models. We present a systematic guide for finding such patterns in a given reaction--diffusion model, during which we obtain four key quantities that allow us to predict the qualitative properties of our solutions with minimal analysis. We consider four well-established vegetation models and compute their key predictive quantities, observing that models which possess similar values exhibit qualitatively similar localised patterns; we then complement our results with numerical simulations of various localised states in each model. Here, localised vegetation patches emerge generically from Turing instabilities and act as transient states between uniform and patterned environments, displaying complex dynamics as they evolve over time.</description>

Abstract: Let $f$ be an orientation-preserving homeomorphism of the 2-disc $\mathbb{D}^2$ that fixes the boundary pointwise and leaves invariant a finite subset in the interior of $\mathbb{D}^2$. We study the strong Nielsen equivalence of periodic points of such homeomorphisms $f$ and we give a necessary and sufficient condition for two periodic points to be strong Nielsen equivalent in the context of braid theory. In addition, we present an application of our result to the trace formula given by Jiang--Zheng, deducing that the obtained forced periodic orbits belong to different strong Nielsen classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we investigate a fractional stochastic neutral differential equation with time delay, which includes both deterministic and stochastic components. Our primary objective is to rigorously prove the existence of a unique solution that satisfies given initial conditions. Furthermore, we extend our research to investigate the finite-time stability of the system by examining trajectory behavior over a given period. We employ advanced mathematical approaches to systematically prove finite-time stability, providing insights into convergence and stability within the stated interval. Using illustrative examples, we strengthen this all-encompassing examination of the complicated dynamics and stability features of fractionally ordered stochastic systems with time delays.</description>

      <title>A new form of asymptotic expansion for non-smooth differential equations with time-decaying forcing functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article is focused on the asymptotic expansions, as time tends to infinity, of decaying solutions of a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The nonlinear terms in the system may not be smooth in a small neighborhood of the origin. The forcing function decays to zero in a very complicated but coherent way. We prove that, under suitable conditions on the forcing function, every decaying solution admits the same asymptotic expansion of a new type. This expansion contains a new variable that allows it to be established in a closed-form, but does not affect the meaning and precision of the expansion. The new variable is introduced to overcome the unsuitability of certain terms resulted from the scaling and shifting method, which is used to deal with the lack of smoothness of the nonlinear terms, and the general form of the forcing function. Moreover, the expansion is constructed explicitly with the use of the complexification method.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Safe Formation Control for Coupled Multi-Agent Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The safe control of multi-robot swarms is a challenging and active field of research, where common goals include maintaining group cohesion while simultaneously avoiding obstacles and inter-agent collision. Building off our previously developed theory for distributed collaborative safety-critical control for networked dynamic systems, we propose a distributed algorithm for the formation control of robot swarms given individual agent dynamics, induced formation dynamics, and local neighborhood position and velocity information within a defined sensing radius for each agent. Individual safety guarantees for each agent are obtained using rounds of communication between neighbors to restrict unsafe control actions among cooperating agents through safety conditions derived from high-order control barrier functions. We provide conditions under which a swarm is guaranteed to achieve collective safety with respect to multiple obstacles using a modified collaborative safety algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of our distributed algorithm via simulation in a simplified physics-based environment.</description>

      <title>Energy-consistent integration of mechanical systems based on Livens principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we make use of Livens principle (sometimes also referred to as Hamilton-Pontryagin principle) in order to obtain a novel structure-preserving integrator for mechanical systems. In contrast to the canonical Hamiltonian equations of motion, the Euler-Lagrange equations pertaining to Livens principle circumvent the need to invert the mass matrix. This is an essential advantage with respect to singular mass matrices, which can yield severe difficulties for the modelling and simulation of multibody systems. Moreover, Livens principle unifies both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian viewpoints on mechanics. Additionally, the present framework avoids the need to set up the system's Hamiltonian. The novel scheme algorithmically conserves a general energy function and aims at the preservation of momentum maps corresponding to symmetries of the system. We present an extension to mechanical systems subject to holonomic constraints. The performance of the newly devised method is studied in representative examples.</description>
