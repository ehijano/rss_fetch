      <title>Separable Drawings: Extendability and Crossing-Free Hamiltonian Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing pseudospherical drawings, we introduce a new class of simple drawings, which we call separable drawings. In a separable drawing, every edge can be closed to a simple curve that intersects each other edge at most once. Curves of different edges might interact arbitrarily. Most notably, we show that (1) every separable drawing of any graph on $n$ vertices in the plane can be extended to a simple drawing of the complete graph $K_{n}$, (2) every separable drawing of $K_{n}$ contains a crossing-free Hamiltonian cycle and is plane Hamiltonian connected, and (3) every generalized convex drawing and every 2-page book drawing is separable. Further, the class of separable drawings is a proper superclass of the union of generalized convex and 2-page book drawings. Hence, our results on plane Hamiltonicity extend recent work on generalized convex drawings by Bergold et al. (SoCG 2024).</description>

      <title>Efficient computations of discrete cubical homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fast algorithm for computing discrete cubical homology of graphs over a field of characteristic zero. This algorithm improves on several computational steps compared to constructions in the existing literature, with the key insights including: a faster way to generate all singular cubes, reducing the dimensions of vector spaces in the chain complex by taking a quotient over automorphisms of the cube, and preprocessing graphs using the axiomatic treatment of discrete cubical homology.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Cooling Center Coverage Using Persistent Homology of a Filtered Witness Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In light of the increase in frequency of extreme heat events, there is a critical need to develop tools to identify geographic locations that are at risk of heat-related mortality. This paper aims to identify locations by assessing holes in cooling-center coverage using persistent homology, a method from topological data analysis. Methods involving persistent homology have shown promising results in identifying holes in coverage of specific resources. We adapt these methods using a witness complex construction to study the coverage of cooling centers. One standard technique for studying the risk of heat-related mortality for a geographic area is a heat vulnerability index (HVIs) based on demographic information. We test our topological approach and an HVI on four locations (central Boston, MA; central Austin, TX; Portland, OR; and Miami, FL) and use death times of connected components and cycles to identify most at risk regions. PH and HVI identify different locations as vulnerable, thus showing measures of coverage need to extend beyond a simple statistic. Using persistent homology along side the HVI score identifies a complementary set of regions at risk, thus the combination of the two provide a more holistic understanding of coverage.</description>

      <title>Invariants of almost embeddings of graphs in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this survey we motivate studies of the invariants from the title. A graph drawing in the plane is called an almost embedding if the images of any two non-adjacent simplices (i.e. vertices or edges) are disjoint. We introduce integer invariants of almost embeddings: winding number, cyclic and triodic Wu numbers. We prove some relations between the invariants. We demonstrate connection of these relations to homology of the deleted product of a graph. We construct almost embeddings realizing some values of these invariants.
  This paper is accessible to mathematicians not specialized in the area (and to students). All the necessary definitions are recalled. We present some ideas of algebraic and geometric topology in a language accessible to non-topologists. However elementary, this paper is motivated by frontline of research; there are some conjectures and an open problem.</description>

      <title>Embeddings of $k$-complexes in $2k$-manifolds and minimum rank of partial symmetric matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.06636v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a $k$-dimensional simplicial complex having $n$ faces of dimension $k$, and $M$ a closed $(k-1)$-connected PL $2k$-dimensional manifold. We prove that for $k\ge3$ odd $K$ embeds into $M$ if and only if there are
  $\bullet$ a skew-symmetric $n\times n$-matrix $A$ with $\mathbb Z$-entries whose rank over $\mathbb Q$ does not exceed $rk H_k(M;\mathbb Z)$,
  $\bullet$ a general position PL map $f:K\to\mathbb R^{2k}$, and
  $\bullet$ orientations on $k$-faces of $K$ such that for any nonadjacent $k$-faces $\sigma,\tau$ of $K$ the element $A_{\sigma,\tau}$ equals to the algebraic intersection of $f\sigma$ and $f\tau$.
  We prove some analogues of this result including those for $\mathbb Z_2$- and $\mathbb Z$-embeddability. Our results generalize the Bikeev-Fulek-Kyn\v cl criteria for the $\mathbb Z_2$- and $\mathbb Z$-embeddability of graphs to surfaces, and are related to the Harris-Krushkal-Johnson-Pat\'ak-Tancer criteria for the embeddability of $k$-complexes into $2k$-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Order-2 Delaunay Triangulations Optimize Angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18238v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The local angle property of the (order-$1$) Delaunay triangulations of a generic set in $\mathbb{R}^2$ asserts that the sum of two angles opposite a common edge is less than $\pi$. This paper extends this property to higher order and uses it to generalize two classic properties from order-$1$ to order-$2$: (1) among the complete level-$2$ hypertriangulations of a generic point set in $\mathbb{R}^2$, the order-$2$ Delaunay triangulation lexicographically maximizes the sorted angle vector; (2) among the maximal level-$2$ hypertriangulations of a generic point set in $\mathbb{R}^2$, the order-$2$ Delaunay triangulation is the only one that has the local angle property. We also use our method of establishing (2) to give a new short proof of the angle vector optimality for the (order-1) Delaunay triangulation. For order-$1$, both properties have been instrumental in numerous applications of Delaunay triangulations, and we expect that their generalization will make order-$2$ Delaunay triangulations more attractive to applications as well.</description>

      <title>Bounding the Treewidth of Outer $k$-Planar Graphs via Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04264v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The treewidth is a structural parameter that measures the tree-likeness of a graph. Many algorithmic and combinatorial results are expressed in terms of the treewidth. In this paper, we study the treewidth of outer $k$-planar graphs, that is, graphs that admit a straight-line drawing where all the vertices lie on a circle, and every edge is crossed by at most $k$ other edges.
  Wood and Telle [New York J. Math., 2007] showed that every outer $k$-planar graph has treewidth at most $3k + 11$ using so-called planar decompositions, and later, Auer et al. [Algorithmica, 2016] proved that the treewidth of outer $1$-planar graphs is at most $3$, which is tight.
  In this paper, we improve the general upper bound to $1.5k + 2$ and give a tight bound of $4$ for $k = 2$. We also establish a lower bound: we show that, for every even $k$, there is an outer $k$-planar graph with treewidth $k+2$. Our new bound immediately implies a better bound on the cop number, which answers an open question of Durocher et al. [GD 2023] in the affirmative.
  Our treewidth bound relies on a new and simple triangulation method for outer $k$-planar graphs that yields few crossings with graph edges per edge of the triangulation. Our method also enables us to obtain a tight upper bound of $k + 2$ for the separation number of outer $k$-planar graphs, improving an upper bound of $2k + 3$ by Chaplick et al. [GD 2017]. We also consider outer min-$k$-planar graphs, a generalization of outer $k$-planar graphs, where we achieve smaller improvements.</description>
