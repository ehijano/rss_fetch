      <title>COMNETS: COst-sensitive decision trees approach to throughput optimization for Multi-radio IoT NETworkS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesoscale IoT applications, such as P2P energy trade and real-time industrial control systems, demand high throughput and low latency, with a secondary emphasis on energy efficiency as they rely on grid power or large-capacity batteries. MARS, a multi-radio architecture, leverages ML to instantaneously select the optimal radio for transmission, outperforming the single-radio systems. However, MARS encounters a significant issue with cost sensitivity, where high-cost errors account for 40% throughput loss. Current cost-sensitive ML algorithms assign a misclassification cost for each class but not for each data sample. In MARS, each data sample has different costs, making it tedious to employ existing cost-sensitive ML algorithms. First, we address this issue by developing COMNETS, an ML-based radio selector using oblique trees optimized by Tree Alternating Optimization (TAO). TAO incorporates sample-specific misclassification costs to avert high-cost errors and achieves a 50% reduction in the decision tree size, making it more suitable for resource-constrained IoT devices. Second, we prove the stability property of TAO and leverage it to understand the critical factors affecting the radio-selection problem. Finally, our real-world evaluation of COMNETS at two different locations shows an average throughput gain of 20.83%, 17.39% than MARS.</description>

      <title>InfinitePOD: Building Datacenter-Scale High-Bandwidth Domain for LLM with Optical Circuit Switching Transceivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling Large Language Model (LLM) training relies on multi-dimensional parallelism, where High-Bandwidth Domains (HBDs) are critical for communication-intensive parallelism like Tensor Parallelism (TP) and Expert Parallelism (EP). However, existing HBD architectures face fundamental limitations in scalability, cost, and fault resiliency: switch-centric HBDs (e.g., NVL-72) incur prohibitive scaling costs, while GPU-centric HBDs (e.g., TPUv3/Dojo) suffer from severe fault propagation. Switch-GPU hybrid HBDs such as TPUv4 takes a middle-ground approach by leveraging Optical Circuit Switches, but the fault explosion radius remains large at the cube level (e.g., 64 TPUs).
  We propose InfinitePOD, a novel transceiver-centric HBD architecture that unifies connectivity and dynamic switching at the transceiver level using Optical Circuit Switching (OCS). By embedding OCS within each transceiver, InfinitePOD achieves reconfigurable point-to-multipoint connectivity, allowing the topology to adapt into variable-size rings. This design provides: i) datacenter-wide scalability without cost explosion; ii) fault resilience by isolating failures to a single node, and iii) full bandwidth utilization for fault-free GPUs. Key innovations include a Silicon Photonic (SiPh) based low-cost OCS transceiver (OCSTrx), a reconfigurable k-hop ring topology co-designed with intra-/inter-node communication, and an HBD-DCN orchestration algorithm maximizing GPU utilization while minimizing cross-ToR datacenter network traffic. The evaluation demonstrates that InfinitePOD achieves 31% of the cost of NVL-72, near-zero GPU waste ratio (over one order of magnitude lower than NVL-72 and TPUv4), near-zero cross-ToR traffic when node fault ratios under 7%, and improves Model FLOPs Utilization by 3.37x compared to NVIDIA DGX (8 GPUs per Node).</description>

      <title>A Slicing Model for Transport Networks with Traffic Burst Control and QoS Compliance for Traffic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network slicing has emerged as a key network technology, providing network operators with the means to offer virtual networks to vertical users over a single physical network infrastructure. Recent research has resulted mainly in techniques for managing and deploying network slices, but the implementation of network slices on a real physical transport network infrastructure has received much less attention. Standardization bodies, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), have provided some implementation recommendations. Still, there is a lack of mechanisms to implement network slices capable of handling traffic bursts while simultaneously meeting the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of the traffic flows associated with the slices. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-grained resource control mechanism to implement transport network slices that meet traffic QoS requirements while both accepting limited traffic bursts, and enabling efficient bandwidth sharing within and across slices. The mechanism is executed at the edge of the transport network. The proposed model aligns with current standards on network slicing and has been tested on an experimental platform. Using this platform, we have conducted an extensive experimental campaign that demonstrates that our proposal can effectively control traffic bursts generated within the network slices while maximizing bandwidth utilization across the network.</description>

      <title>Technical Report: Generating the WEB-IDS23 Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) require correctly labelled, representative and diverse datasets for an accurate evaluation and development. However, several widely used datasets do not include labels which are fine-grained enough and, together with small sample sizes, can lead to overfitting issues that also remain undetected when using test data. Additionally, the cybersecurity sector is evolving fast, and new attack mechanisms require the continuous creation of up-to-date datasets. To address these limitations, we developed a modular traffic generator that can simulate a wide variety of benign and malicious traffic. It incorporates multiple protocols, variability through randomization techniques and can produce attacks along corresponding benign traffic, as it occurs in real-world scenarios. Using the traffic generator, we create a dataset capturing over 12 million samples with 82 flow-level features and 21 fine-grained labels. Additionally, we include several web attack types which are often underrepresented in other datasets.</description>

      <title>Saflo: eBPF-Based MPTCP Scheduler for Mitigating Traffic Analysis Attacks in Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the $\underline{\textbf{saf}}$e sub$\underline{\textbf{flo}}$w (Saflo) eBPF-based multipath TCP (MPTCP) scheduler, designed to mitigate traffic analysis attacks in cellular networks. Traffic analysis attacks, which exploit vulnerabilities in Downlink Control Information (DCI) messages, remain a significant security threat in LTE/5G networks. To counter such threats, the Saflo scheduler employs multipath communication combined with additional security-related tasks. Specifically, it utilizes eBPF tools to operate in both kernel and user spaces. In the kernel space, the eBPF scheduler performs multipath scheduling while excluding paths disabled by the user-space programs. The user-space programs conduct security-related computations and machine learning-based attack detection, determining whether each path should be enabled or disabled. This approach offloads computationally intensive tasks to user-space programs, enabling timely multipath scheduling in kernel space. The Saflo scheduler was evaluated in a private LTE/5G testbed. The results demonstrated that it significantly reduces the accuracy of video identification and user identification attacks in cellular networks while maintaining reasonable network performance for users.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diagonal RIS: A New Frontier for 6G Internet of Things Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology has emerged as a promising enabler for next-generation wireless networks, offering a paradigm shift from passive environments to programmable radio wave propagation. Despite the potential of diagonal RIS (D-RIS), its limited wave manipulation capability restricts performance gains. In this paper, we investigate the burgeoning concept of beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS), which incorporates non-diagonal elements in its scattering matrix to deliver more fine-grained control of electromagnetic wavefronts. We begin by discussing the limitations of traditional D-RIS and introduce key BD-RIS architectures with different operating modes. We then highlight the features that make BD-RIS particularly advantageous for 6G IoT applications, including advanced beamforming, enhanced interference mitigation, and flexible coverage. A case study on BD-RIS-assisted vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication in an underlay cellular network demonstrates considerable improvements in spectral efficiency when compared to D-RIS and conventional systems. Lastly, we present current challenges such as hardware design complexity, channel estimation, and non-ideal hardware effects, and propose future research directions involving AI-driven optimization, joint communication and sensing, and physical layer security. Our findings illustrate the transformative potential of BD-RIS in shaping high-performance, scalable, and reliable 6G IoT networks.</description>

      <title>Safeguarding connected autonomous vehicle communication: Protocols, intra- and inter-vehicular attacks and defenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancements in autonomous driving technology, coupled with the growing interest from automotive manufacturers and tech companies, suggest a rising adoption of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) in the near future. Despite some evidence of higher accident rates in AVs, these incidents tend to result in less severe injuries compared to traditional vehicles due to cooperative safety measures. However, the increased complexity of CAV systems exposes them to significant security vulnerabilities, potentially compromising their performance and communication integrity. This paper contributes by presenting a detailed analysis of existing security frameworks and protocols, focusing on intra- and inter-vehicle communications. We systematically evaluate the effectiveness of these frameworks in addressing known vulnerabilities and propose a set of best practices for enhancing CAV communication security. The paper also provides a comprehensive taxonomy of attack vectors in CAV ecosystems and suggests future research directions for designing more robust security mechanisms. Our key contributions include the development of a new classification system for CAV security threats, the proposal of practical security protocols, and the introduction of use cases that demonstrate how these protocols can be integrated into real-world CAV applications. These insights are crucial for advancing secure CAV adoption and ensuring the safe integration of autonomous vehicles into intelligent transportation systems.</description>

      <title>Spatial Network Calculus: Toward Deterministic Wireless Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02556v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends the classical network calculus to spatial scenarios, focusing on wireless networks with heterogeneous traffic and varying transmit power levels. Building on spatial network calculus, a prior extension of network calculus to spatial settings, we propose a generalized framework by introducing spatial regulations for stationary marked point processes. The regulations correspond to two key constraints: the total transmit power within a spatial region and the cumulative received power at a receiver. Then we prove the equivalence of ball regulation and shot-noise regulation for stationary marked point processes and establish a universal lower bound on the performance of all network links under these constraints. This framework is applicable to diverse network scenarios, as demonstrated by the analysis of performance guarantees for networks with multi-class users. In addition, we propose an SINR-based power control scheme adapted to user traffic, which ensures differentiated quality of service (QoS) for different user classes. We derive deterministic performance guarantees for all links in complex and heterogeneous wireless networks.</description>
