      <title>Proof-Producing Translation of Functional Programs into a Time \&amp; Space Reasonable Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a semi-automated framework to construct and reason about programs in a deeply-embedded while-language. The while-language we consider is a simple computation model that can simulate (and be simulated by) Turing machines with a linear time and constant space blow-up. Our framework derives while-programs from functional programs written in a subset of Isabelle/HOL, namely tail-recursive functions with first-order arguments and algebraic datatypes. As far as we are aware, it is the first framework targeting a computation model that is reasonable in time and space from a complexity-theoretic perspective.</description>

      <title>Substructural Parametricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordered, linear, and other substructural type systems allow us to expose deep properties of programs at the syntactic level of types. In this paper, we develop a family of unary logical relations that allow us to prove consequences of parametricity for a range of substructural type systems. A key idea is to parameterize the relation by an algebra, which we exemplify with a monoid and commutative monoid to interpret ordered and linear type systems, respectively. We prove the fundamental theorem of logical relations and apply it to deduce extensional properties of inhabitants of certain types. Examples include demonstrating that the ordered types for list append and reversal are inhabited by exactly one function, as are types of some tree traversals. Similarly, the linear type of the identity function on lists is inhabited only by permutations of the input. Our most advanced example shows that the ordered type of the list fold function is inhabited only by the fold function.</description>

      <title>Diverse Controllable Diffusion Policy with Signal Temporal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating realistic simulations is critical for autonomous system applications such as self-driving and human-robot interactions. However, driving simulators nowadays still have difficulty in generating controllable, diverse, and rule-compliant behaviors for road participants: Rule-based models cannot produce diverse behaviors and require careful tuning, whereas learning-based methods imitate the policy from data but are not designed to follow the rules explicitly. Besides, the real-world datasets are by nature "single-outcome", making the learning method hard to generate diverse behaviors. In this paper, we leverage Signal Temporal Logic (STL) and Diffusion Models to learn controllable, diverse, and rule-aware policy. We first calibrate the STL on the real-world data, then generate diverse synthetic data using trajectory optimization, and finally learn the rectified diffusion policy on the augmented dataset. We test on the NuScenes dataset and our approach can achieve the most diverse rule-compliant trajectories compared to other baselines, with a runtime 1/17X to the second-best approach. In the closed-loop testing, our approach reaches the highest diversity, rule satisfaction rate, and the least collision rate. Our method can generate varied characteristics conditional on different STL parameters in testing. A case study on human-robot encounter scenarios shows our approach can generate diverse and closed-to-oracle trajectories. The annotation tool, augmented dataset, and code are available at https://github.com/mengyuest/pSTL-diffusion-policy.</description>

      <title>Zhuk's bridges, centralizers, and similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the second of three papers motivated by the author's desire to understand and explain "algebraically" one aspect of Dmitriy Zhuk's proof of the CSP Dichotomy Theorem. In this paper we extend Zhuk's "bridge" construction to arbitrary meet-irreducible congruences of finite algebras in locally finite varieties with a Taylor term. We then connect bridges to centrality and similarity. In particular, we prove that Zhuk's bridges and our "proper bridges" (defined in our first paper) convey the same information in locally finite Taylor varieties.</description>

      <title>A study for recovering the cut-elimination property in cyclic proof systems by restricting the arity of inductive predicates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.05791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The framework of cyclic proof systems provides a reasonable proof system for logics with inductive definitions. It also offers an effective automated proof search procedure for such logics without finding induction hypotheses. Recent researches have shown that the cut-elimination property, one of the most fundamental properties in proof theory, of cyclic proof systems for several logics does not hold. These results suggest that a naive proof search, which avoids the Cut rule, is not enough.
  This paper shows that the cut-elimination property still fails in a simple cyclic proof system even if we restrict languages to unary inductive predicates and unary functions, aiming to clarify why the cut-elimination property fails in the cyclic proof systems. The result in this paper is a sharper one than that of the first authors' previous result, which gave a counterexample using two ternary inductive predicates and a unary function symbol to show the failure of the cut-elimination property in the cyclic proof system of the first-order logic.</description>

      <title>Strong Structural Bounds for MaxSAT: The Fine Details of Using Neuromorphic and Quantum Hardware Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hardware accelerators like quantum annealers or neuromorphic chips are capable of finding the ground state of a Hamiltonian. A promising route in utilizing these devices is via methods from automated reasoning: The problem at hand is first encoded into MaxSAT; then MaxSAT is reduced to Max2SAT; and finally, Max2SAT is translated into a Hamiltonian. It was observed that different encodings can dramatically affect the efficiency of the hardware accelerators. Yet, previous studies were only concerned with the size of the encodings rather than with syntactic or structural properties.
  We establish structure-aware reductions between MaxSAT, Max2SAT, and the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem (QUBO) that underlies such hardware accelerators. All these problems turn out to be equivalent under linear-time, treewidth-preserving reductions. As a consequence, we obtain tight lower bounds under ETH and SETH for Max2SAT and QUBO, as well as a new time-optimal fixed-parameter algorithm for QUBO. While our results are tight up to a constant additive factor for the primal treewidth, we require a constant multiplicative factor for the incidence treewidth. To close the emerging gap, we supplement our results with novel time-optimal algorithms for fragments of MaxSAT based on model counting.</description>

      <title>Neural DNF-MT: A Neuro-symbolic Approach for Learning Interpretable and Editable Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03888v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although deep reinforcement learning has been shown to be effective, the model's black-box nature presents barriers to direct policy interpretation. To address this problem, we propose a neuro-symbolic approach called neural DNF-MT for end-to-end policy learning. The differentiable nature of the neural DNF-MT model enables the use of deep actor-critic algorithms for training. At the same time, its architecture is designed so that trained models can be directly translated into interpretable policies expressed as standard (bivalent or probabilistic) logic programs. Moreover, additional layers can be included to extract abstract features from complex observations, acting as a form of predicate invention. The logic representations are highly interpretable, and we show how the bivalent representations of deterministic policies can be edited and incorporated back into a neural model, facilitating manual intervention and adaptation of learned policies. We evaluate our approach on a range of tasks requiring learning deterministic or stochastic behaviours from various forms of observations. Our empirical results show that our neural DNF-MT model performs at the level of competing black-box methods whilst providing interpretable policies.</description>
