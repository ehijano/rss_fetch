      <title>Plasmascopy of ultrafast hot charges in solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate an electric field-resolved approach for probing ultrafast dynamics of photoinjected charges in solids. Direct access to the electric field of few-cycle pulses enables us to measure a broadband response of a medium with associated plasma frequency. We prepare an ensemble of photoinjected hot charge carriers with energies sufficient to trigger impact ionization and establish a framework to measure its dynamics. Our study reveals the first time-resolved observation of the short-lived ultrafast impact ionization in germanium counteracted by trapping of mobile charges at later times. This approach provides a promising route for studying ultrafast many-body physics in photoexcited solids, with predictions from advanced theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Development of a Modular ODMR Setup for Optical Experiments in a Variable Temperature Insert</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed an optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) setup designed for compatibility with a widely used, commercially available helium bath cryostat equipped with a variable temperature insert. The optical path extends nearly two meters, spanning the full length of the cryostat insert, enabling excitation of the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers and detection of the resulting fluorescence from outside the cryostat. The setup preserves optical alignment and beam quality along this extended path allowing integration into existing cryogenic systems without significant modifications. We demonstrate the setup's performance by measuring the temperature dependence of the resonance signal and its behavior under small applied magnetic fields, as well as the magnetic transition of a SrRuO$_3$ sample, thereby showcasing the feasibility of NV magnetometry on a sample in constrained cryogenic environments.</description>

      <title>Observation of Custodial Chiral Symmetry in Memristive Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of custodial symmetry, a residual symmetry that protects physical observables from large quantum corrections, has been a cornerstone of high-energy physics, but its experimental observation has remained unexplored. Building on recent theoretical work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 097701 (2022)], we report the first experimental observation of classical analog of custodial chiral symmetry in a memristive Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) circuit. We provide direct experimental evidence for custodial symmetry through the measurement of the correction to the Lagrangian. This Lagrangian correction, which mimics a mass term in field theory, vanishes smoothly as the perturbation is reduced. We also demonstrate that topological edge states in the memristive SSH circuit remain localized at the boundary, protected by custodial chiral symmetry. This work opens new avenues for emulating field-theoretic symmetries and nonlinear dynamics in memristive platforms.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of magic dressing of $^3$He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common concern in high-precision neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM) experiments is that of magnetic field stability. For static fields, this problem can be mitigated through the use of a superconducting holding field coil, which when operated in persistent current mode serves to stabilize the magnetic field. However, such a solution is not viable when time-varying magnetic fields are present, as is the case for the spin dressing mode of the proposed nEDMSF (nEDM super-fluid) experiment. This experiment features an oscillating magnetic field to dress the gyromagnetic ratios of $^3$He and neutrons to the same value, a condition known as critical dressing. Fluctuations in the dressing field amplitude have the potential to disrupt this condition. Here, we investigate a modification to spin dressing, termed ``magic dressing,'' which renders the system insensitive to small variations in dressing field amplitude. We further demonstrate the utility of this method for the single spin-species case using a sample of polarized $^3$He. We find a dramatic increase in transverse relaxation time in the presence of magnetic field gradients.</description>
