      <title>Contrastive Normalizing Flows for Uncertainty-Aware Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating physical parameters from data is a crucial application of machine learning (ML) in the physical sciences. However, systematic uncertainties, such as detector miscalibration, induce data distribution distortions that can erode statistical precision. In both high-energy physics (HEP) and broader ML contexts, achieving uncertainty-aware parameter estimation under these domain shifts remains an open problem. In this work, we address this challenge of uncertainty-aware parameter estimation for a broad set of tasks critical for HEP. We introduce a novel approach based on Contrastive Normalizing Flows (CNFs), which achieves top performance on the HiggsML Uncertainty Challenge dataset. Building on the insight that a binary classifier can approximate the model parameter likelihood ratio, we address the practical limitations of expressivity and the high cost of simulating high-dimensional parameter grids by embedding data and parameters in a learned CNF mapping. This mapping yields a tunable contrastive distribution that enables robust classification under shifted data distributions. Through a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that CNFs, when coupled with a classifier and established frequentist techniques, provide principled parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification through classification that is robust to data distribution distortions.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian replica exchange augmented with diffusion-based generative models and importance sampling to assess biomolecular conformational basins and barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhanced sampling techniques are essential for exploring biomolecular conformational dynamics that occur on timescales inaccessible to conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This study introduces a framework that combines Hamiltonian replica exchange (REST2) with denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and importance sampling to enhance the mapping of conformational free-energy landscapes. Building on previous applications of DDPMs to temperature replica exchange (TREM), we propose two key improvements. First, we adapt the method to REST2 by treating potential energy as a fluctuating variable. This adaptation allows for more efficient sampling in large biomolecular systems. Second, to further improve resolution in high-barrier regions, we develop an iterative scheme combining replica exchange, DDPM, and importance sampling along known collective variables. Benchmarking on the mini-protein CLN025 demonstrates that DDPM-refined REST2 achieves comparable accuracy to TREM while requiring fewer replicas. Application to the enzyme PTP1B reveals a loop transition pathway consistent with prior complex biased simulations, showcasing the approach's ability to uncover high-barrier transitions with minimal computational overhead with respect to conventional replica exchange approaches. Overall, this hybrid strategy enables more efficient exploration of free-energy landscapes, expanding the utility of generative models in enhanced sampling simulations.</description>

      <title>Divisible and indivisible Stochastic-Quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a complete geometrical characterisation of divisible and indivisible time-evolution at the level of probabilities for systems with two configurations, open or closed. Our new geometrical construction in the space of stochastic matrices shows the existence of conical bounds separating divisible and indivisible dynamics, bearing analogy with the relativistic causal structure, with an emerging time pointing towards information erasure when the dynamics are divisible. Indivisible dynamics, which include quantum dynamics, are characterised by a time-flow against the information-erasure time coordinate or by being tachyonic with respect to the cones in the stochastic matrix space. This provides a geometric counterpart of other results in the literature, such as the equivalence between information-decreasing and divisible processes. The results apply under minimal assumptions: (i) the system has two configurations, (ii) one can freely ascribe initial probabilities to both and (iii) probabilities at other times are linearly related to the initial ones through conditional probabilities. The optional assumption of (iv) continuity places further constraints on the system, removing one of the past cones. Discontinuous stochastic dynamics in continuous time include cases with divisible blocks of evolution which are not themselves divisible. We show that the connection between continuity and multiplicity of divisors holds for any dimension. We extend methods of coarse graining and dilations by incorporating dynamics and uncertainty, connecting them with divisibility criteria. This is a first step towards a full geometric characterisation of indivisible stochastic dynamics for any number of configurations which, as they cannot at the level of probabilities be reduced to a composition of evolution operators, constitute fundamental elements of probabilistic time-evolution.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Multi-Track Reconstruction using Graph Neural Networks at Belle II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the study of an end-to-end multi-track reconstruction algorithm for the central drift chamber of the Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB collider using Graph Neural Networks for an unknown number of particles. The algorithm uses detector hits as inputs without pre-filtering to simultaneously predict the number of track candidates in an event and their kinematic properties. In a second step, we cluster detector hits for each track candidate to pass to a track fitting algorithm. Using a realistic full detector simulation including beam-induced backgrounds and detector noise taken from actual collision data, we find significant improvements in track finding efficiencies for tracks in a variety of different event topologies compared to the existing baseline algorithm used in Belle II. For events with a hypothetical long-lived massive particle with a mass in the GeV-range decaying uniformly along its flight direction into two charged particles, the GNN achieves a combined track finding and fitting efficiency of 85.4% with a fake rate of 2.5%, compared to 52.2% and 4.1% for the baseline algorithm. This is the first end-to-end multi-track machine learning algorithm for a drift chamber detector that has been utilized in a realistic particle physics environment.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Propagation for Learning in Lagrangian Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for training dynamical systems governed by Lagrangian mechanics using Equilibrium Propagation. Our approach extends Equilibrium Propagation -- initially developed for energy-based models -- to dynamical trajectories by leveraging the principle of action extremization. Training is achieved by gently nudging trajectories toward desired targets and measuring how the variables conjugate to the parameters to be trained respond. This method is particularly suited to systems with periodic boundary conditions or fixed initial and final states, enabling efficient parameter updates without requiring explicit backpropagation through time. In the case of periodic boundary conditions, this approach yields the semiclassical limit of Quantum Equilibrium Propagation. Applications to systems with dissipation are also discussed.</description>
