      <title>Coupling and Recoupling Coefficients for Wigner's U(4) Supermultiplet Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel procedure for evaluating Wigner coupling coefficients and Racah recoupling coefficients for U(4) in two group-subgroup chains is presented. The canonical U(4)-&gt;U(3)-&gt;U(2)-&gt;U(1) coupling and recoupling coefficients are applicable to any system that possesses U(4) symmetry, while the physical U(4)-&gt;SU_S(2)xSU_T(2) coupling coefficients are more specific to nuclear structure studies that utilize Wigner's Supermultiplet Symmetry concept. The procedure that is proposed sidesteps the use of binomial coefficients and alternating sum series, and consequently enables fast and accurate computation of any and all U(4)-underpinned features. The inner multiplicity of a (S,T) pair within a single U(4) irreducible representation is obtained from the dimension of the null space of the SU(2) raising generators; while the resolution for the outer multiplicity follows from the work of Alex et al. on U(N). It is anticipated that a C++ library will ultimately be available for determining generic coupling and recoupling coefficients associated with both the \textit{canonical} and the \textit{physical} group-subgroup chains of U(4).</description>

      <title>The Steklov problem for exterior domains: asymptotic behavior and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of the Steklov problem for the modified Helmholtz equation $(p-\Delta) u = 0$ in the exterior of a compact set, for which the positive parameter $p$ ensures exponential decay of the Steklov eigenfunctions at infinity. We obtain the small-$p$ asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions and discuss their features for different space dimensions. These results find immediate applications to the theory of stochastic processes and unveil the long-time asymptotic behavior of probability densities of various first-passage times in exterior domains. Theoretical results are validated by solving the exterior Steklov problem by a finite-element method with a transparent boundary condition.</description>

      <title>General solution to Euler-Poisson equations of a free symmetric body by direct summation of power series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Euler-Poisson equations belong to the class of first-order differential equations for determining the integral lines of a given vector field. The general solution to these equations can be written as a power series of the evolution parameter. We calculated the sum of these series for the case of a free symmetric body, obtaining its rotation matrix through the elementary functions.</description>

      <title>Surprising symmetry properties and exact solutions of Kolmogorov backward equations with power diffusivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the original advanced version of the direct method, we efficiently compute the equivalence groupoids and equivalence groups of two peculiar classes of Kolmogorov backward equations with power diffusivity and solve the problems of their complete group classifications. The results on the equivalence groups are double-checked with the algebraic method. Within these classes, the remarkable Fokker-Planck and the fine Kolmogorov backward equations are distinguished by their exceptional symmetry properties. We extend the known results on these two equations to their counterparts with respect to a distinguished discrete equivalence transformation. Additionally, we carry out Lie reductions of the equations under consideration up to the point equivalence, exhaustively study their hidden Lie symmetries and generate wider families of their new exact solutions via acting by their recursion operators on constructed Lie-invariant solutions. This analysis reveals eight powers of the space variable with exponents -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 as values of the diffusion coefficient that are prominent due to symmetry properties of the corresponding equations.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the Gross-Pitaevskii Dynamics through Renormalized Excitation Number Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the time evolution of initially trapped Bose-Einstein condensates in the Gross-Pitaevskii regime. We show that the system continues to exhibit BEC once the trap has been released and that the dynamics of the condensate is described by the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Like the recent work \cite{BS}, we obtain optimal bounds on the number of excitations orthogonal to the condensate state. In contrast to \cite{BS}, however, whose main strategy consists of controlling the number of excitations with regards to a suitable fluctuation dynamics $t\mapsto e^{-B_t} e^{-iH_Nt}$ with renormalized generator, our proof is based on controlling renormalized excitation number operators directly with regards to the Schr\"odinger dynamics $t\mapsto e^{-iH_Nt}$.</description>

      <title>From bordisms of three-manifolds to domain walls between topological orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a correspondence between spin three-manifolds and bosonic abelian topological orders. Let $N$ be a spin three-manifold. We can define a $(2+1)$-dimensional topological order $\mathrm{TO}_N$ as follows: its anyons are the torsion elements in $H_1(N)$, the braiding of anyons is given by the linking form, and their topological spins are given by the quadratic refinement of the linking form obtained from the spin structure. Under this correspondence, a surgery presentation of $N$ gives rise to a classical Chern--Simons description of the associated topological order $\mathrm{TO}_N$. We then extend the correspondence to spin bordisms between three-manifolds, and domain walls between topological orders. In particular, we construct a domain wall $\mathcal{D}_M$ between $\mathrm{TO}_N$ and $\mathrm{TO}_{N'}$, where $M$ is a spin bordism from $N$ to $N'$. This domain wall unfolds to a composition of a gapped boundary, obtained from anyon condensation, and a gapless Narain boundary CFT.</description>

      <title>Strong field behavior of Wang-Yau Quasi-local energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We look at the strong field behavior of the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy. In particular, we examine the limit of the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy as the defining spacelike 2-surface {\Sigma} approaches an apparent horizon from outside. Assuming any smooth isometric embedding, we find that the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy blows up in this limit, unless the horizon can be isometrically embedded into R3. Moreover, if the horizon cannot be embedded into R3, the optimal embedding equation is not solvable for {\Sigma} near the horizon. We discuss the implications of our results in the conclusion section.</description>

      <title>A proposal of quasi-local mass for 2-surfaces of timelike mean curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quasi-local mass, typically defined as an integral over a spacelike $2$-surface $\Sigma$, should encode information about the gravitational field within a finite, extended region bounded by $\Sigma$. Therefore, in attempts to quantize gravity, one may consider an infinite dimensional space of $2$-surfaces instead of an infinite dimensional space of $4$-dimensional Lorentzian spacetimes. However, existing definitions for quasilocal mass only applies to surfaces outside an horizon whose mean curvature vector is spacelike. In this paper, we propose an extension of the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy/mass to surfaces with timelike mean curvature vector, including in particular trapped surfaces. We adopt the same canonical gauge as in the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy but allow the pulled back "killing vector" to the physical spacetime to be spacelike. We define the new quasi-local energy along the Hamiltonian formulation of the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy. The new definition yields a positive definite surface energy density and a new divergence free current. Calculations for coordinate spheres in Kerr family spacetime are shown. In the spherical symmetric case, our definition reduces to a previous definition \cite{lundgren2007self}.</description>

      <title>Sampling from the Continuous Random Energy Model in Total Variation Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuous random energy model (CREM) is a toy model of spin glasses on $\{0,1\}^N$ that, in the limit, exhibits an infinitely hierarchical correlation structure. We give two polynomial-time algorithms to approximately sample from the Gibbs distribution of the CREM in the high-temperature regime, based on a Markov chain and a sequential sampler. The running time depends algebraically on the desired TV distance and failure probability and exponentially in $(1/g')^{O(1)}$, where $g'$ is the gap to a certain inverse temperature threshold; this contrasts with previous results which only attain $o(N)$ accuracy in KL divergence. If the covariance function $A$ of the CREM is concave, the algorithms work up to the critical threshold $\beta_c$, which is the static phase transition point; moreover, for certain $A$, the algorithms work up to the known algorithmic threshold $\beta_G$ proposed in Addario-Berry and Maillard (2020) for non-trivial sampling guarantees. Our result depends on quantitative bounds for the fluctuation of the partition function and a new contiguity result of the ``tilted" CREM obtained from sampling, which is of independent interest. We also show that the spectral gap is exponentially small with high probability, suggesting that the algebraic dependence is unavoidable with a Markov chain approach.</description>

      <title>Generating Kerr-anti-de Sitter thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work we study the construction of different thermodynamic descriptions for the Kerr-anti-de Sitter (KadS) black holes. The early versions of the KadS thermodynamics are briefly discussed, highlighting some of its strong points and shortcomings. Isohomogeneous transformations, a procedure for generating new thermodynamics, are presented and geometrically interpreted for KadS. This tool is used to determine possible KadS thermodynamics that can be constructed to satisfy a Smarr formula, and the validity of the first law in the generated thermodynamics. The connection between new thermodynamic theories and early Hawking's approach is considered. In this new framework, the usual KadS thermodynamics is complemented with its geometric construction, and Hawking's proposal, which does not satisfy the first law, is improved to an alternative thermodynamic theory. With the quantum statistical relation, Hawking's and this alternative KadS thermodynamics are also generalized from four to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Analytical Expression for Continuum-continuum Transition Amplitude of Hydrogen-like Atoms with Angular-momentum Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attosecond chronoscopy typically utilises interfering two-photon transitions to access the phase information. Simulating these two-photon transitions is challenging due to the continuum-continuum transition term. The hydrogenic approximation within second-order perturbation theory has been widely used due to the existence of analytical expressions of the wave functions. So far, only (partially) asymptotic results have been derived, which fail to correctly describe the low-kinetic-energy behaviour, especially for high angular-momentum states. Here, we report an analytical expression that overcome these limitations. They are based on the Appell's F1 function and use the confluent hypergeometric function of the second kind as the intermediate states. We show that the derived formula can be applied to arbitrarily high angular momenta and quantitatively agrees with the numerical simulations using the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. Furthermore, we give an angular-momentum-dependent asymptotic form of the outgoing wavefunction and their continuum-continuum dipole transition amplitudes.</description>

      <title>A Transformation Theorem for Transverse Signature-Type Changing Semi-Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the early eighties Hartle and Hawking put forth that signature-type change may be conceptually interesting, paving the way to the so-called 'no boundary' proposal for the initial conditions for the universe. Such singularity-free universes have no beginning, but they do have an origin of time. In mathematical terms, we are dealing with signature-type changing manifolds where a Riemannian region (i.e., a region with a positive definite metric) is smoothly joined to a Lorentzian region at the surface of transition where time begins.
  We present a transformation prescription to transform an arbitrary Lorentzian manifold into a singular signature-type changing manifold. Then we establish the Transformation Theorem, asserting that, conversely, under certain conditions, such a metric $(M,\tilde{g})$ can be obtained from some Lorentz metric $g$ through the aforementioned transformation procedure. By augmenting the assumption by certain constraints, mutatis mutandis, the global version of the Transformation Theorem can be proven as well. In conclusion, we make use of the Transformation Prescription to demonstrate that the induced metric on the hypersurface of signature change is either Riemannian or a positive semi-definite pseudo metric.</description>

Abstract: We study the stable geodesics of the QFT special K\"ahler geometry ($\equiv$ Seiberg-Witten geometry of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ QFT) using the Myers argument. Complete stable geodesics are quite restricted, and can be described very explicitly. In particular no closed stable geodesic exists. We comment on the application of the Myers method to related problems, including geodesics in moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau 3-folds.</description>

      <title>Stationary reduction method based on nonisospectral deformation of orthogonal polynomials, and discrete Painlev\'{e}-type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new approach called ``stationary reduction method based on nonisospectral deformation of orthogonal polynomials" for deriving discrete Painlev\'{e}-type (d-P-type) equations. We successfully apply this approach to (bi)orthogonal polynomials satisfying ordinary orthogonality, $(1,m)$-biorthogonality, generalized Laurent biorthogonality, Cauchy biorthogonality and partial-skew orthogonality. As a result, several seemingly novel classes of high order d-P-type equations, along with their solutions and associated Lax pairs, are derived. Notably, the d-P-type equation related to the Cauchy biorthogonality can be viewed as a stationary reduction of a nonisospectral generalization involving the first two flows of the Toda hierarchy of CKP type. Additionally, the d-P-type equation related to the partial-skew orthogonality is associated with the nonisospectral Toda hierarchy of BKP type, and this equation is found to admit a solution expressed in terms of Pfaffians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a general framework of estimates for convergence rates of random discrete model curves approaching Schramm Loewner Evolution (SLE) curves in the lattice size scaling limit. We show that a power-law convergence rate of an interface to an SLE curve can be derived from a power-law convergence rate for an appropriate martingale observable provided the discrete curve satisfies a specific bound on crossing events, the Kempannien-Smirnov condition, along with an estimate on the growth of the derivative of the SLE curve. We apply our framework to show that the exploration process for critical site percolation on hexagonal lattice converges to the SLE$_6$ curve with a power-law convergence rate.</description>

Abstract: We aim to establish a scalable scheme for characterising diagonal non- Clifford gates for single- and multi-quit systems; d is a prime-power integer. By employing cyclic operators and a qudit T gate, we generalise the dihedral benchmarking scheme for single- and multi-qudit circuits. Our results establish a path for experimentally benchmarking qudit systems and are of theoretical and experimental interest because our scheme is optimal insofar as it does not require preparation of the full qudit Clifford gate set to characterise a non-Clifford gate. Moreover, combined with Clifford randomised benchmarking, our scheme is useful to characterise the generators of a universal gate set.</description>

      <title>Splitting techniques for approximating the exponential of commutators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct product formulas of orders 3 to 6 approximating the exponential of a commutator of two arbitrary operators in terms of the exponentials of the operators involved. The new schemes require a reduced number of exponentials and thus provide more efficient approximations than other previously published alternatives, whereas they can be still used as a starting methods of recursive procedures to increase the order of approximation.</description>

      <title>Background Vlasov equations and Young measures for passive scalar and vector advection equations under special stochastic scaling limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last few years it was proved that scalar passive quantities subject to suitable stochastic transport noise, and more recently that also vector passive quantities subject to suitable stochastic transport and stretching noise, weakly converge to the solutions of deterministic equations with a diffusion term. In the background of these stochastic models, we introduce stochastic Vlasov equations which gives additional information on the fluctuations and oscillations of solutions: we prove convergence to non-trivial Young measures satisfying limit PDEs with suitable diffusion terms. In the case of a passive vector field the background Vlasov equation adds completely new statistical information to the stochastic advection equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Triply Special Relativity is a deformation of Special Relativity based on three fundamental parameters, that describes a noncommutative geometry on a curved spacetime, preserving the Lorentz invariance and the principle of relativity. Its symmetries are generated by a 14-parameter nonlinear algebra.
  In this paper, we discuss a generalization of the original model and construct its realizations on a canonical phase space. We also investigate in more detail its classical limit, obtained by replacing the commutators by Poisson brackets.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new method to estimate the $L^\infty$ norm for eigenfunctions of partial differential operators on an arbitrary open set $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We establish a general inequality which estimates the local $L^\infty$ norm by the number of integer solutions to a certain diophantine problem arising from the principal symbol of the operator. The novelty of our method lies in its complete independence from the regularity of the boundary, the boundary condition or the validity of a local Weyl law. Our result applies to domains with fractal boundary, unbounded domains, as well as to non-self-adjoint operators.</description>

      <title>Vacuum energy density from the form factor bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The form-factor bootstrap is incomplete until one normalizes the zero-particle form factor. For the stress energy tensor we describe how to obtain the vacuum energy density $\rho_{\rm vac}$, defined as $\langle 0| T_{\mu\nu} | 0 \rangle = \rho_{\rm vac} \, g_{\mu\nu}$, from the form-factor bootstrap. Even for integrable QFT's in D=2 spacetime dimensions, this prescription is new, although it reproduces previously known results obtained in a different and more difficult thermodynamic Bethe ansatz computation. We propose a version of this prescription in D=4 dimensions. For these even dimensions, the vacuum energy density has the universal form $\rho_{\rm vac} \propto m^D/\mathfrak{g}$ where $\mathfrak{g}$ is a dimensionless interaction coupling constant which can be determined from the high energy behavior of the S-matrix. In the limit $\mathfrak{g} \to 0$, $\rho_{\rm vac} $ diverges due to well understood UV divergences in free quantum field theories. If we assume the the observed Cosmological Constant originates from the vacuum energy density $\rho_{\rm vac}$ computed as proposed here, then this suggests there must exist a particle which does not obtain its mass from spontaneous symmetry breaking in the electro-weak sector, which we designate as the ``zeron". A strong candidate for the zeron is a massive Majorana neutrino.</description>

      <title>Rigorous derivation of damped-driven wave turbulence theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous justification of various kinetic regimes exhibited by the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with an additive stochastic forcing and a viscous dissipation. The importance of such damped-driven models stems from their wide empirical use in studying turbulence for nonlinear wave systems. The force injects energy into the system at large scales, which is then transferred across scales, thanks to the nonlinear wave interactions, until it is eventually dissipated at smaller scales. The presence of such scale-separated forcing and dissipation allows for the constant flux of energy in the intermediate scales, known as the inertial range, which is the focus of the vast amount of numerical and physical literature on wave turbulence.
  Roughly speaking, our results provide a rigorous kinetic framework for this turbulent behavior by proving that the stochastic dynamics can be effectively described by a deterministic damped-driven kinetic equation, which carries the full picture of the turbulent energy dynamic across scales (like cascade spectra or other flux solutions). The analysis extends previous works in the unperturbed setting arXiv:1912.09518-arXiv:2301.07063 to the above empirically motivated damped driven setting. Here, in addition to the size $L$ of the system, and the strength $\lambda$ of the nonlinearity, an extra thermodynamic parameter has to be included in the kinetic limit ($L\to \infty, \lambda\to 0$), namely the strength $\nu$ of the forcing and dissipation. Various regimes emerge depending on the relative sizes of $L$, $\lambda$ and $\nu$, which give rise to different kinetic equations. Two major novelties of this work is the extension of the Feynman diagram analysis to additive stochastic objects, and the sharp asymptotic development of the leading terms in that expansion.</description>

      <title>Unitary tetrahedron quantum gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of many-body systems using 2-qubit Yang-Baxter gates offer a benchmark for quantum hardware. This can be extended to the higher dimensional case with $n$-qubit generalisations of Yang-Baxter gates called $n$-simplex operators. Such multi-qubit gates potentially lead to shallower and more efficient quantum circuits as well. Finding them amounts to identifying unitary solutions of the $n$-simplex equations, the building blocks of higher dimensional integrable systems. These are a set of highly non-linear and over determined system of equations making it notoriously hard to solve even when the local Hilbert spaces are spanned by qubits. We systematically overcome this for higher simplex operators constructed using two methods: from Clifford algebras and by lifting Yang-Baxter operators. The $n=3$ or the tetrahedron case is analyzed in detail. For the qubit case our methods produce 13 inequivalent families of unitary tetrahedron operators. 12 of these families are obtained by appending the 5 unitary families of 4 by 4 constant Yang-Baxter operators of Dye-Hietarinta, with a single qubit operator. As applications, universal sets of single, two and three qubit gates are realized using such unitary tetrahedron operators. The ideas presented in this work can be naturally extended to the higher simplex cases.</description>

Abstract: We establish boundedness and polynomial decay results for the Teukolsky system in the exterior spacetime of very slowly rotating and strongly charged sub-extremal Kerr-Newman black holes, with a focus on axially symmetric solutions. The key step in achieving these results is deriving a physical-space Morawetz estimate for the associated generalized Regge-Wheeler system, without relying on spherical harmonic decomposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rudnick recently proved that the spectral number variance for the Laplacian of a large compact hyperbolic surface converges, in a certain scaling limit and when averaged with respect to the Weil-Petersson measure on moduli space, to the number variance of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble of random matrix theory. In this note we extend Rudnick's approach to show convergence to the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble for twisted Laplacians which break time-reversal symmetry, and to the Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble for Dirac operators. This addresses a question of Naud, who obtained analogous results for twisted Laplacians on high genus random covers of a fixed compact surface.</description>

Abstract: We prove a correspondence, for Riemannian manifolds with self-dual Weyl tensor, between twistor functions and solutions to the Teukolsky equations for any conformal and spin weights. In particular, we give a contour integral formula for solutions to the Teukolsky equations, and we find a recursion operator that generates an infinite family of solutions and leads to the construction of Cech representatives and sheaf cohomology classes on twistor space. Apart from the general conformally self-dual case, examples include self-dual black holes, scalar-flat K\"ahler surfaces, and quaternionic-K\"ahler metrics, where we map the Teukolsky equation to the conformal wave equation, establish new relations to the linearised Przanowski equation, and find new classes of quaternionic deformations.</description>

Abstract: We study a mean-field spin model with three- and two-body interactions. The equilibrium measure for large volumes is shown to have three pure states, the phases of the model. They include the two with opposite magnetization and an unpolarized one with zero magnetization, merging at the critical point. We prove that the central limit theorem holds for a suitably rescaled magnetization, while its violation with the typical quartic behavior appears at the critical point.</description>

Abstract: We consider dilute Bose gases on the three dimensional unit torus that interact through a pair potential with scattering length of order $ N^{\kappa-1}$, for some $\kappa &gt;0$. For the range $ \kappa\in [0, \frac1{43})$, \cite{ABS} proves complete BEC of low energy states into the zero momentum mode based on a unitary renormalization through operator exponentials that are quartic in creation and annihilation operators. In this paper, we give a new and self-contained proof of BEC of the ground state for $ \kappa\in [0, \frac1{20})$ by combining some of the key ideas of \cite{ABS} with the novel diagonalization approach introduced recently in \cite{Br}, which is based on the Schur complement formula. In particular, our proof avoids the use of operator exponentials and is significantly simpler than \cite{ABS}.</description>

Applying this result to principal SUSY W-algebras, we get their free field realization inside the SUSY Heisenberg vertex algebras. Furthermore, the screening operators for principal SUSY W-algebras allow us to present them as intersections of the principal SUSY W-algebras associated with $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$, $\mathfrak{osp}(2|2)$, $\mathfrak{osp}(3|2)$ and $\mathfrak{osp}(4|2)$, tensored with SUSY Heisenberg vertex algebras.</description>

Abstract: We consider the six-vertex model at its free-fermion point with domain wall boundary conditions, which is equivalent to random domino tilings of the Aztec diamond. We compute the scaling limit of a particular non-local correlation function, essentially equivalent to the partition function for the domino tilings of a pentagon-shaped domain, obtained by cutting away a triangular region from a corner of the initial Aztec diamond. We observe a third-order phase transition when the geometric parameters of the obtained pentagonal domain are tuned to have the fifth side exactly tangent to the arctic ellipse of the corresponding initial model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2101.09349v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twist defects in surface codes can be used to encode more logical qubits, improve the code rate, and implement logical gates. In this work we provide a rigorous formalism for constructing surface codes with twists generalizing the well-defined homological formalism introduced by Kitaev for describing CSS surface codes. In particular, we associate a surface code to \emph{any} graph $G$ embedded on \emph{any} 2D-manifold, in such a way that (1) qubits are associated to the vertices of the graph, (2) stabilizers are associated to faces, (3) twist defects are associated to odd-degree vertices. In this way, we are able to reproduce the variety of surface codes, with and without twists, in the literature and produce some new examples. We also calculate and bound various code properties such as the rate and distance in terms of topological graph properties such as genus, systole, and face-width.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.13526v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We carry out the extended symmetry analysis of an ultraparabolic Fokker-Planck equation with three independent variables, which is also called the Kolmogorov equation and is singled out within the class of such Fokker-Planck equations by its remarkable symmetry properties. In particular, its essential Lie invariance algebra is eight-dimensional, which is the maximum dimension within the above class. We compute the complete point symmetry pseudogroup of the Fokker-Planck equation using the direct method, analyze its structure and single out its essential subgroup. After listing inequivalent one- and two-dimensional subalgebras of the essential and maximal Lie invariance algebras of this equation, we exhaustively classify its Lie reductions, carry out its peculiar generalized reductions and relate the latter reductions to generating solutions with iterative action of Lie-symmetry operators. As a result, we construct wide families of exact solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation, in particular, those parameterized by an arbitrary finite number of arbitrary solutions of the (1+1)-dimensional linear heat equation. We also establish the point similarity of the Fokker-Planck equation to the (1+2)-dimensional Kramers equations whose essential Lie invariance algebras are eight-dimensional, which allows us to find wide families of exact solutions of these Kramers equations in an easy way.</description>

  $\mathcal{D} $ of \textit{c\`{a}dl\`{a}g} paths $w: [0,\infty) \to S^1$, where $S^1$ is the unitary circle. We equip the space $\mathcal{D} $ with the Skorokhod metric, and we show that the semi-flow is expanding. We also introduce a stochastic semi-group $e^{t\, L}$, $t \geq 0,$ where $L$ acts linearly on continuous functions $f:S^1\to\mathbb{R}$. This stochastic semigroup and an initial vector of probability $\pi$ define an associated stationary shift-invariant probability $\mathbb{P}$ on the Polish space $\mathcal{D} $. Given such $\mathbb{P}$ and an H\"older potential $V:S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$, we define a continuous time Ruelle operator, which is described by a family of linear operators $ \mathbb{L}^t_V$, $t\geq 0,$ acting on continuous functions $\varphi: S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$. More precisely, given any H\"older $V$ and $t\geq 0$, the operator $ \mathbb{L}^t_V$, is defined by
  $\varphi \to \psi(y) = \mathbb{L}^t_V(\varphi)(y)= \int_{w(t)=y} e^{ \int_0^t V(w(s)) ds} \varphi (w(0)) d \mathbb{P}(w).$
  For some specific parameters we show the existence of an eigenvalue $\lambda_V$ and an associated H\"older eigenfunction $\varphi_V&gt;0$.After a coboundary procedure we obtain another stochastic semigroup, with infinitesimal generator $L_V$, and this will define a new probability $\mathbb{P}_V$ on $\mathcal{D}$, which we call the Gibbs (or, equilibrium) probability for the potential $V$. In this case, we define entropy for some shift-invariant probabilities on $\mathcal{D}$, and we consider a variational problem of pressure. Finally, we define entropy production and present our main result: we analyze its relation with time-reversal and symmetry of $L$. We also show that the continuous-time shift $\Theta_t$, acting on the Skorohod space $D$, is expanding.</description>

      <title>Cycle Index Polynomials and Generalized Quantum Separability Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mixedness of one share of a pure bipartite state determines whether the overall state is a separable, unentangled state. Here we consider quantum computational tests of mixedness, and we derive an exact expression of the acceptance probability of such tests as the number of copies of the state becomes larger. We prove that the analytical form of this expression is given by the cycle index polynomial of the symmetric group $S_k$, which is itself related to the Bell polynomials. After doing so, we derive a family of quantum separability tests, each of which is generated by a finite group; for all such algorithms, we show that the acceptance probability is determined by the cycle index polynomial of the group. Finally, we produce and analyze explicit circuit constructions for these tests, showing that the tests corresponding to the symmetric and cyclic groups can be executed with $O(k^2)$ and $O(k\log(k))$ controlled-SWAP gates, respectively, where $k$ is the number of copies of the state being tested.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09693v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work deals with the scattering entropy of quantum graphs in many different circumstances. We first consider the case of the Shannon entropy and then the R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies, which are more adequate to study distinct quantitative behavior such as entanglement and nonextensive behavior, respectively. We describe many results associated with different types of quantum graphs in the presence of several vertices, edges, and leads. In particular, we think the results may be used as quantifiers in models related to the transport in quantum graphs.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Counting and Mixed $p$-Spin Glass Models under Replica Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fluctuation problems at high temperature in the general mixed $p$-spin glass models under the weak external field assumption: $h= \rho N^{-\alpha}, \rho&gt;0, \alpha \in [1/4,\infty]$. By extending the cluster expansion approach to this generic setting, we convert the fluctuation problem as a hypergraph counting problem and thus obtain a new multiple-transition phenomenon. A by-product of our results is a new critical inverse temperature obtained from optimal second moment estimates. In particular, all our fluctuation results hold up to the threshold. Combining with multivariate Stein's method, we also obtain an explicit convergence rate under proper moment assumptions on the general symmetric disorder. Our results have several further implications. First, our approach works for both even and odd pure $p$-spin models. The leading cluster structures in the odd $p$ case are different and more involved than in the even $p$ case. This combinatorially explains the folklore that odd $p$-spin is more complicated than even $p$. Second, in the mixed $p$-spin setting, the cluster structures differ depending on the relation between the minimum effective even and odd $p$-spins: $p_e$ and $p_o$. As an example, at $h=0$, there are three sub-regimes: $p_e&lt;p_o, p_o&lt;p_e&lt;2p_o, p_e\ge 2p_o$, wherein the first and third ones, the mixed model behaves essentially like a pure $p$-spin model, and only in the second regime, it is more like a mixture. This gives another criterion for classifying mean-field spin glass models compared to the work of Auffinger and Ben Arous (Ann.~Probab.~41 (2013), no.~6, 4214--4247), where the idea is based on complexity computations for spherical models. Third, our framework naturally implies a multi-scale fluctuation phenomenon conjectured in the work of Bovier and Schertzer (Probab. Theory Relat. Fields (2024)).</description>

      <title>Large-scale circulation reversals explained by pendulum correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a low-order dynamical system to describe thermal convection in an annular domain. The model derives systematically from a Fourier-Laurent truncation of the governing Navier-Stokes Boussinesq equations and accounts for spatial dependence of the flow and temperature fields. Comparison with fully-resolved direct numerical simulations (DNS) shows that the model captures parameter bifurcations and reversals of the large-scale circulation (LSC), including states of (i) steady circulating flow, (ii) chaotic LSC reversals, and (iii) periodic LSC reversals. Casting the system in terms of the fluid's angular momentum and center of mass (CoM) reveals equivalence to a damped pendulum with forcing that raises the CoM above the fulcrum. This formulation offers a transparent mechanism for LSC reversals, namely the inertial overshoot of a forced pendulum, and it yields an explicit formula for the frequency $f^*$ of regular LSC reversals in the high Rayleigh-number limit. This formula is shown to be in excellent agreement with DNS and produces the scaling law $f^* \sim Ra^{0.5}$.</description>

      <title>Strong Szeg\H{o} Limit Theorems for Multi-Bordered, Framed, and Multi-Framed Toeplitz Determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work provides the general framework for obtaining strong Szeg\H{o} limit theorems for multi-bordered, semi-framed, framed, and multi-framed Toeplitz determinants, extending the results of Basor et al. (2022) beyond the (single) bordered Toeplitz case. For the two-bordered and also the semi-framed Toeplitz determinants, we compute the strong Szeg\H{o} limit theorems associated with certain classes of symbols, and for the $k$-bordered (${k \geq 3}$), framed, and multi-framed Toeplitz determinants we demonstrate the recursive fashion offered by the Dodgson condensation identities via which strong Szeg\H{o} limit theorems can be obtained. One instance of appearance of semi-framed Toeplitz determinants is in calculations related to the entanglement entropy for disjoint subsystems in the XX spin chain (Brightmore et al. (2020) and Jin-Korepin (2011)). In addition, in the recent work Gharakhloo and Liechty (2024) and in an unpublished work of Professor Nicholas Witte, such determinants have found relevance respectively in the study of ensembles of nonintersecting paths and in the study of off-diagonal correlations of the anisotropic square-lattice Ising model. Besides the intrinsic mathematical interest in these structured determinants, the aforementioned applications have further motivated the study of the present work.</description>

      <title>Uplifting edges in higher order networks: spectral centralities for non-uniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral analysis of networks states that many structural properties of graphs, such as centrality of their nodes, are given in terms of their adjacency matrices. The natural extension of such spectral analysis to higher order networks is strongly limited by the fact that a given hypergraph could have several different adjacency hypermatrices, hence the results obtained so far are mainly restricted to the class of uniform hypergraphs, which leaves many real systems unattended. A new method for analysing non-linear eigenvector-like centrality measures of non-uniform hypergraphs is presented in this paper that could be useful for studying properties of $\mathcal{H}$-eigenvectors and $\mathcal{Z}$-eigenvectors in the non-uniform case. In order to do so, a new operation - the $\textit{uplift}$ - is introduced, incorporating auxiliary nodes in the hypergraph to allow for a uniform-like analysis. We later argue why this is a mathematically sound operation, and we furthermore use it to classify a whole family of hypergraphs with unique Perron-like $\mathcal{Z}$-eigenvectors. We supplement the theoretical analysis with several examples and numerical simulations on synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Generalized Stein's lemma and asymptotic equipartition property for subalgebra entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum Stein's lemma is a fundamental result of quantum hypothesis testing in the context of distinguishing two quantum states. A recent conjecture, known as the ``generalized quantum Stein's lemma", asserts that this result is true in a general framework where one of the states is replaced by convex sets of quantum states. In this work, we show that the assertion of the generalized Stein's lemma is true for the setting where the second hypothesis is the state space of any subalgebra $\mathcal{N}$. This is obtained through a strong asymptotic equipartition property for smooth subalgebra entropies that applies for any fixed smoothing parameter $\epsilon\in (0,1)$. As an application in resource theory, we show that the relative entropy of a subalgebra is the asymptotic dilution cost under suitable operations. This provides a scope to establish a connection between different quantum resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we fix the complex structure and explore the moduli space of the heterotic system by considering two different yet "dual" deformation paths starting from a K\"ahler solution. They correspond to deformation along the Bott-Chern cohomology class and the Aeppli cohomology class respectively. Using the implicit function theorem, we prove the local existence of heterotic solutions along these two paths and hence establish an initial step to construct local moduli coordinates around a K\"ahler solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.18004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a gauge theory model on the 4-dimensional $\rho$-Minkowski space-time, a particular deformation of the Minkowski space-time recently considered. The corresponding star product results from a combination of Weyl quantization map and properties of the convolution algebra of the special Euclidean group. We use noncommutative differential calculi based on twisted derivations together with a twisted notion of noncommutative connection. The twisted derivations pertain to the Hopf algebra of $\rho$-deformed translations, a Hopf subalgebra of the $\rho$-deformed Poincar\'e algebra which can be viewed as defining the quantum symmetries of the $\rho$-Minkowski space-time. The gauge theory model is left invariant under the action of the $\rho$-deformed Poincar\'e algebra. The kinetic part of the action is found to coincide with the one of the usual (commutative) electrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02153v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The soliton-like superradiant regime of free-electron lasers (FEL) offers a promising path towards ultrashort pulses, beyond the natural limit dictated by the bandwidth of the high-gain FEL instability. In this work we present a three-dimensional theory of the superradiant regime, including the effects of beam emittance and energy spread. Our work takes advantage of recent developments in non-linear FEL theory to provide a fully analytical description of soliton-like superradiance. Our theory proves the existence of a diffraction-dominated steady-state regime in which the superradiant peak power grows indefinitely while leaving the pulse duration and on-axis intensity almost unchanged. These results are in excellent agreement with three-dimensional simulations and are supported by recent experimental results at the Linac Coherent Light Source. This work advances non-linear FEL theory and provides a theoretical framework for the next generation of attosecond x-ray FELs.</description>

      <title>Simplifications of Lax pairs for differential-difference equations by gauge transformations and (doubly) modified integrable equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12022v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix differential-difference Lax pairs play an essential role in the theory of integrable nonlinear differential-difference equations. We present sufficient conditions which allow one to simplify such a Lax pair by matrix gauge transformations. Furthermore, we describe a procedure for such a simplification and present applications of it to constructing new integrable equations connected by (non-invertible) discrete substitutions of Miura type to known equations with Lax pairs.
  Suppose that one has three (possibly multicomponent) equations $E$, $E_1$, $E_2$, a (Miura-type) discrete substitution from $E_1$ to $E$, and a discrete substitution from $E_2$ to $E_1$. Then $E_1$ and $E_2$ can be called a modified version of $E$ and a doubly modified version of $E$, respectively. We demonstrate how the above-mentioned procedure helps (in the considered examples) to construct modified and doubly modified versions of a given equation possessing a Lax pair satisfying certain conditions.
  The considered examples include scalar equations of Itoh-Narita-Bogoyavlensky type and $2$-component equations related to the Toda lattice. We present several new integrable equations connected by new discrete substitutions of Miura type to known equations.</description>

Abstract: We study the phase space of a particle moving in the gravitational field of a rotating black hole described by the Kerr metric from a geometrical perspective. In particular, we show the construction of a multidimensional generalization of the unstable periodic orbits, known as Normally Hyperbolic Invariant Manifold, and its stable and unstable invariant manifolds that direct the dynamics in the phase space. Those stable and unstable invariant manifolds divide the phase space and are robust under perturbations. To visualize the multidimensional invariant sets under the flow in the phase space, we use a method based on the arclength of the trajectories in phase space known as Lagrangian descriptors in the literature.</description>

      <title>On Hagedorn wavepackets associated with different Gaussians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07880v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hagedorn functions are carefully constructed generalizations of Hermite functions to the setting of many-dimensional squeezed and coupled harmonic systems. Wavepackets formed by superpositions of Hagedorn functions have been successfully used to solve the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation exactly in harmonic systems and variationally in anharmonic systems. For evaluating typical observables, such as position or kinetic energy, it is sufficient to consider orthonormal Hagedorn functions with a single Gaussian center. Here, we instead derive various relations between Hagedorn bases associated with different Gaussians, including their overlaps, which are necessary for evaluating quantities nonlocal in time, such as time correlation functions needed for computing spectra. First, we use the Bogoliubov transformation to obtain commutation relations between the ladder operators associated with different Gaussians. Then, instead of using numerical quadrature, we employ these commutation relations to derive exact recurrence relations for the overlap integrals between Hagedorn functions with different Gaussian centers. Finally, we present numerical experiments that demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our algebraic method as well as its suitability to treat problems in spectroscopy and chemical dynamics.</description>

Abstract: The current study aims to examine uncertainty relations for measurements from generalized equiangular tight frames. Informationally overcomplete measurements are a valuable tool in quantum information processing, including tomography and state estimation. The maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases are the most common case of such measurements. The existence of $d+1$ mutually unbiased bases is proved for $d$ being a prime power. More general classes of informationally overcomplete measurements have been proposed for various purposes. Measurements of interest are typically characterized by some inner structure maintaining the required properties. It leads to restrictions imposed on generated probabilities. To apply the considered measurements, these restrictions should be converted into information-theoretic terms. It is interesting that certain restrictions hold irrespectively to overcompleteness. To describe the amount of uncertainty quantitatively, we use the Tsallis and R\'{e}nyi entropies as well as probabilities of separate outcomes. The obtained results are based on estimation of the index of coincidence. The derived relations are briefly exemplified.</description>

      <title>Quantum space-time Poincar\'e inequality for Lindblad dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09115</link>

Abstract: We investigate the mixing properties of primitive hypocoercive Lindblad dynamics. By extending the variational framework originally developed for underdamped Langevin dynamics, we derive fully explicit and constructive exponential decay estimates for the convergence in the noncommutative $L^2$-norm. Our analysis relies on establishing a quantum analog of space-time Poincar\'{e} inequalities. To complement these hypocoercive estimates, we also analyze the limiting behavior of the spectral gap for Lindblad dynamics with a large coherent contribution, providing sharper convergence rate estimates in this asymptotic regime. A number of concrete examples are provided as applications of our theoretical results.</description>

Abstract: We consider labelings of a finite regular tree by a finite alphabet subject to restrictions specified by a nonnegative transition matrix, propose an algorithm for determining whether the set of possible configurations on the last row of the tree is independent of the symbol at the root, and prove that the algorithm succeeds in a bounded number of steps, provided that the dimension of the tree is greater than or equal to the maximum row sum of the transition matrix. (The question was motivated by calculation of topological pressure on trees and is an extension of the idea of primitivity for nonnegative matrices.)</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity of the Fidelity in Open Qudit Systems: Gate and Noise Dependence in High-dimensional Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15141</link>

Abstract: High-dimensional quantum computing has generated significant interest due to its potential to address scalability and error correction challenges faced by traditional qubit-based systems. This paper investigates the Average Gate Fidelity (AGF) of single qudit systems under Markovian noise in the Lindblad formalism, extending previous work by developing a comprehensive theoretical framework for the calculation of higher-order correction terms. We derive general expressions for the perturbative expansion of the Average Gate Infidelity (AGI) in terms of the environmental coupling coefficient and validate these with extensive numerical simulations, emphasizing the transition from linear to nonlinear behaviour in the strong coupling regime. Our findings highlight the dependence of AGI on qudit dimensionality, quantum gate choice, and noise strength, providing critical insights for optimising quantum gate design and error correction protocols. Additionally, we utilise our framework to identify universal bounds for the AGI in the strong coupling regime and explore the practical implications for enhancing the performance of near-term qudit architectures. This study offers a robust foundation for future research and development in high-dimensional quantum computing, contributing to the advancement of robust, high-fidelity quantum operations.</description>

      <title>Conceptual and formal groundwork for the study of resource dependence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A resource theory imposes a preorder over states, with one state being above another if the first can be converted to the second by a free operation, and where the set of free operations defines the notion of resourcefulness under study. In general, the location of a state in the preorder of one resource theory can constrain its location in the preorder of a different resource theory. It follows that there can be nontrivial dependence relations between different notions of resourcefulness. In this article, we lay out the conceptual and formal groundwork for the study of resource dependence relations. In particular, we note that the relations holding among a set of monotones that includes a complete set for each resource theory provides a full characterization of resource dependence relations. As an example, we consider three resource theories concerning the about-face asymmetry properties of a qubit along three mutually orthogonal axes on the Bloch ball, where about-face symmetry refers to a representation of $\mathbb{Z}_2$, consisting of the identity map and a $\pi$ rotation about the given axis. This example is sufficiently simple that we are able to derive a complete set of monotones for each resource theory and to determine all of the relations that hold among these monotones, thereby completely solving the problem of determining resource dependence relations. Nonetheless, we show that even in this simplest of examples, these relations are already quite nuanced.</description>

      <title>3d Gravity as a random ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give further evidence that the matrix-tensor model studied in \cite{belin2023} is dual to AdS$_{3}$ gravity including the sum over topologies. This provides a 3D version of the duality between JT gravity and an ensemble of random Hamiltonians, in which the matrix and tensor provide random CFT$_2$ data subject to a potential that incorporates the bootstrap constraints. We show how the Feynman rules of the ensemble produce a sum over all three-manifolds and how surgery is implemented by the matrix integral. The partition functions of the resulting 3d gravity theory agree with Virasoro TQFT (VTQFT) on a fixed, hyperbolic manifold. However, on non-hyperbolic geometries, our 3d gravity theory differs from VTQFT, leading to a difference in the eigenvalue statistics of the associated ensemble. As explained in \cite{belin2023}, the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations of the matrix-tensor integral play a crucial role in understanding how gravity emerges in the limit that the ensemble localizes to exact CFT's. We show how the SD equations can be translated into a combinatorial problem about three-manifolds.</description>

      <title>The differential of self-consistent transfer operators and the local convergence to equilibrium of mean field strongly coupled dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the differential of a self-consistent transfer operator at a fixed point of the operator itself and show that its spectral properties can be used to establish a kind of local exponential convergence to equilibrium: probability measures near the fixed point converge exponentially fast to the fixed point by the iteration of the transfer operator. This holds also in the strong coupling case. We also show that for mean field coupled systems satisfying uniformly a Lasota-Yorke inequality also the differential does. We present examples of application of the general results to deterministic expanding maps outside the weak coupling regime.</description>
