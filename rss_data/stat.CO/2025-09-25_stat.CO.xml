      <title>Stochastic Path Planning in Correlated Obstacle Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Stochastic Correlated Obstacle Scene (SCOS) problem, a navigation setting with spatially correlated obstacles of uncertain blockage status, realistically constrained sensors that provide noisy readings and costly disambiguation. Modeling the spatial correlation with Gaussian Random Field (GRF), we develop Bayesian belief updates that refine blockage probabilities, and use the posteriors to reduce search space for efficiency. To find the optimal traversal policy, we propose a novel two-stage learning framework. An offline phase learns a robust base policy via optimistic policy iteration augmented with information bonus to encourage exploration in informative regions, followed by an online rollout policy with periodic base updates via a Bayesian mechanism for information adaptation. This framework supports both Monte Carlo point estimation and distributional reinforcement learning (RL) to learn full cost distributions, leading to stronger uncertainty quantification. We establish theoretical benefits of correlation-aware updating and convergence property under posterior sampling. Comprehensive empirical evaluations across varying obstacle densities, sensor capabilities demonstrate consistent performance gains over baselines. This framework addresses navigation challenges in environments with adversarial interruptions or clustered natural hazards.</description>

      <title>Diffusion and Flow-based Copulas: Forgetting and Remembering Dependencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Copulas are a fundamental tool for modelling multivariate dependencies in data, forming the method of choice in diverse fields and applications. However, the adoption of existing models for multimodal and high-dimensional dependencies is hindered by restrictive assumptions and poor scaling. In this work, we present methods for modelling copulas based on the principles of diffusions and flows. We design two processes that progressively forget inter-variable dependencies while leaving dimension-wise distributions unaffected, provably defining valid copulas at all times. We show how to obtain copula models by learning to remember the forgotten dependencies from each process, theoretically recovering the true copula at optimality. The first instantiation of our framework focuses on direct density estimation, while the second specialises in expedient sampling. Empirically, we demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed methods over state-of-the-art copula approaches in modelling complex and high-dimensional dependencies from scientific datasets and images. Our work enhances the representational power of copula models, empowering applications and paving the way for their adoption on larger scales and more challenging domains.</description>

      <title>Generalized Bayesian Inference for Dynamic Random Dot Product Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The random dot product graph is a popular model for network data with extensions that accommodate dynamic (time-varying) networks. However, two significant deficiencies exist in the dynamic random dot product graph literature: (1) no coherent Bayesian way to update one's prior beliefs about the latent positions in dynamic random dot product graphs due to their complicated constraints, and (2) no approach to forecast future networks with meaningful uncertainty quantification. This work proposes a generalized Bayesian framework that addresses these needs using a Gibbs posterior that represents a coherent updating of Bayesian beliefs based on a least-squares loss function. We establish the consistency and contraction rate of this Gibbs posterior under commonly adopted Gaussian random walk priors. For estimation, we develop a fast Gibbs sampler with a time complexity for sampling the latent positions that is linear in the observed edges in the dynamic network, which is substantially faster than existing exact samplers. Simulations and an application to forecasting international conflicts show that the proposed method's in-sample and forecasting performance outperforms competitors.</description>

      <title>Spectrally Deconfounded Random Forests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a modification of Random Forests to estimate functions when unobserved confounding variables are present. The technique is tailored for high-dimensional settings with many observed covariates. We use spectral deconfounding techniques to minimize a deconfounded version of the least squares objective, resulting in the Spectrally Deconfounded Random Forests (SDForests). We show how the omitted variable bias gets small given some assumptions. We compare the performance of SDForests to classical Random Forests in a simulation study and a semi-synthetic setting using single-cell gene expression data. Empirical results suggest that SDForests outperform classical Random Forests in estimating the direct regression function, even if the theoretical assumptions, requiring linear and dense confounding, are not perfectly met, and that SDForests have comparable performance in the non-confounded case.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Geostatistics Using Predictive Stacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12414v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop Bayesian predictive stacking for geostatistical models, where the primary inferential objective is to provide inference on the latent spatial random field and conduct spatial predictions at arbitrary locations. We exploit analytically tractable posterior distributions for regression coefficients of predictors and the realizations of the spatial process conditional upon process parameters. We subsequently combine such inference by stacking these models across the range of values of the hyper-parameters. We devise stacking of means and posterior densities in a manner that is computationally efficient without resorting to iterative algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and can exploit the benefits of parallel computations. We offer novel theoretical insights into the resulting inference within an infill asymptotic paradigm and through empirical results showing that stacked inference is comparable to full sampling-based Bayesian inference at a significantly lower computational cost.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Heritability of Longitudinal Rate-of-Change: Genetic Insights into PSA Velocity in Prostate Cancer-Free Individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is widely used for prostate cancer screening. While the genetics of PSA levels has been studied to enhance screening accuracy, the genetic basis of PSA velocity, the rate of PSA change over time, remains unclear. The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, a large, randomized study with longitudinal PSA data (15,260 cancer-free males, averaging 5.34 samples per subject) and genome-wide genotype data, provides a unique opportunity to estimate PSA velocity heritability. We developed a mixed model to jointly estimate heritability of PSA levels at age 54 and PSA velocity. To accommodate the large dataset, we implemented two efficient computational approaches: a partitioning and meta-analysis strategy using average information restricted maximum likelihood (AI-REML), and a fast restricted Haseman-Elston (REHE) regression method. Simulations showed that both methods yield unbiased estimates of both heritability metrics, with AI-REML providing smaller variability in the estimation of velocity heritability than REHE. Applying AI-REML to PLCO data, we estimated heritability at 0.32 (s.e. = 0.07) for baseline PSA and 0.45 (s.e. = 0.18) for PSA velocity. These findings reveal a substantial genetic contribution to PSA velocity, supporting future genome-wide studies to identify variants affecting PSA dynamics and improve PSA-based screening.</description>

      <title>Learning from geometry-aware near-misses to real-time COR: A spatiotemporal grouped random GEV framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time prediction of corridor-level crash occurrence risk (COR) remains challenging, as existing near-miss based extreme value models oversimplify collision geometry, exclude vehicle-infrastructure (V-I) interactions, and inadequately capture spatial heterogeneity in vehicle dynamics. This study introduces a geometry-aware two-dimensional time-to-collision (2D-TTC) indicator within a Hierarchical Bayesian spatiotemporal grouped random parameter (HBSGRP) framework using a non-stationary univariate generalized extreme value (UGEV) model to estimate short-term COR in urban corridors. High-resolution trajectories from the Argoverse-2 dataset, covering 28 locations along Miami's Biscayne Boulevard, were analyzed to extract extreme V-V and V-I near misses. The model incorporates dynamic variables and roadway features as covariates, with partial pooling across locations to address unobserved heterogeneity. Results show that the HBSGRP-UGEV framework outperforms fixed-parameter alternatives, reducing DIC by up to 7.5% for V-V and 3.1% for V-I near-misses. Predictive validation using ROC-AUC confirms strong performance: 0.89 for V-V segments, 0.82 for V-V intersections, 0.79 for V-I segments, and 0.75 for V-I intersections. Model interpretation reveals that relative speed and distance dominate V-V risks at intersections and segments, with deceleration critical in segments, while V-I risks are driven by speed, boundary proximity, and steering/heading adjustments. These findings highlight the value of a statistically rigorous, geometry-sensitive, and spatially adaptive modeling approach for proactive corridor-level safety management, supporting real-time interventions and long-term design strategies aligned with Vision Zero.</description>
