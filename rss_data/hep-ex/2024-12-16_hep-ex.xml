      <title>ATLAS EFT Results in the Top Quark Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With no direct evidence for new physics at the TeV scale, deviations from the Standard Model (SM) can be explored systematically through Effective Field Theories (EFTs) such as the Standard Model EFT (SMEFT). SMEFT extends the SM by introducing higher-dimensional operators parametrized by Wilson coefficients, offering a framework to probe beyond the SM (BSM) effects. This contribution highlights three recent analyses using the ATLAS Run-2 dataset at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 140 $\text{fb}^{-1}$. Combined measurements improve the sensitivity to Wilson coefficients by reducing degeneracies and tightening constraints, exploring the potential of SMEFT in the top quark sector.</description>

      <title>Searching for long-lived dark scalars at the FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the search for long-lived dark scalars from exotic Higgs boson decays at the Future Circular Collider in its $e^+e^-$ stage, FCC-ee, considering an integrated luminosity of 10.8 $\text{ab}^{-1}$ collected during the ZH run at a center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=240$ GeV. The work considers $Zh$ events where the $Z$ boson decays leptonically and the Higgs boson $h$ decays into two long-lived dark scalars $s$ which further decay into bottom anti-bottom quark pairs. The analysis is performed using a parametrized simulation of the IDEA detector concept and targets dark scalar decays in the tracking volume, resulting in multiple displaced vertices in the final state. The sensitivity towards long-lived dark scalars at FCC-ee is estimated using an event selection requiring two opposite-charge, same-flavor leptons compatible with the $Z$ boson, and at least two displaced vertices in the final state. The selection is seen to efficiently remove the Standard Model background, while retaining sensitivity for dark scalar masses between $m_s=20$ GeV and $m_s=60$ GeV and mean proper lifetimes $c\tau$ between approximately 10 mm and 10 m The results show that the search strategy has potential to probe Higgs to dark scalar branching ratios as low as $10^{-4}$ for a mean proper lifetime $c\tau\approx 1$ m. The results provide the first sensitivity estimate for exotic Higgs decays at FCC-ee with the IDEA detector concept, using the common FCC framework.</description>

      <title>Signal and Power transmission over Fiber in the DUNE Far Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the far detectors of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) will be instrumented with a Vertical Drift Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (VD LArTPC). It will also be equipped with a Photo-Detection System (PDS), which determines the time of interaction of non-beam events, as well as contributing to the energy reconstruction. The characteristics of this new type of LArTPC required an innovative approach to the placement of the photo-detectors. In order to achieve a high light yield and uniform coverage of the detector, the PDS detectors in the VD LArTPC will be placed not only on the membrane walls of the cryostat, but also on the high voltage surface of the TPC's cathode. Such placement enhances the coverage of the PDS but presents an important technical challenge, since the powering and signal readout of the detectors must be done using non-conducting materials. To this end the Power-over-Fiber and Signal-over-Fiber transmission technologies were developed within the DUNE collaboration, opening a door to further enhance the coverage of future PD systems. This document will describe the technical solutions developed to this end, as well as presenting the final performance results from laboratory characterization of the devices and the prototype testing campaigns carried out at the CERN Neutrino Platform.</description>

      <title>Probing Millicharged Particles at an Electron Beam Dump with Ultralow-Threshold Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to search for millicharged particles produced in high-intensity electron beam dumps using small ultralow-threshold sensors. As a concrete example, we consider a Skipper-CCD placed behind the beam dump in Hall A at Jefferson Lab. We compute the millicharged particle flux, including both electromagnetic cascade and meson productions emanating from an aluminum target. We find that the sensitivity of a modest 2x14 array of Skipper-CCDs can exceed the sensitivity of all existing searches for millicharged particle masses below 1.5 GeV, and is either competitive or world leading when compared to other proposed experiments. Our results demonstrate that small-scale ultralow threshold silicon devices can enhance the reach of accelerator-based experiments, while fitting comfortably within existing experimental halls.</description>

      <title>Direct detection of boosted dark matter in two component dark matter scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the detection of boosted dark matter in a two component dark matter model with the hidden gauge $U(1)_D$ symmetry. The model introduces heavy and light fermionic dark matter components, where the heavy dark matter annihilation in the Galactic center boosts the light dark matter. Directional direct detection experiments, such as NEWSdm, are suitable for testing the boosted scenario by focusing on signals from the Galactic center. We found that the expected event rate could reach up to O(10) events per year per 5 kg of the detector material.</description>

      <title>Measurements of global and local spin polarization of $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ in Au+Au collisions from the RHIC Beam Energy Scan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the measurements of $\Lambda$ hyperons' global and local spin polarization from second phase of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES-II) in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 7.7--27 GeV. Global polarization measurements of $\bar{\Lambda}$ and $\Lambda$ show no significant differences, offering insights into the late-stage evolution of the magnetic field. The new measurements of the local polarization of $\Lambda$ perpendicular to the reaction plane ($\langle P_{2,y} \rangle$) shows a monotonic increase with decreasing collision energy, while the component along the beam direction ($\langle P_{2,z} \rangle$) for both $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ is small in magnitude with no strong energy dependence. The net local polarization observable, $\langle P_{2,y}^{net} \rangle =\langle P_{2,y}(\Lambda) \rangle - \langle P_{2,y}(\bar{\Lambda})\rangle$ and $\langle P_{2,z}^{net} \rangle = \langle P_{2,z}(\Lambda) \rangle - \langle P_{2,z}(\bar{\Lambda} \rangle)$ designed to probe baryonic spin Hall effect, is consistent with zero with large uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Beam test results of a fully 3D-printed plastic scintillator particle detector prototype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10174v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plastic scintillators are widely used for the detection of elementary particles, and 3D reconstruction of particle tracks is achieved by segmenting the detector into 3D granular structures. In this study, we present a novel prototype fabricated by additive manufacturing, consisting of a 5 x 5 x 5 array of 1 cm3 plastic scintillator cubes, each optically isolated. This innovative approach eliminates the need to construct complex monolithic geometries in a single operation and gets rid of the traditional time-consuming manufacturing and assembling processes. The prototype underwent performance characterization during a beam test at CERN's Proton-Synchrotron facility. Light yield, optical crosstalk, and light response uniformity, were evaluated. The prototype demonstrated a consistent light yield of approximately 27 photoelectrons (p.e.) per channel, similar to traditional cast scintillator detectors. Crosstalk between adjacent cubes averaged 4-5%, and light yield uniformity within individual cubes exhibited about 7% variation, indicating stability and reproducibility. These results underscore the potential of the novel additive manufacturing technique, for efficient and reliable production of high-granularity scintillator detectors.</description>

      <title>Coherent radiation of modulated positron bunch formed in crystalline undulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A planar channeling of the positrons of a bunch taking into account medium polarization is considered, which entails it's radiation at both soft and hard photons at a zero angle. Spatially uniphase charged particles organized into a microbunch with a well-defined spatial phase distribution can emit coherent (synergistic or collective) radiation when the wavelength of the emitted radiation is comparable to or longer than the longitudinal size of the microbunch. This phenomenon can only occur in microundulators with account of the polarization. The crystalline undulator (CU) parameters (the spatial period and the amplitude) are chosen to preserve the channeling phenomenon of positrons and the coherence of CU radiation (CUR) from positron microbunches. The gain of spontaneous radiation hinges on the modulation depth of a microbunch. The latter, an important parameter of a bunch, will also be possible to determine as a result of the proposed experiment. A numerical analysis has been conducted for a specific scenario involving CUR generated by a positron bunch modulated during the SASE FEL process at the wavelength corresponding to the SASE FEL.</description>

      <title>Physics Instrument Design with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a case for the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for the design of physics instrument as an alternative to gradient-based instrument-optimization methods. It's applicability is demonstrated using two empirical studies. One is longitudinal segmentation of calorimeters and the second is both transverse segmentation as well longitudinal placement of trackers in a spectrometer. Based on these experiments, we propose an alternative approach that offers unique advantages over differentiable programming and surrogate-based differentiable design optimization methods. First, Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms possess inherent exploratory capabilities, which help mitigate the risk of convergence to local optima. Second, this approach eliminates the necessity of constraining the design to a predefined detector model with fixed parameters. Instead, it allows for the flexible placement of a variable number of detector components and facilitates discrete decision-making. We then discuss the road map of how this idea can be extended into designing very complex instruments. The presented study sets the stage for a novel framework in physics instrument design, offering a scalable and efficient framework that can be pivotal for future projects such as the Future Circular Collider (FCC), where most optimized detectors are essential for exploring physics at unprecedented energy scales.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity to $\mathcal{CP}$-violating effective couplings in the top-Higgs sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe requires new sources of charge-parity ($\mathcal{CP}$) violation beyond those in the Standard Model. In this work, we investigate $\mathcal{CP}$-violating effects in the top-Higgs sector using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework. Focusing on top-pair production in association with a Higgs boson and single top-Higgs associated production at the LHC, we study $\mathcal{CP}$ violation in the top-Higgs Yukawa coupling and other Higgs and top interactions entering these processes. By analysing $\mathcal{CP}$-sensitive differential observables and asymmetries, we provide direct constraints on $\mathcal{CP}$-violating interactions in the top-Higgs sector. Our analysis demonstrates how combining $t\bar{t}h$ and $thj$ production can disentangle the real and imaginary components of the top-Yukawa coupling, offering valuable insights into potential sources of $\mathcal{CP}$ violation. The sensitivity of these observables to SMEFT operators provides model-independent constraints on the parameter space, advancing the search for new physics in the top-Higgs sector.</description>

      <title>Neutrino-Portal Dark Matter Detection Prospects at a Future Muon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With no concrete evidence for non-gravitational interactions of dark matter to date, it is natural to wonder whether dark matter couples predominantly to the Standard Model (SM)'s neutrinos. Neutrino interactions (and the possible existence of additional neutrinophilic mediators) are substantially less understood than those of other SM particles, yet this picture will change dramatically in the coming decades with new neutrino sources. One potential new source arises with the construction of a high-energy muon collider (MuCol) -- due to muons' instability, a MuCol is a source of high-energy collimated neutrinos. Importantly, since the physics of muon decays (into neutrinos) is very well-understood, this leads to a neutrino flux with systematic uncertainties far smaller than fluxes from conventional high-energy (proton-sourced) neutrino beams. In this work, we study the capabilities of a potential neutrino detector, "MuCol$\nu$," placed ${\sim}$100 m downstream of the MuCol interaction point. The MuCol$\nu$ detector would be especially capable of searching for a neutrinophilic mediator $\phi$ through the mono-neutrino scattering process $\nu_\mu N \to \mu^+ \phi X$, exceeding searches from other terrestrial approaches for $m_\phi$ in the ${\sim}$few MeV -- ten GeV range. Even with a $10$ kg-yr exposure, MuCol$\nu$ is capable of searching for well-motivated classes of thermal freeze-out and freeze-in neutrino-portal dark matter.</description>

Abstract: A novel point cloud diffusion model for relativistic heavy-ion collisions, capable of ultra-fast generation of event-by-event collision output, is introduced. When trained on UrQMD cascade simulations, the model generates realistic collision event output containing 26 distinct hadron species, as a list of particle momentum vectors along with their particle ID. From solving inverse problems to accelerating model calculations or detector simulations, the model can be a promising general purpose tool for heavy-ion collisions beneficial to both theoretical studies and experimental applications.</description>

      <title>Measuring the molecular Migdal effect with neutron scattering on diatomic gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08866v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Migdal effect is a key inelastic signal channel which could be used to detect low-mass dark matter, but it has never been observed experimentally using Standard Model probes. Here we propose a conceptual design for an experiment which could detect the Migdal effect in diatomic molecules through low-energy neutron scattering, and we provide the requirements on the beam spectrum and reducible backgrounds such that a detection may be achieved. The enhancement of the Migdal rate through non-adiabatic couplings, which are absent in isolated atoms, combined with the distinctive photon energies of electronic transitions in CO, suggest that a positive detection of the molecular Migdal effect may be possible with modest beam times at existing neutron facilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The identification of top quark decays where the top quark has a large momentum transverse to the beam axis, known as $top$ $tagging$, is a crucial component in many measurements of Standard Model processes and searches for beyond the Standard Model physics at the Large Hadron Collider. Machine learning techniques have improved the performance of top tagging algorithms, but the size of the systematic uncertainties for all proposed algorithms has not been systematically studied. This paper presents the performance of several machine learning based top tagging algorithms on a dataset constructed from simulated proton-proton collision events measured with the ATLAS detector at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. The systematic uncertainties associated with these algorithms are estimated through an approximate procedure that is not meant to be used in a physics analysis, but is appropriate for the level of precision required for this study. The most performant algorithms are found to have the largest uncertainties, motivating the development of methods to reduce these uncertainties without compromising performance. To enable such efforts in the wider scientific community, the datasets used in this paper are made publicly available.</description>

Abstract: Neutron tagging is a fundamental technique for electron anti-neutrino detection via the inverse beta decay channel. A reported discrepancy in neutron detection efficiency between observational data and simulation predictions prompted an investigation into neutron capture modeling in Geant4. The study revealed that an overestimation of the thermal motion of hydrogen atoms in Geant4 impacts the fraction of captured nuclei. By manually modifying the Geant4 implementation, the simulation results align with calculations based on evaluated nuclear data and show good agreement with observables derived from the SK-Gd data.</description>

      <title>High gradient twin $e^+e^-$, $e^-e^-$ linear colliders with energy recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09758</link>

Abstract: Recently, a high energy superconducting (SC) \epem linear collider (LC) with energy recovery (ERLC) has been proposed where twin RF structures are used to avoid parasitic collisions in linacs. Such a collider could operate in a DC (duty cycle) or CW (continuous) modes, if sufficient power is available, with a luminosity of ${\cal O}(10^{36})$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ at $2E_0=250-500$ GeV. In this paper, it is noted that the luminosity in the ERLC is independent of the accelerating gradient (at the same total power). Therefore, the ERLC could operate at maximum available accelerating gradients. This paper considers for the first time an $e^-e^-$ twin collider with ER and estimates its achievable luminosity. Such an $e^-e^-$ collider is much simpler than an $e^+e^-$ one because beam recirculation is not needed. Travelling wave RF structures allow for higher gradients and reduced heat load. It is shown that an ERLC with accelerating gradient of $G=40$ MeV/m could operate in CW mode with $L_{e^+e^-} =$ (1 -- 2.5)$\times 10^{36}$ and $L_{e^-e^-} =$ (3 -- 7)$\times 10^{36}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for reasonable powers of 150 and 300 MW for $2E_0=250$ and $2E_0=500$ GeV, respectively. Such a machine is a promising candidate for a Higgs factory.</description>

      <title>The statistics and sensitivity of axion wind detection with the homogeneous precession domain of superfluid helium-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The homogeneous precession domain (HPD) of superfluid $^{3}$He has recently been identified as a detection medium which might provide sensitivity to the axion-nucleon coupling $g_{aNN}$ competitive with, or surpassing, existing experimental proposals. In this work, we make a detailed study of the statistical and dynamical properties of the HPD system in order to make realistic projections for a full-fledged experimental program. We include the effects of clock error and measurement error in a concrete readout scheme using superconducting qubits and quantum metrology. This work also provides a more general framework to describe the statistics associated with the axion gradient coupling through the treatment of a transient resonance with a non-stationary background in a time-series analysis. Incorporating an optimal data-taking and analysis strategy, we project a sensitivity approaching $g_{aNN} \sim 10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$ across a decade in axion mass.</description>

      <title>Parity and lepton masses in the left-right symmetric model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14480v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Curiously in the minimal left right symmetric model, chiral symmetry that protects the electron's mass ($m_e$), due to parity (P), implies in the symmetry limit the vanishing of its neutrino mixing angles. We break the chiral symmetry softly (or spontaneously if it is gauged) to generate the observed large neutrino mixing angles at the tree-level. The electron then acquires its mass on renormalization group equation (RGE) running due to its neutrino's mixing, and in turn determines the $B-L$ gauge symmetry breaking scale ($v_R$) to be $10^{10} GeV \lesssim v_R \leq 10^{15} GeV.$ If the muon's mass is also generated radiatively, the $B-L$ breaking scale is $\sim 10^{14-15}$ GeV. Regardless of the high scale of $v_R$, this is a testable model since on RGE running and P breaking, a large strong CP phase ($\bar{\theta} &gt;&gt; 10^{-10}$) which depends logarithmically on $v_R$ is generated if there is $\mathcal{O}(1)$ CP violation in leptonic Yukawa couplings. Hence we expect that leptonic CP phases including the Dirac CP phase $\delta_{CP}$ of the PMNS matrix must be consistent with $0$ or $180^o$ to within a degree, which can be verified or excluded by neutrino experiments such as DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande. In lieu of P, if charge conjugation C is used, the same results follow. However with C and no P, axions would likely need to be added anyway, in which case there is no constraint on $\delta_{CP}$.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network-Based Track Finding in the LHCb Vertex Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12119v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The next decade will see an order of magnitude increase in data collected by high-energy physics experiments, driven by the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). The reconstruction of charged particle trajectories (tracks) has always been a critical part of offline data processing pipelines. The complexity of HL-LHC data will however increasingly mandate track finding in all stages of an experiment's real-time processing. This paper presents a GNN-based track-finding pipeline tailored for the Run 3 LHCb experiment's vertex detector and benchmarks its physics performance and computational cost against existing classical algorithms on GPU architectures. A novelty of our work compared to existing GNN tracking pipelines is batched execution, in which the GPU evaluates the pipeline on hundreds of events in parallel. We evaluate the impact of neural-network quantisation on physics and computational performance, and comment on the outlook for GNN tracking algorithms for other parts of the LHCb track-finding pipeline.</description>

      <title>A Low-Cost, Low-Power Media Converter Solution for Next-Generation Detector Readout Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High Energy Physics (HEP) data acquisition systems are often built from high-end FPGAs. As such systems scale in the HL-LHC era, severe under-utilization of FPGA transceivers can occur because front-end links prioritize radiation hardness and power consumption over raw data bandwidth. This work evaluates recently introduced low-power, low-cost FPGA devices as an alternative building block for future readout architectures. This study presents the implementation of a readout back-End on FPGA where the front-end protocol is based on the Low-Power GigaBit Transceiver (lpGBT) and the readout protocol is based on 10 Gigabit Ethernet, using the LHCb Run 4 RICH detector as a practical case study.</description>
