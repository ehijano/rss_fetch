      <title>A numerical modeling of wave-inclined slats interaction for particle methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MPS-VG, a Virtual Grating (VG) model for the Lagrangian mesh-free Moving Particle Semi-implicit (MPS) method is proposed for replacing conventional particle-based solid modeling of gratings with a set of thin inclined slats. Unlike most approaches for perforated wave energy dampening devices, in which the flow through the device is simplified by pressure loss or damping effects without flow deflection, MPS-VG models the angular deviation caused by hydrodynamic impact on inclined slats. Both accuracy and computational performance of the model were checked through a simulation of wet dam break scenarios with the grating structures placed horizontally or vertically. The results were compared with those from fully particle-based modeling. MPS-VG correctly predicted complex wave-structure interactions using a relatively low-resolution model and significantly reduced processing time and memory storage compared to conventional particle-based MPS modeling. The evaluation of the performance of the gratings with inclined slats as wave energy dampers revealed the horizontal gratings outperformed the vertical ones. Therefore, qualitative and quantitative agreements strengthened the potential of MPS-VG as a practical and computationally efficient tool for the study of multi-scale phenomena of wave impacts on grating with inclined slats.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamically Beneficial School Configurations in Carangiform Swimmers: Insights from Flow-Physics Informed Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers have long debated which spatial arrangements and swimming synchronizations are beneficial for the hydrodynamic performance of fish in schools. In our previous work (Seo and Mittal, Bioinsp. Biomim., Vol. 17, 066020, 2022), we demonstrated using direct numerical simulations that hydrodynamic interactions with the wake of a leading carangiform swimmer could significantly enhance the swimming performance of a trailing swimmer by augmenting the leading-edge vortex (LEV) on its caudal fin. In this study, we develop a model based on the phenomenology of LEV enhancement, which utilizes wake velocity data from direct numerical simulations of a leading fish to predict the trailing swimmer's hydrodynamic performance without additional simulations. This approach enables a comprehensive analysis of the effects of relative positioning, phase difference, flapping amplitude, Reynolds number, and the number of swimmers in the school on thrust enhancement. The results offer several insights regarding the effect of these parameters that have implications for fish schools as well as for bio-inspired underwater vehicle applications. schooling.</description>

      <title>A Novel Simulation Approach for Evaporation Processes in Small Gaps of Industrial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long liquid retention times in industrial gaps, due to capillary effects, significantly affect product lifetime by facilitating corrosion on solid surfaces. Concentration-driven evaporation plays a major role in mitigating this corrosion. Accurate evaporation rate predictions are crucial for improved product design. However, simulating capillary-driven flows with evaporation in complex geometries is challenging, requiring consideration of surface tension, wetting, and phase-change effects. Traditional approaches, such as the Volume-of-Fluid method, are prone to curvature calculation errors and have long simulation times due to strict time step limitations. This study introduces a novel semi-transient simulation approach for fast evaporation rate prediction in arbitrarily shaped cavities. The approach involves a unidirectional coupling circuit, simulating the fluid surface in Surface Evolver and combining it with a vapor-in-gas diffusion simulation in OpenFOAM. The approach assumes that the evaporation rate is calculated solely based on the conditions at a given liquid filling level, without considering the evaporation history. This allows for highly parallelized simulations, achieving simulation runtimes in the order of 10 minutes to cover up to 150 hours of physical time. Numerical investigations are conducted for water evaporation in air at a temperature of 23{\deg}C and a relative humidity of 17%, for round and polygonal-shaped capillaries with inner diameters ranging from 1 mm to 13 mm. The results are validated using experimental data and show strong agreement. Simulations are also performed for complex industrial relevant gaps, demonstrating the applicability of the approach to a wide range of crevice geometries.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty in Elastic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastic turbulence can lead to to increased flow resistance, mixing and heat transfer. Its control -- either suppression or promotion -- has significant potential, and there is a concerted ongoing effort by the community to improve our understanding. Here we explore the dynamics of uncertainty in elastic turbulence, inspired by an approach recently applied to inertial turbulence in Ge et al. (2023) \textit{J. Fluid Mech.} 977:A17. We derive equations for the evolution of uncertainty measures, yielding insight on uncertainty growth mechanisms. Through numerical experiments, we identify four regimes of uncertainty evolution, characterised by I) rapid transfer to large scales, with large scale growth rates of $\tau^{6}$ (where $\tau$ represents time), II) a dissipative reduction of uncertainty, III) exponential growth at all scales, and IV) saturation. These regimes are governed by the interplay between advective and polymeric contributions (which tend to amplify uncertainty), viscous, relaxation and dissipation effects (which reduce uncertainty), and inertial contributions. In elastic turbulence, reducing Reynolds number increases uncertainty at short times, but does not significantly influence the growth of uncertainty at later times. At late times, the growth of uncertainty increases with Weissenberg number, with decreasing polymeric diffusivity, and with the logarithm of the maximum length scale, as large flow features adjust the balance of advective and relaxation effects. These findings provide insight into the dynamics of elastic turbulence, offering a new approach for the analysis of viscoelastic flow instabilities.</description>

      <title>Undulatory underwater swimming: Linking vortex dynamics, thrust, and wake structure with a biorobotic fish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flapping-based propulsive systems rely on fluid-structure interactions to produce thrust. At intermediate and high Reynolds numbers, vortex formation and organization in the wake of such systems are crucial for the generation of a propulsive force. In this work, we experimentally investigate the wake produced by a tethered robotic fish immersed in a water tunnel. By systematically varying the amplitude and frequency of the fish tail as well as the free-stream speed, we are able to observe and characterize different vortex streets as a function of the Strouhal number. The produced wakes are three-dimensional and exhibit a classical V-shape, mainly with two oblique trains of vortex rings convecting outward. Using two-dimensional Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in the mid-span plane behind the fish and through extensive data processing of the velocity and vorticity fields, we demonstrate the strong couplings at place between vortex dynamics, thrust production and wake structure. We first measure the evolution of the vortex velocity with the Strouhal number, and model it using a momentum balance equation directly related to thrust production. We then focus on the wake structure, such as wake angle as well as vortex ring orientation, diameter and vorticity. The wake structure is modelled in a simple geometrical framework where the vortex ring velocity is composed of the free-stream speed and the ring self-advecting speed. This framework is tested and validated by our experimental measurements as well as literature data collapsing on master curves, highlighting a universal behavior dominated by the Strouhal number. This allows us to establish a comprehensive understanding of how the wake structure varies with this number and, thus, thrust production.</description>

      <title>Amplitude blowup in compressible Euler flows without shock formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated that continuous self-similar radial Euler flows can
  drive primary (non-differentiated) flow variables to infinity at the center of motion.
  Among the variables that blow up at collapse is the pressure, and it is unsurprising that
  this type of behavior can generate an outgoing shock wave.
  In this work we prove that there is an alternative scenario in which an incoming,
  continuous 3-d flow suffers blowup, including in pressure,
  and yet remains continuous beyond collapse. We verify that this behavior is possible
  even in cases where the fluid is everywhere moving toward the center of motion at time of collapse.
  The results underscore the subtlety of shock formation in multi-dimensional flow.</description>

      <title>Community attitudes towards the environmental cost of computational fluid dynamics research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations underpin much fluid dynamics research today. Such simulations often rely on large scale high performance computing (HPC) systems, and have a significant carbon footprint. Increasing the efficiency of data centers or the proportion of electricity coming from renewable sources can lessen the environmental impact of scientific computing to a degree, but the attitudes of researchers also play a role. There are many choices researchers make which influence the carbon footprint of simulations. To change behaviours around simulation use, it is first necessary to understand attitudes toward them. Here, we present a case study on fluid dynamics researchers based in the University of Manchester, UK. We find a low awareness of the carbon footprint of computations, compounded by a lack of knowledge of the specific hardware used to run simulations. There is a discrepancy between researchers self-declared attitudes towards reducing the carbon footprint of their work, and their actions and choices. Overall, researchers did not consider carbon footprint as important in their decision making, and we found no correlation between the impact and carbon cost of simulations. Improved education and awareness of the environmental impact of simulations is imperative in the interests of the sustainability of this field.</description>

      <title>Optimal paths and dynamical symmetry breaking in the current fluctuations of driven diffusive media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large deviation theory provides a framework to understand macroscopic fluctuations and collective phenomena in many-body nonequilibrium systems in terms of microscopic dynamics. In these lecture notes we discuss the large deviation statistics of the current, a central observable out of equilibrium, using mostly macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT) but also microscopic spectral methods. Special emphasis is put on describing the optimal path leading to a rare fluctuation, as well as on different dynamical symmetry breaking phenomena that appear at the fluctuating level. We start with an overview of trajectory statistics in driven diffusive systems as described by MFT. We discuss the additivity principle, a simplifying conjecture to compute the current distribution in one-dimensional nonequilibrium systems, and extend this idea to higher dimensions, where the nonlocal structure of the optimal current vector field becomes crucial. Next we explore dynamical phase transitions (DPTs) in current fluctuations, which manifest as symmetry-breaking events in trajectory statistics. These include particle-hole symmetry-breaking DPTs in open channels, for which we work out a Landau-like theory as well as the joint statistics of the current and the order parameter. Time-translation symmetry-breaking DPTs in periodic systems are also discussed, where coherent traveling condensates emerge to facilitate current deviations. We also discuss the microscopic spectral mechanism leading to these DPTs, which is linked to an emerging degeneracy of the leading eigenspace. Using this spectral perspective, we find the signatures of the recently discovered time-crystal phases of matter in traveling-wave DPTs, and use Doob's transform to propose a packing-field mechanism to create programmable time-crystals in driven systems. Finally, we address open challenges and future directions in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Actuation manifold from snapshot data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven methodology to learn a low-dimensional manifold of controlled flows. The starting point is resolving snapshot flow data for a representative ensemble of actuations. Key enablers for the actuation manifold are isometric mapping as encoder and a combination of a neural network and a k-nearest-neighbour interpolation as decoder. This methodology is tested for the fluidic pinball, a cluster of three parallel cylinders perpendicular to the oncoming uniform flow. The centres of these cylinders are the vertices of an equilateral triangle pointing upstream. The flow is manipulated by constant rotation of the cylinders, i.e. described by three actuation parameters. The Reynolds number based on a cylinder diameter is chosen to be 30. The unforced flow yields statistically symmetric periodic shedding represented by a one-dimensional limit cycle. The proposed methodology yields a five-dimensional manifold describing a wide range of dynamics with small representation error. Interestingly, the manifold coordinates automatically unveil physically meaningful parameters. Two of them describe the downstream periodic vortex shedding. The other three describe the near-field actuation, i.e. the strength of boat-tailing, the Magnus effect and forward stagnation point. The manifold is shown to be a key enabler for control-oriented flow estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19320v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new open-source high-fidelity dataset for Machine Learning (ML) containing 355 geometric variants of the Windsor body, to help the development and testing of ML surrogate models for external automotive aerodynamics. Each Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation was run with a GPU-native high-fidelity Wall-Modeled Large-Eddy Simulations (WMLES) using a Cartesian immersed-boundary method using more than 280M cells to ensure the greatest possible accuracy. The dataset contains geometry variants that exhibits a wide range of flow characteristics that are representative of those observed on road-cars. The dataset itself contains the 3D time-averaged volume &amp; boundary data as well as the geometry and force &amp; moment coefficients. This paper discusses the validation of the underlying CFD methods as well as contents and structure of the dataset. To the authors knowledge, this represents the first, large-scale high-fidelity CFD dataset for the Windsor body with a permissive open-source license (CC-BY-SA).</description>

      <title>Emergence of capillary waves in miscible co-flowing fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17333v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that capillary waves can exist at the the boundary between miscible co-flowing fluids. We unveil that the interplay between transient interfacial stresses and confinement drives the progressive transition from the well-known inertial regime, characterized by a frequency independent wavenumber, $k\sim\omega^{0}$, to a capillary wave scaling, $k\sim\omega^{2/3}$, unexpected for miscible fluids. This allows us to measure the effective interfacial tension between miscible fluids and its rapid decay on time scales never probed so far, which we rationalize with a model going beyond square-gradient theories. Our work potentially opens a new avenue to measure transient interfacial tensions at the millisecond scale in a controlled manner.</description>

      <title>An Experimental Configuration to Study High-Enthalpy Radiating Flows Under Nonequilibrium De-excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an experimental configuration, called the Prandtl-Meyer plus duct arrangement (PMD), designed to study high-enthalpy radiating flows undergoing nonequilibrium de-excitation. The original design proposed by Wilson, developed without the benefit of modern computational fluid dynamics (CFD), was inadequate for generating a sufficiently large undisturbed zone or achieving a uniform flow along the centerline, necessitating further refinement. Consequently, significant modifications were implemented to enhance PMD's performance, resulting in an expanded undisturbed zone and a uniform centerline flow that facilitate the measurements of nonequilibrium de-excitation.} A general design method is introduced, combining theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to tailor the flow conditions for various research objectives. The implementation involves considerations of the shock tube conditions, PMD configuration, and the effective measurement zone. The interplay between shock tube conditions and airfoil geometry generates diverse de-excitation patterns. The shock tube test time, transition onset location, and radiance intensity determine the effective measurement zone. An example utilizing N2 as the test gas demonstrates the method, achieving one-dimensional flow with thermal nonequilibrium and chemical freezing along the centerline, validating the method's effectiveness. An effective measurement zone of 200 mm is obtained under this condition, and the primary constraint under high-enthalpy conditions is the limited shock tube test time due to the high shock velocity and low fill pressure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate perturbations in a rotational and incompressible fluid flow. Interested in the phenomenon analogous to the black hole ergoregion instability, we verify the influence of the vorticity in the instability associated with this fluid system, in the presence of a region in which the fluid flow velocity is greater than the speed of the perturbation. With this aim, we compute the quasinormal modes of the system, using two different numerical methods, obtaining an excellent numerical agreement between them. We find that the vorticity tends to diminish the ergoregion instability of the system.</description>
