      <title>Schottky-Invariant $p$-Adic Diffusion Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A parametrised diffusion operator on the regular domain $\Omega$ of a $p$-adic Schottky group is constructed. It is defined as an integral operator on the complex-valued functions on $\Omega$ which are invariant under the Schottky group $\Gamma$, where integration is against the measure defined by an invariant regular differential 1-form $\omega$. It is proven that the space of Schottky invariant $L^2$-functions on $\Omega$ outside the zeros of $\omega$ has an orthonormal basis consiting of $\Gamma$-invariant extensions of Kozyrev wavelets which are eigenfunctions of the operator. The eigenvalues are calculated, and it is shown that the heat equation for this operator provides a unique solution for its Cauchy problem with Schottky-invariant continuous initial conditions supportes outside the zero set of $\omega$, and gives rise to a strong Markov process on the corresponding orbit space for the Schottky group whose paths are c\`adl\`ag.</description>

      <title>Higher Dimensional Brill-Noether Loci and Moduli for Very Ample Line Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Brill-Noether loci for higher dimensional varieties. Let $M$ be a moduli space of coherent sheaves on $X$. The Brill-Noether loci of $M$ are the closed subsets $\{\mathcal{F} \in M : h^0(X,\mathcal{F}) \geq k+1\}$. When $X$ is a smooth curve and $M = \textbf{Pic}_X^d$, the space of degree $d$ line bundles on $X$, the Brill-Noether loci have a natural determinantal scheme structure coming from a map of vector bundles on $\textbf{Pic}_X^d$, which is the main tool in studying their geometry. In [CMR10], the authors generalize this to the case where $X$ is any variety and $M$ is the moduli space of stable vector bundles on $X$ with fixed invariants but require that $H^i(X,E) = 0$ for all $E \in M$ and $i \geq 2$. We generalize these results by showing how to give a natural determinantal scheme structure to the Brill-Noether loci for any $X$ and any $M$. In doing so we develop the theory of Fitting ideals for a complex which can be used to define natural scheme structures in other cases as well, such as the locus of points where the projective dimension of a coherent sheaf jumps up. As an application of our results, we construct moduli spaces for very ample line bundles on a variety.</description>

      <title>Quantum $K$-theory of Lagrangian Grassmannian via parabolic Peterson isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Schubert calculus in the torus-equivariant quantum $K$-ring of the Lagrangian Grassmannian $\mathrm{LG}(n)$. Our main tool is the $K$-theoretic Peterson map due to Kato. The map is from the (localized) equivariant $K$-homology ring $K_{*}^{T}(\mathrm{Gr}_{G})$ of the affine Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}_{G}$ of the symplectic group $G=\mathrm{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ to the (localized) torus-equivariant quantum $K$-ring $QK_{T}(\mathrm{LG}(n))$. We determine explicitly the kernel of this map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous work, we stated the conjecture that any semiring homomorphism between the Boolean function semirings on 1-dimensional tropical fans has the property called geometric. In this paper, we show that the conjecture is true. As an application, we establish a way to find all the morphisms between given 1-dimensional tropical fans.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a survey paper on recent work on syzygies of algebraic varieties. We discuss the gonality conjecture on weight-one syzygies of algebraic curves, syzygies of secant varieties of algebraic curves, syzygies of tangent developable surfaces and Green's conjecture on syzygies of canonical curves, and asymptotic syzygies of algebraic varieties. All results considered in this paper were proven using the geometry of symmetric products of algebraic curves.</description>

      <title>Projective structures and Hodge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every compact Riemann surface $X$ admits a natural projective structure $p_u$ as a consequence of the uniformization theorem. In this work we describe the construction of another natural projective structure on $X$, namely the Hodge projective structure $p_h$, related to the second fundamental form of the period map. We then describe how projective structures correspond to $(1,1)$-differential forms on the moduli space of projective curves and, from this correspondence, we deduce that $p_u$ and $p_h$ are not the same structure.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms of unstable ${\mathbb P}^1$-bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P\to X$ be a ${\mathbb P}^1$-bundle over a variety $X$. The aim of this note is to understand all connected, algebraic groups $$ \operatorname{Aut}^\circ(P)\subset G\subset \operatorname{Bir}( X\times {\mathbb P}^1). $$ We get a quite complete answer if $\operatorname{Aut}^\circ(X)$ is a maximal, connected, algebraic subgroup of $\operatorname{Bir}(X)$, and $P$ is sufficiently unstable.
  This gives examples of connected, algebraic subgroups of $\operatorname{Bir}({\mathbb P}^4)$ that are not contained in any maximal one.</description>

      <title>Motivic realization of rigid G-local systems on curves and tamely ramified geometric Langlands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a reductive group $G$, we prove that complex irreducible rigid $G$-local systems with quasi-unipotent monodromies and finite order abelianization on a smooth curve are motivic, generalizing a theorem of Katz for $GL_n$. We do so by showing that the Hecke eigensheaf corresponding to such a local system is itself motivic. Unlike other works in the subject, we work entirely over the complex numbers. In the setting of de Rham geometric Langlands, we prove the existence of Hecke eigensheaves associated to any irreducible $G$-local system with regular singularities. We also provide a spectral decomposition of a naturally defined automorphic category over the stack of regular singular local systems with prescribed eigenvalues of the local monodromies at infinity. Finally, we establish a relationship between rigidity for complex local systems and automorphic rigidity, answering a conjecture of Yun in the tame complex setting.</description>

      <title>A Topological Approach to Simple Descriptions of Convex Hulls of Sets Defined by Three Quadrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the convex hull of a set $S\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ defined by three quadratic inequalities. A simple way of generating inequalities valid on $S$ is to take nonnegative linear combinations of the defining inequalities of $S$. We call such inequalities aggregations. We introduce a new technique relating aggregations to properties of the spectral curve, i.e. the curve defined by the vanishing of the determinant polynomial, and utilizing known spectral sequences (Agrachev and Lerario, 2012). We find new families beyond those identified in (Dey, Mu\~noz, and Serrano, 2022; Blekherman, Dey, and Sun, 2024), where the convex hull is defined by aggregations. We also prove a characterization of the emptiness of the projective variety defined by $3$ homogeneous quadratics in terms of the spectral curve generalizing results of (Agrachev, 1988).</description>

      <title>Automorphisms and deformations of regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties can have moduli. To be precise, suppose $X$ is a regular semisimple Hessenberg variety, which is a divisor in the flag variety $G/B$, where $G$ is a simple algebraic group of rank $r$ over $\mathbb{C}$. Then we show that the space $\mathrm{H}^1(X,TX)$ of first order deformations of $X$ has dimension $r-1$ except in type $A_2$. (In type $A_2$, the Hessenberg varieties in question are all isomorphic to the permutahedral toric surface. So $\dim\mathrm{H}^1(X,TX) = 0$.) We also show that the connected component of the automorphism group of $X$ is the maximal torus of $G$, and we show that $\mathrm{H}^i(X,TX) = 0$ for $i \geq 2$.
  In type $A$, we can give an even more precise statement determining when two regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties, which are divisors in $G/B$, are isomorphic. We also compute the automorphism groups explicitly in type~$A_{n-1}$ in the terms of stabilizer subgroups of the action of the symmetric group $S_{n}$ on the moduli space $M_{0,n+1}$ of smooth genus $0$ curves with $n + 1$ marked points. Using this, we describe the moduli stack of the regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties $X$ explicitly as a quotient stack of $M_{0,n+1}$.
  We prove several analogous results for Hessenberg varieties in generalized flag varieties. In type $A$, these are used in the proofs of the results for $G/B$, but they are also independently interesting because the associated moduli stacks are related directly to the action of $S_n$ on $M_{0,n}$.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Parabolic Picard Sheaf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth irreducible complex projective curve of genus $g\,\geq\, 2$, and let $D\,=\,x_1+\dots+x_r$ be a reduced effective divisor on $X$. Denote by $U_{\alpha}(L)$ the moduli space of stable parabolic bundles on $X$ of rank $n$, determinant $L$ of degree $d$ with flag type $\{k^i_j\}$ and generic parabolic weights $\{\alpha^i_j\}$ at each $x_i$, $1\, \leq\, i\,\leq \, r$. There is a universal family on $X\times U_{\alpha}(L)$; its direct image to $U_{\alpha}(L)$ is called the parabolic Picard sheaf. We prove that the parabolic Picard sheaf is stable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kim, Kresch and Oh defined unramified Gromov-Witten invariants. For a threefold, Pandharipande conjectured that they are equal to Gopakumar-Vafa invariants (BPS invariants) in the case of Fano classes and primitive Calabi-Yau classes. We prove the conjecture using a wall-crossing technique. This provides an algebro-geometric construction of Gopakumar-Vafa invariants in these cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a formula for the degrees of Ikeda and Naruse's $P$-Grothendieck polynomials using combinatorics of shifted tableaux. We show this formula can be used in conjunction with results of Hamaker, Marberg, and Pawlowski to obtain an upper bound on the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of certain Pfaffian varieties known as vexillary skew-symmetric matrix Schubert varieties. Similar combinatorics additionally yields a new formula for the degree of Grassmannian Grothendieck polynomials and the regularity of Grassmannian matrix Schubert varieties, complementing a 2021 formula of Rajchgot, Ren, Robichaux, St. Dizier, and Weigandt.</description>

Abstract: We discuss canonical local heights on abelian varieties over non-archimedean fields from the point of view of Berkovich analytic spaces. Our main result is a refinement of N\'eron's classical result relating canonical local heights with intersection multiplicities on the N\'eron model. We also revisit Tate's explicit formulas for N\'eron's canonical local heights on elliptic curves. Our results can be viewed as extensions of Tate's formulas to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>One-form symmetries and the 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $A$-model: Topologically twisted indices for any $G$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric Chern-Simons-matter gauge theories with a one-form symmetry in the $A$-model formalism on $\Sigma_g\times S^1$. We explicitly compute expectation values of topological line operators that implement the one-form symmetry. This allows us to compute the topologically twisted index on the closed Riemann surface $\Sigma_g$ for any real compact gauge group $G$. All computations are carried out in the effective $A$-model on $\Sigma_g$, whose ground states are the so-called Bethe vacua. We discuss how the 3d one-form symmetry acts on the Bethe vacua, and how its 't Hooft anomaly constrains the vacuum structure. In the special case of the $SU(N)_K$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons theory, we obtain results for the $(SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_r)^{\theta}_K$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons theories, for all non-anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_r \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_N$ subgroups of the center of the gauge group, and with the associated $\mathbb{Z}_r$ $\theta$-angle turned on, reproducing and extending various results in the literature. In particular, we find an interesting mixed 't Hooft anomaly between gravity and the $\mathbb{Z}_r$ one-form symmetry of the $SU(N)_K$ theory (for $N$ even, $\frac{N}{r}$ odd and $\frac{K}{r}$ even). This plays a key role in our derivation of the Witten index, which we explicitly compute for any $N$, $K$ and $r$ in terms of refinements of Jordan's totient function. Our results lead to precise conjectures about integrality of indices, which appear to have a strong number-theoretic flavour. Note: this paper directly builds upon unpublished notes by Brian Willett from 2020.</description>

      <title>A geometric approach to functional equations for general multiple Dirichlet series over function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sawin recently gave an axiomatic characterization of multiple Dirichlet series over the function field $\mathbb{F}_{q}(T)$ and proved their existence by exhibiting the coefficients as trace functions of specific perverse sheaves. However, he did not prove that these series actually converge anywhere, instead treating them as formal power series.
  In this paper, we prove that these series do converge in a certain region, and moreover that the functions obtained by analytically continuing them satisfy functional equations.
  For convergence, it suffices to obtain bounds on the coefficients, for which we use the decomposition theorem for perverse sheaves, in combination with the Kontsevich moduli space of stable maps to construct a suitable compactification.
  For the functional equations, the key identity is a multi-variable generalization of the relationship between a Dirichlet character and its Fourier transform; in the multiple Dirichlet series setting, this uses a density trick for simple perverse sheaves and an explicit formula for intermediate extensions from the complement of a normal crossings divisor.</description>

      <title>Some Singular Examples of Relative Langlands Duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relative Langlands duality structures the study of automorphic periods around a putative duality between certain group actions of Langlands dual reductive groups.
  In this article, after giving a self-contained exposition of the relevant ingredients from relative Langlands duality, we examine this proposal for some interesting pairs of singular spaces: one pair arising from the cone of nilpotent (3 x 3)-matrices, and the other pair arising from the nilpotent cone of (2,2,2)-tensors. These relate, respectively, to Rankin--Selberg integrals discovered by Ginzburg and Garrett.</description>

      <title>Relative Langlands Duality of Toric Periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relative Langlands program introduced by Ben-Zvi--Sakellaridis--Venkatesh posits a duality structure exchanging automorphic periods and L-functions, which can be encoded by pairs of dual Hamiltonian actions. In work of the author and Venkatesh, an extension of the definitions to certain singular spaces was made with the objective of restoring duality in some well-known automorphic integrals. In this companion article we apply these definitions to establish duality in the context of affine toric varieties, and study finer structures regarding regularization and stabilizers that are instructive for the general case.</description>

      <title>Prismatic $F$-crystals and Wach modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show a direct equivalence between the category of analytic/completed prismatic $F$-crystals on the absolute prismatic site of a small (unramified at $p$) base ring and the category of relative Wach modules from the theory of $(\varphi, \Gamma)$-modules. The result is obtained by showing that the data of the Galois action on a Wach module is equivalent to the data of a prismatic stratification on the underlying $\varphi$-module.</description>

      <title>On Postnikov completeness for replete topoi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the hypercomplete $\infty$-topos associated with any replete topos is Postnikov complete, positively answering a question of Bhatt and Scholze; this will be deduced from the Milnor sequences for sheaves of spaces on replete topoi that we construct. As a corollary, we generalize a result of To\"en on affine stacks.</description>

      <title>Morphisms of character varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10135v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field, let $H \subset G$ be (possibly disconnected) reductive groups over $k$, and let $\Gamma$ be a finitely generated group. Vinberg and Martin have shown that the induced morphism of character varieties \[ \underline{\mathrm{Hom}}_{k\textrm{-gp}}(\Gamma, H)//H \to \underline{\mathrm{Hom}}_{k\textrm{-gp}}(\Gamma, G)//G \] is finite. In this note, we generalize this result (with a significantly different proof) by replacing $k$ with an arbitrary locally noetherian scheme, answering a question of Dat. Along the way, we use Bruhat-Tits theory to establish a few apparently new results about integral models of reductive groups over discrete valuation rings.</description>

      <title>Heat Equations and Hearing the Genus on p-adic Mumford Curves via Automorphic Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A self-adjoint operator is constructed on the $L_2$-functions on the $K$-rational points $X(K)$ of a Mumford curve $X$ defined over a non-archimedean local field $K$. It generates a Feller semi-group, and the corresponding heat equation describes a Markov process on $X(K)$. Its spectrum is non-positive, contains zero and has finitely many limit points which are the only non-eigenvalues, and correspond to the zeros of a given regular differential 1-form on $X(K)$. This allows to recover the genus of X from the spectrum. The hyperelliptic case allows in principle an explicit genus extraction.</description>

      <title>Weak abelian direct summands and irreducibility of Galois representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\rho_\ell$ be a semisimple $\ell$-adic representation of a number field $K$ that is unramified almost everywhere. We introduce a new notion called weak abelian direct summands of $\rho_\ell$ and completely characterize them, for example, if the algebraic monodromy of $\rho_\ell$ is connected. If $\rho_\ell$ is in addition $E$-rational for some number field $E$, we prove that the weak abelian direct summands are locally algebraic (and thus de Rham). We also show that the weak abelian parts of a connected semisimple Serre compatible system form again such a system.
  Using our results on weak abelian direct summands, when $K$ is totally real and $\rho_\ell$ is the three-dimensional $\ell$-adic representation attached to a regular algebraic cuspidal automorphic, not necessarily polarizable representation $\pi$ of $\mathrm{GL}_3(\mathbb{A}_K)$ together with an isomorphism $\mathbb{C}\simeq \overline{\mathbb{Q}}_\ell$, we prove that $\rho_\ell$ is irreducible. We deduce in this case also some $\ell$-adic Hodge theoretic properties of $\rho_\ell$ if $\ell$ belongs to a Dirichlet density one set of primes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dualizability of sheaves on manifolds with isotropic singular supports $\operatorname{Sh}_\Lambda(M)$ and microsheaves with isotropic supports $\operatorname{\mu sh}_\Lambda(\Lambda)$ and obtain a classification result of colimit-preserving functors by convolutions of sheaf kernels. Moreover, for sheaves with isotropic singular supports and compact supports $\operatorname{Sh}_\Lambda^b(M)_0$, the standard categorical duality and Verdier duality are related by the wrap-once functor, which is the inverse Serre functor in proper objects, and we thus show that the Verdier duality extends naturally to all compact objects $\operatorname{Sh}_\Lambda^c(M)_0$ when the wrap-once functor is an equivalence, for instance, when $\Lambda$ is a full Legendrian stop or a swappable Legendrian stop.</description>
