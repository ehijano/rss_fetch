      <title>Optimizing In Vivo Data Acquisition for Robust Clinical Microvascular Imaging Using Ultrasound Localization Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) enables microvascular imaging at spatial resolutions beyond the acoustic diffraction limit, offering significant clinical potentials. However, ULM performance relies heavily on microbubble (MB) signal sparsity, the number of detected MBs, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), all of which vary in clinical scenarios involving bolus MB injections. These sources of variations underscore the need to optimize MB dosage, data acquisition timing, and imaging settings in order to standardize and optimize ULM of microvasculature. This pilot study investigated temporal changes in MB signals during bolus injections in both pig and human models to optimize data acquisition for clinical ULM. Quantitative indices were developed to evaluate MB signal quality, guiding selection of acquisition timing that balances the MB localization quality and adequate MB counts. The effects of transmitted voltage and dosage were also explored. In the pig model, a relatively short window (approximately 10 seconds) for optimal acquisition was identified during the rapid wash-out phase, highlighting the need for real-time MB signal monitoring during data acquisition. The slower wash-out phase in humans allowed for a more flexible imaging window of 1-2 minutes, while trade-offs were observed between localization quality and MB density (or acquisition length) at different wash-out phase timings. Guided by these findings, robust ULM imaging was achieved in both pig and human kidneys using a short period of data acquisition, demonstrating its feasibility in clinical practice. This study provides insights into optimizing data acquisition for consistent and reproducible ULM, paving the way for its standardization and broader clinical applications.</description>

      <title>An AI-directed analytical study on the optical transmission microscopic images of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in planktonic and biofilm states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biofilms are resistant microbial cell aggregates that pose risks to health and food industries and produce environmental contamination. Accurate and efficient detection and prevention of biofilms are challenging and demand interdisciplinary approaches. This multidisciplinary research reports the application of a deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) model for detecting biofilms produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa with high accuracy. Aptamer DNA templated silver nanocluster (Ag-NC) was used to prevent biofilm formation, which produced images of the planktonic states of the bacteria. Large-volume bright field images of bacterial biofilms were used to design the AI model. In particular, we used U-Net with ResNet encoder enhancement to segment biofilm images for AI analysis. Different degrees of biofilm structures can be efficiently detected using ResNet18 and ResNet34 backbones. The potential applications of this technique are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Agreement of Image Quality Metrics with Radiological Evaluation in the Presence of Motion Artifacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Reliable image quality assessment is crucial for evaluating new motion correction methods for magnetic resonance imaging. In this work, we compare the performance of commonly used reference-based and reference-free image quality metrics on a unique dataset with real motion artifacts. We further analyze the image quality metrics' robustness to typical pre-processing techniques.
  Methods: We compared five reference-based and five reference-free image quality metrics on data acquired with and without intentional motion (2D and 3D sequences). The metrics were recalculated seven times with varying pre-processing steps. The anonymized images were rated by radiologists and radiographers on a 1-5 Likert scale. Spearman correlation coefficients were computed to assess the relationship between image quality metrics and observer scores.
  Results: All reference-based image quality metrics showed strong correlation with observer assessments, with minor performance variations across sequences. Among reference-free metrics, Average Edge Strength offers the most promising results, as it consistently displayed stronger correlations across all sequences compared to the other reference-free metrics. Overall, the strongest correlation was achieved with percentile normalization and restricting the metric values to the skull-stripped brain region. In contrast, correlations were weaker when not applying any brain mask and using min-max or no normalization.
  Conclusion: Reference-based metrics reliably correlate with radiological evaluation across different sequences and datasets. Pre-processing steps, particularly normalization and brain masking, significantly influence the correlation values. Future research should focus on refining pre-processing techniques and exploring machine learning approaches for automated image quality evaluation.</description>

      <title>Alleviating the trade-off between coincidence time resolution and sensitivity using scalable TOF-DOI detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coincidence time resolution (CTR) in time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET) has significantly improved with advancements in scintillators, photodetectors, and readout electronics. Achieving a CTR of 100 ps remains challenging due to the need for sufficiently thick scintillators-typically 20 mm-to ensure adequate sensitivity because the photon transit time spread within these thick scintillators impedes achieving 100 ps CTR. Therefore, thinner scintillators are preferable for CTR better than 100 ps. To address the trade-off between TOF capability and sensitivity, we propose a readout scheme of PET detectors. The proposed scheme utilizes two orthogonally stacked one-dimensional PET detectors, enabling the thickness of the scintillators to be reduced to approximately 13 mm without compromising sensitivity. This is achieved by stacking the detectors along the depth-of-interaction (DOI) axis of a PET scanner. We refer to this design as the cross-stacked detector, or xDetector. Furthermore, the xDetector inherently provides DOI information using the same readout scheme. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that the xDetector achieved a CTR of 175 ps FWHM and an energy resolution of 11% FWHM at 511 keV with 3 x 3 x 12.8 mm3 lutetium oxyorthosilicate crystals, each coupled one-to-one with silicon photomultipliers. In terms of xy-spatial resolution, the xDetector exhibited an asymmetric resolution due to its readout scheme: one resolution was defined by the 3.2 mm readout pitch, while the other was calculated using the center-of-gravity method. The xDetector effectively resolves the trade-off between TOF capability and sensitivity while offering scalability and DOI capability. By integrating state-of-the-art scintillators, photodetectors, and readout electronics with the xDetector scheme, achieving a CTR of 100 ps FWHM alongside high DOI resolution becomes a practical possibility.</description>

      <title>On the improved performances of FLUKA v4-4.0 in out-of-field proton dosimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new model for the nuclear elastic scattering of protons below 250 MeV has been recently included in FLUKA v4-4.0, motivated by the evaluation of radiation effects in electronics. Nonetheless, proton nuclear elastic scattering plays a significant role also in proton dosimetry applications, for which the new model necessitated an explicit validation. Therefore, in this work a benchmark has been carried out against a recent measurement of radial-depth maps of absorbed dose in a water phantom under irradiation with protons of 100 MeV, 160 MeV, and 225 MeV. Two FLUKA versions have been employed to simulate these dose maps: v4-3.4, relying on a legacy model for proton nuclear elastic scattering, and v4-4.0, relying on the new model. The enhanced agreement with experimental absorbed doses obtained with FLUKA v4-4.0 is discussed, and the role played by proton nuclear elastic scattering, among other interaction mechanisms, in various regions of the radial-depth dose map is elucidated. Finally, the benchmark reported in this work is sensitive enough to showcase the importance of accurately characterizing beam parameters and the scattering geometry for Monte Carlo simulation purposes.</description>

      <title>Post-pandemic social contacts in Italy: implications for social distancing measures on in-person school and work attendance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collection of updated data on social contact patterns following the COVID-19 pandemic disruptions is crucial for future epidemiological assessments and evaluating non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) based on physical distancing. We conducted two waves of an online survey in March 2022 and March 2023 in Italy, gathering data from a representative population sample on direct (verbal/physical interactions) and indirect (prolonged co-location in indoor spaces) contacts. Using a generalized linear mixed model, we examined determinants of individuals' total social contacts and evaluated the potential impact of work-from-home and distance learning on the transmissibility of respiratory pathogens. In-person attendance at work or school emerged as a primary driver of social contacts. Adults attending in person reported a mean of 1.69 (95% CI: 1.56-1.84) times the contacts of those staying home; among children and adolescents, this ratio increased to 2.38 (95% CI: 1.98-2.87). We estimated that suspending all non-essential work alone would marginally reduce transmissibility. However, combining distance learning for all education levels with work-from-home policies could decrease transmissibility by up to 23.7% (95% CI: 18.2%-29.0%). Extending these measures to early childcare services would yield only minimal additional benefits. These results provide useful data for modelling the transmission of respiratory pathogens in Italy after the end of the COVID-19 emergency. They also provide insights into the potential epidemiological effectiveness of social distancing interventions targeting work and school attendance, supporting considerations on the balance between the expected benefits and their heavy societal costs.</description>
