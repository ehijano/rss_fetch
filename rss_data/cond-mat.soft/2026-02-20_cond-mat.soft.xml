      <title>How Continuous Symmetry Stabilizes the Ordered Phase of Polar Flocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of the ordered phase of compressible polar flocks against the nucleation of counter-propagating droplets, using a combination of analytical theory, microscopic and hydrodynamic simulations. For discrete-symmetry flocks, such droplets are known to always grow and propagate, making the ordered phase metastable. We explain how, on the contrary, continuous symmetry can stabilize the ordered phase at small enough noise by destabilizing the leading edge of growing droplets. Flocking models with continuous symmetries thus have a lower critical dimension than their discrete-symmetry counterparts, in contrast to equilibrium physics.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Chirality in Helical Polymers via a Geometric Extension of the Kremer-Grest Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality in polymeric systems enables a wide range of emergent optical, mechanical, and transport phenomena, yet a unified framework that quantitatively connects molecular-scale geometry to chiral behavior remains lacking. Existing theoretical descriptions typically emphasize either continuum models, such as the helical wormlike chain (HWLC), which neglect intermolecular interactions, or mesophase-level theories, which obscure the role of molecular geometry. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive framework for quantifying chirality in helical polymers by extending the Kremer-Grest bead-spring model to explicitly map intrinsic curvature and torsion onto bond angle and dihedral potentials. We establish direct theoretical relationships between helical parameters such as pitch and radius, and connect them to a normalized, dimensionless chirality characteristic, $\chi$ that captures local geometric correlations absent from conventional HWLC descriptions. Furthermore, using molecular dynamics simulations, we systematically quantify the influence of excluded volume interactions and thermal fluctuations on helical geometry and chirality, dispelling the common assumption that monotonic increases in chirality are associated only with decreasing pitch. Finally, we present a coarse-graining procedure that facilitates a direct comparison between experimental helical polymers and the Kremer-Grest helical chain, demonstrating quantitative agreement across a diverse set of polymer classes. This unified geometric and particle-based description provides a predictive roadmap for selecting and engineering chiral Kremer-Grest models and offers a general platform for designing polymeric materials with controlled and tunable chirality.</description>

      <title>Stockmayer Fluid with a Shifted Dipole: Bulk Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shifting the point dipole from the center of a Stockmayer particle is a simple geometric modification that has been explored previously, yet its implications for liquid structure, dielectric response, and phase behavior remain incompletely understood. Here, we combine molecular dynamics simulations with analytical theory to provide a unified physical interpretation of how dipole displacement reshapes microscopic correlations and propagates to macroscopic thermodynamic properties. We show that dipole shifting breaks the fore-aft symmetry of the local electrostatic field, producing only modest changes in radial packing but strong alterations in angular structure within the first solvation shell. Enhanced alignment near the dipole head is accompanied by frustrated orientational correlations near the tail, leading to broader angular distributions and a shift away from axial configurations at strong coupling. These structural asymmetries weaken cooperative ordering and result in a systematic reduction of the dielectric constant, despite locally stronger interactions. For large shifts, the dielectric response approaches the Debye limit, indicating effective suppression of dipole-dipole correlations. The same geometric frustration governs vapor-liquid equilibria: while increasing dipole strength raises the critical temperature, even modest shifts disrupt the highly polarized liquid states that emerge at strong coupling and can suppress ferroelectric-like ordering. Predictions from a reparameterized COFFEE theory capture these trends within its domain of validity, highlighting the direct connection between local orientational structure and macroscopic observables. Overall, this work demonstrates that dipole location, not only magnitude, provides a powerful control parameter in dipolar fluids and offers a clear framework for understanding geometric frustration in electrostatic liquids.</description>

      <title>Reverse segregation in dense granular flow through narrow vertical channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling flow-induced segregation in a granular mixture is highly relevant to many industrial settings. To enhance mixing or promote segregation, the continuous gravity flow of a bidisperse granular mixture through a series of narrow vertical channels with exit slots is investigated. The bidisperse mixture is composed of two different sizes of particles, but of the same density. In dense flow, segregation occurs, leading to formation of bands. The bands of large particles appear at a distance away from the walls. This finding is in contrast to that in shear-driven segregation in a dense flow where large particles segregate towards the walls. Using a phenomenological model, it has been shown that rolling and bouncing induced segregation is the dominant mechanism. When cylindrical inserts are placed to modify flow patterns, that significantly influences segregation patterns. The symmetrical placement of a cylindrical insert close to the exit slot vanishes the bands and enhances mixing. However, with two inserts placed symmetrically and close to the exit slot, the degree of segregation in the reverse direction is greatly enhanced compared to that without insert. In the former, small particles accumulate in thin regions adjacent to the walls, and large particles comprise the bulk of the domain and the flowing stream. The heap formation above the insert in a narrow channel, when the insert is close to the exit, enhances mixing in one configuration, whereas it amplifies reverse segregation in the other.</description>

      <title>How Molecular Motors' Interaction Shapes Flagellar Beat and Its Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic dynamics of flagellar beating for micro-swimmers, such as flagellated cells, sperms and microalgae, is dominated by a feedback mechanism between flagellar shape and the rate of activation/de-activation of the $N \gg 1$ driving molecular motors. In the context of the so-called rigid filament models, where the axoneme is described by a single degree of freedom $X(t)$, we investigate the effect of direct coupling between the activity dynamics of adjacent motors, parametrized by $K \ge 0$. A functional Fokker-Planck equation for $X$ and the state of the $N$ motors is obtained. In the limit of small coupling $K \ll 1$, we derive a system of equations governing the dynamics of the Fourier modes of the active motor density, obtaining estimates for several observables and the fluctuations' quality factor $Q$. For larger $K$ we resort to numerical simulations. The effect of introducing the coupling $K&gt;0$ is to increase characteristic times and the beating period. Moreover at large $K$s the limit cycle becomes bi-stable, with abrupt avalanches of the motor dynamics. Increasing $K$ is similar to what observed in the case $K=0$ when the confining elastic force is strongly reduced. The quality factor of fluctuations has a non-monotonic behavior: it first increases with $K$, then decreases. This is accompanied by the reduction and eventual disappearance of regions where the fraction of activated motor is nor $0$ neither $1$.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Prediction of Dielectric Anisotropy in Nematic Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We curate a large-scale dataset of low frequency dielectric anisotropy values for low molecular weight liquid crystals. Using this dataset, we demonstrate that supervised machine-learning models can predict dielectric anisotropy with substantially improved accuracy (RMSE 2.6) compared to estimates obtained from the Maier-Meier relations using molecular properties from both the widely used semiempirical AM1 method (RMSE 9.7) and the modern r2scan-3c composite method (RMSE 11.2). Realising the potential of machine learning techniques for liquid crystalline materials requires carefully curated data to be accessible, and on this basis we propose a simple and standard template for reporting data.</description>

      <title>Tracking the Brownian motion of DNA-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles for conformation analysis beyond the optical resolution limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brownian motion provides access to hydrodynamic properties of nanoscale objects independent of their optical resolvability. Here, we present a diffusion-based approach to infer effective particle size distributions of DNA-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), consisting of a magnetic core and a polystyrene shell, in a regime where direct geometric sizing is limited by optical diffraction. Using multi-particle tracking microscopy, we analyze the Brownian dynamics of MNPs grafted with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) of varying contour length under low-salt conditions. A physically motivated model is introduced that relates dsDNA contour length to an effective hydrodynamic diameter via an attenuated corona description. The measured diffusion coefficient distributions exhibit a systematic and monotonic dependence on dsDNA length in quantitative agreement with the model. While the tracked objects are predominantly dsDNA-mediated agglomerates rather than isolated nanoparticles, clustering does not obscure the length-dependent signal. Instead, the dsDNA corona determines the hydrodynamic scaling, whereas agglomeration mainly introduces an offset and distribution broadening. These results demonstrate that Brownian dynamics enables robust readout of biomolecular length scales even far below the optical resolution limit. The distribution-based approach is inherently tolerant to polydispersity and aggregation, making diffusion-based tracking a simple and promising strategy for future biotechnological and biomedical assays.</description>

      <title>Densely-packed particle raft at vertically vibrated air-water interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a dense raft of millimeter-sized granular particles at a vertically vibrated air-water interface, which displays a rich set of patterns and particle dynamics as we vary the vibration amplitude, frequency, and particle packing fraction. While the classical parametric instability with standing waves still occurs over a certain parameter space, the measured wave dispersion relations indicate an increasing role in the raft's emerging elasticity at higher packing fractions, which induces a decrease in the effective surface tension and an increase in an out-of-plane bending modulus. At higher vibration frequencies and lower amplitudes, we also identified a regime without standing waves in which individual particles exhibit thermal-like motion and transition from diffusive to sub-diffusive transport as the packing fraction increases. Glassy behaviors such as spatial and temporal heterogeneity in particle dynamics occur as well, which is analogous to supercooled liquids. When the vibration amplitude is increased starting in this supercooled regime, a large cavity eventually forms inside the raft with its size and shape related to the vibration frequency and the injected vibration energy. The cavitation results in the coexistence of free surface water waves inside the cavity and thermal-like particle motion in the raft.</description>

      <title>Light-Activated Self-thermophoretic Janus Nanopropellers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving controlled and directed motion of artificial nanoscale systems in three-dimensional fluid environments remains a key-challenge in active matter, primarily due to the prevailing thermal fluctuations that rapidly randomize the particle trajectories. While significant progress has been made with micrometer-sized particles, imparting sufficient mechanical energy, or self-propulsion, to nanometer-sized particles to overcome Brownian diffusion and enable controlled transport remains a major issue for emerging applications in nanoscience and nanomedicine. Here, we address this challenge by demonstrating the fuel-free, reversible, and tunable active behavior of gold-silica (Au-SiO2) Janus nanoparticles (radius R=33 nm) induced by optical excitation. Using single particle tracking, we provide direct experimental evidence of self-thermophoresis, clearly distinguishing active motion from thermal noise. These light-driven Janus nanoparticles constitute a minimal yet robust photothermal system for investigating active matter and its manipulation at the nanoscale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal theories are used to model a broad array of non-equilibrium phenomena found in nature ranging from biological systems like networks of neurons to the behavior of overflowing water fountains. This includes systems broadly classified as active matter systems. We show that the stochastic theories which describe nonreciprocal interactions can be mapped into quantum field theories described by a supersymmetric action with a single supercharge. The theories are generically non-Hermitian. This generalizes the past work of Parisi and Sourlas on reciprocal theories, which model systems with interactions derived from potentials.</description>

      <title>Complete closed-form solutions to the problem of inextensional bending for surfaces of translation and origami tessellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plates generally admit six deformation modes: three of which are high in strain energy, stretch the plate's midsurface and are called membrane modes; and three are low-energy, bend the midsurface without stretching it and are called bending modes. For origami tessellations, and other corrugated compliant thin shells, the modes are mixed and it is no longer clear what modes, if any, are low in energy in the sense that they are inextensional. Here, it is shown, by direct construction of closed-form solutions, that when the midsurface is a surface of translation, there exists three infinitesimally inextensional deformation modes that correspond to (1) stretching, with an effective Poisson's effect; (2) bending, with an effective synclastic or anti-clastic effect; and to (3) twisting. The provided expressions are valid irrespective of surface regularity and, in particular, properly handle any creases be them straight or curved. The results provide a powerful benchmark for the validation of numerical methods and further insight into the elastic stiffness of thin corrugated compliant shells.</description>

      <title>Shortcut learning in geometric knot classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classifying the topology of closed curves is a central problem in low dimensional topology with applications beyond mathematics spanning protein folding, polymer physics and even magnetohydrodynamics. The central problem is how to determine whether two embeddings of a closed arc are equivalent under ambient isotopy. Given the striking ability of neural networks to solve complex classification tasks, it is therefore natural to ask if the knot classification problem can be tackled using Machine Learning (ML). In this paper, we investigate generic shortcut methods employed by ML to solve the knot classification challenge and specifically discover hidden non-topological features in training data generated through Molecular Dynamics simulations of polygonal knots that are used by ML to arrive to positive classifications results. We then provide a rigorous foundation for future attempts to tackle the knot classification challenge using ML by developing a publicly-available (i) dataset, that aims to remove the potential of non-topological feature classification and (ii) code, that can generate knot embeddings that faithfully explore chosen geometric state space with fixed knot topology. We expect that our work will accelerate the development of ML models that can solve complex geometric knot classification challenges.</description>

      <title>Excluded volume geometry and packing fraction in binary convex hyperparticle mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper the excluded volume of binary similar hyperparticles with small size difference in D-dimensional Euclidean spaces R2, R3, and R4 is studied using two different statistical geometry approaches. These geometric approaches, concerning orientation geometry and integral geometry, yield the excluded volume of particle pairs. The excluded volume of rectangles, based on orientation geometry, in Euclidean space R2 is used to derive an explicit equation for the bidisperse packing fraction, which is compatible with the expression published previously. Next, the excluded volume of pairs of convex particles in D = 2, 3 and 4, resulting from integral geometry, are presented. These excluded volumes are identical with the specific ones for circles and rectangles (D = 2) and (sphero)cylinders (D = 3), derived by orientation geometry. Furthermore, these orientation geometry-based excluded volumes contain geometric measures: particle volume, surface area, mean curvature and the second quermassintegral. They allow for the derivation of closed-form expressions for the random packing fraction of binary convex similar hyperparticles in Euclidean spaces R2 , R3 and R4.</description>

      <title>Advanced Manufacturing with Renewable and Bio-based Materials: AI/ML workflows and Process Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advanced manufacturing with new bio-derived materials can be achieved faster and more economically with first-principle-based artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)-derived models and process optimization. Not only is this motivated by increased industry profitability, but it can also be optimized to reduce waste generation, energy consumption, and gas emissions through additive manufacturing (AM) and AI/ML-directed self-driving laboratory (SDL) process optimization. From this perspective, the benefits of using 3D printing technology to manufacture durable, sustainable materials will enable high-value reuse and promote a better circular economy. Using AI/ML workflows at different levels, it is possible to optimize the synthesis and adaptation of new bio-derived materials with self-correcting 3D printing methods, and in-situ characterization. Working with training data and hypotheses derived from Large Language Models (LLMs) and algorithms, including ML-optimized simulation, it is possible to demonstrate more field convergence. The combination of SDL and AI/ML Workflows can be the norm for improved use of biobased and renewable materials towards advanced manufacturing. This should result in faster and better structure, composition, processing, and properties (SCPP) correlation. More agentic AI tasks, as well as supervised or unsupervised learning, can be incorporated to improve optimization protocols continuously. Deep Learning (DL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) can be applied to more generative AI directions in both AM and SDL, with bio-based materials.</description>

      <title>Droplet Breakup Against an Isolated Obstacle</title>

Abstract: We describe combined experiments and simulations of droplet breakup during flow-driven interactions with a circular obstacle in a quasi-two-dimensional microfluidic chamber. Due to a lack of in-plane confinement, the droplets can also slip past the obstacle without breaking. Droplets are more likely to break when they have a higher flow velocity, larger size (relative to the obstacle radius R), smaller surface tension, and for head-on collisions with the obstacle. We also observe that droplet-obstacle collisions are more likely to result in breakup when the height of the sample chamber is increased. We define a nondimensional breakup number Bk ~ Ca, where Ca is the Capillary number, that accounts for changes in the likelihood of droplet break up with variations in these parameters. As Bk increases, we find in both experiments and discrete element method (DEM) simulations of the deformable particle model that the behavior changes from droplets never breaking (Bk &lt;&lt; 1) to always breaking for Bk &gt;&gt; 1, with a rapid change in the probability of droplet breakup near Bk = 1. We also find that Bk ~ S^(4/3), where S characterizes the symmetry of the collision, which implies that the minimum symmetry required for breakup is controlled by a characteristic distance h ~ R.</description>
