      <title>On the set of atoms and strong atoms in additive monoids of cyclic semidomains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a cancellative and commutative monoid. A non-invertible element of $M$ is called an atom (or irreducible element) if it cannot be factored into two non-invertible elements, while an atom $a$ of $M$ is called strong if $a^n$ has a unique factorization in $M$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. The monoid $M$ is atomic if every non-invertible element factors into finitely many atoms (repetitions allowed). For an algebraic number $\alpha$, we let $M_\alpha$ denote the additive monoid of the subsemiring $\mathbb{N}_0[\alpha]$ of $\mathbb{C}$. The atomic structure of $M_\alpha$ reflects intricate interactions between algebraic number theory and additive semigroup theory. For $m, n \in \mathbb{N}_0 \cup \{ \infty \}$ (with $m \le n$), the pair $(m,n)$ is called realizable if there exists an algebraic number $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$ such that $M_\alpha$ has $m$ strong atoms and $n$ atoms. Our primary goal is to identify classes of realizable pairs with the long-term goal of providing a complete description of the full set of realizable pairs.</description>

      <title>The n-total graph of a commutative ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative ring with $1\not = 0$, $Z(R)$ be the set of all zero-divisors of $R$, and $n \geq 1$. This paper introduces the $n$-total graph of a commutative ring $R$. The $n$-total graph of a commutative ring $R$, denoted by $n-T(R)$, is an undirected simple graph with vertex set $R$, such that two vertices $x, y$ in $R$ are connected by an edge if $x^n + y^n$ in $Z(R)$. Note that if $n =1$, then the $1$-total graph of $R$ is the total graph of $R$ in the sense of Anderson-Badawi's paper on the total graph of a commutative ring. In this paper, we study some graph properties and theoretical ring structure.</description>

      <title>Banach modules, almost mathematics and condensed mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between almost mathematics, condensed mathematics and the categories of seminormed and Banach modules over a Banach ring $A$, with submetric (norm-decreasing) $A$-module homomorphisms for morphisms. If $A$ is a Banach ring with a norm-multiplicative topologically nilpotent unit $\varpi$ contained in the closed unit ball $A_{\leq1}$ such that $\varpi$ admits a compatible system of $p$-power roots $\varpi^{1/p^{n}}$ with \begin{equation*}\lVert\varpi^{1/p^{n}}\rVert=\lVert\varpi\rVert^{1/p^{n}}\end{equation*}for all $n$, we prove that the "almost closed unit ball" functor \begin{equation*}M\mapsto M_{\leq1}^{a}\end{equation*}is an equivalence between the category of Banach $A$-modules and submetric $A$-module maps and the category of $\varpi$-adically complete, $\varpi$-torsion-free almost $(A_{\leq1}, (\varpi^{1/p^{\infty}}))$-modules. We also obtain an analogous result for Banach algebras and almost algebras. The main novelty in our approach is that we show that the norm on the Banach module $M$ is completely determined by the corresponding almost $A_{\leq1}$-module $M_{\leq1}^{a}$, rather than being determined only up to equivalence.
  We deduce from our results the existence of a natural fully faithful embedding of the category of Banach $A$-modules and submetric $A$-module maps into the category of (static) condensed almost $(A_{\leq1}, (\varpi^{1/p^{\infty}}))$-modules in the sense of Mann, which factors through the full subcategory of solid condensed $(A_{\leq1}, (\varpi^{1/p^{\infty}}))$-almost modules. If $A$ is perfectoid and the adic spectrum of $(A, A^{\circ})$ is totally disconnected, we show that this embedding transforms the complete tensor product of Banach $A$-modules into (an almost analog of) the solid tensor product of solid condensed almost modules.</description>

      <title>Locally Associated Orders in Real Quadratic Number Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2025, the concept of an order in a number field being associated, ideal-preserving, or locally associated was introduced in order to tackle problems in factorization. In this paper, we explore locally associated orders in real quadratic number fields of the form $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{p}]$, with $p\in\mathbb{N}$ prime. In particular, we develop strategies and produce results which make determining when a given order in such a number field is (or is not) locally associated much easier. We also highlight the relatively few cases which defy simple characterization, leading to a conjecture on the solutions to Pell's equations of the form $x^2-y^2p=1$.</description>

      <title>Bumpless pipe dreams encode Gr\"obner geometry of Schubert polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.08370v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In their study of infinite flag varieties, Lam, Lee, and Shimozono (2021) introduced bumpless pipe dreams in a new combinatorial formula for double Schubert polynomials. These polynomials are the TxT-equivariant cohomology classes of matrix Schubert varieties and of their flat degenerations. We give diagonal term orders with respect to which bumpless pipe dreams index the irreducible components of diagonal Gr\"obner degenerations of matrix Schubert varieties, counted with scheme-theoretic multiplicity.
  This indexing was conjectured by Hamaker, Pechenik, and Weigandt (2022). We also give a generalization to equidimensional unions of matrix Schubert varieties. This result establishes that bumpless pipe dreams are dual to and as geometrically natural as classical pipe dreams, for which an analogous anti-diagonal theory was developed by Knutson and Miller (2005).</description>

      <title>On Root Capacity, Intersection Indicium, Minimal Generating Sets of Galois Closure &amp; Compositum Feasible Triplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We carry forward the work started by the author and Bhagwat in [2] and develop the Theory of root clusters further in this article and also apply similar methods to resolve certain problems in related areas. We establish the Inverse root capacity problem for number fields which is a generalization of Inverse cluster size problem for number fields proved in [2]. We introduce the concept of intersection indicium as a generalization of the concept of ascending index introduced in [2] and prove some of its properties. We then establish the Inverse intersection indicium problem for number fields (excluding certain cases) which is a generalization of Inverse ascending index problem for number fields proved in [2]. We give a field theoretic formulation for the concept of minimal generating sets of splitting fields which was introduced by the author and Vanchinathan in [10] and generalize a result in [10] for number fields and also establish the existence of field extensions over number fields for given degree and given cardinality of minimal generating set of Galois closure dividing the degree. We generalize a result in [6] by establishing that a certain family of triplets is compositum feasible over any number field and we also list all the irreducible triplets in this family. We also prove a partial case of a conjecture in [6]. In the concluding section of this article, we improve on the inverse problems proved in [2] and this article by proving that there exist arbitrarily large finite families of pairwise non-isomorphic extensions having additional properties that satisfy the given conditions.</description>
