      <title>Frequency Extraction from Invariant Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In non-degenerate integrable Hamiltonian systems, invariant tori can be parameterized equivalently by action variables or by their fundamental frequencies. We introduce an invariant-flow formulation for extracting fundamental frequencies of integrable Hamiltonian systems. By treating invariants as generators of commuting Hamiltonian flows, the frequencies are obtained from time-of-flight parameters along these flows, providing a direct alternative to action-angle constructions and spectral methods based on long time series. The approach yields an explicit numerical procedure that extends naturally to systems with multiple degrees of freedom. Its effectiveness is demonstrated using the McMillan map, where machine-precision accuracy is achieved.</description>

      <title>Curvature atlas II: geometric classification of integrable rigid-body regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the second part of a curvature-based program for rigid-body dynamics on SU2. In Part I, Curvature-Driven Dynamics on S3: A Geometric Atlas, we introduced the inertial curvature field Kgeo associated with a left-invariant metric on SU2, constructed a geometric Atlas of curvature regimes, and identified the inertia ratio 2:2:1 as a curvature-balanced regime giving rise to a pure-precession family for the heavy top, building on the prior dynamical discovery of this regime. Here we develop the curvature Atlas into a classification tool for integrable and near-integrable rigid-body regimes. We show that all classical integrable heavy-top cases (Euler, Lagrange, Kovalevskaya, Goryachev-Chaplygin) correspond to specific degenerate curvature signatures of Kgeo. In each case the inertia tensor imposes a simple algebraic structure on the inertial curvature field: vanishing of one component, symmetric curvature pairs, or orthogonal curvature splitting. We formulate and prove a curvature classification theorem describing these signatures and their relation to integrability. We then single out the mixed anisotropic ratio 2:2:1 as a minimally nondegenerate curvature-balanced regime: it destroys algebraic integrability while preserving an exact curvature balance, giving rise to pure precession for the heavy top. Finally, we introduce a curvature deviation functional measuring the distance to the nearest integrable curvature signature, describe near-integrable regimes in a neighbourhood of 2:2:1, and present an integrability map.</description>

      <title>Solvable Quantum Circuits from Spacetime Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years dual-unitary circuits and their multi-unitary generalizations have emerged as exactly solvable yet chaotic models of quantum many-body dynamics. However, a systematic picture for the solvability of multi-unitary dynamics remains missing. We present a framework encompassing a large class of such non-integrable models with exactly solvable dynamics, which we term \emph{completely reducible} circuits. In these circuits, the entanglement membrane determining operator growth and entanglement dynamics can be characterized analytically. Completely reducible circuits extend the notion of space-time symmetry to more general lattice geometries, breaking dual-unitarity globally but not locally, and allow for a rich phenomenology going beyond dual-unitarity. As example, we introduce circuits that support four and five directions of information flow. We derive a general expression for the entanglement line tension in terms of the pattern of information flow in spacetime. The solvability is shown to be related to the absence of knots of this information flow, connecting entanglement dynamics to the Kauffman bracket as knot invariant. Building on these results, we propose that in general non-integrable dynamics the curvature of the entanglement line tension can be interpreted as a density of information transport. Our results provide a new and unified framework for exactly solvable models of many-body quantum chaos, encompassing and extending known constructions.</description>

      <title>Rationally-extended radial harmonic oscillator in a position-dependent mass background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the radial harmonic oscillator problem in the position-dependent mass background of the type $m(\alpha;r) = (1+\alpha r^2)^{-2}$, $\alpha&gt;0$, can be solved by using a point canonical transformation mapping the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation onto that of the P\"oschl-Teller I potential with constant mass. The radial harmonic oscillator problem with position-dependent mass is shown to exhibit a deformed shape invariance property in a deformed supersymmetric framework. The inverse point canonical transformation then provides some exactly-solvable rational extensions of the radial harmonic oscillator with position-dependent mass associated with $X_m$-Jacobi exceptional orthogonal polynomials of type I, II, or III. The extended potentials of type I and II are proved to display deformed shape invariance. The spectrum and wavefunctions of the radial harmonic oscillator potential and its extensions are shown to go over to well-known results when the deforming parameter $\alpha$ goes to zero.</description>

      <title>Orbital stability of smooth solitary waves for the modified Camassa-Holm equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19342v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the orbital stability of smooth solitary wave solutions to the modified Camassa-Holm equation with cubic nonlinearity. These solutions, which exist on a nonzero constant background $k$, are unique up to translation for each permissible value of $k$ and wave speed. By leveraging the Hamiltonian nature of the modified Camassa-Holm equation and employing three conserved functionals-comprising an energy and two Casimirs, we establish orbital stability through an analysis of the Vakhitov-Kolokolov condition. This stability pertains to perturbations of the momentum variable in $H^1(\mathbb{R})$.</description>
