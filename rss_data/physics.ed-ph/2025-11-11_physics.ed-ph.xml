      <title>"Ni\~nas At\'omicas" (Atomic Girls): An initiative that generates opportunities for young girls in STEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on an initiative that seeks to encourage high school girls to develop critical thinking and transferable skills widely used in scientific work, as well as to generate a concrete space of opportunities for girls to experience how real science is done. Our "Ni\~nas At\'omicas" workshop combines the teaching of particle physics, electronics, programming and scientific methodology through building and operating a dedicated experiment: a muon counter. Girls from all over Chile can apply to this workshop, where every year they are guided by female scientists for two weeks. We report on the contents and methodology of our workshop and provide details on how to build the muon detector counter experiment. We report results on muon flux and proper lifetime, two muon properties which can be extracted from the data collected by the girls with the muon detectors they built themselves. Insights into the girl's experiences during the 2024 and 2025 editions of the workshop are also detailed, with the aim to contribute to the wider physics education research and outreach communities.</description>

      <title>The 2017 Merrimack College Mobile Lightboard: Personalized Office-Based Lightboarding on a Shared Mobile Board</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and evaluate the Merrimack College Mobile Lightboard, which we built in 2017 and which is still in use in 2025. Our design was closely based on that of the groundbreaking 2014 Duke University Lightboard but with a smaller glass pane, 5 feet wide instead of 6 feet wide. The resulting scaled-down board is small enough to move in and out of individual faculty offices, but large enough to make detailed videos. An updated construction cost estimate is provided, and recent upgrades are briefly discussed. We believe that personalized office-based lightboarding represents an attractive option for many faculty members, with strengths that complement those of centralized installations. Our successful build suggests that this option is technically and financially feasible at many if not most higher education institutions.</description>
