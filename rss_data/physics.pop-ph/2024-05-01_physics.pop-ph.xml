      <title>Explaining Grover's algorithm with a colony of ants: a pedagogical model for making quantum technology comprehensible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of quantum technologies requires an increasing number of physicists, computer scientists, and engineers who can work on these technologies. For educating these professionals, quantum mechanics should stop being perceived as incomprehensible. In this paper we contribute to this change by presenting a pedagogical model for explaining Grover's search algorithm, a prominent quantum algorithm. This model visualizes the three main steps of Grover's algorithm and, in addition to explaining the algorithm itself, introduces three key principles of quantum mechanics: superposition, interference, and state collapse at measurement. The pedagogical model, visualized by a video, is called the "Ant Colony Maze model". It represents the search problems as finding the exit of a maze, and visualizes Grover's search algorithm as a strategy by which a colony of ants finds that exit.</description>

      <title>Cycling on rough roads: A model for resistance and vibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimising opposing forces is a matter of interest to most cyclists. These forces arise from passage through air ("drag") and interaction with the road surface ("resistance"). Recent work recognises that resistance forces arise not only from the deformation of the tyre ("rolling resistance") but also from irregularities in the road surface ("roughness resistance"), which lead to power dissipation in the body of the rider through vibration. The latter effect may also have an adverse impact on human health. In this work we offer a quantitative theory of roughness resistance and vibration that links these effects to a surface characterisation in terms of the International Roughness Index (IRI). We show that the roughness resistance and the Vibration Dose Value (or VDV, the usual vibration dosage metric) can be expressed in terms of elementary formulae. The roughness resistance depends only on the vertical stiffness of the bicycle and the roughness index. Surprisingly, other apparently relevant parameters, such as physiological characteristics of the bicycle rider and other features of the bicycle, do not enter. For roads of moderate roughness, roughness resistance is larger than rolling resistance. For very rough roads, roughness resistance is larger than aerodynamic drag. So only on roads of high quality (in most jurisdictions, accounting for less than 10~\% of the total) can roughness resistance be ignored. Roughness resistance can be mitigated by reducing the vertical stiffness of the bicycle. In common with other recent reports, we find that almost any cycling activity will breach public health guidelines relating to Vibration Dose Value.</description>

      <title>Technosignatures longevity and Lindy's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The probability of detecting technosignatures (i.e. evidence of technological activity beyond Earth) increases with their longevity, or the time interval over which they manifest. Therefore, the assumed distribution of longevities has some bearing on the chances of success of technosignature searches, as well as on the inferred age of technosignatures following a first contact. Here, we investigate the possibility that the longevity of technosignatures conforms to the so-called Lindy's law, whereby, at any time, their remaining life expectancy is roughly proportional to their age. We show that, if Lindy's law applies, the general tenet that the first detected technosignature ought to be very long lived may be overruled. We conclude by discussing the number of emitters that had to appear, over the history of the Galaxy, in order for one of them to be detectable today from Earth.</description>

      <title>Is Artificial Intelligence the great filter that makes advanced technical civilisations rare in the universe?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the hypothesis that the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), culminating in the emergence of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), could act as a "Great Filter" that is responsible for the scarcity of advanced technological civilisations in the universe. It is proposed that such a filter emerges before these civilisations can develop a stable, multiplanetary existence, suggesting the typical longevity (L) of a technical civilization is less than 200 years. Such estimates for L, when applied to optimistic versions of the Drake equation, are consistent with the null results obtained by recent SETI surveys, and other efforts to detect various technosignatures across the electromagnetic spectrum. Through the lens of SETI, we reflect on humanity's current technological trajectory - the modest projections for L suggested here, underscore the critical need to quickly establish regulatory frameworks for AI development on Earth and the advancement of a multiplanetary society to mitigate against such existential threats. The persistence of intelligent and conscious life in the universe could hinge on the timely and effective implementation of such international regulatory measures and technological endeavours.</description>

      <title>Non-trivial solution to a simple problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of finding the frequencies of small longitudinal oscillations of a spring having a finite mass and stiffness, attached at one end to a wall and at the other end to a body of finite mass, is discussed. This problem was repeatedly proposed at Olympiads for schoolchildren, in various lessons on the Internet, and even on tests in mechanics for students of universities. In all the cases known to me, the implied solution was actually wrong. I discuss two cases: (A) a spring lies on a smooth table, (B) a spring is attached to the ceiling. It is shown that the solution to this simply formulated problem is non-trivial.</description>

      <title>Game Design Inspired by Quantum Physics: A Case Study on The Quantum Photo Booth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explain the conceptual development of the STAGE Lab Quantum Casino (a.k.a. the STAGE Lab Quantum Arcade), one of the Lab's most recent artistic endeavors about quantum physics. This work consists of a series of card and digital games and an interactive experience, exposing the public to quantum physics and minimizing learning barriers. Furthermore, we will also present a case study of the interactive experience, in the form of The Quantum Photo Booth.
  The STAGE Lab Quantum Casino provides an entertaining and approachable experience for people of all ages to become familiar with quantum physics. By using core concepts of quantum physics as tools and strategies to overcome challenges that arise in gameplay, players gain an intuitive understanding of these concepts. These games provide players with a first-hand experience of the following quantum physics concepts: measurement, superposition, encryption, decoherence, and entanglement. Instead of teaching the concepts through a traditional classroom pedagogy, these games aim to invoke curiosity, spark moments of playfulness, and catalyze play-centric learning modalities. This paper provides a general overview of the development of the STAGE Lab Quantum Casino, focusing on The Quantum Photo Booth experience and how science is integrated into the very nature of the game development process in addition to its outcome.</description>
