      <title>Holographic Timelike Entanglement Across Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a holographic framework for computing timelike entanglement entropy (tEE) in quantum field theories, extending the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription into Lorentzian settings. Using three broad classes of supergravity backgrounds, we derive both exact and approximate tEE expressions for slab, spherical, and hyperbolic regions, and relate them to the central charges of the dual conformal field theories. The method is applied to infinite families of supersymmetric linear quivers in dimensions from d=2 to d=6, showing that Liu-Mezei and slab central charges scale universally like the holographic central charge. We then analyse gapped and confining models, including twisted compactifications and wrapped brane constructions, identifying how a mass gap modifies tEE and when approximate formulas remain accurate. In all cases, we uncover robust scaling with invariant separations and signature dependent phase behaviour, distinguishing spacelike from timelike embeddings. Our results unify the treatment of tEE in both conformal and nonconformal theories, clarifying its role as a probe of causal structure, universal data, and nonperturbative dynamics in holography.</description>

      <title>Algebraic traversable wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new large $N$ limit which at the extreme limit is dual in the bulk to a back-reacted traversable wormhole, by making use if a novel definition of algebra at infinity, an algebra familiar in the literature from the study of quasi-local algebras. We also compute, from a purely algebraic perspective, the effects registered by a left universe observer due to a unitary fluctuation on the right universe of the traversable wormhole, and reproduce a result from an earlier computation by Maldacena, Stanford and Yang \cite{Maldacena:2017axo}.</description>

      <title>Structure In The Heterotic Matter Field Kahler Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has long been known that superpotential couplings in heterotic theories often vanish despite the absence of any known symmetry that would forbid them. We show that such structure is also exhibited by the matter field Kahler potential of these compactifications. We give an analytical analysis which provides some simple conditions under which certain terms, which would be expected to be present in the Kahler potential, vanish. Explicit examples of this phenomenon are provided, some of which are verifiable by other methods and some of which can only currently be accessed by these techniques. By studying the interplay of the structure we find with Higgsing transitions, we are able to show that this vanishing of Kahler potential terms can extend to all orders in a perturbative expansion in the matter fields.</description>

      <title>HBAR entropy in causal diamond geometry: A near-horizon perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we extend the Horizon Brightened Acceleration Radiation (HBAR) framework to the causal diamond (CD) spacetime. We study a cloud of two-level atoms, injected at random times in the asymptotic past of the CD, freely falling toward its causal horizon and emitting scalar radiation via a weak dipole coupling to a quantum field. In the near-horizon region, an emergent conformal symmetry-captured by conformal quantum mechanics (CQM)-governs the field dynamics and allows analytic control of the emission process. We find that the radiation spectrum is thermal, with temperature $T_D = 1/(\pi\alpha)$, and that the associated von Neumann entropy flux reproduces the entropy production of the radiation field. These results demonstrate that the causal horizons of the CD spacetime effectively act as a topological thermal reservoir, with thermal properties arising entirely from the global causal structure rather than from underlying microscopic degrees of freedom, highlighting that the validity of the HBAR framework is fundamentally tied to the existence of causal horizons, independent of the presence of a black hole.</description>

      <title>Five-loop Anomalous Dimensions of Cubic Scalar Theory from Operator Product Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, an Operator Product Expansion method has been proposed for renormalization in quantum field theories. This method extracts UV divergences from two-point propagator-type integrals, and it is believed to be applicable to generic QFTs. In the present work, we apply the OPE method to the renormalization of scalar theory with cubic interactions in six-dimensions. We have successfully computed the 5-loop corrections to the anomalous dimensions of the $\phi^Q$ operator, as well as the large $N$ expansion of scaling dimensions at the Wilson-Fisher fixed point to $1/N^5$ order. This computation sets a new loop-order record for the anomalous dimension of the $\phi^Q$ operator in cubic scalar theory, and further demonstrates the efficiency and capacity of the OPE method in renormalization.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos Diagnostics for Open Quantum Systems from Bi-Lanczos Krylov Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Hermitian systems, Krylov complexity has emerged as a powerful diagnostic of quantum dynamics, capable of distinguishing chaotic from integrable phases, in agreement with established probes such as spectral statistics and out-of-time-order correlators. By contrast, its role in non-Hermitian settings, relevant for modeling open quantum systems, remains less understood due to the challenges posed by complex eigenvalues and the limitations of standard approaches such as singular value decomposition. Here, we demonstrate that Krylov complexity, computed via the bi-Lanczos algorithm, effectively identifies chaotic and integrable phases in open quantum systems. The results align with complex spectral statistics and complex spacing ratios, highlighting the robustness of this approach. The universality of our findings is further supported through studies of both the non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and non-Hermitian random matrix ensembles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we discuss the issue of localization of $N=2$ spinning particles. More specifically, we show that we can not confine the spinning particle within the Randall-Sundrum scenario. We argue that this result directly affects studies related to localization of $p$-form fields. We show that, due to the non confinement of the superparticle, we can not localize $p$-forms on the membrane.</description>

      <title>Chiral effective potential in $4D$, $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the chiral effective superpotential in $4D$ $\mathcal{N}=1$, $SU(N)$ super Yang-Mills theory coupled to chiral matter in one- and two-loop approximations. It is found that the one-loop contribution to the chiral effective potential is always finite and is expressed in terms of a specific triangle integral. The two-loop contributions generated by purely chiral vertices turned out to be finite as well. The chiral effective potential stipulated by supergraphs with gauge superfield subgraphs is finite for the supergraphs with no divergent subgraphs. In the case of the finite $\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM theory, the two-loop chiral contributions to the effective action are significanlty simplified. The leading large $N$ behavior of the chiral effective superpotential in finite $\mathcal{N}=2$ super-Yang-Mills models with $SU(N)$ gauge symmetry is studied and it is shown that the exact form in the coupling constant of the chiral effective superpotential can be found.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a three-dimensional bi-vector-tensor theory of the generalized Proca class by regularizing the Gauss-Bonnet invariant within the Weyl geometry. We show that the theory admits a regular AdS$_3$ black hole solution with primary hairs. Introducing a deformation in the theory, a different regular AdS$_3$ black hole solution is obtained. Charged generalizations of these solutions are given by coupling to Born-Infeld electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions of Electromagnetically Charged Black Holes in Lovelock Gravity with Nonconstant Curvature Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the most general class of charged black hole solutions in third-order Lovelock gravity within even-dimensional spacetimes in the presence of an electromagnetic field. These solutions feature nonconstant-curvature horizons that affect geometry when n&gt;=8. The near-origin behavior of the metric reveals a timelike singularity for electrically charged cases, in contrast to the spacelike singularity found in the uncharged case. We investigate thermodynamic stability in both the grand canonical and canonical ensembles. In the grand canonical ensemble, stability is determined by the positivity of both the Hessian determinant and the temperature. In the canonical ensemble, the sign of the heat capacity governs stability. We identify both first- and second-order phase transitions, including a van der Waals-like behavior characterized by instability at intermediate black hole sizes. Our results reveal a rich phase structure influenced by Lovelock corrections and electromagnetic fields, and demonstrate how conserved charges affect black hole evaporation and stabilization.</description>

      <title>A proof of the reverse isoperimetric inequality using a geometric-analytic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first proof of the reverse isoperimetric inequality for black holes in arbitrary dimension using a two-pronged geometric-analytic approach. The proof holds for compact Riemannian hypersurfaces in AdS space and seems to be a generic property of black holes in the extended phase space formalism. Using Euclidean gravitational action, we show that, among all hypersurfaces of given volume, the round sphere in the $D$-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space maximizes the area (and hence the entropy). This analytic result is supported by a geometric argument in a $1+1+2$ decomposition of spacetime: gravitational focusing enforces a strictly negative conformal deformation, and the Sherif-Dunsby rigidity theorem then forces the deformed 3-sphere to be isometric to the round 3-sphere, establishing the round sphere as the extremal surface, in fact, a maximally entropic surface. Our work establishes that the reversal of the usual isoperimetric inequality occurs due to the structure of the curved background governed by Einstein's equation, underscoring the role of gravity in the reverse isoperimetric inequality for black hole horizons in AdS space.</description>

      <title>Modified cosmology through generalized mass-to-horizon entropy: observational constraints from DESI DR2 BAO data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generalized mass-to-horizon entropy has recently been proposed as an extension of the Bekenstein-Hawking area law, derived from a modified mass-horizon relation constructed to ensure consistency with the Clausius equation. Within the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture, this entropy formulation yields modified Friedmann equations, which recover the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology in the appropriate limit of the model's two free parameters. In the present study, we constrain this framework using observations from TypeIa supernovae (SNIa), cosmic chronometers (CC) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO, including DESI~DR2), together with the SH0ES distance-ladder prior on $H_0$, across four combinations of data sets. Although the extended entropic scenario yields a slightly better, or statistically comparable, fit to the data, model selection via the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) mildly favors the cosmological constant as the dark energy candidate. Moreover, the $\Lambda$CDM limit lies within $\sim 1\sigma$ of our constraints, indicating no significant deviation from standard cosmology with current data.</description>

      <title>Compact stars in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity: regular and divergent scalar field configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate static, spherically symmetric solutions in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity non-minimally coupled to a massless real scalar field, both in vacuum and in the presence of fermionic matter. Focusing on a specific quadratic scalar-Gauss-Bonnet coupling, we identify two distinct classes of compact objects: one with a regular scalar field at the origin -- connected to general relativity in an appropriate limit -- and another {one} with a divergent scalar field at the origin but a regular geometry. We analyze both purely scalar and matter-supported (hybrid) configurations, showing that the former can describe a broad class of compact objects, while the latter can reproduce neutron star-like masses even when modeled with a simple polytropic equation of state. Furthermore, we highlight distinctive phenomenological signatures, including the ability of these stars to exceed known compactness limits and their potential to act as gravitational wave super-emitters. We also examined the motion of test particles non-minimally coupled to the scalar field and showed the existence of stable circular orbits within the Schwarzschild's ISCO and static configurations at finite radii for particles with zero angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Emergent Turbulence in Nonlinear Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravity in nonlinear and dynamical regimes underpins spectacular astrophysical phenomena and observable consequences, from the early universe to black hole collisions. In these extreme environments, inverse energy cascades - mediated by nonlinear interactions - may help explain the near scale-invariance of cosmic structure and the simplicity of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers. Yet the presence, characteristics, and generality of such interactions in full General Relativity remain largely unexplored. Here we show that two types of nonlinear interactions - a four-mode and a three-mode interaction - emerge in the fully nonlinear regime, and can indeed channel inverse energy cascades by inducing resonant and anti-damping instabilities. This establishes what was previously only hinted at in highly specialized perturbative contexts. We further demonstrate a ``laminar'' to ``turbulent'' transition for the largest-possible angular structure in General Relativity, whereas finer structures remain persistently turbulent. Our results reveal the impact and generality of these nonlinear interactions (instabilities), which can be key to understanding observations ranging from cosmological to kilometer scales. We anticipate that our work will shed new light on nonlinear gravitational phenomena and their consequences, such as constructing gravitational wave templates and testing General Relativity in the most extreme regime. Moreover, our work is a starting point for addressing nonlinear gravitational interactions using ideas and methods inspired by fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Callan-Symanzik-like equation in information theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the jumps in the complexity growth rate (CGR) through the complexity=anything proposal. It is revealed that bulk fields are in charge of the height and the location of these jumps. To put it accurately, their counterparts are divergence of energy momentum tensor, shear viscosity and the Weyl anomaly of the boundary theory. The behavior of CGR around these jumps manifests a critical behavior and critical exponents. Moreover, it is figured out that CGR satisfies a Callan-Symanzik-like equation around these jumps. This equation suggests that the speed of information processing could be changed by the scale of energy. Put it another way, by change of the scale of energy one could turn the classical computers into faster processor computers even faster than our current quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Shadow of a nonlinear electromagnetic generalized Kerr-Newman-AdS black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the shadow properties of the Kerr-Newman-Anti-de Sitter black hole coupled to a nonlinear electrodynamics. We construct the shadow by employing the celestial coordinate approach for observers located at finite distances, accounting for the non-asymptotically flat nature of the spacetime. The size, distortion, area, and oblateness of the shadow are analyzed in terms of the black hole parameters, including the spin, effective charge, and nonlinearity parameter. We further explore observational constraints using the Event Horizon Telescope results for M87* and Sgr~A*. The angular diameters inferred from the observed images allow us to bound the parameter space of the model, showing that both spin and nonlinearity play key roles in shaping the shadow and in restricting the effective charge. Additionally, we examine the energy emission rate derived from the shadow radius and Hawking temperature, highlighting the influence of rotation and nonlinear electrodynamics on black hole evaporation. Our results demonstrate that the black hole model provides a physically consistent and observationally viable extension of the standard Kerr paradigm, with potential implications for near-horizon quantum processes and tests of gravity beyond general relativity.</description>

      <title>Real-time bubble nucleation and growth for false vacuum decay on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit quantum false vacuum decay for the one-dimensional Ising model, focusing on the real-time nucleation and growth of true vacuum bubbles. Via matrix product state simulations, we demonstrate that for a wide range of parameters, the full time-dependent quantum state is well described by a Gaussian ansatz in terms of domain wall operators, with the associated vacuum bubble wave function evolving according to the linearized time-dependent variational principle. The emerging picture shows three different stages of evolution: an initial nucleation of small bubbles, followed by semi-classical bubble growth, which in turn is halted by the lattice phenomenon of Bloch oscillations. Furthermore, we find that the resonant bubble only plays a significant role in a certain region of parameter-space. However, when significant, it does lead to an approximately constant decay rate during the intermediate stage. Moreover, this rate is in quantitative agreement with the analytical result of Rutkevich (Phys. Rev. B 60, 14525) for which we provide an independent derivation based on the Gaussian ansatz.</description>

      <title>Many-body theory of false vacuum decay in quantum spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we theoretically investigate the false vacuum decay process in a ferromagnetic quantum spin-1/2 chain. We develop a many-body theory describing the nucleation and the coherent dynamics of true-vacuum bubbles that is analytically tractable and agrees with numerical matrix product state calculations in all parameter regimes up to intermediate times. This bosonic theory allows us to identify different regimes in the parameter space and unravel the underlying physical mechanisms. In particular, regimes that closely correspond to the cosmological false vacuum decay picture are highlighted and characterized in terms of observable quantities.</description>

      <title>Entropy, purity and gluon cascades at high energies with recombinations and transitions to vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study one dimensional dipole cascade models in the high-energy limit of QCD. Motivated by data on hadron multiplicities in the LHCb kinematical range, we generalize existing cascade models for splitting and recombination to account also for transitions to the vacuum. This modification allows us to describe the data. Furthermore, we perform both analytical and numerical studies of the cascades and find that the cascade including loop corrections, as well as the one accounting for transitions to the vacuum, can both be related to the Negative Binomial Distribution. In the latter case, however, one must properly normalize the cascade to account for transitions to the vacuum. We also study the scaling properties of the cascades and identify new regimes, which we call "focal" and "parallel." Finally, we investigate the Quantum Information (QI) measures of the cascades, which allow us to highlight their distinctive properties.</description>

      <title>Modular transformations of tau functions and conformal blocks on the torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The connection problem for isomonodromic tau functions on the one-punctured torus concerns the ratio between the tau function and its modular transform, associated to dual pants decompositions of the torus. In this paper, we study the modular transformations of the tau function and consequently derive the connection constant. Moreover, through the relation with two-dimensional Conformal Field Theory, we also obtain an exact closed formula for the $c=1$ Virasoro modular kernel, whose expression was previously unknown, and relate it to the $c\rightarrow\infty$ (semiclassical) modular kernel and $SL_2(\mathbb{C})$ complex Chern-Simons amplitudes. Finally, we prove that the connection constant and the two, $c=1$ and $c\to \infty$, modular kernels are generating functions of canonical transformations on the character variety of the one-punctured torus. Our results are also relevant for the $\mathcal{N}=2^*$ gauge theory.</description>

      <title>On palindromic numerators of bigraded symmetric orbifold Hilbert series and Kostka-Foulkes polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From our work on partition functions in log gravity, we show that the palindromic numerators in two variables of bigraded symmetric orbifold Hilbert series take the form of sums of products of Kostka-Foulkes polynomials associated with a pair of partition $\lambda$ and $\mu=(1^n)$. The log partition function also being a KP $\tau$-function, our work gives a new description of Hall-Littlewood and Kostka-Foulkes polynomials as palindromic numerators of quotient expansions in the moduli space of formal power series solutions of the KP hierarchy. Using the structure and properties of the log partition function, we also show that the palindromic polynomials are eigenvalues of a differential operator arising from a recurrence relation and acting on the Hilbert series.</description>

      <title>Associativity is enough: an all-orders 2d chiral algebra for 4d form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a special set of massless four-dimensional gauge theories which admit local and gauge-anomaly-free uplifts to twistor space; we call such theories twistorial. In twistorial theories, generalized towers of soft modes (including states of both helicities) form a 2d chiral algebra even at the quantum level. The 2d OPE limit of this chiral algebra coincides with the holomorphic collinear limit in 4d. This is true, in particular, for self-dual Yang-Mills (SDYM) theory coupled to special choices of matter, the latter being required to make the theory twistorial. Costello and the second author recently proposed that form factors of such twistorial 4d theories could be computed as 2d chiral algebra correlators. In turn, there exist form factors of self-dual theories, with insertions of appropriate local operators, that compute a subclass of observables in full (i.e. non-self-dual) QCD, coupled to appropriate matter. For example, the n-point two-loop all + QCD amplitude has recently been computed using the 1-loop chiral algebra OPEs determined thus far, but higher orders of the quantum-deformed chiral algebra must be determined to continue the ``chiral algebra bootstrap'' program for higher-loop-level form factors of these twistorial theories. In this paper, using only elementary constraints from symmetries and associativity, we obtain closed-form expressions for the extended chiral algebra OPEs to arbitrary loop-order. This can be viewed as providing an all-loop result for a subset of collinear splitting functions in non-supersymmetric, massless QCD coupled to special choices of matter.</description>

      <title>Modern Approach to 2D Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primary aim of these lecture notes is to introduce the modern approach to two-dimensional conformal field theory (2D CFT). The study of analytical methods in two-dimensional conformal field theory has developed over several decades, starting with BPZ. The development of analytical methods, particularly in rational conformal field theory (RCFT), has been remarkable, with complete classifications achieved for certain model groups. One motivation for studying CFT comes from its ability to describe quantum critical systems. Given that realistic quantum critical systems are fundamentally RCFTs, it is somewhat natural that the analytical methods of RCFT have evolved significantly.
  CFTs other than RCFTs are called irrational conformal field theories (ICFTs). Compared to RCFTs, the study of ICFTs has not progressed as much. Leaving aside whether there is physical motivation or not, ICFTs inherently possess a difficulty that makes them challenging to approach. However, with the development of quantum gravity, the advancement of analytical methods for ICFTs has become essential. The reason lies in the AdS/CFT correspondence. AdS/CFT refers to the relationship between $d+1$ dimensional quantum gravity and $d$ dimensional CFT. Within this correspondence, the CFT appears as a non-perturbative formulation of quantum gravity. Except in special cases, this CFT belongs to ICFT. Against this backdrop, the methods for ICFTs have developed rapidly in recent years. Many of these ICFT methods are indispensable for modern quantum gravity research. Unfortunately, these cannot be learned from textbooks on 2D CFTs, such as Yellow book. These lecture notes aim to fill this gap. Specifically, we will cover techniques that have already been applied in many studies, such as HHLL block and monodromy method, and significant results that have become proper nouns, such as Hellerman bound and HKS bound.</description>

Abstract: We construct a holographic tensor network for the double-scaled SYK model (DSSYK). The moment of the transfer matrix of DSSYK can be mapped to the matrix product state (MPS) of a spin chain. By adding the height direction as a holographic direction, we recast the MPS for DSSYK into the holographic tensor network whose building block is a 4-index tensor with the bond dimension three.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of the butterfly velocity in holographic QCD models at finite temperature and chemical potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15357v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study quantum chaos in a variety of holographic QCD models at finite temperature and chemical potentials. This includes the 1 R-Charge black hole (1RCBH) model, the 2 R-Charge black hole (2RCBH) model, a potential reconstruction-based analytic bottom-up model, and a numerical bottom-up model. All these models are different avatars of the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity action, distinguished by their specific choices of dilaton potentials and gauge-kinetic coupling functions. We focus on computing the chaos parameter, the butterfly velocity, using three distinct methods: entanglement wedge reconstruction, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and pole-skipping. We show that all three methods yield identical results for the butterfly velocity across all the holographic QCD models considered, further establishing the equivalence between the three approaches. Furthermore, we analyze in detail the behavior of the butterfly velocity as a function of chemical potential and temperature. Interestingly, a universal trend emerges across all models: the butterfly velocity increases/decreases with temperature/chemical potential for thermodynamically stable phases. Additionally, in the high-temperature limit, the butterfly velocity in all models approaches that of the chargeless plasma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent investigations of R\'enyi entanglement entropy in the SYK chain of Majorana fermions have indicated that the model exhibits slow thermalization when initialized in certain states. The extent to which the heavy modes -- believed to underlie this behavior -- affect other aspects of the model remains an open question. In this work, I study thermalization and scrambling of information in individual energy eigenstates of the SYK chain using exact diagonalization. I show that two-point correlation functions in finite-energy eigenstates closely match their thermal counterparts and that information scrambling occurs efficiently within these pure states. These results suggest that the slow thermalization observed in entanglement dynamics does not extend to all probes of thermalization and scrambling, even in pure states. I discuss the implications of these findings for thermal states in a potential holographic dual theory.</description>

Abstract: We reveal for the first time that ultraviolet (UV) observables can diagnose quantum phase transitions (QPTs). In a class of holographic models exhibiting metal-insulator transitions, we study two types of UV observables -- high-frequency conductivity and short-range entanglement. Remarkably, we find that the derivatives of these UV observables exhibit extrema near the quantum critical point. Analytical results show these critical behaviors arise from the deformation of the asymptotic bulk geometry. Moreover, these UV diagnostics show enhanced robustness to thermal fluctuations compared to typical infrared (IR) diagnostics, providing a clean method to identify quantum criticality at finite temperature. This work opens a new window for exploring quantum critical phenomena via UV physics in the laboratory.</description>

It is shown that for a particular asymptotic value of the $B$-field, the excitation energy of a long string plus its contribution to the energy of the black hole is that in $T\bar T+J\bar T+T\bar J$ deformed $CFT_2$ with $c=6k$. The excitation energy of a winding $w&gt;1$ long string plus its contribution to the background, a $w/p$ fraction of the black-hole energy, evolves according to that in a $Z_w$ twisted sector of a $p$-fold symmetric product of the latter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the holographic symmetry algebra in the MHV sector. We find an infinite dimensional Abelian symmetry algebra whose generators are the conformally soft negative helicity gravitons and gluons. So the complete symmetry algebra in the MHV graviton sector is a semideirect product of the $w_{1+\infty}$ algebra and the infinite dimensional Abelian algebra. Similarly in the MHV gluon sector the symmetry algebra is a semidirect product of the $S$ algebra and the infinite dimensional Abelian algebra. The extended symmetry algebra has some use. For example, it is known for sometime that an $n$ point MHV amplitude satisfies $(n-2)$ Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) type equations. So two equations are missing. We show that the extended symmetry algebra has additional null states whose decoupling give rise to the two missing equations.</description>

Abstract: We investigate boson stars in an $O(3)$ scalar field theory with a symmetry-breaking potential. By constructing numerically spherically symmetric solutions, we demonstrate that the model gives rise to a rich set of field configurations. The negative coupling constant of the scalar self-interactions allows for two types of boson stars: Type I solutions represent the usual boson stars, that emerge from the vacuum as the boson frequency is decreased below the boson mass, whereas type II boson stars emerge from a set of static soliton solutions. Depending on the strengths of the gravitational and the electric coupling constants, both types or only one type is present. At a critical set of coupling constants, both types undergo a bifurcation. There the spirals of both types disconnect from their branches and reconnect with each other, while the remaining branches of both types also reconnect with each other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a general method for realizing simple current extensions of the conformal field theories. We systematically obtain the $Z_{N}$ symmetry extended fusion ring of bulk and chiral theories and the corresponding modular partition functions with nonanomalous subgroup $Z_{n}(\subset Z_{N})$. The bulk (or nonchiral) fusion ring provides fundamental algebraic data for conformal bootstrap, and the chiral fusion ring provides fundamental data for the graded symmetry topological field theories. The latter also provides algebraic data of smeared boundary conformal field theories describing zero modes of the extended models. For more general multicomponent or coupled systems, we also obtain a new series of extended theories. By applying the folding trick to the resultant coupled theories, their partition functions correspond to charged or gapped domain walls or massless renormalization group flows preserving quotient group structures. This work opens new research directions in studying the classification of conformal field theories and the corresponding topological quantum field theories (or topological orders) by establishing the traditional methods in abstract algebra and modular form.</description>

      <title>$c_{\rm eff}$ from Resurgence at the Stokes Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent papers [1,2], a new method to cross the natural boundary has been proposed, and applied to Mordell-Borel integrals arising in the study of Chern-Simons theory, based on decompositions into {\it resurgent cyclic orbits}. Resurgent analysis on the Stokes line leads to a unique transseries decomposition in terms of unary false theta functions, which can be continued across the natural boundary to produce dual $q$-series whose integer-valued coefficients enumerate BPS states. This constitutes a deeper new manifestation of resurgence in quantum field theoretic path integrals. In this paper we show that the algebraic structure of the {\it resurgent cyclic orbits}, combined with just the leading term of the $q$-series, completely determines the large order rate of growth of the dual $q$-series coefficients. The essential exponent of this asymptotic growth has a Cardy-like interpretation [10] of an effective central charge in a 3 dimensional quantum field theory with $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry related to the Chern-Simons theory through the $3d$-$3d$ correspondence.</description>

      <title>AdS3 integrability, Sine-Gordon and fractional supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The massless S-matrix of the pure RR AdS3 X S3 X T4 theory is very similar but not quite the same as Fendley-Intriligator's N=2 S-matrix, in turns related to Sine-Gordon taken at a special coupling. In this short note we review the reason why supersymmetry emerges but with a fractional statistics of the particles. We then use this to obtain a very simple interpolating S-matrix between massless AdS3 and Sine-Gordon, and further find two interpolating S-matrices between these and the mixed-flux relativistic S-matrix, solving the Yang-Baxter equation all the way in-between. They are all relativistic invariant and braiding unitary, can be written in terms of particles with fractional statistics, and they might serve the purpose to embed into a parent integrable system.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in dual unitary quantum circuits with impurities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03442v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bipartite entanglement entropy is one of the most useful characterizations of universal properties in a many-body quantum system. Far from equilibrium, there exist two highly effective theories describing its dynamics -- the quasiparticle and membrane pictures. In this work we investigate entanglement dynamics, and these two complementary approaches, in a quantum circuit model perturbed by an impurity. In particular, we consider a dual unitary quantum circuit containing a spatially fixed, non-dual-unitary impurity gate, allowing for differing local Hilbert space dimensions to either side. We compute the entanglement entropy for both a semi-infinite and a finite subsystem within a finite distance of the impurity, comparing exact results to predictions of the effective theories. We find that for a semi-infinite subsystem, both theories agree with each other and the exact calculation. For a finite subsystem, however, both theories qualitatively differ, with the quasiparticle picture predicting a non-monotonic growth in contrast to the membrane picture. We show that such non-monotonic behavior can arise even in random chaotic circuits, shedding light on the range of validity of the membrane picture in such systems.</description>

      <title>A Guide to Functional Methods Beyond One-Loop Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Functional methods can be applied to the quantum effective action to efficiently determine counterterms and matching conditions for effective field theories. We extend the toolbox to two-loop order and beyond and show how to evaluate the expansion of the path integral in a manifestly gauge-covariant manner. We also generalize the method to theories with mixed spin statistics and prove the validity of the hard-region matching formula to all loop orders. The methods are exemplified with a two-loop matching calculation of the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian resulting from decoupling the electron in QED.</description>

      <title>Magnetar field dynamics shaped by chiral anomalies and helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chiral magnetic effect (CME) -- a macroscopic manifestation of the quantum chiral anomaly -- induces currents along magnetic field lines, facilitating mutual conversion between chiral asymmetry and magnetic helicity. Although the finite electron mass suppresses chiral asymmetry through spin-flip processes, we demonstrate that the CME effectively shapes magnetar field evolution. Magnetic helicity acts as a persistent internal source of chiral asymmetry, which mediates the redistribution of magnetic energy across spatial scales, without requiring an external energy source. Our three-dimensional magneto-thermal simulations of the neutron star crust reveal a novel mechanism that significantly reconfigures the magnetic field inherited at birth, amplifying both toroidal and poloidal large-scale dipolar components (crucial for spin-down) to strengths of &gt;1e14 G within just a century, at the expense of small-scale structures. This astrophysical application of the CME, distinct and complementary to conventional hydrodynamic dynamo models, offers an innovative framework for understanding magnetar field dynamics and provides a transformative solution to the origin of their exceptionally strong, large-scale fields.</description>

      <title>Emergent symmetry in a two-Higgs-doublet model from quantum information and nonstabiliserness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studies of scattering processes in scalar models with two Higgs doublets have recently hinted at a connection between the absence of flavour-space entanglement in $\Phi^+\Phi^0$ scattering and an emergent $\mathrm{SO}(8)$ symmetry in the scalar potential. We extend the analysis to all scattering channels with two particles in the external states by treating the process as a four-qubit system in the weak isospin and flavour subspaces of the $2$-particle state. We work with a generic quantum information-theoretic principle encoded by the commutativity of the initial state density matrix with the transition matrix (at leading order in perturbation theory). This yields a special case of the entanglement minimisation conditions previously derived in the literature, and we interpret the principle in terms of the conservation of non-stabiliserness (or magic). Working at leading order in the quartic couplings, we find a consistent set of conditions that implies an $\mathrm{SO}(8)$ symmetry on the quartic part of the potential for scattering an arbitrary initial state, but a smaller $\mathrm{SU}(2)_R$ symmetry when the initial state is chosen to have definite isospin. This follows by accounting for Bose symmetry in the initial state, which introduces entanglement between the isospin and flavour subspaces.</description>

      <title>Kerr black hole in a uniform magnetic field: An exact solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05199v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new class of exact spacetimes in Einstein's gravity, which are Kerr black holes immersed in an external magnetic (or electric) field that is asymptotically uniform and oriented along the rotational axis, is presented. These are axisymmetric stationary solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations such that (unlike in the Plebanski-Demianski spacetime) the null directions of the Faraday tensor are not aligned with neither of the two principal null directions of the Weyl tensor of algebraic type D (unlike the Kerr-Melvin spacetime). Three physical parameters are the black hole mass $m$, its rotation $a$, and the external field value $B$. For vanishing $B$ the metric directly reduces to standard Boyer-Lindquist form of the Kerr black hole, while for zero $m$ we recover conformally flat Bertotti-Robinson universe with a uniform Maxwell field. For zero $a$ the spacetime is contained in the Van den Bergh-Carminati solutions which can be understood as the Schwarzschild black hole in a magnetic field. Our family of black holes with non-aligned Maxwell hair - that can be called the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson (Kerr-BR) black holes - may find application in various studies ranging from mathematical relativity to relativistic astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons-matter conformal field theory on fuzzy sphere: Confinement transition of Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories compose a large class of interacting conformal field theories in 3d, among which an outstanding category is critical Chern-Simons-matter theories. In this paper, we focus on one of the simplest instances: one complex critical scalar coupled to $\mathrm{U}(1)_2$ Chern-Simons gauge field. It is theoretically interesting as it is conjectured to exhibit dualities between four simple Lagrangian descriptions, but also practically important as it describes the transition between Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid (or $\nu=1/2$ bosonic Laughlin state) and trivially gapped phase. Using the fuzzy sphere regularisation, we realise this theory as a transition on the spherical lowest Landau level between a $\nu_f=2$ fermionic integer quantum Hall state and a $\nu_b=1/2$ bosonic fractional quantum Hall state. We show that this transition is continuous and has emergent conformal symmetry. By studying the operator spectrum, we show that there exists only one relevant singlet with scaling dimension $\Delta_S=1.52(18)$. We also discuss other higher operators and the consequences of our results.</description>

      <title>Energy Extraction From the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson Black Hole via Magnetic Reconnection under Circular Plasma and Plunging Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a class of exact solutions describing rotating black holes immersed in a uniform magnetic field has been proposed, and various properties of such black holes remain unclear. This paper aims to explore how to extract energy based on the magnetic reconnection mechanism in both the circular orbit region and the plunging region. After introducing the properties of this spacetime, we analyze physical quantities such as the size of the ergoregion, the event horizon, and the boundaries of the ergosphere. We then analyze the magnetic reconnection process within circular orbits. We plot energy extraction parameter diagrams, and analyze the power and efficiency of energy extraction. The results show that the magnetic field impedes energy extraction. Comparing with Kerr black holes and Kerr-Melvin black holes, we find that this black hole's energy extraction capability is stronger than that of the Kerr-Melvin black hole but weaker than that of the Kerr black hole. Furthermore, we study magnetic reconnection and energy extraction in the plunging region of this black hole. The results indicate that the magnetic field still impedes energy extraction. The black hole's energy extraction capability in this region also remains weaker than that of a Kerr black hole but stronger than that of a Kerr-Melvin black hole. Comparing the plunging region with the circular orbit region, we find that the energy extraction power in the plunging region is consistently stronger than in the circular orbit region.</description>

      <title>Information Transport in Classical-Quantum Hybrid System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many important quantities in quantum information science, such as entropy and entanglement, are non-linear functions of the density matrix and cannot be expressed as operator observables. Standard open-system approaches evolve only a single copy of the density matrix, making it impossible to track the dynamics of such quantities. A formalism proposed by some of the present authors addressed this challenge by evolving multiple virtual replicas, but was limited to the weak-coupling regime. Here, we extend this approach to strong coupling between a quantum system and classical environments. The resulting multi-replica master equation enables direct evaluation of entropy flow and related metrics in strongly hybridized quantum-classical systems. Our results show that quantum coherence and hybridization jointly suppress net entropy transfer, creating a thermodynamic bottleneck. This framework provides a general tool for studying entropy dynamics and guiding the design of more robust, resource-efficient quantum hardware.</description>
