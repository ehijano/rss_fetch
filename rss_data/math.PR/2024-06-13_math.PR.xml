      <title>Random Combinatorial Billiards and Stoned Exclusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study several random combinatorial billiard trajectories. Such a system, which depends on a fixed parameter $p\in(0,1)$, models a beam of light that travels in a Euclidean space, occasionally randomly reflecting off of a hyperplane in the Coxeter arrangement of an affine Weyl group with some probability that depends on the side of the hyperplane that it hits. In one case, we (essentially) recover Lam's reduced random walk in the limit as $p$ tends to $0$. The investigation of our random billiard trajectories relies on an analysis of new finite Markov chains that we call stoned exclusion processes. These processes have remarkable stationary distributions determined by well-studied polynomials such as ASEP polynomials, inhomogeneous TASEP polynomials, and open boundary ASEP polynomials; in many cases, it was previously not known how to construct Markov chains with these stationary distributions. Using multiline queues, we analyze correlations in the stoned multispecies TASEP, allowing us to determine limit directions for reduced random billiard trajectories and limit shapes for new random growth processes for $n$-core partitions. Our perspective coming from combinatorial billiards naturally leads us to formulate a new variant of the ASEP on $\mathbb{Z}$ called the scan ASEP, which we deem interesting in its own right.</description>

      <title>McKean-Vlasov Forward-backward doubly stochastic differential equations and applications to stochastic control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates first the existence and uniqueness of solutions for McKean-Vlasov forward-backward doubly stochastic differential equations (MV-FBDSDEs) in infinite-dimensional real separable Hilbert spaces. These equations combine the features of forward-backward doubly stochastic differential equations with the mean-field approach, allowing the coefficients to depend on the solution distribution. We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions for MV-FBDSDEs using the method of continuation and provide an example and a counterexample to illustrate our findings. Moreover, we extend the practical applicability of our results by employing them within the context of the stochastic maximum principle for a control problem governed by MV-FBDSDEs. This study contributes to the field of stochastic control problems and presents the first analysis of MV-FBDSDEs in infinite-dimensional spaces.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the $i$-dimensional plaqutte random-cluster model with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}_q$ is dual to a $(d-i)$-dimensional plaquette random cluster model. In addition, we explore boundary conditions, infinite volume limits, and uniqueness for these models. For previously known results, we provide new proofs that rely more on the tools of algebraic topology.</description>

      <title>On the representation property for 1D general diffusion semimartingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general diffusion semimartingale is a one-dimensional path-continuous semimartingale that is also a regular strong Markov process. We say that a continuous semimartingale has the representation property if all local martingales w.r.t. its canonical filtration have an integral representation w.r.t. its continuous local martingle part. The representation property is of fundamental interest in the field of mathematical finance, where it is strongly connected to market completeness. The main result from this paper shows that the representation property holds for a general diffusion semimartingale (that is not started in an absorbing boundary point) if and only if its scale function is (locally) absolutely continuous on the interior of the state space. As an application of our main theorem, we deduce that general diffusion semimartingales with such scale functions are extreme points in their semimartingale problem. This observation contributes to a solution of a problem posed by J. Jacod and M. Yor on the extremality of strong Markov solutions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [Fleurat, Salvy 2024], we introduced a model of block-weighted random maps that undergoes a phase transition as the density of separating elements changes. The purpose of this note is to demonstrate that the methodology we developed can be extended to many other families of maps. We prove that a phase transition exists and provide detailed information about the size of the largest blocks in each regime.</description>

      <title>Weak coupling limit of KPZ with rougher than white noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the KPZ equation in $1$ spatial dimension with noise that is rougher than white by an exponent $\gamma&gt;1/4$. Under a weak coupling limit, formally removing the nonlinearity from the equation, we show using regularity structures that the renormalised solutions converge to a Gaussian limit that is different from the solution of the linear part of the equation. The regime of this effect has a nontrivial overlap with the subcritical regime $\gamma&lt;1/2$.</description>

      <title>A law of the iterated logarithm for the number of blocks in regenerative compositions generated by gamma-like subordinators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The points of the closed range of a drift-free subordinator with no killing are used for separating into blocks the elements of a sample of size $n$ from the standard exponential distribution. This gives rise to a random composition of $n$. Assuming that the subordinator has the L\'{e}vy measure, which behaves near zero like the gamma subordinator, we prove a law of the iterated logarithm for the number of blocks in the composition as $n$ tends to infinity. Along the way we prove a law of the iterated logarithm for the Lebesgue convolution of a standard Brownian motion and a deterministic regularly varying function. This result may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Central Limit Theorem on Two-Sided Descents of Mallows Distributed Elements of Finite Coxeter Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mallows distribution is a non-uniform distribution, first introduced over permutations to study non-ranked data, in which permutations are weighted according to their length. It can be generalized to any Coxeter group, and we study the distribution of $\text{des}(w) + \text{des}(w^{-1})$ where $w$ is a Mallows distributed element of a finite irreducible Coxeter group. We show that the asymptotic behavior of this statistic is Guassian. The proof uses a size-bias coupling with Stein's method.</description>

      <title>A Game Theoretic Analysis of the Three-Gambler Ruin Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the following game. Three players start with initial capitals of $s_{1},s_{2},s_{3}$ dollars; in each round player $P_{m}$ is selected with probability $\frac{1}{3}$; then \emph{he} selects player $P_{n}$ and they play a game in which $P_{m}$ wins from (resp. loses to) $P_{n}$ one dollar with probability $p_{mn}$ (resp. $p_{nm}=1-p_{mn}$). When a player loses all his capital he drops out; the game continues until a single player wins by collecting everybody's money.
  This is a "strategic" version of the classical Gambler's Ruin game. It seems reasonable that a player may improve his winning probability by judicious selection of which opponent to engage in each round. We formulate the situation as a \emph{stochastic game} and prove that it has at least one Nash equilibrium in deterministic stationary strategies.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Maximum Principle for optimal advertising models with delay and non-convex control space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study optimal advertising problems that models the introduction of a new product into the market in the presence of carryover effects of the advertisement and with memory effects in the level of goodwill. In particular, we let the dynamics of the product goodwill to depend on the past, and also on past advertising efforts. We treat the problem by means of the stochastic Pontryagin maximum principle, that here is considered for a class of problems where in the state equation either the state or the control depend on the past. Moreover the control acts on the martingale term and the space of controls can be chosen to be non-convex. The maximum principle is thus formulated using a first-order adjoint Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDEs), which can be explicitly computed due to the specific characteristics of the model, and a second-order adjoint relation.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of quantum system in fermion fields: Pontryagin-type maximum principle(I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the Pontryagin-type maximum principle for optimal control of quantum stochastic systems in fermion fields is obtained. These systems have gained significant prominence in numerous quantum applications ranging from physical chemistry to multi-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. Furthermore, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to backward quantum stochastic differential equations driven by fermion Brownian motion. The application of noncommutative martingale inequalities and the martingale representation theorem enables this achievement.</description>

      <title>Non-stationary Gaussian random fields on hypersurfaces: Sampling and strong error analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A flexible model for non-stationary Gaussian random fields on hypersurfaces is introduced. The class of random fields on curves and surfaces is characterized by a power spectral density of a second order elliptic differential operator. Sampling is done by a Galerkin--Chebyshev approximation based on the surface finite element method and Chebyshev polynomials. Strong error bounds are shown with convergence rates depending on the smoothness of the approximated random field.</description>

Abstract: We establish stability and pathwise uniqueness of solutions to Wiener noise driven McKean-Vlasov equations with random non-Lipschitz continuous coefficients. In the deterministic case, we also obtain the existence of unique strong solutions. By using our approach, which is based on an extension of the Yamada-Watanabe ansatz to the multidimensional setting and which does not rely on the construction of Lyapunov functions, we prove first moment and pathwise exponential stability. Furthermore, Lyapunov exponents are computed explicitly.</description>

      <title>Non-asymptotic convergence bounds for modified tamed unadjusted Langevin algorithm in non-convex setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.02600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from a high-dimensional target distribution $\pi_\beta$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with density proportional to $\theta\mapsto e^{-\beta U(\theta)}$ using explicit numerical schemes based on discretising the Langevin stochastic differential equation (SDE). In recent literature, taming has been proposed and studied as a method for ensuring stability of Langevin-based numerical schemes in the case of super-linearly growing drift coefficients for the Langevin SDE. In particular, the Tamed Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (TULA) was proposed in [Bro+19] to sample from such target distributions with the gradient of the potential $U$ being super-linearly growing. However, theoretical guarantees in Wasserstein distances for Langevin-based algorithms have traditionally been derived assuming strong convexity of the potential $U$. In this paper, we propose a novel taming factor and derive, under a setting with possibly non-convex potential $U$ and super-linearly growing gradient of $U$, non-asymptotic theoretical bounds in Wasserstein-1 and Wasserstein-2 distances between the law of our algorithm, which we name the modified Tamed Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (mTULA), and the target distribution $\pi_\beta$. We obtain respective rates of convergence $\mathcal{O}(\lambda)$ and $\mathcal{O}(\lambda^{1/2})$ in Wasserstein-1 and Wasserstein-2 distances for the discretisation error of mTULA in step size $\lambda$. High-dimensional numerical simulations which support our theoretical findings are presented to showcase the applicability of our algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.08242v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the stochastic heat equation driven by space-time white noise defined on an abstract Hilbert space, assuming that the drift and diffusion coefficients are both merely H\"older continuous. Random field SPDEs are covered as special examples. We give the first proof that there exists a unique in law mild solution when the diffusion coefficient is $\beta$ - H\"older continuous for $\beta&gt;\frac{3}{4}$ and uniformly non-degenerate, and that the drift is locally H\"older continuous. Meanwhile, assuming the existence of a suitable Lyapunov function for the SPDE, we prove that the solution converges exponentially fast to the unique invariant measure with respect to a typical Wasserstein distance. Our technique generalizes when the SPDE has a Burgers type non-linearity $(-A)^{\vartheta}F(X_t)$ for any $\vartheta\in(0,1)$, where $F$ is $\vartheta+\epsilon$- H\"older continuous and has linear growth. For $\vartheta\in(\frac{1}{2},1)$ this result is new even in the case of additive noise.</description>

      <title>Approximate Message Passing for sparse matrices with application to the equilibria of large ecological Lotka-Volterra systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is divided into two parts. The first part is devoted to the study of a class of Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithms which are widely used in the fields of statistical physics, machine learning, or communication theory. The AMP algorithms studied in this part are those where the measurement matrix has independent elements, up to the symmetry constraint when this matrix is symmetric, with a variance profile that can be sparse. The AMP problem is solved by adapting the approach of Bayati, Lelarge, and Montanari (2015) to this matrix model. \\ The Lotka-Volterra (LV) model is the standard model for studying the dynamical behavior of large dimensional ecological food chains. The second part of this paper is focused on the study of the statistical distribution of the globally stable equilibrium vector of a LV system in the situation where the random symmetric interaction matrix among the living species is sparse, and in the regime of large dimensions. This equilibrium vector is the solution of a Linear Complementarity Problem, which distribution is shown to be characterized through the AMP approach developed in the first part. In the large dimensional regime, this distribution is close to a mixture of a large number of truncated Gaussians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Branching processes in a varying environment encompass a wide range of stochastic demographic models, and their complete understanding in terms of limit behaviour poses a formidable research challenge. In this paper, we conduct a thorough investigation of such processes within a continuous-time framework, assuming that the reproduction law of individuals adheres to a specific parametric form for the probability generating function. Our six clear-cut limit theorems support the notion of recognizing five distinct asymptotical regimes for branching in varying environments: supercritical, asymptotically degenerate, critical, strictly subcritical, and loosely subcritical.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11259v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The preferential attachment model is a natural and popular random graph model for a growing network that contains very well-connected ``hubs''. We study the higher-order connectivity of such a network by investigating the topological properties of its clique complex. We concentrate on the expected Betti numbers, a sequence of topological invariants of the complex related to the numbers of holes of different dimensions. We determine the asymptotic growth rates of the expected Betti numbers, and prove that the expected Betti number at dimension 1 grows linearly fast, while those at higher dimensions grow sublinearly fast. Our theoretical results are illustrated by simulations. (Changes are made in this version to generalize Proposition 14 and to streamline proofs. These changes are shown in blue.)</description>

      <title>Continuous-time mean field Markov decision models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a finite number of $N$ statistically equal agents, each moving on a finite set of states according to a continuous-time Markov Decision Process (MDP). Transition intensities of the agents and generated rewards depend not only on the state and action of the agent itself, but also on the states of the other agents as well as the chosen action. Interactions like this are typical for a wide range of models in e.g. biology, epidemics, finance, social science and queueing systems among others. The aim is to maximize the expected discounted reward of the system, i.e. the agents have to cooperate as a team. Computationally this is a difficult task when $N$ is large. Thus, we consider the limit for $N\to\infty.$ In contrast to other papers we treat this problem from an MDP perspective. This has the advantage that we need less regularity assumptions in order to construct asymptotically optimal strategies than using viscosity solutions of HJB equations. The convergence rate is $1/\sqrt{N}$. We show how to apply our results using two examples: a machine replacement problem and a problem from epidemics. We also show that optimal feedback policies from the limiting problem are not necessarily asymptotically optimal.</description>

      <title>On local maxima of smooth Gaussian nonstationary processes and stationary planar fields with trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present exact formulas for both the expected number and the height distribution of local maxima (peaks) in two distinct categories of smooth, non-centered Gaussian fields: (i) nonstationary Gaussian processes and (ii) stationary planar Gaussian fields. For case (i), we introduce a novel parameter related to conditional correlation that significantly simplifies the computation of these formulas. Notably, the peak height distribution is solely dependent on this single parameter. In case (ii), traditional methods involving GOE random matrices are ineffective for non-isotropic fields with mean functions. To address this, we apply specific transformations that enable the derivation of formulas using generalized chi-squared density functions. These derived results provide essential tools for calculating p-values and power in applications of signal and change point detection within environments characterized by non-isotropic Gaussian noise.</description>

      <title>What is a $p$-adic Dyson Brownian motion?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the singular numbers of a certain explicit continuous-time Markov jump process on $\mathrm{GL}_N(\mathbb{Q}_p)$, which we argue gives the closest $p$-adic analogue of multiplicative Dyson Brownian motion. We do so by explicitly classifying the possible dynamics of singular numbers of processes on $\mathrm{GL}_N(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ satisfying natural properties possessed by Brownian motion on $\mathrm{GL}_N(\mathbb{C})$. Computing the evolution of singular numbers explicitly, we find that the $N$-tuple of singular numbers in decreasing order evolves as a Poisson jump process on $\mathbb{Z}^N$, with ordering enforced by reflection off the walls of the positive type $A$ Weyl chamber. This contrasts with -- and provides a $p$-adic analogue to -- the behavior of classical Dyson Brownian motion, where ordering is enforced by conditioning to avoid the Weyl chamber walls.</description>

      <title>A local-global principle for nonequilibrium steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global steady state of a system in thermal equilibrium exponentially favors configurations with lesser energy. This principle is a powerful explanation of self-organization because energy is a local property of a configuration. For nonequilibrium systems, there is no such property for which an analogous principle holds, hence no common explanation of the diverse forms of self-organization they exhibit. However, a flurry of recent work demonstrates that a local property of configurations called "rattling" predicts the global steady states of a broad class of nonequilibrium systems. We interpret this emerging physical theory in terms of Markov processes to generalize and prove its main claims. Surprisingly, we find that the idea at the core of rattling theory is so general as to apply to equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems alike. Its predictions hold to an extent determined by the relative variance of, and correlation between, the local and global "parts" of an arbitrary steady state. We show how these key quantities characterize the local-global relationships of random walks on random graphs, various spin-glass dynamics, and models of animal collective behavior.</description>

      <title>Operation with Concentration Inequalities and Conjugate of Parallel Sum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08206v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the concentration of the measure theory formalism, we consider the transformation $\Phi(Z)$ of a random variable $Z$ having a general concentration function $\alpha$. If the transformation $\Phi$ is $\lambda$-Lipschitz with $\lambda&gt;0$ deterministic, the concentration function of $\Phi(Z)$ is immediately deduced to be equal to $\alpha(\cdot/\lambda)$. If the variations of $\Phi$ are bounded by a random variable $\Lambda$ having a concentration function (around $0$) $\beta: \mathbb R_+\to \mathbb R$, this paper sets that $\Phi(Z)$ has a concentration function analogous to the so-called parallel produuct of $\alpha$ and $\beta$: $(\alpha^{-1} \cdot \beta^{-1})^{-1}$. We apply this result to (i) express the concentration of large-tailed random vectors, (ii) generalize Hanson Wright inequality, and (iii) provide useful insights on the so-called "multilevel concentration" that appears when $\Lambda$ is the product of $n$ random variables. This last result is obtained when we formulate the conjugate functions of the parallel sum of $n$ real mappings.</description>

Abstract: We study the limiting spectral measure of large random Helson matrices and large random matrices of certain patterned structures.
  Given a real random variable $X \in L^{2+ \varepsilon}(\mathbb{P}) $ for some $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and $\mathrm{Var}(X) = 1$. For the random $n \times n$ Helson matrices generated by the independent copies of $X$, scaling the eigenvalues by $\sqrt{n}$, we prove the almost sure weak convergence of the spectral measure to the standard Wigner semi-circular law. Similar results are established for large random matrices with certain general patterned structures.</description>

      <title>Two sided ergodic singular control and mean field game for diffusions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a probabilistic mean-field game driven by a linear diffusion an individual player aims to minimize an ergodic long-run cost by controlling the diffusion through a pair of -- increasing and decreasing -- c\`adl\`ag processes, while he is interacting with an aggregate of players through the expectation of a similar diffusion controlled by another pair of c\`adl\`ag processes. In order to find equilibrium points in this game, we first consider the control problem, in which the individual player has no interaction with the aggregate of players. In this case, we prove that the best policy is to reflect the diffusion process within two thresholds. Based on these results, we obtain criteria for the existence of equilibrium points in the mean-field game in the case when the controls of the aggregate of players are of reflection type, and give a pair of nonlinear equations to find these equilibrium points. In addition, we present an approximation result for Nash equilibria of erdogic games with finitely many players to the mean-field game equilibria considered above when the number of players tends to infinity. These results are illustrated by several examples where the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium points depend on the coefficients of the underlying diffusion.</description>

      <title>Fitting an ellipsoid to random points: predictions using the replica method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of fitting a centered ellipsoid to $n$ standard Gaussian random vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$, as $n, d \to \infty$ with $n/d^2 \to \alpha &gt; 0$. It has been conjectured that this problem is, with high probability, satisfiable (SAT; that is, there exists an ellipsoid passing through all $n$ points) for $\alpha &lt; 1/4$, and unsatisfiable (UNSAT) for $\alpha &gt; 1/4$. In this work we give a precise analytical argument, based on the non-rigorous replica method of statistical physics, that indeed predicts a SAT/UNSAT transition at $\alpha = 1/4$, as well as the shape of a typical fitting ellipsoid in the SAT phase (i.e., the lengths of its principal axes). Besides the replica method, our main tool is the dilute limit of extensive-rank "HCIZ integrals" of random matrix theory. We further study different explicit algorithmic constructions of the matrix characterizing the ellipsoid. In particular, we show that a procedure based on minimizing its nuclear norm yields a solution in the whole SAT phase. Finally, we characterize the SAT/UNSAT transition for ellipsoid fitting of a large class of rotationally-invariant random vectors. Our work suggests mathematically rigorous ways to analyze fitting ellipsoids to random vectors, which is the topic of a companion work.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove that rectified deep neural networks do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality when approximating McKean--Vlasov SDEs in the sense that the number of parameters in the deep neural networks only grows polynomially in the space dimension $d$ of the SDE and the reciprocal of the accuracy $\epsilon$.</description>

      <title>Multi-Dimensional Cohomological Phenomena in the Multiparametric Models of Random Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past two decades, extensive research has been conducted on the (co)homology of various models of random simplicial complexes. So far, it has always been examined merely as a list of groups. This paper expands upon this by describing both the ring structure and the Steenrod-algebra structure of the cohomology of the multiparametric models. For the lower model, we prove that the ring structure is always a.a.s trivial, while, for certain parameters, the Steenrod-algebra a.a.s acts non-trivially. This reveals that complex multi-dimensional topological structures appear as subcomplexes of this model. In contrast, we improve upon a result of Farber and Nowik, and assert that the cohomology of the upper multiparametric model is a.a.s concentrated in a single dimension.</description>

      <title>Diffusion models for Gaussian distributions: Exact solutions and Wasserstein errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14250v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion or score-based models recently showed high performance in image generation. They rely on a forward and a backward stochastic differential equations (SDE). The sampling of a data distribution is achieved by solving numerically the backward SDE or its associated flow ODE. Studying the convergence of these models necessitates to control four different types of error: the initialization error, the truncation error, the discretization and the score approximation. In this paper, we study theoretically the behavior of diffusion models and their numerical implementation when the data distribution is Gaussian. In this restricted framework where the score function is a linear operator, we can derive the analytical solutions of the forward and backward SDEs as well as the associated flow ODE. This provides exact expressions for various Wasserstein errors which enable us to compare the influence of each error type for any sampling scheme, thus allowing to monitor convergence directly in the data space instead of relying on Inception features. Our experiments show that the recommended numerical schemes from the diffusion models literature are also the best sampling schemes for Gaussian distributions.</description>
