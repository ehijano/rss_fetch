      <title>A Remark on Fujino's work on the canonical bundle formula via period maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fujino gave a proof in [Fuj03] for the semi-ampleness of the moduli part in the canonical bundle formula in the case when the general fibers are K3 surfaces or Abelian varieties. We show a similar statement when the general fibers are primitive symplectic varieties with mild singularities. This answers a question of Fujino raised in the same article. Moreover, using the structure theory of varieties with trivial first Chern class, we reduce the question of semi-ampleness in the case of families of K-trivial varieties to a question when the general fibers satisfy a slightly weaker Calabi-Yau condition.</description>

      <title>Characterizing rational homogeneous spaces via $\mathbb{C}^*$-actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study smooth varieties of Picard number one admitting a special dominating family of rational curves and an equalized $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. In particular we show that $X$ is a smooth variety of Picard number one with nef tangent bundle admitting an equalized $\mathbb{C}^*$-action with an isolated extremal fixed point if and only if $X$ is an irreducible Hermitian symmetric space.</description>

      <title>Homological smoothness and Deligne resolution for tropical fans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say that a tropical fan is homologically smooth if each of its open subsets verify tropical Poincare duality. A tropical homology manifold is a tropical variety that is locally modelled by open subsets of homologically smooth tropical fans.
  We show that homological smoothness is a T-stable property in the category of tropical fans. This implies in particular that quasilinear fans are homologically smooth, and tropical varieties locally modelled by them are tropical homology manifolds. Previously, this was known only for locally matroidal tropical varieties.
  In order to show the above results, we prove a tropical analogue of the Deligne weight spectral sequence for homologically smooth tropical fans. This allows to describe the cohomology of tropical modifications, and will be of importance in our companion work which develops a Hodge theory in the tropical setting.</description>

      <title>Resolution of $1$-foliations singularities on surfaces and threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider resolution of singularities for $1$-foliations on varieties of dimension at most three in positive characteristic. We prove that such singularities can be completely resolved if we allow tame regular Deligne--Mumford stacks as underlying spaces. If one restricts to underlying varieties, we show that $1$-foliations singularities can be simplified into multiplicative ones.</description>

      <title>K-stable valuations and Calabi-Yau metrics on affine spherical varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After providing an explicit K-stability condition for a $\mathbb{Q}$-Gorenstein log spherical cone, we prove the existence and uniqueness of an equivariant K-stable degeneration of the cone, and deduce uniqueness of the asymptotic cone of a given complete $K$-invariant Calabi-Yau metric in the trivial class of an affine $G$-spherical manifold, $K$ being the maximal compact subgroup of $G$.
  Next, we prove that the valuation induced by $K$-invariant Calabi-Yau metrics on affine $G$-spherical manifolds is in fact $G$-invariant. As an application, we point out an affine smoothing of a Calabi-Yau cone that does not admit any $K$-invariant Calabi-Yau metrics asymptotic to the cone. Another corollary is that on $\mathbb{C}^3$, there are no other complete Calabi-Yau metrics with maximal volume growth and spherical symmetry other than the standard flat metric and the Li-Conlon-Rochon-Sz\'ekelyhidi metrics with horospherical asymptotic cone. This answers the question whether there is a nontrivial asymptotic cone with smooth cross section on $\mathbb{C}^{3}$ raised by Conlon-Rochon when the symmetry is spherical.</description>

      <title>Border rank bounds for $GL(V)$-invariant tensors arising from matrices of constant rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove border rank bounds for a class of $GL(V)$-invariant tensors in $V^*\otimes U\otimes W$, where $U$ and $W$ are $GL(V)$-modules. These tensors correspond to spaces of matrices of constant rank. In particular we prove lower bounds for tensors in $\mathbb{C}^l\otimes\mathbb{C}^m\otimes\mathbb{C}^n$ that are not $1_A$-generic, where no nontrivial bounds were known, and also when $l,m\ll n$, where previously only bounds for unbalanced matrix multiplication tensors were known. We give the first explicit use of Young flattenings for tensors beyond Koszul to obtain border rank lower bounds, and determine the border rank of three tensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a lattice-theoretic classification of non-symplectic automorphisms of prime order of irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds of OG10 type. We determine which automorphisms are induced by a non-symplectic automorphism of prime order of a cubic fourfold on the associated LSV manifolds, giving a geometric and lattice-theoretic description of the algebraic and transcendental lattices of the cubic fourfold. As an application we discuss the rationality conjecture for a general cubic fourfold with a non-symplectic automorphism of prime order.</description>

      <title>Zeta-functions of Curves over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Curves over finite fields are of great importance in cryptography and coding theory. Through studying their zeta-functions, we would be able to find out vital arithmetic and geometric information about them and their Jacobians, including the number of rational points on this kind of curves. In this paper, I investigate if it is possible to construct a curve over finite fields of a given genus $g$ whose zeta-function is given as a product of zeta-functions of $g$ elliptic curves, and find out alternative methods if it is not possible. Basically, I look for conditions which those $g$ elliptic curves should satisfy such that their product (of their Jacobians) is isogenous to the Jacobian of a curve of a given genus $g$. Then from this isogenous relationship I can determine the characteristic polynomial of the Frobenius endomorphism of the Jacobian of the new curve and by this characteristic polynomial I can thus determine the zeta-function of this new curve. By using the zeta-functions of curves in the form as generating functions, the number of rational points on curves can even be found out, which may lead to further researches relating to some applications in cryptography, coding theory and even information theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ``Calabi-Yau Manifolds: a Bestiary for Physicists'' by Tristan Hubsch in 1992 was a classic that served to introduce algebraic geometry to physicists when the first string theory revolution of 1984 - 94 brought, inter alia, the subject of Calabi-Yau manifolds to the staple of high-energy theorists. We are fortunate that a substantially expanded and updated new edition of the Bestiary will shortly appear. This brief note will serve as an afterword to the much anticipated volume.</description>

      <title>Equivariant formality in complex-oriented theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a product of unitary groups and let $(M,\omega)$ be a compact symplectic manifold with Hamiltonian $G$-action. We prove an equivariant formality result for any complex-oriented cohomology theory $\mathbb{E}^*$ (in particular, integral cohomology). This generalizes the celebrated result of Atiyah-Bott-Kirwan for rational cohomology. The proof does not use classical ideas but instead relies on a recent cohomological splitting result of Abouzaid-McLean-Smith for Hamiltonian fibrations over $\mathbb{CP}^1$. Moreover, we establish analogues of the "localization" and "injectivity to fixed points" theorems for certain cohomology theories studied by Hopkins-Kuhn-Ravenel. As an application of these results, we establish a Goresky-Kottwitz-MacPherson theorem with Morava $K$-theory coefficients for Hamiltonian $T$-manifolds.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we compute the pseudo-effective cones of various projective bundles $\mathbb{P}_X(E)$ over higher dimensional varieties $X$ under some assumptions on $X$ as well as on the vector bundle $E$. We also compute the volume function on fibre product $\mathbb{P}(E)\times_C\mathbb{P}(F)$ of two projective bundles over a smooth irreducible complex projective curve $C$. In particular, we show that the volume function on the fiber product of two ruled surfaces is of polynomial type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the singularities of varieties obtained as infinitesimal quotients by $1$-foliations in positive characteristic. (1) We show that quotients by (log) canonical $1$-foliations preserve the (log) singularities of the MMP. (2) We prove that quotients by multiplicative derivations preserve many properties, amongst which most $F$-singularities. (3) We formulate a notion of families of $1$-foliations, and investigate the corresponding families of quotients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12756v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a smooth, projective curve $Y$, a point $y_0 \in Y$, a positive integer $n$, and a transitive subgroup $G$ of the symmetric group $S_{d}$ we study smooth, proper families, parameterized by algebraic varieties, of pointed degree $d$ covers of $(Y,y_0)$, $(X,x_{0})\to (Y,y_0)$, branched in $n$ points of $Y\setminus y_{0}$, whose monodromy group equals $G$. We construct a Hurwitz space $H$, an algebraic variety whose points are in bijective correspondence with the equivalence classes of pointed covers of $(Y,y_0)$ of this type. We construct explicitly a family parameterized by $H$, whose fibers belong to the corresponding equivalence classes, and prove that it is universal. We use classical tools of algebraic topology and of complex algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Lang--Trotter Conjecture for CM Elliptic Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.14256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an elliptic curve $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ and non-zero integer $r$, the Lang--Trotter conjecture predicts a striking asymptotic formula for the number of good primes $p\leqslant x$, denoted by $\pi_{E,r}(x)$, such that the Frobenius trace of $E$ at $p$ is equal to the given integer $r$. We focus on the CM case in this memoir, and show how to realize the following two goals:
  (1) to give an unconditional estimate for $\pi_{E,r}(x)$, which confirms the upper bound part of the conjecture up to a constant multiple;
  (2) to give a conditional explicit asymptotic formula for $\pi_{E,r}(x)$ based on the Hardy--Littlewood conjecture on primes represented by quadratic polynomials.
  For completeness, we also summarize classical results on quadratic, cubic and quartic residues, as well as the corresponding reciprocity laws. This part should be of independent interests and could provide useful materials for more junior readers. We also highlight some possible extensions of the arguments in this memoir that may work for other statistical problems of CM elliptic curves.</description>

      <title>Maximal parahoric arithmetic transfers, resolutions and modularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.11994v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any unramified quadratic extension of $p$-adic local fields $F/F_0$ $(p&gt;2)$, we formulate several arithmetic transfer conjectures at any maximal parahoric level, in the context of Zhang's relative trace formula approach to the arithmetic Gan--Gross--Prasad conjecture. The formulation involves a way to resolve the singularity of relevant moduli spaces via natural stratifications and modify derived fixed points. By a local-global method and double induction, we prove these conjectures for $F_0$ unramified over $\mathbb Q_p$, including the arithmetic fundamental lemma for $p&gt;2$. Moreover, we prove new modularity results for arithmetic theta series at parahoric levels via a method of modification over $\mathbb F_q$ and $\mathbb C$. Along the way, we study the complex and mod $p$ geometry of Shimura varieties and special cycles. We introduce the relative Cayley map and also establish Jacquet--Rallis transfers at maximal parahoric levels.</description>
