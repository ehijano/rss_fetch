      <title>When Truth Does Not Take on Its Shoes: How Misinformation Spreads in Chatrooms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine how misinformation spreads in social networks composed of individuals with long-term offline relationships. Especially, we focus on why misinformation persists and diffuses despite being recognized by most as false. In our psychological game theoretical model, each agent who receives a piece of (mis)information must first decide how to react -- by openly endorsing it, remaining silent, or openly challenging it. After observing the reactions of her neighbors who also received the message, the agent then chooses whether to forward it to others in her own chatroom who have not yet received it. By distinguishing these two roles, our framework addresses puzzling real-world phenomena, such as the gap between what individuals privately believe and what they publicly transmit. A key assumption in our model is that, while perceived veracity influences decisions, the dominant factor is the alignment between an agent's beliefs and those of her social network -- a feature characteristic of communities formed through long-term offline relationships. This dynamic can lead agents to tacitly accept and even propagate information they privately judge to be of low credibility. Our results challenge the view that improving information literacy alone can curb the spread of misinformation. We show that when agents are highly sensitive to peer pressure and the network exhibits structural polarization, even if the majority does not genuinely believe in it, the message still can spread widely without encountering open resistance.</description>

      <title>Who gets hit first and who recovers last? Evidence from Indian Coastal Flood Shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Catastrophic floods directly risk 1.8 billion lives worldwide, most of whom are from East and South Asia. How do extreme floods reshape paid labor outcomes? To answer this, I focus on a 1-in-100 year flood event in India. I first combine Sentinel-1 SAR with JRC Global Surface Water dataset to generate flood map. Using information from this map in various rounds of periodic labor force surveys, I estimate gender-specific dynamic effects of the flood shock. Key results show that men experienced short-lived reduction in their employment while women faced a delayed but persistent decline in their working hours. Men suffered most in secondary sector and increased their participation in primary sector. Women were hit hardest in the tertiary sector. Such sectoral impacts could be attributable to disruptions in infrastructure and physical capital. Moreover, marital status and dependency burden further shape the gender differential effects of the extreme flood event. Results remain robust under alternative treatment definitions.</description>

      <title>PyPSA-DE: Open-source German energy system model reveals savings from integrated planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Germany has set an ambitious target of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. We explore how integrated cross-sectoral planning can reduce costs compared to existing national plans. Our new linear optimization model PyPSA-DE simulates the electricity and hydrogen transmission networks, as well as supply, demand, and storage in all sectors of the energy system in Germany and its neighboring countries with high spatial and temporal resolution. While our new model shows strong electricity transmission grid development, total expansion is one third lower than in the national grid development plan, lowering costs by 92 billion EUR$_{2020}$ to 191 billion EUR$_{2020}$ and average grid tariffs by 7.5 EUR$_{2020}$ / MWh. These savings are mainly due to integrated planning and operation, a market design with regional prices, and a system-optimal usage of offshore wind. PyPSA-DE is open-source and can readily be adapted to study related issues around the energy transition.</description>

      <title>Bridging Quasi-Experimental and Structural Approaches for Robust Evaluation of US Airline Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15785v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We bridge quasi-experimental and structural approaches to develop a robust method for retrospective merger evaluation. First, we show that the standard difference-in-differences estimation equation can be interpreted as a "reduced form" of our structural equations, formally $\textit{bridging}$ these methodologies. Demand and cost parameters enable the construction of a robust measure of the merger price effect that remains identified even when the difference-in-differences approach is not, and can be decomposed into efficiency gains versus conduct changes among the remaining firms. Second, we enhance the structural approach by weighting each market's contribution to the moment conditions using market- and time-specific synthetic weights when the number of treated markets is limited. Applying this methodology to three major airline mergers, we find that modest efficiency gains are entirely offset by increased coordination, particularly in later mergers. The $\textit{synthetic GMM}$ refinement sharpens these findings, uncovering anti-competitive effects that standard approaches miss.</description>

      <title>Individual utilities of life satisfaction reveal inequality aversion unrelated to political alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07793v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How should well-being be prioritised in society, and what trade-offs are people willing to make between fairness and personal well-being? We investigate these questions using a stated preference experiment with a nationally representative UK sample (n = 300), in which participants evaluated life satisfaction outcomes for both themselves and others under conditions of uncertainty. Individual-level utility functions were estimated using an Expected Utility Maximisation (EUM) framework and tested for sensitivity to the overweighting of small probabilities, as characterised by Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT). A majority of participants displayed concave (risk-averse) utility curves and showed stronger aversion to inequality in societal life satisfaction outcomes than to personal risk. These preferences were unrelated to political alignment, suggesting a shared normative stance on fairness in well-being that cuts across ideological boundaries. The results challenge use of average life satisfaction as a policy metric, and support the development of nonlinear utility-based alternatives that more accurately reflect collective human values. Implications for public policy, well-being measurement, and the design of value-aligned AI systems are discussed.</description>

      <title>Reimagining Agent-based Modeling with Large Language Model Agents via Shachi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of emergent behaviors in large language model (LLM)-driven multi-agent systems is a critical research challenge, yet progress is limited by a lack of principled methodologies for controlled experimentation. To address this, we introduce Shachi, a formal methodology and modular framework that decomposes an agent's policy into core cognitive components: Configuration for intrinsic traits, Memory for contextual persistence, and Tools for expanded capabilities, all orchestrated by an LLM reasoning engine. This principled architecture moves beyond brittle, ad-hoc agent designs and enables the systematic analysis of how specific architectural choices influence collective behavior. We validate our methodology on a comprehensive 10-task benchmark and demonstrate its power through novel scientific inquiries. Critically, we establish the external validity of our approach by modeling a real-world U.S. tariff shock, showing that agent behaviors align with observed market reactions only when their cognitive architecture is appropriately configured with memory and tools. Our work provides a rigorous, open-source foundation for building and evaluating LLM agents, aimed at fostering more cumulative and scientifically grounded research.</description>
