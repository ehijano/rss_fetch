      <title>The meaning of closeness to women and/or LGBTQ+ physicists: a social network analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 'Closeness' is well-defined as a quantitative measure of centrality in social network analysis (SNA), but it is not as well defined qualitatively as a description of social relationships. This paper presents a qualitative analysis of 'closeness' as it is defined both implicitly and explicitly in interviews with 100 women and/or LGBTQ+ PhD physicists. The interviews include a social network construction component, and we define a quantitative network parameter that serves as a proxy for closeness, which we examine in relation to attributes of network members. We find that physicists in this sample see trust, relaxed boundaries, reliance, and support as concepts that most directly define closeness in their relationships. Consistent interaction, positive affect, and commonalities are also often present in (and in some cases, defining of) these relationships. From the quantitative analysis, we find that these physicists tend to view family and partners, friends, and professional friends as comprising their closest relationships. These results are consistent with other studies which have sought to define closeness qualitatively, but the prevalence of trust in this dataset in particular suggests that these physicists see the ability to confide as uniquely important in their relationships. We make recommendations to institutions supporting and employing physicists on how to better support gender and sexual minority (GSM) physicists going forward, and we believe these results help us gain a better understanding of how GSM physicists find success in physics despite the barriers they face due to their identities.</description>

      <title>Decentralization can hinder frequency synchronization in power grids through multiple phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decarbonization is rapidly increasing the penetration of inverter-based renewables and other low-capacity generators, intensifying concerns about frequency synchronization in increasingly decentralized power grids. A common heuristic from Kuramoto onset theory and homogeneous parameter swing-equation models is that distributing generation across many smaller units reduces the effective heterogeneity of nodal injections (natural frequencies) and lowers the coupling required for synchronization. Here, using a second-order Kuramoto model, we investigate how decentralization affects frequency synchronization when inertia and damping scale with power generation and consumption. We find that decentralization does not always lower the critical frequency synchronization threshold. Instead, increasing decentralization can induce a non-monotonic dependence of the critical coupling strength and lead to a double phase transition in frequency synchronization. These behaviors remain robust under asymmetric inertia between consumers and generators. Even when empirical power-generation and power-consumption distributions are considered, a region in which the critical threshold remains nearly constant is observed as decentralization increases. Our results demonstrate that decentralization can give rise to complex collective dynamics and caution against assuming that decentralization alone ensures improved frequency synchronization.</description>

      <title>An Epidemiological Modeling Take on Religion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Religions are among the most consequential social institutions, shaping collective identities, moral norms, and political organization across societies and historical periods. Nevertheless, despite extensive scholarship describing conversion, competition, and secularization, there is still no widely adopted formal model that captures religious dynamics over time within a unified, mechanistic framework. In this study, we propose an epidemiologically grounded model of religious change in which religions spread and compete analogously to co-circulating strains. The model extends multi-strain compartmental dynamics by distinguishing passive believers, active missionaries, and religious elites, and by incorporating demographic turnover and mutation-like splitting that endogenously generates new denominations. Using computer simulations, we show that the same mechanism reproduces canonical qualitative regimes, including emergence from rarity, rapid expansion, long-run coexistence, and transient rise-and-fall movements. A reduced calibration variant fits historical affiliation trajectories with parsimonious regime shifts in effective recruitment and disaffiliation, yielding interpretable signatures of changing social conditions. Finally, sensitivity analyses map sharp regime boundaries in parameter space, indicating that modest shifts in recruitment efficacy or retention among active spreaders can qualitatively alter long-run religious landscapes. These results establish a general, interpretable framework for studying religion as a dynamical diffusion process and provide a tool for comparative inference and counterfactual analysis in sociological research.</description>

      <title>City-level energy and emission assessment based on 20+ million electric vehicle registrations in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: China, the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) market, plays a pivotal role in global decarbonization of the transport sector. We present the first high-resolution assessment of EV adoption in 295 cities, utilizing more than 20 million registrations of 586 EV models tracked monthly from 2022 to 2024 and projecting transition pathways to 2035. Real-world data reveal that EVs are 30.9-212.8 megajoules per 100 kilometers (km) more energy efficient than internal combustion vehicles, yet their carbon intensities range from 18.2 to 270.4 grams of carbon dioxide (gCO2)/km among provinces. The limited electrification of hybrids means that gasoline still accounts for 44% of EV energy use. Scenario projections suggest that emissions will peak about 2030 at 21.1-30.9 megatonnes of CO2, declining by 2035 as solid-state batteries and stronger policies are introduced. The findings establish an empirical foundation for accurate emissions accounting, emphasize the need to reduce regional disparities in adoptability, and offer globally relevant insights to accelerate deep decarbonization in road transport.</description>

      <title>Quantum, Diplomacy, and Geopolitics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum technologies, spanning communication, sensing, computing, and cryptography, are rapidly emerging as critical paths of geopolitical competition and strategic defence innovation. Unlike traditional technological advances, quantum introduces novel capabilities that fundamentally disrupt established norms of security, intelligence, and diplomatic engagement. This strategic analysis explores the evolving quantum landscape through the dual lenses of diplomacy and geopolitics, with specific implications for defence leaders, policymakers, and industry stakeholders. The benefits and challenges of quantum technologies are examined from a diplomatic and geopolitical perspective to help leaders make informed strategic decisions. Leading powers now recognise quantum as a domain where technological leadership directly translates to geopolitical influence, compelling an intense race for dominance alongside new forms of multilateral diplomacy aimed at managing both risks and opportunities. Quantum technologies do not all have the same operational maturity, but technological progress is accelerating. Post-quantum cryptography demands immediate action, every encrypted communication created today may be harvested and decrypted within the decade by adversaries equipped with quantum capabilities.</description>

      <title>The hidden structure of innovation networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Innovation emerges from complex collaboration patterns - among inventors, firms, or institutions. However, not much is known about the overall mesoscopic structure around which inventive activity self-organizes. Here, we tackle this problem by employing patent data to analyze both individual (co-inventorship) and organization (co-ownership) networks in three strategic domains (artificial intelligence, biotechnology and semiconductors). We characterize the mesoscale structure (in terms of clusters) of each domain by comparing two alternative methods: a standard baseline - modularity maximization - and one based on the minimization of the Bayesian Information Criterion, within the Stochastic Block Model and its degree-corrected variant. We find that, across sectors, inventor networks are denser and more clustered than organization ones - consistent with the presence of small recurrent teams embedded into broader institutional hierarchies - whereas organization networks have neater hierarchical role-based structures, with few bridging firms coordinating the most peripheral ones. We also find that the discovered meso-structures are connected to innovation output. In particular, Lorenz curves of forward citations show a pervasive inequality in technological influence: across sectors and methods, both inventor (especially) and organization networks consistently show high levels of concentration of citations in a few of the discovered clusters. Our results demonstrate that the baseline modularity-based method may not be capable of fully capturing the way collaborations drive the spreading of inventive impact across technological domains. This is due to the presence of local hierarchies that call for more refined tools based on Bayesian inference.</description>
