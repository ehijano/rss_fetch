      <title>Augmented Lagrangian methods produce cutting-edge magnetic coils for stellarator fusion reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding feasible coils for stellarator fusion devices is a crux of realizing this concept for future power plants. The coils must reproduce the physics properties of the target plasma while satisfying myriad engineering constraints. Current efforts struggle to navigate the highly nonconvex optimization landscape and result in suboptimal stellarator coils, and/or they end up spending considerable resources scanning the continuous parameter space. In this work, we present an augmented Lagrangian approach to tackle the ill-posed problem of coil optimization. Our approach yields solutions that out-perform previous Pareto-optimal work and display excellent physics and engineering properties. We conclude by illustrating its effectiveness and versatility by generating coils for five stellarators with very different symmetries and magnetic field shaping. In all cases, we find coil solutions that in various ways outperform published coil sets, including built and operating reactors such as Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) and the Helically Symmetric eXperiment (HSX).</description>

      <title>Early Prediction of Current Quench Events in the ADITYA Tokamak using Transformer based Data Driven Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disruptions in tokamak plasmas, marked by sudden thermal and current quenches, pose serious threats to plasma-facing components and system integrity. Accurate early prediction, with sufficient lead time before disruption onset, is vital to enable effective mitigation strategies. This study presents a novel data-driven approach for predicting early current quench, a key precursor to disruptions, using transformer-based deep learning models, applied to ADITYA tokamak diagnostic data. Using multivariate time series data, the transformer model outperforms LSTM baselines across various data distributions and prediction thresholds. The transformer model achieves better recall, maintaining values above 0.9 even up to a prediction threshold of 8-10 ms, significantly outperforming LSTM in this critical metric. The proposed approach remains robust up to an 8 ms lead time, offering practical feasibility for disruption mitigation in ADITYA tokamak. In addition, a comprehensive data diversity analysis and bias sensitivity study underscore the generalization of the model. This work marks the first application of transformer architectures to ADITYA tokamak data for early current-quench prediction, establishing a promising foundation for real time disruption avoidance in short-pulse tokamaks.</description>

      <title>Assessing the economic benefits of space weather mitigation investment decisions: Evidence from Aotearoa New Zealand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space weather events pose a growing threat to modern economies, yet their macroeconomic consequences still remain underexplored. This study presents the first dedicated economic assessment of geomagnetic storm impacts on Aotearoa New Zealand, quantifying potential GDP losses across seven disruption and mitigation scenarios due to an extreme coronal mass ejection (CME). The primary focus is upon the damaging impacts of geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) on the electrical power transmission network. The goal is to support decision-making around space weather mitigation investments by providing a first-order approximation of their potential economic benefits. We find that in the absence of mitigation, a severe but realistic storm could result in up to NZ\$8.36 billion in lost GDP, with more than half stemming from cascading supply chain effects. Yet, even less severe scenarios incur losses exceeding NZ\$3 billion. Importantly, research-led operational strategies, such as optimized switching and islanding, can avoid up to NZ\$370 million in losses for as little as NZ\$500,000 in expenditure, delivering a benefit-cost ratio of 740 to 1. Moreover, physical protections such as GIC blocking devices further reduce disruption to as low as NZ\$1.12 billion, with avoided GDP losses up to NZ\$2.3 billion, and benefit-cost returns up to 80 to 1. When also acknowledging unmodelled impacts, including multi-billion losses in capital equipment and long-term revenue, the economic rationale for pre-emptive mitigation becomes even more pertinent. Future research needs to integrate the modelling of capital and revenue losses for strategically important industrial facilities.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Dynamics of Strongly Magnetized Ion-Electron Relativistic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present 3D simulations of semirelativistic collisionless magnetic reconnection, where upstream ions are subrelativistic while electrons are ultrarelativistic. We employ the realistic proton-to-electron mass ratio and explore a range of upstream ion magnetization spanning two orders of magnitude, with our highest-magnetization run achieving unprecedentedly large domain sizes. Through a parameter scan, we find that as the system transitions from mildly to trans- and ultrarelativistic regimes the qualitative behavior of reconnection becomes strongly influenced by 3D effects mediated by drift-kink and flux-rope kink dynamics. As a result, magnetic-energy dissipation at high magnetizations, and the subsequent nonthermal particle acceleration, can become less efficient, contrary to general expectations for 3D relativistic reconnection. Our results have important implications for understanding reconnection in magnetized astrophysical scenarios, such as the surroundings of black holes and neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Accelerated free energy estimation in ab initio path integral Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a methodology for accelerating the estimation of the free energy from path integral Monte Carlo simulations by considering an intermediate artificial reference system where interactions are inexpensive to evaluate numerically. Using the spherically averaged Ewald interaction as this intermediate reference system for the uniform electron gas, the interaction contribution for the free energy was evaluated up to 18 times faster than the Ewald-only method. Furthermore, a $\xi$-extrapolation technique was tested and applied to alleviate the fermion sign problem and to resolve the sign for large particle numbers. Combining these two techniques enabled the evaluation of the free energy for a system of 1000 electrons, where both finite-size and statistical errors are below chemical accuracy. The general procedure can be applied to systems relevant for planetary and inertial confinement fusion modeling with low to moderate levels of quantum degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Evidence for an Inverse Cascade of Magnetic Helicity in the Inner Heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To elucidate the cascade direction of the solar wind turbulence, we analyzed magnetic helicity density spectra from the Parker Solar Probe data across more than 500 heliocentric distances. For the first time, we confirmed a persistent inverse cascade extending from the Sun to Mercury's orbital vicinity. This finding challenges the conventional hypothesis that the magnetic helicity density within the inner heliosphere is random. Furthermore, our analysis revealed a radial sign change of the spectral magnetic helicity density at a frequency whose value decreases logarithmically with distance. These results provide new insights into the evolution of solar wind turbulence in the inner heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Preferential acceleration of heavy ions in magnetic reconnection: Hybrid-kinetic simulations with electron inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar energetic particles (SEPs) in the energy range 10s KeV/nucleon-100s MeV/nucleon originate from Sun. Their high flux near Earth may damage the space borne electronics and generate secondary radiations harmful for the life on Earth and thus understanding their energization on Sun is important for space weather prediction. Impulsive (or ${}^{3}$He-rich) SEP events are associated with the acceleration of charge particles in solar flares by magnetic reconnection (MR) and related processes. The preferential acceleration of heavy ions and the extra-ordinary abundance enhancement of ${}^3$He in the impulsive SEPs are not understood yet. We study heavy-ion acceleration and their abundance enhancements by MR, an established acceleration source for impulsive SEPs in which heavy-ion enhancement is observed. We simulate MR using a 2-D hybrid-kinetic plasma model (kinetic ions and inertial electron fluid) with all the ions species treated self-consistently. We find that heavy ions are preferentially accelerated to energies many times larger than their initial thermal energies by a variety of acceleration mechanisms operating in MR. Most efficient acceleration takes place in the flux pileup regions of MR. Heavy ions with sufficiently small values of charge to mass ratio ($Q/M$) can be accelerated by pickup mechanism in outflow regions even before any magnetic flux is piled up. The energy spectra of heavy ions develop a shoulder like region, a non-thermal feature, as a result of the acceleration. The spectral index of the power law fit to the shoulder region of the spectra varies approximately as $(Q/M)^{-0.64}$. Abundance enhancement factor, defined as number of particles above a threshold energy normalized to total number of particles, scales as $(Q/M)^{-\alpha}$ where $\alpha$ increases with the energy threshold. We discuss our simulation results in the light of the SEP observations.</description>

      <title>Multiple solutions to the static forward free-boundary Grad-Shafranov problem on MAST-U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Grad-Shafranov (GS) equation is a nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation that governs the ideal magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium of a tokamak plasma. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of multiple solutions to the GS equation when solved in idealistic geometries with simplified plasma current density profiles and boundary conditions. Until now, the question of whether multiple equilibria might exist in real-world tokamak geometries with more complex current density profiles and integral free-boundary conditions (commonly used in production-level equilibrium codes) has remained unanswered. In this work, we discover multiple solutions to the static forward free-boundary GS problem in the MAST-U tokamak geometry using the validated evolutive equilibrium solver FreeGSNKE and the deflated continuation algorithm. By varying the plasma current, current density profile coefficients, or coil currents in the GS equation, we identify and characterise distinct equilibrium solutions, including both deeply and more shallowly confined plasma states. We suggest that the existence of even more equilibria is likely prohibited by the restrictive nature of the integral free-boundary condition, which globally couples poloidal fluxes on the computational boundary with those on the interior. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for wider equilibrium modelling and emphasise the need to explore whether multiple solutions are present in other equilibrium codes and tokamaks, as well as their potential impact on downstream simulations that rely on GS equilibria.</description>

      <title>An Improved Boris Algorithm for Charge Particle Orbit in Tokamak Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An improved Boris algorithm for simulating the motion of charged particles in electromagnetic fields has been developed. This enhancement addresses the issue of inaccurate fast-scale cyclotron phase calculations present in the original Boris algorithm, while preserving its advantage in simulating slow-scale guiding center motion. As a result, it strikes a balance between low and high-frequency dynamics, overcoming the limitations of traditional second-order volume-preserving algorithms (VPAs) which are constrained to a single characteristic frequency. Test particle simulations indicate that, in most cases, the improved Boris algorithm achieves significantly higher accuracy than conventional VPAs when simulating cases involving various frequencies of electric field within a typical Tokamak magnetic field, highlighting its superior efficacy in handling problems across a wide range of characteristic frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Until now, quasi-isodynamic magnetic fields have been the only known stellarator configurations that, at low collisionality, give small radial neoclassical transport and zero bootstrap current for arbitrary plasma profiles, the latter facilitating control of the magnetic configuration. The recently introduced notion of piecewise omnigenous fields has enormously broadened the space of stellarator configurations with small radial neoclassical transport. In this Letter, the existence of piecewise omnigenous fields that give zero bootstrap current is proven analytically and confirmed numerically. These results establish piecewise omnigenity as an alternative approach to stellarator reactor design.</description>

      <title>Magnetorotational instability in a solar mean-field dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the question whether the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) can operate in the near-surface shear layer (NSSL) of the Sun and how it affects the interaction with the dynamo process. Using hydromagnetic mean-field simulations of $\alpha\Omega$-type dynamos in rotating shearing-periodic boxes, we show that for negative shear, the MRI can operate above a certain critical shear parameter. This parameter scales inversely with the equipartition magnetic field strength above which $\alpha$ quenching set in. Like the usual $\Omega$ effect, the MRI produces toroidal magnetic field, but in our Cartesian cases it is found to reduce the resulting magnetic field strength and thus to suppress the dynamo process. In view of the application to the solar NSSL, we conclude that the turbulent magnetic diffusivity may be too large for the MRI to be excited and that therefore only the standard $\Omega$ effect is expected to operate.</description>

Abstract: Energetic particles in interplanetary space are normally measured at time scales that are long compared to the ion gyroperiod. Such observations by necessity average out the microphysics associated with the acceleration and transport of 10s - 100s keV particles. We investigate previously unseen non-equilibrium features that only become observable at very high time resolution, and discuss possible explanations of these features. We use unprecedentedly high-time-resolution data that were acquired by the in situ instruments on Solar Orbiter in the vicinity of two interplanetary shocks observed on 2023-11-29 07:51:17 UTC and 2023-11-30 10:47:26 UTC at $\sim 0.83$ astronomical units from the Sun. The solar-wind proton beam population follows the magnetic field instantaneously, on time scales which are significantly shorter than a gyro-period. Energetic particles, despite sampling large volumes of space, vary on remarkably short time scales, typically on the order of the convection time of their gyro-radius. Non-equilibrium features such as bump-on-tail distributions of energetic particles are formed by small-scale magnetic structures in the IMF. High-time-resolution observations show previously unobserved microphysics in the vicinity of two traveling interplanetary shocks, including ion reflection at a current sheet, which may explain where ions are reflected in shock acceleration.</description>
