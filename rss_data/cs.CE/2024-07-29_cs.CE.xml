      <title>Parsimonious Universal Function Approximator for Elastic and Elasto-Plastic Cavity Expansion Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity expansion is a canonical problem in geotechnics, which can be described by partial differential equations (PDEs) and ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This study explores the potential of using a new solver, a physics-informed neural network (PINN), to calculate the stress field in an expanded cavity in the elastic and elasto-plastic regimes. Whilst PINNs have emerged as an effective universal function approximator for deriving the solutions of a wide range of governing PDEs/ODEs, their ability to solve elasto-plastic problems remains uncertain. A novel parsimonious loss function is first proposed to balance the simplicity and accuracy of PINN. The proposed method is applied to diverse material behaviours in the cavity expansion problem including isotropic, anisotropic elastic media, and elastic-perfectly plastic media with Tresca and Mohr-Coulomb yield criteria. The results indicate that the use of a parsimonious prior information-based loss function is highly beneficial to deriving the approximate solutions of complex PDEs with high accuracy. The present method allows for accurate derivation of solutions for both elastic and plastic mechanical responses of an expanded cavity. It also provides insights into how PINNs can be further advanced to solve more complex problems in geotechnical practice.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global financial landscape is experiencing significant transformation driven by technological advancements and evolving market dynamics. Moreover, blockchain technology has become a pivotal platform with widespread applications, especially in finance. Cross-border payments have emerged as a key area of interest, with blockchain offering inherent benefits such as enhanced security, transparency, and efficiency compared to traditional banking systems. This paper presents a novel framework leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts to emulate cross-border payments, ensuring interoperability and compliance with international standards such as ISO20022. Key contributions of this paper include a novel prototype framework for implementing smart contracts and web clients for streamlined transactions and a mechanism to translate ISO20022 standard messages. Our framework can provide a practical solution for secure, efficient, and transparent cross-border transactions, contributing to the ongoing evolution of global finance and the emerging landscape of decentralized finance.</description>

      <title>CIDER: Counterfactual-Invariant Diffusion-based GNN Explainer for Causal Subgraph Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferring causal links or subgraphs corresponding to a specific phenotype or label based solely on measured data is an important yet challenging task, which is also different from inferring causal nodes. While Graph Neural Network (GNN) Explainers have shown potential in subgraph identification, existing methods with GNN often offer associative rather than causal insights. This lack of transparency and explainability hinders our understanding of their results and also underlying mechanisms. To address this issue, we propose a novel method of causal link/subgraph inference, called CIDER: Counterfactual-Invariant Diffusion-based GNN ExplaineR, by implementing both counterfactual and diffusion implementations. In other words, it is a model-agnostic and task-agnostic framework for generating causal explanations based on a counterfactual-invariant and diffusion process, which provides not only causal subgraphs due to counterfactual implementation but reliable causal links due to the diffusion process. Specifically, CIDER is first formulated as an inference task that generatively provides the two distributions of one causal subgraph and another spurious subgraph. Then, to enhance the reliability, we further model the CIDER framework as a diffusion process. Thus, using the causal subgraph distribution, we can explicitly quantify the contribution of each subgraph to a phenotype/label in a counterfactual manner, representing each subgraph's causal strength. From a causality perspective, CIDER is an interventional causal method, different from traditional association studies or observational causal approaches, and can also reduce the effects of unobserved confounders. We evaluate CIDER on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which all demonstrate the superiority of CIDER over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Application of Computer Technology in Financial Investment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to understand the application of computer technology in financial investment, the author proposes a research on the application of computer technology in financial investment. The author used user transaction data from a certain online payment platform as a sample, with a total of 284908 sample records, including 593 positive samples (fraud samples) and 285214 negative samples (normal samples), to conduct an empirical study on user fraud detection based on data mining. In this process, facing the problem of imbalanced positive and negative samples, the author proposes to use the Under Sampling method to construct sub samples, and then perform feature scaling, outlier detection, feature screening and other processing on the sub samples. Then, four classification models, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor algorithm, decision tree, and support vector machine, are trained on the processed sub samples. The prediction results of the four models are evaluated, and the results show that the recall rate, Fl score, and AUC value of the logistic regression model are the highest, indicating that the detection method based on computer data mining is practical and feasible.</description>

      <title>Billiards Sports Analytics: Datasets and Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, it becomes a common practice to capture some data of sports games with devices such as GPS sensors and cameras and then use the data to perform various analyses on sports games, including tactics discovery, similar game retrieval, performance study, etc. While this practice has been conducted to many sports such as basketball and soccer, it remains largely unexplored on the billiards sports, which is mainly due to the lack of publicly available datasets. Motivated by this, we collect a dataset of billiards sports, which includes the layouts (i.e., locations) of billiards balls after performing break shots, called break shot layouts, the traces of the balls as a result of strikes (in the form of trajectories), and detailed statistics and performance indicators. We then study and develop techniques for three tasks on the collected dataset, including (1) prediction and (2) generation on the layouts data, and (3) similar billiards layout retrieval on the layouts data, which can serve different users such as coaches, players and fans. We conduct extensive experiments on the collected dataset and the results show that our methods perform effectively and efficiently.</description>

      <title>Advancement of metal oxide nanomaterials on agri-food fronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of metal oxide nanomaterials (MOx NMs) in the agrifood industry offers innovative solutions that can facilitate a paradigm shift in a sector that is currently facing challenges in meeting the growing requirements for food production, while safeguarding the environment from the impacts of current agriculture practices. This review comprehensively illustrates recent advancements and applications of MOx for sustainable practices in the food and agricultural industries and environmental preservation. Relevant published data point out that MOx NMs can be tailored for specific properties, enabling advanced design concepts with improved features for various applications in the agrifood industry. Applications include nano-agrochemical formulation, control of food quality through nanosensors, and smart food packaging. Furthermore, recent research suggests MOx's vital role in addressing environmental challenges by removing toxic elements from contaminated soil and water. This mitigates the environmental effects of widespread agrichemical use and creates a more favorable environment for plant growth. The review also discusses potential barriers, particularly regarding MOx toxicity and risk evaluation. Fundamental concerns about possible adverse effects on human health and the environment must be addressed to establish an appropriate regulatory framework for nano metal oxide-based food and agricultural products.</description>

      <title>A novel Taguchi-based approach for optimizing neural network architectures: application to elastic short fiber composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an innovative application of the Taguchi design of experiment method to optimize the structure of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for the prediction of elastic properties of short fiber reinforced composites. The main goal is to minimize the required computational effort for hyperparameter optimization while enhancing the prediction accuracy. Utilizing a robust design of experiment framework, the structure of an ANN model is optimized. This essentially is the identification of a combination of hyperparameters that yields an optimal predictive accuracy with the fewest algorithmic runs, thereby achieving a significant reduction of the required computational effort. Our findings demonstrate that the Taguchi method not only streamlines the hyperparameter tuning process but also could substantially improve the algorithm's performance. These results underscore the potential of the Taguchi method as a powerful tool for optimizing machine learning algorithms, particularly in scenarios where computational resources are limited. The implications of this study are far-reaching, offering insights for future research in the optimization of different algorithms for improved accuracies and computational efficiencies.</description>

      <title>Aero-Nef: Neural Fields for Rapid Aircraft Aerodynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a methodology to learn surrogate models of steady state fluid dynamics simulations on meshed domains, based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). The proposed models can be applied directly to unstructured domains for different flow conditions, handle non-parametric 3D geometric variations, and generalize to unseen shapes at test time. The coordinate-based formulation naturally leads to robustness with respect to discretization, allowing an excellent trade-off between computational cost (memory footprint and training time) and accuracy. The method is demonstrated on two industrially relevant applications: a RANS dataset of the two-dimensional compressible flow over a transonic airfoil and a dataset of the surface pressure distribution over 3D wings, including shape, inflow condition, and control surface deflection variations. On the considered test cases, our approach achieves a more than three times lower test error and significantly improves generalization error on unseen geometries compared to state-of-the-art Graph Neural Network architectures. Remarkably, the method can perform inference five order of magnitude faster than the high fidelity solver on the RANS transonic airfoil dataset.

      <title>Sponsored is the New Organic: Implications of Sponsored Results on Quality of Search Results in the Amazon Marketplace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interleaving sponsored results (advertisements) amongst organic results on search engine result pages (SERP) has become a common practice across multiple digital platforms. Advertisements have catered to consumer satisfaction and fostered competition in digital public spaces; making them an appealing gateway for businesses to reach their consumers. However, especially in the context of digital marketplaces, due to the competitive nature of the sponsored results with the organic ones, multiple unwanted repercussions have surfaced affecting different stakeholders. From the consumers' perspective the sponsored ads/results may cause degradation of search quality and nudge consumers to potentially irrelevant and costlier products. The sponsored ads may also affect the level playing field of the competition in the marketplaces among sellers. To understand and unravel these potential concerns, we analyse the Amazon digital marketplace in four different countries by simulating 4,800 search operations. Our analyses over SERPs consisting 2M organic and 638K sponsored results show items with poor organic ranks (beyond 100th position) appear as sponsored results even before the top organic results on the first page of Amazon SERP. Moreover, we also observe that in majority of the cases, these top sponsored results are costlier and are of poorer quality than the top organic results. We believe these observations can motivate researchers for further deliberation to bring in more transparency and guard rails in the advertising practices followed in digital marketplaces.</description>

      <title>WindsorML -- High-Fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics Dataset For Automotive Aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new open-source high-fidelity dataset for Machine Learning (ML) containing 355 geometric variants of the Windsor body, to help the development and testing of ML surrogate models for external automotive aerodynamics. Each Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation was run with a GPU-native high-fidelity Wall-Modeled Large-Eddy Simulations (WMLES) using a Cartesian immersed-boundary method using more than 280M cells to ensure the greatest possible accuracy. The dataset contains geometry variants that exhibits a wide range of flow characteristics that are representative of those observed on road-cars. The dataset itself contains the 3D time-averaged volume &amp; boundary data as well as the geometry and force &amp; moment coefficients. This paper discusses the validation of the underlying CFD methods as well as contents and structure of the dataset. To the authors knowledge, this represents the first, large-scale high-fidelity CFD dataset for the Windsor body with a permissive open-source license (CC-BY-SA).</description>

      <title>Planning For Edge Failure in Fixed-Charge Flow Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fixed-Charge Network Flow problem is a well-studied NP-hard problem that has the goal of finding a flow in a network where fixed edge costs are incurred, regardless of the amount of flow hosted by the edge. In this paper, we consider scenarios where a designated edge in the network has the potential to fail after edges have already been purchased. If the edge does fail, procurement of additional edges may be required to repair the flow and compensate for the failed edge so as to maintain the original flow amount. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that aims to minimize the costs of both the initial flow as well as the repaired flow. We introduce an algorithm that finds the Pareto front between these two objectives, thereby providing decision makers with a sequence of solutions that trade off initial flow cost with repaired flow cost. We demonstrate the algorithm's efficacy with an evaluation using real-world CO2 capture and storage infrastructure data.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm on Integrated High-Performance Computing and Quantum Computing Systems for Large-Scale Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum approximated optimization algorithm (QAOA) has shown promise for solving combinatorial optimization problems by providing quantum speedup on near-term gate-based quantum computing systems. However, QAOA faces challenges in optimizing variational parameters for high-dimensional problems due to the large number of qubits required and the complexity of deep circuits, which limit its scalability for real-world applications. In this study, we propose a distributed QAOA (DQAOA), which leverages a high-performance computing-quantum computing (HPC-QC) integrated system. DQAOA leverages distributed computing strategies to decompose a large job into smaller tasks, which are then processed on the HPC-QC system. The global solution is iteratively updated by aggregating sub-solutions obtained from DQAOA, allowing convergence toward the optimal solution. We demonstrate that DQAOA can handle considerably large-scale optimization problems (e.g., 1,000-bit problem) achieving high accuracy (~99%) and short time-to-solution (~276 s). To apply this algorithm to material science, we further develop an active learning algorithm integrated with our DQAOA (AL-DQAOA), which involves machine learning, DQAOA, and active data production in an iterative loop. We successfully optimize photonic structures using AL-DQAOA, indicating that solving real-world optimization problems using gate-based quantum computing is feasible with our strategies. We expect the proposed DQAOA to be applicable to a wide range of optimization problems and AL-DQAOA to find broader applications in material design.</description>
