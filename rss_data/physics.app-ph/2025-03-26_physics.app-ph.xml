      <title>Suppressing DC Drift in Thin-Film Lithium Niobate Modulators via Multiferroic Skyrmion Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) modulators, despite their superior electro-optic performance, face critical DC drift challenges under low-frequency or prolonged operation. In this work, we demonstrate a novel suppression strategy by exciting multiferroic skyrmions in TFLN, achieving drift-free square-wave modulation for voer 1 hour-the first solution eliminating feedback systems. This breakthrough originates from dual carrier suppression mechanisms:(1) charge density reduction via skyrmion-induced polarization nano-regions (PNRs) excitation, and (2) mean free path restriction through polarization gradients at PNRs domain walls.By directly targeting the root cause of DC drift-mobile charge redistribution-our method uniquely preserves the essential SiO2 upper cladding, resolving the longstanding trade-off between drift mitigation and waveguide protection.Crucially, our work also provides the first experimental observation of interconversion between short-term drift (seconds-scale transient overshoot) and long-term drift (hours-scale baseline shift), offering critical insights into their unified origin.</description>

      <title>A multi-axis Nanopositioner based on Near-Field Acoustic Levitation and Electromagnetic Actuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positioners based on near-field acoustic levitation (NFAL) offer high positioning resolution and bandwidth, primarily along the Z axis, because of the large acoustic Z-stiffness and squeeze film damping. However, their XY-positioning resolution and bandwidth are several orders of magnitude lower because of the limited acoustic stiffness and damping in these directions. In this paper, we increase the XY-stiffness and damping by using a steady-current-based planar electromagnetic trap and eddy current damping technique, respectively. Specifically, NFAL is used to levitate a magnetic platform, which is then electromagnetically trapped in the XY-plane. Eddy currents generated by a thin copper plate beneath the levitating platform increase in-plane damping by a factor of 52, thereby reducing vibrations inherent in the NFAL technique. Additionally, the planar coil used for electromagnetic trapping provides multi-axis positioning capabilities. We demonstrate 3-axis linear motion with a root mean square (rms) positioning resolution of better than 20 nm along all axes. The in-plane motion range and bandwidth achieved are 1.42 mm and 16 Hz, respectively, while a motion range of 40 micrometers with a positioning bandwidth of 171 Hz is achieved along the Z-axis.</description>

      <title>Silicon-Integrated Next-Generation Plasmonic Devices for Energy-Efficient Semiconductor Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon-based integrated photonics has demonstrated significant advances in miniaturization and performance, yet critical challenges remain in achieving efficient on-chip communication at high bandwidths. Plasmonic devices on silicon and silicon-on-insulator substrates offer a promising solution, enabling subwavelength light confinement and enhanced light-matter interactions through hybrid modes. However, integrating traditional plasmonic materials like gold and silver into silicon-based platforms presents significant challenges, particularly due to their incompatibility with standard silicon processing techniques and their increased optical losses at longer wavelengths, which can hinder performance in near-infrared applications. Plasmonic devices, leveraging advances in device architectures, have the potential to close these performance gaps and enable the next generation of high-speed, on-chip data communication. This review explores recent progress in silicon-integrated hybrid-mode plasmonic devices, highlighting the potential of transparent conductive oxides like indium tin oxide for low-loss and tunable operation. Key device topologies including coupled hybrid plasmonic waveguides and dielectric-based heterostructures are examined, along with fabrication techniques and practical considerations. By critically comparing various plasmonic approaches and identifying their respective advantages and limitations, a path toward realizing the full potential of plasmonics in shaping the future of high-performance, silicon-based integrated photonics is charted.</description>

      <title>Observation of giant remnant polarization in ultrathin AlScN at cryogenic temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of wurtzite ferroelectrics opens new frontiers in polar materials, yet their behavior at cryogenic temperatures remains unexplored. Here, we reveal unprecedented ferroelectric properties in ultrathin (10 nm) Al$_{0.68}$Sc$_{0.32}$N (AlScN) at cryogenic temperatures where the properties are fundamentally distinct from those of conventional oxide ferroelectrics. At 12 K, we demonstrate a giant remnant polarization exceeding 250 $\mu$C/cm$^2$ -- more than twice that of any known ferroelectric -- driven by an enhanced c/a ratio in the wurtzite structure. Our devices sustain remarkably high electric fields (~13 MV/cm) while maintaining reliable switching, achieving over 104 polarization reversal cycles at 12 K. Critically, this breakdown field strength approaches that of passive dielectric materials while maintaining ferroelectric functionality. The extraordinary polarization enhancement and high-field stability at cryogenic temperatures contrasts sharply with oxide ferroelectrics, establishing wurtzite ferroelectrics as a distinct class of polar materials with implications spanning fundamental physics to cryogenic non-volatile memory and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>ZodiAq: An Isotropic Flagella-Inspired Soft Underwater Drone for Safe Marine Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inherent challenges of robotic underwater exploration, such as hydrodynamic effects, the complexity of dynamic coupling, and the necessity for sensitive interaction with marine life, call for the adoption of soft robotic approaches in marine exploration. To address this, we present a novel prototype, ZodiAq, a soft underwater drone inspired by prokaryotic bacterial flagella. ZodiAq's unique dodecahedral structure, equipped with 12 flagella-like arms, ensures design redundancy and compliance, ideal for navigating complex underwater terrains. The prototype features a central unit based on a Raspberry Pi, connected to a sensory system for inertial, depth, and vision detection, and an acoustic modem for communication. Combined with the implemented control law, it renders ZodiAq an intelligent system. This paper details the design and fabrication process of ZodiAq, highlighting design choices and prototype capabilities. Based on the strain-based modeling of Cosserat rods, we have developed a digital twin of the prototype within a simulation toolbox to ease analysis and control. To optimize its operation in dynamic aquatic conditions, a simplified model-based controller has been developed and implemented, facilitating intelligent and adaptive movement in the hydrodynamic environment. Extensive experimental demonstrations highlight the drone's potential, showcasing its design redundancy, embodied intelligence, crawling gait, and practical applications in diverse underwater settings. This research contributes significantly to the field of underwater soft robotics, offering a promising new avenue for safe, efficient, and environmentally conscious underwater exploration.</description>

      <title>Defects and Impurity Properties of VN precipitates in ARAFM Steels: Modelling using a Universal Machine Learning Potential and Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: VN precipitates used to strengthen ARAFM steels for fusion applications, have been shown to undergo dissolution under high Fe ion irradiation doses of 100 dpa at dose rates of 10^-3 dpa/s at 600 C. Here, point defects and solute substitutions have been studied using atom probe tomography (APT), universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs), and density functional theory. Through a combination of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), APT, and atomic scale calculations, N-vacancies and substitutional Cr are found to be present in VN precipitates prior to irradiation. Ternary convex hulls were calculated for ten VNX (X=Cr, Fe, C, Si, Mn, W, Ta, B, S, P) systems with an uMLIP. These calculations predict Fe, P, Mn, and Si to be unstable solutes in the VN precipitate. Therefore, Fe, P, Mn and Si implantation via collision cascades is found to be a possible mechanism driving dissolution of VN.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic back-switching phenomenon in SOT-MRAM devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19840v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The writing process of SOT-MRAMs is considered deterministic when additional symmetry-breaking factors, such as the application of an external magnetic field aligned with the current, are present. Notably, the write probability exhibits a unique behavior as a function of the current: it drops to zero at high currents or even oscillates with the current. This phenomenon is attributed to back-switching, an intrinsic effect of magnetization reversal driven by spin-orbit torques. A systematic investigation of this back-switching phenomenon is conducted on sub-100 nm CoFeB magnetic pillars positioned at the center of $\beta$-W Hall crosses. Using a statistical approach, the study examines the impact of various parameters, including the amplitude of current pulses and the application of magnetic fields in different directions. The findings reveal that the back-switching phenomenon is not statistically random. Macrospin simulations, employing realistic magnetic parameter values, accurately replicate the experimental observations and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of back-switching. These simulations also explore strategies to mitigate the phenomenon, such as optimizing the shape of the writing pulses. Applying this approach to complete SOT-MRAM single cells achieves a write error rate below $2 \times 10^{-6}$, demonstrating the effectiveness of this strategy in expanding the operational current range for write operations in SOT-MRAMs.</description>

      <title>Programmable on-chip nonlinear photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear photonics uses coherent interactions between optical waves to engineer functionality that is not possible with purely linear optics. Traditionally, the function of a nonlinear-optical device is determined during design and fixed during fabrication. In this paper, we present a photonic device with highly programmable nonlinear functionality: an optical slab waveguide with an arbitrarily reconfigurable two-dimensional distribution of $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinearity. The nonlinearity is realized using electric-field-induced $\chi^{(2)}$ in a $\chi^{(3)}$ material. The programmability is engineered by massively parallel control of the electric-field distribution within the device using a photoconductive layer and optical programming with a spatial light pattern. To showcase the versatility of our device, we demonstrated spectral, spatial, and spatio-spectral engineering of second-harmonic generation by tailoring arbitrary quasi-phase-matching (QPM) grating structures in two dimensions. Second-harmonic light was generated with programmable spectra, enabled by real-time in situ inverse design of QPM gratings. Flexible spatial control was also achieved, including the generation of complex waveforms such as Airy beams and the simultaneous engineering of spectral and spatial features. This allowed us to create distinct spatial light profiles across multiple wavelengths. The programmability also allowed us to demonstrate in situ, real-time compensation of fluctuations in pump laser wavelength. Our work shows that we can transcend the conventional one-device--one-function paradigm, expanding the potential applications of nonlinear optics in situations where fast device reconfigurability is not merely practically convenient but essential -- such as in programmable optical quantum gates and quantum light sources, all-optical signal processing, optical computation, and structured light for sensing.</description>

      <title>Barium Titanate and Lithium Niobate Permittivity and Pockels Coefficients from MHz to Sub-THz Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Pockels effect is essential for controlling optical signals at the highest speeds, particularly for electro-optic modulators in photonic integrated circuits. Lithium niobate (LN) and barium titanate (BTO) are two excellent Pockels materials to this end. Here, we measure the Pockels coefficients and permittivity in LN and BTO over a continuous frequency range from 100 MHz to 330 GHz. These properties are constant across this frequency range in LN but have a significant frequency dependence in BTO. Still, our measurements show that BTO has remarkably large electro-optic properties compared to LN. Furthermore, we show how BTO devices can be designed with a flat electro-optic frequency response despite the Pockels coefficient dispersion. Finally, we expound our method for broadband characterization of these vital electro-optic properties, utilizing specialized integrated electro-optic phase shifters. Altogether, this work empowers the design of high-speed BTO devices and the development of new electro-optic materials.</description>
