      <title>The Stochastic Guitar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic physics is a central pillar of modern research in many fields, but is rarely presented to undergrad students in a hands-on experiment. Here, we demonstrate how a human-scale, simple, and affordable experimental setup can be used to fill this gap, and to illustrate many advanced concepts in a step-by-step approach. Based on a metal wire (such as a guitar string), our setup facilitates the observation of fluctuating dynamics in the time domain, the frequency spectrum, and in the rotating phase space. The latter allows introducing time-dependent cross-correlations between the sine and cosine quadratures of the stochastic motion, which feature deterministic order even in the absence of any deterministic forces.</description>

      <title>Thermal noise squeezing and amplification in parametrically driven resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we propose several methods with increasing precision for analytically estimating white noise squeezing in the frequency domain of classical parametrically-driven resonators with added noise. The analytical model is based on obtaining the response of the resonator to the added noise using Green's function. The response consists of three parts: elastic, down, and up parametric conversions. We obtain the Green's function approximately using the first-order averaging method or exactly, in principle, using Floquet theory. We characterize the noise squeezing by calculating the statistical properties of the real and imaginary parts of the Fourier transform of the resonator response to added noise. Furthermore, we observe that the squeezing effects occur only at half the parametric pump frequency. Due to correlation, the squeezing limit of $-6$~dB can be reached even with detuning around resonance near the instability threshold. Additionally, we validate some of our theoretical predictions of squeezing with the results obtained from the numerical integration of the stochastic differential equations of our model. We also applied our techniques to investigate squeezing in a pair of coupled parametric and harmonic resonators with a single noise input. The results obtained from Floquet theory can be applied generally to coupled</description>
