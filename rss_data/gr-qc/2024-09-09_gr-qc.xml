      <title>Spin-induced Scalar Clouds around Kerr-Newman Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that a scalar field non-minimally coupled to the electromagnetic field can experience a spin-induced tachyonic instability near Kerr-Newman black holes, potentially driving the formation of scalar clouds. In this paper, we construct such scalar clouds for both fundamental and excited modes, detailing their existence domains and wave functions. Our results indicate that a sufficiently strong coupling between the scalar and electromagnetic fields is essential for sustaining scalar clouds. Within the strong coupling regime, black holes that rotate either too slowly or too rapidly are unable to support scalar clouds. Furthermore, we observe that scalar cloud wave functions are concentrated near the black hole's poles. These findings provide a foundation for future investigations of spin-induced scalarized Kerr-Newman black holes.</description>

      <title>Charged dilatonic black holes in dilaton-massive gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on massive Einstein-dilaton gravity including the coupling of dilaton scalar field to massive graviton terms, and then derive static and spherically symmetric solutions of charged dilatonic black holes in four dimensional spacetime. We find that the dilatonic black hole could possess different horizon structures for some suitably parameters. Then, we also investigate the thermodynamic properties of charged dilatonic black holes where $f(r)$ approaches $+\infty$ and $-\infty$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Physical properties and the maximum compactness bound of a class of compact stars in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the physical behaviour of a stellar configuration by developing a compact stellar model within the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity. We study the mass-radius ($M-R$) relationship and obtain the maximum compactness bound of the resultant stellar configuration by assuming the modification to be linear in non-metricity $Q$, i.e. $f(Q) = \alpha\ Q + \beta$. The maximum compactness bound proposed in $f(Q)$ gravity is analogous to the Buchdahl bound in general relativity. We note that the compactness bound increases in $f(Q)$ gravity. In the general relativistic limit ($\alpha=-1$), our approach regains the Buchdahl bound for an incompressible star. Our observation might be relevant in the context of a recent observation with the MeerKAT observatory, which indicates the existence of high mass non-black hole compact objects which cannot be modelled by using the conventional neutron star equation of state (EoS).</description>

      <title>Higher-derivative corrections to the Kerr quasinormal mode spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide the most complete analysis so far of quasinormal modes of rotating black holes in a general higher-derivative extension of Einstein's theory. By finding the corrections to the Teukolsky equation and expressing them in a simple form, we are able to apply a generalized continued fraction method that allows us to find the quasinormal mode frequencies including overtones. We obtain the leading-order corrections to the Kerr quasinormal mode frequencies of all the $(l,m,n)$ modes with $l=2,3,4$, $-l\le m\le l$ and $n=0,1,2$, and express them as a function of the black hole spin $\chi$ using polynomial fits. We estimate that our results remain accurate up to spins between $\chi\sim 0.7$ and $\chi\sim 0.95$, depending on the mode. We report that overtones are overall more sensitive to corrections, which is expected from recent literature on this topic. We also discuss the limit of validity of the linear corrections to the quasinormal mode frequencies by estimating the size of nonlinear effects in the higher-derivative couplings. All our results are publicly available in an online repository.</description>

      <title>The renormalized stress-energy tensor for scalar fields in the Boulware state with applications to extremal black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a mode-sum prescription to directly compute the renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) for scalar fields in the Boulware vacuum. The method generalizes the recently developed extended coordinate method which was previously only applicable to Hartle-Hawking states. We exhibit the accuracy and efficiency of the method by calculating the RSET in sub-extremal and extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetimes. We find numerical evidence for the regularity of the RSET at the extremal horizon regardless of the field mass and its coupling. We employ our numerical results of the RSET to source the semi-classical Einstein equations, demonstrating that if the RSET is considered as a static perturbation, it will either de-extremalize the black hole, or convert it into a horizonless object.</description>

      <title>GLoW: novel methods for wave-optics phenomena in gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave-optics phenomena in gravitational lensing occur when the signal's wavelength is commensurate to the gravitational radius of the lens. Although potentially detectable in lensed gravitational waves, fast radio bursts and pulsars, accurate numerical predictions are challenging to compute. Here we present novel methods for wave-optics lensing that allow the treatment of general lenses. In addition to a general algorithm, specialized methods optimize symmetric lenses (arbitrary number of images) and generic lenses in the single-image regime. We also develop approximations for simple lenses (point-like and singular isothermal sphere) that drastically outperform known solutions without compromising accuracy. These algorithms are implemented in Gravitational Lensing of Waves (GLoW): an accurate, flexible, and fast code. GLoW efficiently computes the frequency-dependent amplification factor for generic lens models and arbitrary impact parameters in O(1 ms) to O(10 ms) depending on the lens configuration and complexity. GLoW is readily applicable to model lensing diffraction on gravitational-wave signals, offering new means to investigate the distribution of dark-matter and large-scale structure with signals from ground and space detectors.</description>

      <title>Gravitational baryogenesis in energy-momentum squared gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of gravitational baryogenesis within the context of a specific modified theory of gravity, namely, energy-momentum squared gravity or $f(R, T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})$ gravity. In this framework, the gravitational Lagrangian is formulated as a general function of the Ricci scalar $R$ and the self-contraction of the energy-momentum tensor, $\mathcal{T}^2 \equiv T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu}$. This approach extends the conventional paradigm of gravitational baryogenesis by introducing new dependencies that allow for a more comprehensive exploration of the baryon asymmetry problem. Our analysis aims to elucidate the role of these gravitational modifications in the generation of baryon asymmetry, a critical issue in cosmology that remains unresolved within the Standard Model of particle physics. By incorporating $\mathcal{T}^2$ into the gravitational action, we propose that these modifications can significantly influence the dynamics of the early universe, thereby altering the conditions under which baryogenesis occurs. This study not only provides a novel depiction of gravitational baryogenesis but also offers insights into how modified gravity theories can address the longstanding question of baryon asymmetry. The implications of our findings suggest that $f(R, T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})$ gravity could play a crucial role in understanding the fundamental processes that led to the matter-antimatter imbalance observed in the universe today.</description>

      <title>Paraxial wave equation of light bundles: Gaussian beams and caustic avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infinitesimal light bundles on curved spacetimes can be studied via a Hamiltonian formalism, similar to the Newtonian paraxial rays. In this work, we assign a classical wave function to a thin null bundle and study its evolution equation. This is achieved via the usage of the Schr\"odinger operators within a procedure analogous to the one in the semi-classical regime of quantum mechanics. The correspondence between the metaplectic operators and the symplectic phase space transformations of the geodesic deviation variables is at the core of our method. It allows for the introduction of unitary operators. We provide two solutions of the null bundle wave function which differ by their origin: (i) a point source, and (ii) a finite source. It is shown that while the former wave function includes the same information as the standard thin null bundle framework, the latter is a Gaussian beam. The Gaussianity of the intensity profile of our beam depends on the spacetime curvature and not on the random processes. We show that this beam avoids the caustics of an instantaneous wavefront. Our results are applicable for any spacetime and they can be used to model light propagation from coherent sources while averting the mathematical singularities of the standard thin null bundle formalism. This is especially relevant when estimating cosmological distances in a realistic inhomogeneous universe.</description>

      <title>Leptodermic corrections to the TOV equations and nuclear astrophysics within the effective surface approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The macroscopic model for a neutron star (NS) as a liquid drop at the equilibrium is used to extend the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations taking into account
  the gradient terms responsible for the system surface. The parameters of the Schwarzschild metric in the spherical case are found with these surface corrections in the
  leading (zero) order of the leptodermic approximation $a/R&lt;&lt;1$, where $a$ is the NS effective-surface (ES) thickness, and $R$ is the effective NS radius. The energy
  density $\mathcal{E}$ is considered in a general form including the functions of the particle number density and of its gradient terms. The macroscopic gravitational
  potential $\Phi(\rho)$ is taken into account in the simplest form as expansion in powers of $\rho-\overline{\rho} $, where $\overline{\rho}$ is the saturation density,
  up to second order, in terms of its contributions to th separation particle energy and incompressibility. Density distributions $\rho$ across the NS ES in the normal
  direction to the ES, which are derived in the simple analytical form at the same leading approximation, was used for the derivation of the modified TOV (MTOV) equations
  by accounting for their NS surface corrections. The MTOV equations are analytically solved at first order and the results are compared with the standard TOV approach of
  the zero order.</description>

      <title>Neutron stars in the bumblebee theory of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, theoretical studies on the bumblebee gravity model, a nonminimally-coupled vector-tensor theory that violates the Lorentz symmetry, have flourished, with a simultaneous increase in the utilization of observations to impose constraints. The static spherical solutions of neutron stars (NSs) in the bumblebee theory are calculated comprehensively in this work. These solutions with different coupling constants reveal a rich theoretical landscape for NSs, including vectorized NSs and NSs with finite radii but divergent masses. With these solutions, preliminary constraints on the asymptotic vector field values are obtained through restrictions on the stellar radius.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze lensing of photons and neutrinos in a gravitational field, proposing a method to include radiative effects in classical lens equations. The study uses Schwarzschild and a Reissner-Nordstrom metrics expanded at second post Newtonian order in the Newtonian potential, employing a semiclassical approach to compare one-loop corrections from the Standard Model with Einstein's deflection formula via an impact parameter representation. We also explore the energy dependence of deflection due to quantum corrections and integrate these with classical lens equations.</description>

      <title>Lorentz violation with an invariant minimum speed as foundation of the uncertainty principle in Minkowski, dS and AdS spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research aims to provide the geometrical foundation of the uncertainty principle within a new causal structure of spacetime so-called Symmetrical Special Relativity (SSR), where there emerges a Lorentz violation due to the presence of an invariant minimum speed $V$ related to the vacuum energy. SSR predicts that a dS-scenario occurs only for a certain regime of speeds $v$, where $v&lt;v_0=\sqrt{cV}$, which represents the negative gravitational potentials ($\Phi&lt;0$) connected to the cosmological parameter $\Lambda&gt;0$. For $v=v_0$, Minkowski (pseudo-Euclidian) space is recovered for representing the flat space ($\Lambda=0$), and for $v&gt;v_0$ ($\Phi&gt;0$), Anti-de Sitter (AdS) scenario prevails ($\Lambda&lt;0$). The fact that the current universe is flat as its average density of matter distribution ($\rho_m$ given for a slightly negative curvature $R$) coincides with its vacuum energy density ($\rho_{\Lambda}$ given for a slightly positive curvature $\Lambda$), i.e., the {\it cosmic coincidence problem}, is now addressed by SSR. SSR provides its energy-momentum tensor of perfect fluid, leading to the EOS of vacuum ($p=-\rho_{\Lambda}$). Einstein equation for vacuum given by such SSR approach allows us to obtain $\rho_{\Lambda}$ associated with a scalar curvature $\Lambda$, whereas the solution of Einstein equation only in the presence of a homogeneous distribution of matter $\rho_m$ for the whole universe presents a scalar curvature $R$, in such a way that the presence of the background field $\Lambda$ opposes the Riemannian curvature $R$, thus leading to a current effective curvature $R_{eff}=R+\Lambda\approx 0$ according to observations.</description>

      <title>Neutral particle collisions near Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger black holes after shadow observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GMGHS) black hole with a magnetic charge (or an electric charge) has noteworthy features that its scalar curvature near the event horizon of the black hole with the almost maximal charge can be extremely large. The large curvature, which is related with the gravity on a finite-sized object or between two points, causes high center-of-mass energy for two neutral particles near the almost maximally charged GMGHS black hole. Recently, the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration gave the bound on the charge of black holes from the shadow and mass observations of black holes under an assumption that the diameter of observed rings are proportion to that of photon spheres. The photon sphere would be less related with the curvature, since it is determined by the behavior of one photon or one ray neither two photons nor two rays. Thus, the high-energy neutral particle collision and the black hole shadow observations would be complementary to distinguish the GMGHS black hole from other black hole solutions. In this paper, we investigate a new way to compare the center-of-mass energy for neutral particle collisions in the GMGHS spacetime and other black hole spacetimes. From the shadow observations and the mass observations under the assumptions on the effect of black hole charges, we can put constraints on the center-of-mass energy of the particles. We apply our method to shadow and mass observations of M87* and Sagittarius~A*. We find that the center-of-mass energy of neutral particles near the GMGHS black holes cannot be extremely large under the observational constraints, and conclude that the GMGHS spacetimes are hardly distinguishable from the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m spacetimes by the particle collisions if we apply the shadow and mass observations at $1 \sigma$ probability.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic topology of Black Holes in $F(R)$-Euler-Heisenberg gravity's Rainbow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topology of black hole thermodynamics is a fascinating area of study that explores the connections between thermodynamic properties and topological features of black holes. This paper has led to several significant findings: We successfully derive the field equations for $F(R)$-Euler-Heisenberg theory, providing a framework for studying the interplay between modified gravity and non-linear electromagnetic effects. We obtain an analytical solution for a static, spherically symmetric, energy-dependent black hole with constant scalar curvature. Also, our analysis of black holes in F(R)-Euler-Heisenberg gravity's Rainbow reveals significant insights into their topological properties. We identified the total topological charges by examining the normalized field lines along various free parameters. Our findings indicate that the parameters $( R_0 )$ and $( f_{\epsilon} = g_{\epsilon} )$ influence the topological charges. These results are comprehensively summarized in Table I. Additionally, a general overview of Tables II, III, and IV related to the photon sphere of the mentioned black hole reveals that with an increase in $f_{\varepsilon}$, the permissible range of negative $\lambda$ in the first case gradually transitions into a non-permissible region in the third case. On the other hand, it is known that the QED parameter, which measures the strength of nonlinear effects, can be either positive or negative. A positive QED parameter reduces the electric field near the horizon and increases the black hole's mass, whereas a negative QED parameter increases the electric field and decreases the mass. According to the two statements above, it can be concluded that the increase in $f_{\varepsilon}$ actually decreases the strength of the electric field near the horizon and strengthens the effects of gravity.</description>

      <title>Landauer principle in cosmology as the link to information theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a deep connection between cosmology in thermodynamic description of apparent horizon and information theory. In particular, we show how the Landauer principle gets satisfied during the entire cosmic evolution of the universe starting from inflation to the late dark energy era. This in turn reveals why the matter fields are not in thermal equilibrium with the apparent horizon during most of the cosmic era of the universe, except for the fluids with $\omega = -1/3$ leading to the transitions of the universe from an accelerating to a decelerating era and vice-versa.</description>

      <title>The spin correlation of fermion pairs created by a Kerr black hole gravitationalpotential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of massive fermions created and scattered by a rotating Kerr black hole. The helicities of the scattered fermions can vary during propagation. A fermion with a right-handed helicity can become either right or left-handed after interacting with the gravitational potential. This implies that measuring characteristics of an escaping particle is insufficient to reconstruct all the characteristics of its infalling partner. This further means the helicities of a particle pair created by the gravitational potential are not fully entangled. Since spin and helicity share many common features, it is likely that the same is true for spins of spontaneously created particles.</description>

      <title>Wheeler-DeWitt equation and the late gravitational collapse: effects of factor ordering and the tunneling scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We set up the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation for late gravitational collapse. The fact that the gravitational collapse and the expanding/ collapsing universe can be described within the realm of the Robertson-Walker metric renders the corresponding WDW equation for collapsing matter a timeless Schr\"odinger equation. We explore the consequences of such an equation and find the density to be quantized in terms of the Planck density. Apart from that, the wave function as a solution of the WDW equation shows that the initial singularity is avoided. We concentrate on different factor orderings in the kinetic term of the equation and show how after splitting off an exponential ansatz, new polynomials entering the solution can be constructed. This enables us to conclude that the factor ordering changes the details of the solution and interpretation, but overall on a qualitative level the results remain the same. We also probe into the effects of a positive cosmological constant. It offers the possibility of a tunneling scenario at the cosmological horizon.</description>

      <title>Synergies in analysing binary black hole mergers: Effect of orbital eccentricity, spin-precession, and non-quadrupole modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A gravitational wave (GW) signal carries imprints of the properties of its source. The ability to extract source properties crucially depends on our prior knowledge of the signal morphology. Even though binary black hole (BBH) mergers are the cleanest system to model in general relativity, currently, there are no waveform models which include all physical effects. This thesis focuses on three subdominant effects: orbital eccentricity, spin-precession, and non-quadrupole or higher-order modes (HMs). We study the interplay of these effects on data analysis of GW signals, highlighting the shortcomings and emphasizing the need for more advanced waveforms. For instance, we investigate whether orbital eccentricity and spin-precession can mimic each other and thus caution the GW community towards the biases that may arise due to the neglect of eccentricity and/or spins in the waveform models. Using waveforms with full spin-precession and HMs, we extend the existing spin-induced quadrupole moment (SIQM) test - a null test to distinguish BBH systems from other black hole mimickers - and show that these improved waveforms give significantly better bounds. Additionally, we quantify the parameter space where the effect of HMs is most significant and show the importance of detecting these modes in GW events for future ground-based GW detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope.</description>

      <title>Polarized Image of a Synchrotron-emitting Ring in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates polarized images of an equatorial synchrotron-emitting ring surrounding hairy black holes within the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory. Our analysis demonstrates qualitative similarities between the polarization patterns of hairy black holes and Schwarzschild black holes. However, due to the non-minimal coupling between the scalar and electromagnetic fields, an increase in black hole charge and coupling constant can substantially amplify polarization intensity and induce deviations in the electric vector position angle. These effects may offer observational signatures to distinguish hairy black holes from Schwarzschild black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate primordial magnetogenesis within a quantum bouncing model driven by a scalar field, focusing on various non-minimal couplings between the electromagnetic field and the scalar field. We test three cases: no coupling, a Cauchy coupling with gradual decay, and a Gaussian coupling with rapid fall-off. By exploring these scenarios, we assess a wide range of coupling strengths across different scales. The scalar field, with an exponential potential, behaves as pressureless matter in the asymptotic past of the contracting phase, as stiff matter around the bounce, and as dark energy during the expanding phase. Our findings reveal that, among the tested cases, only the Gaussian coupling can explain the generation of primordial magnetic fields on cosmological scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revise the cosmological interaction between dark energy and dark matter. More precisely, we focus on models that support compartmentalization or co-existence in the dark sector of the universe. Within the framework of a homogeneous and isotropic, spatially flat Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker geometry, we analyse the asymptotic behaviour of the physical parameters for two interacting models, where dark energy and dark matter have constant equations of state parameters, in the presence of dark radiation, when dark energy is described by a quintessence scalar field. For each model, we determine the asymptotic solutions and attempt to understand how the interaction affects the cosmological evolution and history.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing and shadows from thin-disks in Loop Quantum Gravity self-dual black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze gravitational lensing and their cast images from thin-disks in shadow observations of a family of spherically symmetric black hole solutions previously derived within the framework of Loop Quantum Gravity. Such black holes depend on two parameters (besides the mass of the black hole itself), $P$ and $a_0$, the latter imbuing the configurations with an interior wormhole structure. Using the bounds from the Event Horizon Telescope regarding the shadow's radius of Sgr A$^*$ that constrain the parameter $P \lesssim 0.08(2\sigma)$ (at $a_0=0$), we study the modifications to weak and strong gravitational lensing induced by these geometries as compared to the Schwarzschild black hole within this range. In particular, we discuss several observables in the strong field regime related to the luminosity decay, the angular separation, and the flux ratio between multiples images of the source. Furthermore, we consider the cast images of these black holes when illuminated by a geometrically and optically thin accretion disk according to several semi-analytic profiles for the disk's emission.</description>

      <title>Trace Anomaly in Metric-Affine gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the trace (Weyl) anomaly within a general metric-affine geometry that includes both torsion and nonmetricity. Using the Heat Kernel method and Seeley's algorithm, we compute the Minakshisundaram coefficients for arbitrary spacetimes within this framework, incorporating the effects of the nonmetricity and torsion tensors for the first time. We then determine the corrections to the trace anomaly at one loop for the matter sector in theories invariant under conformal transformation, frame rescaling transformation, and projective transformation. We identify a new anomaly related to hypermomentum, arising from the dilation part mediated by the Weyl component of nonmetricity. As particular cases, we analyze the spin $0$ and spin $1/2$ cases, considering various couplings between matter and the gravitational sector. We demonstrate that invariance under the frame rescaling transformation results in an anomaly in the relationship between the hypermomentum and the stress-energy tensor. In contrast, under the projective transformation, no anomaly is present; specifically, there is no non-zero trace of the hypermomentum tensor in any of our concrete examples.</description>

      <title>Geometrical origin for the compaction function for primordial black hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a geometrical origin for the Shibata-Sasaki compaction function, which is known to be a reliable indicator of primordial black hole (PBH) formation, at least during radiation domination. We identify it with a compactness function in the static spacetime obtained by removing the cosmological scale factor from the metric in the long-wavelength limit. Furthermore, we discover that it reaches its maximum value of 1/2 at extremal surfaces on the constant-time spacelike hypersurface, which simultaneously are bifurcating trapping horizons and admit circular photon orbits in the static spacetime. Thus, the Shibata-Sasaki compaction function measures how close the positively curved region is to a type II configuration, with extremal surfaces where the value reaches 1/2.</description>

Moreover we show that the result remains true for the entire range of $|a_0|/m_0$ for which stability can be established.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the properties of relativistic stars made of isotropic matter within the framework of the minimal Standard Model Extension, where a bumblebee field coupled to spacetime induces spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking. We adopt analytic equations-of-state describing either condensate dark stars or strange quark stars. We solve the structure equations numerically, and we compute the mass-to-radius relationships. The influence of the bumblebee parameter $l$ is examined in detail, and an upper bound is obtained using the massive pulsar PSR J0740+6620 and the strangely light HESS J1731-347 compact object.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Gravitational Radiation Reaction: Failed Tail, Memories &amp; Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Schwinger-Keldysh "in-in" effective field theory (EFT) framework, we complete the knowledge of nonlinear gravitational radiation-reaction effects in the (relative) dynamics of binary systems at fifth Post-Newtonian (5PN) order. Diffeomorphism invariance plays a key role guaranteeing that the Ward identities are obeyed (in background-field gauge). Nonlocal-in-time (memory) effects appear in the soft-frequency limit as boundary terms in the effective action, consistently with the loss of (canonical) angular momentum. We identify a conservative sector through Feynman's $i0^+$-prescription. Notably, terms at second order in the (linear) radiation-reaction force also produce conservative-like effects (as we likewise demonstrate in electromagnetism). For the sake of comparison, we derive the ${\cal O}(G^4)$ contribution to the total (even-in-velocity) 5PN relative scattering angle. We find perfect agreement in the overlap with the state of the art in the Post-Minkowskian expansion, both in the conservative and dissipative sectors, resolving the (apparent) discrepancy with previous EFT results. We will return to the full conservative part of the 5PN dynamics elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Prospects for searching for sterile neutrinos with gravitational wave and $\gamma$-ray burst joint observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos can influence the evolution of the universe, and thus cosmological observations can be used to detect them. Future gravitational wave (GW) observations can precisely measure absolute cosmological distances, helping to break parameter degeneracies generated by traditional cosmological observations. This advancement can lead to much tighter constraints on sterile neutrino parameters. This work provides a preliminary forecast for detecting sterile neutrinos using third-generation GW detectors in combination with future short $\gamma$-ray burst observations from a THESEUS-like telescope, an approach not previously explored in the literature. Both massless and massive sterile neutrinos are considered within the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We find that using GW data can greatly enhance the detection capability for massless sterile neutrinos, reaching 3$\sigma$ level. For massive sterile neutrinos, GW data can also greatly assist in improving the parameter constraints, but it seems that effective detection is still not feasible.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes in the Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If primordial black holes (PBHs) of asteroidal mass ($M_{\rm PBH}\in[10^{17},10^{23}]$ g) make up the entire dark matter they could be detectable through their gravitational influence in the solar system. In this work we study the perturbations that PBHs induce on the orbits of planets. Detailed numerical simulations of the solar system, embedded in a halo of primordial black holes are performed. We show that the perturbations are too small to be directly detectable with current data, challenging recent results that have ruled out PBHs as a dark matter candidate. Using the Earth-Mars system as an observational probe, we estimate that an improvement in the measurement accuracy by more than an order of magnitude is required to detect the gravitational influence of PBHs in the solar system in the foreseeable future.</description>

      <title>Fractons on curved spacetime in $2+1$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study dipole Chern-Simons theory with and without a cosmological constant in $2+1$ dimensions. We write the theory in a second order formulation and show that this leads to a fracton gauge theory coupled to Aristotelian geometry which can also be coupled to matter. This coupling exhibits the remarkable property of generalizing dipole gauge invariance to curved spacetimes, without placing any limitations on the possible geometries. We also use the second order formulation to construct a higher dimensional generalization of the action. Finally, for the $(2+1)$-dimensional Chern-Simons theory we find solutions and interpret these as electric monopoles, analyze their charges and argue that the asymptotic symmetries are infinite-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Constraining the nuclear equation of state from orbits of primordial black holes inside neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lacking terrestrial experimental data, our best constraints on the behavior of matter at high densities up to and above nuclear density arise from observations of neutron stars. Current constraints include those based on measurements of stellar masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities. Here we explore how orbits of primordial black holes - should they exist - inside neutron stars could provide complementary constraints on the nuclear equation of state (EOS). Specifically, we consider a sample of candidate EOSs, construct neutron star models for these EOSs, and compute orbits of primordial black holes inside these stars. We discuss how the pericenter advance of eccentric orbits, i.e. orbital precession, results in beat phenomena in the emitted gravitational wave signal. Observing this beat frequency could constrain the nuclear EOS and break possible degeneracies arising from other constraints, as well as provide information about the host star.</description>

      <title>Probing the Holographic Universe: Aspects of Entanglement Entropy Modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy is crucial for understanding the link between quantum mechanics and information theory. This thesis investigates how energy fluctuations and acceleration affect entanglement entropy through three key scenarios. First, we analyze entanglement between disjoint Rindler observers in de Sitter spacetime. We introduce 1-loop corrections to the partition function of the conformal field theory, disrupting the previously flat entanglement spectrum and resulting in an area law for entanglement entropy, while preserving the finiteness of the Hilbert space. Next, we extend the holographic entanglement entropy framework to field theories with global $U(1)$ symmetry, considering non-linearly charged theories and their thermal and quantum fluctuations. We find that the dual theory experiences spontaneous symmetry breaking and a reduction in the leading-order coefficient of the $\langle TT\rangle$ correlator due to quantum corrections. Using conformal electrodynamics coupled with three-dimensional gravity as an example, we explore a black hole solution and its connection to two-dimensional free bosons. Finally, we investigate three-dimensional accelerating black holes, revealing that increased acceleration reduces the accessible boundary region and, consequently, the entanglement entropy. This suggests a loss of information in the dual theory due to acceleration.</description>

      <title>The Dispersion Relation of Massive Photons in Plasma: A Comment on "Bounding the Photon Mass with Ultrawide Bandwidth Pulsar Timing Data and Dedispersed Pulses of Fast Radio Bursts"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dispersion measures of fast radio bursts have been identified as a powerful tool for testing the zero-mass hypothesis of the photon. The classical approach treats the massive photon-induced and plasma-induced time delays as two separate phenomena. Recently, Wang et al. (2024) suggested that the joint influence of the nonzero photon mass and plasma effects should be considered, and proposed a revised time delay for massive photons propagating in a plasma medium, denoted as $\Delta t'_{m_{\gamma}} \propto \nu^{-4}$, which departures from the classical dispersion relation ($\propto \nu^{-2}$). Here we discuss the derivation presented by Wang et al. (2024) and show that the classical dispersion relation remains valid based on Proca equations.</description>

      <title>Scalaron dark matter and the thermal history of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In metric $f(R)$ gravity minimally coupled to the Standard Model, the scalaron could act as dark matter if its mass falls within the range $4.4~\text{meV} \lesssim m \lesssim 1.2~\text{MeV}$. The dynamics of the scalaron in the universe is influenced by the trace of the stress-energy tensor. In our previous studies, we focused on the classical contribution to this trace generated by the Higgs field. At the onset of the electroweak crossover, its evolution is nonadiabatic with respect to the scalaron mass, and the scalaron experiences a perturbation that can trigger its oscillations. However, the trace of the stress-energy tensor also includes a time-dependent component due to the QCD trace anomaly. In this paper, we revisit the cosmological scenario for scalaron evolution by incorporating the trace anomaly at high temperatures. We show that, while this anomaly produces a shift in the equilibrium value of the scalaron, the evolution of this shift remains adiabatic with respect to the rapid oscillations of the scalaron. Consequently, possible cosmological scenarios for the scalaron evolution are qualitatively unaffected by this correction.</description>

      <title>Extended Generalized Uncertainty Principles, Liouville theorem and density of states: Snyder-De Sitter and Yang models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modifications in quantum mechanical phase space lead to changes in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, these can result in the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) or the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP), which introduce quantum gravitational effects at small and large distances, respectively. A combination of GUP and EUP, the Extended Generalized Uncertainty Principle (EGUP or GEUP), further generalizes these modifications by incorporating noncommutativity in both coordinates and momenta. This paper examines the impact of EGUP on the Liouville theorem in statistical physics and density of states within non-relativistic quantum mechanics framework. We find a weighted invariant phase space volume element in the cases of Snyder-de Sitter and Yang models, presenting how EGUP alters the density of states, potentially affecting physical (thermodynamical) properties.</description>

      <title>A novel standard candle: collapsing axion stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubble constant, $H_0$, is a crucial parameter in cosmology. However, various cosmic observations have produced differing posterior values for $H_0$, resulting in what is referred to as the $H_0$ tension. To resolve this discrepancy, utilizing other cosmological probes to constrain $H_0$ is advantageous. In the quest to identify dark matter candidates, the QCD axion and axionlike particles, collectively referred to as axions, have become leading contenders. These elusive particles can coalesce into dense structures known as axion stars via Bose-Einstein condensation. When these axion stars exceed a critical mass, typically through accretion or merging, they experience a self-induced collapse. This process results in short radio bursts, assuming a decay constant $f_a\lesssim10^{13}{\rm{GeV}}$, with the frequency depending on the axion mass and the luminosity determined by both the axion mass and decay constant. Therefore, we propose that collapsing axion stars could serve as a novel standard candle to constrain $H_0$. Even more interesting is that the radio bursts emitted by collapsing axion stars with specific parameters match the characteristics of observed non-repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs). Thus, FRBs generated by collapsing axion stars have the potential to be used as standard candles to constrain $H_0$.</description>

      <title>Complex structure on quantum-braided planes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a quantum Dolbeault double complex $\oplus_{p,q}\Omega^{p,q}$ on the quantum plane $\Bbb C_q^2$. This solves the long-standing problem that the standard differential calculus on the quantum plane is not a $*$-calculus, by embedding it as the holomorphic part of a $*$-calculus. We show in general that any Nichols-Woronowicz algebra or braided plane $B_+(V)$, where $V$ is an object in an abelian $\Bbb C$-linear braided bar category of real type is a quantum complex space in this sense with a factorisable Dolbeault double complex. We combine the Chern construction on $\Omega^{1,0}$ in such a Dolbeault complex for an algebra $A$ with its conjugate to construct a canonical metric compatible connection on $\Omega^1$ associated to a class of quantum metrics, and apply this to the quantum plane. We also apply this to finite groups $G$ with Cayley graph generators split into two halves related by inversion, constructing such a Dolbeault complex $\Omega(G)$ in this case, recovering the quantum Levi-Civita connection for any edge-symmetric metric on the integer lattice with $\Omega(\Bbb Z)$ now viewed as a quantum complex structure. We also show how to build natural quantum metrics on $\Omega^{1,0}$ and $\Omega^{0,1}$ separately where the inner product in the case of the quantum plane, in order to descend to $\otimes_A$, is taken with values in an $A$-bimodule.</description>

      <title>Brick Wall in AdS-Schwarzschild Black Hole: Normal Modes and Emerging Thermality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the normal modes of a probe scalar field in a five-dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black hole with the brick wall boundary condition near the horizon. We employ various techniques to compute the spectrum and analyze its properties. Our results reveal a linear dependence of the spectrum on the principal quantum number while demonstrating a non-trivial dependence on the angular momentum quantum number. We compute the Spectral Form Factor (SFF) and find a dip-ramp-plateau structure, with the slope of the ramp approaching unity as the brick wall nears the horizon. We also observe that as the brick wall approaches the horizon, the poles of the retarded Green's function condense on the real line, leading to an emergent thermal behavior in the boundary theory. This work extends previous studies on lower-dimensional black holes to higher dimensions, providing insights into the connection between black hole microstate models and boundary chaos. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussions on the information paradox and the nature of black hole interiors in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Curvature Corrections in Double Field Theory via Double Copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in the classical Double Copy (DC) procedure have revealed a profound connection between gauge theories and T-duality invariant frameworks, with Double Field Theory (the classical DC of Yang-Mills theory) emerging as the first explicit example. Extending this procedure to higher-derivative gauge theories predicts the existence of a Higher-Derivative Double Theory (HDDT), which incorporates Weyl gravity along with $b$-field and dilaton contributions, all in a T-duality invariant manner. In this work, we show that combining both mappings leads to DFT$+$, a T-duality invariant model related to the bosonic string, incorporating first-order $\alpha'$ corrections upon parameterization. Our results expand the potential applications of the DC program towards constructing perturbative $\alpha'$-corrected Lagrangians, while also opening up possibilities for reversing the map by considering the single and zeroth copies.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the auxiliary field deformations of the principal chiral model (PCM) introduced in arXiv:2405.05899 and arXiv:2407.16338 to sigma models whose target manifolds are symmetric or semi-symmetric spaces, including a Wess-Zumino term in the latter case. This gives rise to a new infinite family of classically integrable $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ coset models of the form which are of interest in applications of integrability to worldsheet string theory and holography. We demonstrate that every theory in this infinite class admits a zero-curvature representation for its equations of motion by exhibiting a Lax connection.</description>

      <title>Occurrence of gravitational collapse in the accreting neutron stars of binary-driven hypernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The binary-driven hypernova (BdHN) model proposes long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate in binaries composed of a carbon-oxygen (CO) star and a neutron star (NS) companion. The CO core collapse generates a newborn NS and a supernova that triggers the GRB by accreting onto the NSs, rapidly transferring mass and angular momentum to them. We perform three-dimensional, smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics simulations of BdHNe using up-to-date NS nuclear equations of state (EOS), with and without hyperons, and calculate the structure evolution in full general relativity. We assess the binary parameters leading either NS to the critical mass for gravitational collapse into a black hole (BH) and its occurrence time, $t_\textrm{col}$. We include a non-zero angular momentum of the NSs and find that $t_\textrm{col}$ ranges from a few tens of seconds to hours for decreasing NS initial angular momentum values. BdHNe I are the most compact (about five minutes orbital period), promptly form a BH and release $\gtrsim 10^{52}$ erg. They form NS-BH binaries with tens of kyr merger timescale by gravitational-wave emission. BdHNe II and III do not form BHs, release $\sim 10^{50}$-$10^{52}$ erg and $\lesssim 10^{50}$ erg. They form NS-NS with a wider range of merger timescales. In some compact BdHNe II, either NS can become supramassive, i.e., above the critical mass of a non-rotating NS. Magnetic braking by a $10^{13}$ G field can delay BH formation, leading to BH-BH or NS-BH of tens of kyr merger timescale.</description>

      <title>Mixmasters in Wonderland: Chaotic dynamics from Carroll limits of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Carroll limit of general relativity coupled to matter captures the chaotic mixmaster dynamics of near-singularity limits. Zooming in on the behavior of general relativity close to spacelike singularities reveals rich and solvable ultra-local Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz (BKL) dynamics, which we show to be captured by a Carroll limit. Specifically, building on recent work on geometric Carroll expansions of general relativity, we establish that leading-order Carroll gravity, with suitable matter coupling, accurately describes well-known cosmological billiards behavior. Since the Carroll limit implements the ultra-local limit off shell, this opens up the door to a wide range of possible tractable applications, including spatially inhomogeneous setups and the emergence of spikes at late times. This further suggests that Carroll gravity, along with its subleading corrections, could serve as a valuable tool for studying deep infrared physics in AdS/CFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure the speed of light with current observations, such as Type Ia Supernova, galaxy ages, radial BAO mode, as well as simulations of future redshift surveys and gravitational waves as standard sirens. By means of a Gaussian Process reconstruction, we find that the precision of such measurements can be improved from roughly 6\% to 1.5-2\%, in light of these forthcoming observations. This result demonstrates that we will be able to perform a cosmological measurement of a fundamental physical constant with unprecedented precision, which will help us underpinning if its value is truly consistent with local measurements, as predicted by the standard model of Cosmology.</description>

      <title>A Bottom-Up Approach to Black Hole Microstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:2312.14108, we argued that a sliver at the black hole mass in the Hilbert space of a quantum field theory on an AdS black hole with a stretched horizon, has many desirable features of black hole microstates. A key observation is that the stretched horizon requires a finite Planck length, i.e., finite-$N$. Therefore it is best viewed as a ``quantum horizon" -- a proxy for the UV-complete bulk description, and not directly an element in the bulk EFT. It was shown in arXiv:2312.14108 that despite the manifest absence of the interior, the 2-point function in the sliver is indistinguishable from the smooth horizon correlator, up to the Page time. In this paper, instead of boundary correlators, we work directly in the bulk, and demonstrate the appearance of the bulk Hartle-Hawking correlator in the large-$N$ limit. This is instructive because it shows that the analytic continuation across the horizon is emergent. It is a $bulk$ transition to a Type III algebra and provides a structural distinction between black holes and weakly coupled thermal systems. We also identify a mechanism for universal code subspaces and interior tensor factors to appear via a quantum horizon version of thermal factorization. Our claims apply directly only within a ``Page window", so they are not in immediate tension with firewall arguments. During a Page window, typical heavy microstates probed by light single trace operators respond with effectively smooth horizons in low-point correlators. We work in 2+1 dimensions to be concrete, but expect our results to hold in all higher dimensions. We discuss some important differences between our approach and the conventional fuzzball program, and also argue that probe-notions (like infalling boundary conditions) must be distinguished from microstate-notions (like size of the Einstein-Rosen bridge) to make meaningful statements about post-Page smoothness.</description>

Abstract: Unlike a single Carroll particle, a multiparticle Carroll system can move under suitable conditions, as we demonstrate it explicitly for two particles with a momentum-dependent interaction: the center-of-mass remains fixed, however relative motion is possible, confirming previous statements made by Bergshoeff, Casalbuoni, and their collaborators. Analogous results are obtained for electric dipoles with the roles of the center-of-mass and the relative position interchanged.</description>

      <title>Analytic solutions for the motion of spinning particles near spherically symmetric black holes and exotic compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00021v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapidly rotating bodies moving in curved space-time experience the so-called spin-curvature force, which becomes important for the motion of compact objects in gravitational-wave inspirals. As a first approximation, this effect is captured in the motion of a spinning test particle. We solve the equations motion of a spinning particle to leading order in spin in arbitrary static and spherically symmetric space-times in terms of one-dimensional closed-form integrals. This solves the problem and proves its integrability in a wide range of modified gravities and near exotic compact objects. Then, by specializing to the case of bound orbits in Schwarzschild space-time, we demonstrate how to express the solution in the form of Jacobi elliptic functions.</description>

      <title>Charging Kerr-Schild spacetimes in higher dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study higher dimensional charged Kerr-Schild (KS) spacetimes that can be constructed by a KS transformation of a vacuum solution with an arbitrary cosmological constant, and for which the vector potential is aligned with the KS vector $\mathbf{k}$. Focusing on the case of an expanding $\mathbf{k}$, we first characterize the presence of shear as an obstruction to non-null fields (thereby extending an early no-go result of Myers and Perry). We next obtain the complete family of shearfree solutions. In the twistfree case, they coincide with charged Schwarzschild-Tangherlini-like black holes. Solutions with a twisting $\mathbf{k}$ consist of a four-parameter family of higher dimensional charged Taub-NUT metrics with a base space of constant holomorphic sectional curvature. In passing, we identify the configurations for which the test-field limit gives rise to instances of the KS double copy. Finally, it is shown that null fields define a branch of twistfree but shearing solutions, exemplified by the product of a Vaidya-like radiating spacetime with an extra dimension.</description>

      <title>Efficient representations of upper limits and confidence intervals for experimental data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upper limits and confidence intervals are a convenient way to present experimental results. With modern experiments producing more and more data, it is often necessary to reduce the volume of the results for convenient distribution. A common approach is to take a maximum over a set of upper limits, which yields an upper limit valid for the entire set. This, however, can result in significant sensitivity loss, because we discard more constraining data. In this paper we introduce functional upper limits and confidence intervals that allow to summarize results with small relaxation of constraints. A toy example and an application to upper limits in all-sky continuous gravitational wave searches are worked out.</description>

Abstract: We explicitly construct the analogue of the \v{d}Alembert solution to the 1+1 wave equation in an hyperboloidal setting. This hyperboloidal \v{d}Alembert solution is used, in turn, to gain intuition into the behaviour of solutions to the wave equation in a hyperboloidal foliation and to explain some apparently anomalous behaviour observed in numerically constructed solutions discussed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Exploring Stability of f(Q,B) gravity via Dynamical System Approach: a Comprehensive Bayesian Statistical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10956v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our work investigates the cosmological stability of $f(Q, B)$ gravity by employing a dynamical system approach, where $Q$ is the nonmetricity scalar that plays the role of gravity, and $B$ is the boundary term. In the phase space, the model parameters of $f(Q, B)$ are determined using a Bayesian statistical analysis via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, incorporating numerical solutions and observational data from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), the extended Pantheon+ dataset, and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements. We identified a stable critical point within the dynamical system of the model, corresponding to the de Sitter phase. This observation is consistent with current data, indicating a Universe dominated by dark energy (DE) and undergoing late-time accelerated expansion. Furthermore, we explore the cosmological implications of $f(Q, B)$ gravity, which suggest both deceleration and Equation of State (EoS) parameters show a smooth transition from deceleration to an accelerating expansion phase in the evolution of the Universe. Finally, we claimed the $f(Q, B)$ model is compared with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, demonstrating its potential as a viable alternative cosmological framework.</description>

      <title>New look at AdS black holes with conformal scalar hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18048v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit static, spherically symmetric solutions to AdS-Einstein gravity with a conformally coupled scalar field (and no self-interaction potential) in four dimensions. We first observe that a convenient choice of coordinates leads to a significant simplification of the field equations, which enables one to identify various roots of the indicial equations and thus distinct branches of solutions. Next, we construct an explicit 2-parameter hairy black hole solution in terms of an infinite power series around the event horizon. The black hole is non-extremal with a regular scalar field on and outside the event horizon, and it reduces to the Schwarzschild-AdS metric in the limit of vanishing hair. Its properties are illustrated for various values of the parameters and compared with previous numerical results by other authors. In addition, the analysis reveals the presence of a photon sphere and how the scalar field affects its size and the angular radius of the corresponding shadow. The thermodynamics of the solution is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Photon Counting Interferometry to Detect Geontropic Space-Time Fluctuations with GQuEST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The GQuEST (Gravity from the Quantum Entanglement of Space-Time) experiment uses tabletop-scale Michelson laser interferometers to probe for fluctuations in space-time. We present a practicable interferometer design featuring a novel photon counting readout method that provides unprecedented sensitivity, as it is not subject to the interferometric standard quantum limit. We evaluate the potential of this design to measure space-time fluctuations motivated by recent `geontropic' quantum gravity models. The accelerated accrual of Fisher information offered by the photon counting readout enables GQuEST to detect the predicted quantum gravity phenomena within measurement times at least 100 times shorter than equivalent conventional interferometers. The GQuEST design thus enables a fast and sensitive search for signatures of quantum gravity in a laboratory-scale experiment.</description>

      <title>Probing Massive Fields with Multi-Band Gravitational-Wave Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the prospect of probing massive fields and testing gravitational theories with multiband observations of gravitational waves emitted from coalescing compact binaries. Focusing on the dipole radiation induced by a massive field, we show that multiband observations can probe the field with mass ranging from $10^{-16} $ to $10^{-15} {\rm eV}$, a parameter space that cannot be probed by the millihertz band observations alone. Multiband observations can also improve the constraints obtained with the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA binaries by at most 3 orders of magnitude in the mass range. Moreover, we show that multiband observations can discriminate the spin of the field, which cannot be identified with single-band observations.</description>

      <title>Black Holes and Wormholes Beyond Classical General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the paper, only Static Spherically Symmetric space-times in four dimensions are considered within modified gravity models. The non-singular static metrics, including black holes not admitting a de Sitter core in the center and traversable wormholes, are reconsidered within a class of higher-order $F(R)$, satisfying the constraints $F(0)=\frac{dF}{dR}(0)=0$. Furthermore, by making use of the so-called effective field theory formulation of gravity, the quantum corrections to Einstein-Hilbert's action due to higher-derivative terms related to curvature invariants are investigated. In particular, in the case of Einstein-Hilbert action plus cubic curvature Goroff-Sagnotti contribution, the second-order correction in the Goroff-Sagnotti coupling constant is computed. In general, it is shown that the effective metrics, namely Schwarzschild expression plus small quantum corrections, are related to black holes and not to traversable wormholes. In this framework, within the approximation considered, the resolution of singularity for $r=0$ is not accomplished. The related properties of these solutions are investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate scalar perturbation over a Frolov black hole (BH), which is a regular BH induced by the quantum gravity effect. The quasinormal frequencies of a scalar field always consistently reside in the lower half-plane, and the time-domain evolution of the field demonstrates a decaying behavior, with the late-time tail exhibiting a power-law pattern. These observations collectively suggest the stability of a Frolov BH against scalar perturbation. Additionally, our study reveals that the quantum gravity effect leads to slower decay modes. For the case of the angular quantum number $l=0$, the oscillation exhibits non-monotonic behavior with the quantum gravity parameter $\alpha_0$. However, once $l\geq 1$, the angular quantum number surpasses the influence of the quantum gravity effect.</description>

      <title>Enhancing noise characterization with robust time delay interferometry combination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11305v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time delay interferometry (TDI) is essential for suppressing laser frequency noise and achieving the targeted sensitivity for space-borne gravitational wave (GW) missions. In Paper I, we examined the performance of the fiducial second-generation TDI Michelson configuration versus an alternative, the hybrid Relay, in noise suppression and data analysis. The results showed that both TDI schemes have comparable performances in mitigating laser and clock noises. However, when analyzing chirp signal from the coalescence of massive binary black holes, the Michelson configuration becomes inferior due to its vulnerable T channel and numerous null frequencies. In contrast, the hybrid Relay is more robust in dynamic unequal-arm scenarios. In this work, we further investigate the noise characterization capabilities of these two TDI configurations. Our investigations demonstrate that hybrid Relay achieves more robust noise parameter inference than the Michelson configuration. Moreover, the performance can be enhanced by replacing the T channel of hybrid Relay with a second-generation TDI null stream $C^{12}_3$. The combined three data streams, including two science observables from the hybrid Relay and $C^{12}_3$, could reduce the instabilities of noise spectra in the targeting frequency band and form an optimal dataset for characterizing noises.</description>

      <title>Quasi-normal mode frequencies and gravitational perturbations of black holes with any subextremal spin in modified gravity through METRICS: the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational waves emitted in the ringdown phase of binary black-hole coalescence are a unique probe of strong gravity. Understanding how deviations from general relativity affect the ringdown phase of black holes, however, is extremely challenging, as it requires solving highly-coupled and sometimes higher-order partial differential equations. We here extend a novel approach, \textit{Metric pErTuRbations wIth speCtral methodS} (METRICS), to study the metric perturbations and the quasinormal mode frequencies of ringing black holes in modified gravity. We first derive the asymptotic behavior of metric perturbations at the event horizon and spatial infinity for rotating black holes beyond general relativity. We then extend the eigenvalue-perturbation theory approach of METRICS to allow us to compute the leading-order modified gravity corrections to the quasinormal-mode frequencies and metric perturbations. We apply METRICS to rotating black holes in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Without decoupling or simplifying the linearized field equations in this theory, we compute the leading-order corrections to the quasinormal frequencies of the axial and polar perturbations of the $nlm = 022$, 021 and 033 modes of black holes of $a \leq 0.85$. The numerical accuracy of the METRICS frequencies is $\leq 10^{-5}$ for $a \leq 0.6$, $\lesssim 10^{-4}$ for $0.6 &lt; a \leq 0.7 $, and $\lesssim 10^{-2}$ for $0.7 &lt; a \leq 0.85 $ for all modes studied. We fit the frequencies as a polynomial in spin, whose coefficients (up to second order in spin) are consistent with those obtained in previous slow-rotating approximations. These results are the first accurate computations of the gravitational quasinormal-mode frequencies of rapidly rotating black holes (of $a \sim 0.85$) in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A uniformly accelerated atom captures Pancharatnam-Berry phase in its quantum state and the phase factor depends on the vacuum fluctuation of the background quantum fields. We observe that the thermal nature of the fields further affects the induced phase. Interestingly the induced phase captures the exchange symmetry between the Unruh and real thermal baths. This observation further supports the claim that the Unruh thermal bath mimics a real thermal bath. Moreover for certain values of system parameters and at high temperature, the phase is enhanced compared to zero temperature situation. However the required temperature to observe the phase experimentally is so high that the detection of Unruh effect through this is not possible within the current technology.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and greybody factor of Schwarzschild Black Hole in the Cold Dark Matter Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we firstly studied wave function in static spherically symmetric spacetime and obtained effective potential of perturbed fields with spin. Then we applied $6^{\rm{th}}$ order WKB approximation to analyze quasinormal modes of Schwarzschild black hole in the Cold Dark Matter halo in perturbed fields with different spins and derived quasinormal frequencies. Further, to study the relation between quasinormal frequencies and optics, we compare the results of WKB method with eikonal limit formula. At last, we discussed greybody factor in different perturbed fields under this spacetime.</description>

      <title>Tidal Love numbers and Green's functions in black hole spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal interactions play a crucial role in deciphering gravitational wave signals emitted by the coalescence of binary systems. They are usually quantified by a set of complex coefficients which include tidal Love numbers, describing the conservative response to an external perturbation. In the static case, these are found to vanish exactly for asymptotically flat black holes in general relativity in four spacetime dimensions, and recently they have been generalized to dynamical interactions. In the context of response theory, the retarded Green's function provides the complete description of the behavior of dynamical systems. In this work we investigate the relation between Love numbers and Green's functions, and highlight the relevance of radiation reaction effects to their connection. As a special case, we discuss Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black holes, where the absence of radiative modes allows us to make a direct link between them.</description>

The dependence of temperaure, Gibbs free energy, specific heat on the horizon radius have been studied for various values of critical density (\r{ho}c ) of the cold dark matter.

      <title>The impact of higher derivative corrections to General Relativity on black hole mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The merging of two black holes is a notoriously difficult process to describe exactly. Nevertheless, the hindrances posed by gravity's nonlinearity can be circumvented by focusing on the strict extreme mass ratio limit, in which one of the black holes is infinitely larger than the other. Such an approach has been developed by Emparan and Mart\'inez and applied within General Relativity to investigate the time evolution of event horizons melding, using nothing but elementary concepts in gravitational physics and simple integrations of geodesics. We apply this strategy to study black hole mergers in higher derivative gravity, in order to assess how the defining characteristics of the fusion process change as the gravitational theory is modified. We adopt the case of Einsteinian cubic gravity for concreteness, and determine how the mergers' duration and the relative area increment change as the theory's single coupling parameter is varied.</description>

      <title>Constraining viscous-fluid models in $f(Q)$ gravity using cosmic measurements and large-scale structure data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the effects of bulk viscosity on the accelerating expansion and large-scale structure formation of a universe in which the underlying gravitational interaction is described by $f(Q)$ gravity. Various toy models of the $f(Q)$ gravity theory, including power-law ($f_{1\rm{CDM}}$), exponential ($f_{2\rm{CDM}}$), and logarithmic ($f_{3\rm{CDM}}$) are considered. To test the cosmological viability of these models, we use 57 Hubble parameter data points (OHD), 1048 supernovae distance modulus (SNIa), their combined analysis (OHD+SNIa), 14 growth rate ($f$-data), and 30 redshift-space distortions ($f\sigma_8$) datasets. We compute the best-fit values $\Omega_m, H_0$ and exponents $\{n, p, \gamma\}$ including the bulk viscosity coefficient $\zeta_0$, through a detailed statistical analysis. Moreover, we study linear cosmological perturbations and compute the density contrast \(\delta(z)\), growth factor $D(z)$, growth rate $(f(z)$, and redshift-space distortion $f\sigma_8(z)$. Based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian / Schwartz Information Criterion (BIC), a statistical comparison of the $f(Q)$ gravity models with \lcdm is made. From our statistical analysis of cosmic measurements, we found an underestimation of all models on the OHD data; therefore, statistical viability led us to weigh it in favour of SNIa data which resulted in the exponential ($f_{2\rm{CDM}}$) model without bulk viscosity being the most plausible alternative model, while on average the $f_{1\rm{CDM}}$ model performed statistically the weakest. We also found that adding bulk viscosity did not improve the fit of the models to all observational data.</description>

      <title>New one-parameter models of dynamical particles in spatially flat FLRW space-times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New one-parameter models of non-rotating dynamical particles are derived as isotropic solutions of Einstein's equations with perfect fluid in space-times with FLRW asymptotic behaviour generalizing thus the models proposed recently in [I. I. Cot\u aescu, Eur. Phys. J. C (2022) 82:86]. These particles are produced by central singularities of the fluid density but without changing the pressure of the asymptotic FLRW space-times. The principal features of these models are investigated using a brief graphical analysis for pointing out the role of the new free parameter. The conclusion is that this gives rise to families of models which behave as non-rotating black holes in the physical space domain bordered by the black hole and cosmological horizons.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the observational signatures of traversable Simpson-Visser wormholes illuminated by luminous celestial spheres and orbiting hot spots. We demonstrate that when light sources and observers are on the same side of the wormholes, the images of the wormholes mimic those of black holes. However, when the light sources are positioned on the opposite side from observers, photons traversing the wormhole throat generate distinct observational signatures. Specifically, unlike black hole images, the wormhole images are confined within the critical curve, resulting in smaller centroid variations. Furthermore, the light curve of hot spots can exhibit additional peaks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We survey elementary features of Lovelock gravity and its maximally symmetric vacuum solutions. The latter is solely determined by the real roots of a dimension-dependent polynomial. We also recover the static spherically symmetric (black hole) solutions of Lovelock gravity using Palais' symmetric criticality principle. We show how to linearize the generic field equations of Lovelock models about a given maximally symmetric vacuum, which turns out to factorize into the product of yet another dimension-dependent polynomial and the linearized Einstein tensor about the relevant background. We also describe how to compute conserved charges using linearized field equations along with the relevant background Killing isometries. We further describe and discuss the special vacua which are defined by the simultaneous vanishing of the aforementioned polynomials.</description>

      <title>Bound states of massive complex ghosts in superrenormalizable quantum gravity theories\</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the remarkable differences between renormalizable quantum gravity with four-derivative action and its superrenormalizable polynomial generalizations is that the latter admit a more sophisticated particle mass spectrum. Already in the simplest superrenormalizable case, the theory has a six-derivative Lagrangian, admitting either a real or complex spectrum of masses. In the case of a real spectrum, there are the graviton, massive unphysical ghosts, and normal particles with masses exceeding the ones of the ghosts. It is also possible to have pairs of complex conjugate massive ghost-like particles. We show that in both cases, these theories do not admit a K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation and do not satisfy the positivity criterium of consistency in terms of the fields associated to those particles. In the main part of the work, using a relatively simple Euclidean scalar toy model, we show that the theory with complex spectrum forms bound states confining unphysical massive excitations into a normal composite particle. Finally, we discuss the cosmological implications of such a ghost confinement.</description>

      <title>Observational features of deformed Schwarzschild black holes illuminated by an anisotropic accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The projection effect of an anisotropic accretion disk causes its electromagnetic radiation to depend on the emission angle. Although this dependency has the potential to influence the observational characteristics of black holes, it has not received sufficient attention. In this paper, we employ a relativistic ray-tracing algorithm to numerically simulate 86 GHz and 230 GHz images of deformed Schwarzschild black holes illuminated by an equatorial anisotropic accretion disk, aiming to reveal the observational signatures of the target black hole and the impact of the projection effect on the images. The study demonstrates that while the introduction of the projection effect does not alter the profiles of the black hole's inner shadow and critical curve, it significantly suppresses the specific intensity of light rays, particularly in direct emission, thereby reducing image brightness. The extent of this reduction depends on both the observation inclination and frequency. This phenomenon aids in the extraction of geometric information from higher-order subrings in the image. Furthermore, we find that increasing the deformation parameter enhances the brightness of the deformed Schwarzschild black hole image, accompanied by a reduction in the size of the critical curve and inner shadow. This relationship establishes a connection between the intrinsic properties of deformed Schwarzschild black holes and their observational characteristics, providing a reliable tool for testing the no-hair theorem and gravitational theories. Specifically, we propose a novel method for constraining parameters based on the silhouette of the inner shadow, which holds promise for extension to any spherically symmetric black hole in other gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Formation of stable wormhole solution with non-commutative geometry in the framework of $f(R,\mathcal{L}_m, T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research delves into the potential existence of traversable wormholes (WHs) within the framework of $f(R,\mathcal{L}_m, T)$ gravity, a modification that includes the matter Lagrangian and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor with specific coupling strengths $\alpha$ and $\beta$. A thorough examination of WH solutions is undertaken using a constant redshift function in tandem with a linear $f(R,\mathcal{L}_m, T)$ model. The analysis involves deriving WH shape functions based on non-commutative geometry, with a particular focus on Gaussian and Lorentzian matter distributions $\rho$. Constraints on the coupling parameters are developed so that the shape function satisfies both the flaring-out and asymptotic flatness conditions. Moreover, for positive coupling parameters, violating the null energy condition (NEC) at the WH throat $r_0$ demands the presence of exotic matter. For negative couplings, however, we find that exotic matter can be avoided by establishing the upper bound $\beta+\alpha/2&lt;-\frac{1}{\rho r_0^2}-8\pi$. Additionally, the effects of gravitational lensing are explored, revealing the repulsive force of our modified gravity for large negative couplings. Lastly, the stability of the derived WH solutions is verified using the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) formalism.</description>

      <title>Bounds on ultralight bosons from the Event Horizon Telescope observation of Sgr A$^*$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observation of Sagittarius A$^*$ (Sgr A$^*$) by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration has uncovered various unanswered questions in black hole (BH) physics. Besides, it may also probe various beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios. One of the most profound possibilities is the search for ultralight bosons (ULBs) using BH superradiance (SR). EHT observations imply that Sgr A$^*$ has a non-zero spin. Using this observation, we derive bounds on the mass of ULBs with purely gravitational interactions. Considering self-interacting ultralight axions, we constrain new regions in the parameter space of decay constant, for a certain spin of Sgr A$^*$. Future observations of various spinning BHs can improve the present constraints on ULBs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If dark matter (DM) consists of primordial black holes (PBHs) and particles simultaneously, PBHs are generically embedded within particle DM halos. Such ``dressed PBHs'' (dPBHs) are subject to modified constraints compared to PBHs and can contribute to significant DM abundance in the mass range $10^{-1} - 10^2 M_\odot$. We show that diffractive lensing of chirping gravitational waves (GWs) from binary mergers can not only discover, but can also identify dPBH lenses and discriminate them from bare PBHs on the event-by-event basis, with potential to definitively establish the coexistence of subdominant PBHs and particle DM.</description>

      <title>The neutron decay anomaly, neutron stars and dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discrepancies in different measurements of the lifetime of isolated neutrons could be resolved by considering an extra neutron decay channel into dark matter, with a branching ratio of the order of $O(1$\%). Although the decay channel into a dark fermion $\chi$ plus visible matter has been already experimentally excluded, a dark decay with either a scalar or dark photon remains still a possibility. In particular, a model with a fermion mass $m_\chi\approx 1$ GeV and a scalar $m_\phi \approx O(\rm{MeV})$ could provide not only the required branching ratio to explain the anomaly but also a good dark matter (DM) candidate with the right thermal abundance today. Although the interaction DM-neutron will affect the formation of neutron stars, the combined effect of the dark matter self-interactions mediated by the light scalar and an effective repulsive interaction with the neutrons induced by the scalar-Higgs coupling would allow heavy enough neutron stars. The combined constraints from neutron lifetime, dark matter abundance, neutron star and Higgs physics, and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, restrict the light scalar mass to the range $2 m_e &lt; m_\phi &lt; 2 m_e + 0.0375$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Interpretation in Subsolar Mass Gravitational Wave Candidate SSM200308</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the recent second part of the third observation run by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, a candidate with sub-solar mass components was reported, which we labelled as SSM200308. This study investigates the premise that primordial black holes (PBHs), arising from Gaussian perturbation collapses, could explain SSM200308. Through Bayesian analysis, we obtain the primordial curvature power spectrum that leads to the merger rate of PBHs aligning with observational data as long as they constitute {$f_{\mathrm{PBH}}=5.66^{+58.68}_{-5.44}\times 10^{-2}$ } of the dark matter. However, while the gravitational wave (GW) background from binary PBH mergers is within current observational limits, the scalar-induced GWs associated with PBH formation exceed the constraints imposed by pulsar timing arrays, challenging the Gaussian perturbation collapse PBH model as the source of SSM200308.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearly charging the conformally dressed black holes preserving duality and conformal invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We start this paper by concisely rederiving ModMax, which is nothing but the unique nonlinear extension of Maxwell's equations preserving conformal and duality invariance. The merit of this new derivation is its transparency and simplicity since it is based on an approach where the elusive duality invariance is manifest. In the second part, we couple the ModMax electrodynamics to Einstein gravity with a cosmological constant together with a standard conformal scalar field, and new stationary spacetimes with dyonic charges are found. These solutions are later used as seed configurations to generate nonlinearly charged (super-)renormalizably dressed spacetimes by means of a known generating method that we extend to include any nonlinear conformal electrodynamics. We end by addressing the issue of how to generalize some of these results to include the recently studied non-Noetherian conformal scalar fields, whose equation of motion still enjoys conformal symmetry even though its action does not. It turns out that the static non-Noetherian conformally dressed black holes also become amenable to being charged by ModMax.</description>

      <title>Warped CFT duals of the Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski family of solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the symmetry properties of the complete family of type D spacetimes generalized form the Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski solution in four dimensions holographically in terms of a warped CFT. The generalized Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski solutions are black hole-like spacetimes characterized by seven physical parameters. Most of the black holes in four dimensions are included within this family. Generically consider a solution with horizon in this family, we figure out the possible warped conformal symmetry attached to the horizon. The horizon can be either extremal or non-extremal. In the extremal case, the near horizon region can be mapped to an infinite spacetime with geometry given by a warped and twist product of AdS$_2$ and S$^2$. The new boundary conditions for AdS$_2$ as well as their higher dimensional uplifts are applied here to manifest the asymptotic symmetry as the warped conformal symmetry. In the non-extremal case, the global warped conformal symmetry is singled out by analyzing the scalar wave equation with constant frequency. The local warped conformal symmetries are represented by the charge algebra associated to the vector fields which preserve the scalar wave equation as well as its frequency. In defining the variation of the covariant charges, a proper counterterm is introduced for consistency conditions which is supposed to be suitable for all the solutions within the family. As a consistency check, the horizon entropy is reproduced by the entropy formula of the warped CFT by using its modular covariance and the central terms derived in the bulk spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Lensing in More Realistic Dark Matter Halo Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore gravitational lensing using more realistic dark matter halo models, moving beyond the limitations of spherical-collapse approximations. Through analytical calculations employing various mass functions, we address critical factors often neglected in the standard Press-Schechter formalism, such as ellipsoidal collapse conditions, angular momentum dynamics, dynamical friction, and the cosmological constant. Our analysis incorporates two widely recognized halo density profiles, the Navarro-Frenk-White and Einasto profiles considering both spherical and ellipsoidal-collapse scenarios. We provide detailed calculations of key gravitational lensing observables, including Einstein radii, lensing optical depths, and time delays, across a broad range of redshifts and masses using two different lensing models: the point mass and singular isothermal sphere (SIS) models. Our results show that using more realistic dark matter halo models enhances lensing effects compared to their spherical-collapse counterparts. Additionally, our analyses of lensing optical depths and time delays reveal distinct differences between the point mass and SIS lens models. These findings underscore the importance of using realistic halo descriptions instead of simplified approximations when modeling gravitational lensing, as this approach can more accurately capture the complex structures of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Holographic reconstruction of black hole spacetime: machine learning and entanglement entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the bulk reconstruction of AdS black hole spacetime emergent from quantum entanglement within a machine learning framework. Utilizing neural ordinary differential equations alongside Monte-Carlo integration, we develop a method tailored for continuous training functions to extract the general isotropic bulk metric from entanglement entropy data. To validate our approach, we first apply our machine learning algorithm to holographic entanglement entropy data derived from the Gubser-Rocha and superconductor models, which serve as representative models of strongly coupled matters in holography. Our algorithm successfully extracts the corresponding bulk metrics from these data. Additionally, we extend our methodology to many-body systems by employing entanglement entropy data from a fermionic tight-binding chain at half filling, exemplifying critical one-dimensional systems, and derive the associated bulk metric. We find that the metrics for a tight-binding chain and the Gubser-Rocha model are similar. We speculate this similarity is due to the metallic property of these models.</description>

      <title>Searching for cosmic strings via black hole spin-down</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings that are attached to rapidly spinning black holes can extract significant amounts of rotational energy and angular momentum. Here we study the effect on primordial black holes, which are expected to form with one or more cosmic strings attached. Although large primordial black holes are predicted to rapidly spin up due to accretion soon after forming, we argue that cosmic strings will spin them down again. We show that if there are cosmic strings with tension greater than $10^{-20}$, the spins of large primordial black holes of mass greater than $30 M_\odot$ should consequently be observed to be near zero. We also investigate the effect on a supermassive black hole of capturing a cosmic string and the possibility of observing the subsequent spin down by its effect on a pulsar orbiting the black hole.</description>

      <title>Curved-spacetime dynamics of spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ particles in superposed states from a WKB approximation of the Dirac equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ particles that are freely propagating in superposed states in curved spacetime. We first make use of a Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation of the Dirac equation in curved spacetime to extract the corresponding Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations that describe the deviation from geodesic motion as well as the spin precession of such particles. We then discuss, in light of our results, the case of flavour neutrinos which are, by nature, a superposition of mass eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Off-shell invariants of linearized $4D, \mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity in the harmonic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the harmonic superspace approach, we construct, at the linearized level, $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric curvatures generalizing scalar curvature, Ricci curvature and Weyl tensor. These supercurvatures are the building blocks of various linearized $4D, \, \mathcal{N}=2$ Einstein supergravity invariants. The supercurvatures involving the scalar and Ricci curvatures are analytic harmonic ${\cal N}=2$ superfields, while the Weyl supertensor is a chiral $\mathcal{N}=2$ superfield. As the basic distinguished feature of our construction, all these objects are expressed through the fundamental analytic gauge prepotentials $h^{++M}, M= (\alpha\dot\alpha, +\alpha, +\dot\alpha, 5)$. The related characteristic features are the heavy use of harmonic derivatives and harmonic zero-curvature equations. On a number of instructive examples, we describe the component reduction of the superfield invariants constructed.</description>

      <title>Yang-Mills extension of the Loop Quantum Gravity-corrected Maxwell equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we endeavour to build up a non-Abelian formulation to describe the self-interactions of massless vector bosons in the context of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). To accomplish this task, we start off from the modified Maxwell equations with the inclusion of LQG corrections and its corresponding local $U(1)$ gauge invariance. LQG effects in the electromagnetic interactions have significant importance, as they might be adopted to describe the flight time of cosmic photons coming from very high-energy explosions in the Universe, such as events of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). These photons have energy-dependent speeds, indicating that the velocity of light in the vacuum is not constant. To carry out the extension from the Abelian to the non-Abelian scenario, we shall follow the so-called Noether current procedure, which consists in recurrently introducing self-interactions into an initially free action for vector bosons by coupling the latter to the conserved currents of a global symmetry present in the action of departure. In the end of the non-Abelianization process, the initial global symmetry naturally becomes local. Once the Yang-Mills system includes LQG correction terms, it becomes possible to analyze how quantum-gravity induced contributions show up in both the electroweak and the QCD sectors of the Standard Model, providing a set-up for phenomenological investigations that may bring about new elements to discuss Physics beyond the Standard-Model.</description>

      <title>Premerger phenomena in neutron-star binary coalescences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variety of high-energy events can take place in the seconds leading up to a binary neutron-star merger. Mechanisms involving tidal resonances, electrodynamic interactions, or shocks in mass-loaded wakes have been proposed as instigators of these precursors. With a view of gravitational-wave and multimessenger astrophysics more broadly, premerger observations and theory are reviewed emphasising how gamma-ray precursors and dynamical tides can constrain the neutron-star equation of state, thermodynamic microphysics, and evolutionary pathways. Connections to post-merger phenomena, notably gamma-ray bursts, are discussed together with how magnetic fields, spin and misalignment, crustal elasticity, and stratification gradients impact observables.</description>
