      <title>Do More Suspicious Transaction Reports Lead to More Convictions for Money Laundering?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Almost all countries in the world require banks to report suspicious transactions to national authorities. The reports are known as suspicious transaction or activity reports (we use the former term) and are intended to help authorities detect and prosecute money laundering. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between suspicious transaction reports and convictions for money laundering in the European Union. We use publicly available data from Europol, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Sourcebook of Crime and Criminal Justice Statistics. To analyze the data, we employ a log-transformation and fit pooled (i.e., ordinary least squares) and fixed effects regression models. The fixed effects models, in particular, allow us to control for unobserved country-specific confounders (e.g., different laws regarding when and how reports should be filed). Initial results indicate that the number of suspicious transaction reports and convictions for money laundering in a country follow a sub-linear power law. Thus, while more reports may lead to more convictions, their marginal effect decreases with their amount. The relationship is robust to control variables such as the size of shadow economies and police forces. However, when we include time as a control, the relationship disappears in the fixed effects models. This suggests that the relationship is spurious rather than causal, driven by cross-country differences and a common time trend. In turn, a country cannot, ceteris paribus and with statistical confidence, expect that an increase in suspicious transaction reports will drive an increase in convictions.
  Our results have important implications for international anti-money laundering efforts and policies. (...)</description>

      <title>From Coverage to Consequences: BMI, Health Behaviors, and Self-rated Health After Medicaid Contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging Tennessee's 2005 Medicaid contraction, I study the impact of losing public health insurance on body weight and relevant health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate synthetic difference-in-differences models. The estimates suggest that the reform increased Body Mass Index by 0.38 points and the overweight or obesity prevalence (BMI$\geq$25) by $\sim$4\% among Tennessean childless adults. My findings -- a 21\% increase in the share of childless adults reporting ``poor'' health status (the lowest level on the five-point scale), a reduction in Medicaid-reimbursed utilization of pain and anti-inflammatory medications, and a reduction in participation in moderate physical activities -- suggest that worsening unmanaged health conditions may be a key pathway through which coverage loss affected weight gain. Additionally, my analysis offers practical guidance for conducting robust inference in single treated cluster settings with limited pre-treatment data.</description>

      <title>Profit-Aware Graph Framework for Cross-Platform Ride-Sharing: Analyzing Allocation Mechanisms and Efficiency Gains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ride-hailing platforms (e.g., Uber, Lyft) have transformed urban mobility by enabling ride-sharing, which holds considerable promise for reducing both travel costs and total vehicle miles traveled (VMT). However, the fragmentation of these platforms impedes system-wide efficiency by restricting ride-matching to intra-platform requests. Cross-platform collaboration could unlock substantial efficiency gains, but its realization hinges on fair and sustainable profit allocation mechanisms that can align the incentives of competing platforms. This study introduces a graph-theoretic framework that embeds profit-aware constraints into network optimization, facilitating equitable and efficient cross-platform ride-sharing. Within this framework, we evaluate three allocation schemes -- equal-profit-based, market-share-based, and Shapley-value-based -- through large-scale simulations. Results show that the Shapley-value-based mechanism consistently outperforms the alternatives across six key metrics. Notably, system efficiency and rider service quality improve with increasing demand, reflecting clear economies of scale. The observed economies of scale, along with their diminishing returns, can be understood with the structural evolution of rider-request graphs, where super-linear edge growth expands feasible matches and sub-linear degree scaling limits per-rider connectivity.</description>

      <title>Bias-Adjusted LLM Agents for Human-Like Decision-Making via Behavioral Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate human decision-making, but their intrinsic biases often diverge from real human behavior--limiting their ability to reflect population-level diversity. We address this challenge with a persona-based approach that leverages individual-level behavioral data from behavioral economics to adjust model biases. Applying this method to the ultimatum game--a standard but difficult benchmark for LLMs--we observe improved alignment between simulated and empirical behavior, particularly on the responder side. While further refinement of trait representations is needed, our results demonstrate the promise of persona-conditioned LLMs for simulating human-like decision patterns at scale.</description>
