      <title>Multiply charged uranium monoxide as a versatile probe of fundamental physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiply charged actinide molecules provide a unique platform to study fundamental physics and the chemical bond under extreme conditions. Beyond the inherently large relativistic effects associated with a high proton number $Z$, an increased molecular charge can further enhance the electronic sensitivity to symmetry-violating nuclear effects, including nuclear Schiff moments. Experimental investigations of multiply charged actinide molecules are challenging because the high charges severely destabilize chemical bonds, leading to spontaneous Coulomb explosion. We demonstrate a method to systematically generate and detect molecular ions at the edge of chemical stability. By applying high-fluence laser ablation to a depleted uranium metal foil, we produce atomic uranium ions U$^{z+}$ and uranium monoxide cations UO$^{z+}$ with $z = 1$--4. Among them, we observe UO$^{3+}$ and UO$^{4+}$, which exhibit comparatively simple electronic structures and are therefore promising for precision spectroscopy. The experiments are supported by relativistic density functional theory calculations of equilibrium bond lengths, charge distributions, and binding energies of all observed molecules. Calculations of symmetry-violating properties suggest a pronounced sensitivity of UO$^{3+}$ to hadronic $CP$ violation. This approach opens a pathway for high-precision investigations of fundamental symmetries and the exploration of relativistic actinide chemistry in previously inaccessible regimes.</description>

      <title>Sample-based quantum diagonalization as parallel fragment solver for the localized active space self-consistent field method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately and efficiently describing strongly correlated electronic systems is a central challenge in quantum computational chemistry, with classical and quantum computers. The localized active space self-consistent field method (LASSCF) uses a product of fragment active spaces as a variational space, with the Schr\"odinger equation solved exactly in each fragment and the fragment active-space orbitals defined in a self-consistent manner. LASSCF is accurate for systems with strong intra-fragment and weak inter-fragment correlation, and its computational cost is combinatorial with respect to the size of the individual fragment active spaces, rather than their product. However, exactly solving the Schr\"odinger equation in each fragment remains a substantial bottleneck. Here, we address the possibility of solving the fragment active space Schr\"odinger equation with approximate methods, particularly sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD). SQD is a technique that uses a quantum computer to sample configurations from a chemically motivated quantum circuit and a classical computer to mitigate errors and solve the Schr\"odinger equation in a subspace of the configuration space. We apply the proposed method, LASSQD, to the [Fe(H$_2$O)$_4$]$_2$bpym$^{4+}$ compound and the [Fe$^{\mathrm{III}}$Fe$^{\mathrm{III}}$Fe$^{\mathrm{II}}$($\mu$$_3$-O)-(HCOO)$_6$] complex for calculating the intermediate-spin ground state energies. We observe that LASSQD can tackle fragment sizes intractable by LASSCF, achieves within 1kcal/mol agreement to LASSCF, and delivers results that are competitive with alternative classical methods to solve the Schr\"odinger equation, and thus can be used as a starting point for a perturbative treatment (LASSQD-PDFT) to recover correlation external to the active space.</description>

      <title>Ab initio insights into plasmonic and strong-field contributions to H$_2$ dissociation on silver nanoshells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling plasmonic catalysis by applying femtosecond laser pulses of high intensity ($10^{13}-10^{15}$ W cm$^{-2}$), although justified by the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) time-scale limitations, can lead to a dissociation mechanism that is completely unrelated to the plasmon excitation created under low-intensity continuous light in experiments (on the order of 1 W cm$^{-2}$). In this study, we examine the dissociation of H$_2$ on a large octahedral Ag nanoshell under varying field intensity, frequency, and duration, and we explore the possibility of identifying optimal modeling conditions accessible with current TDDFT simulations. We show that using this large nanoshell that consists in the outer layer of the Ag$_{231}$ cluster, it is still possible to disentangle the role of the plasmon from strong-field effects at applied field intensities as high as $(2-8) \times 10^{13}$ W cm$^{-2}$. In particular, although strong-field effects are always present at these intensities, we find that the excited plasmon dominates the dissociation process at the lowest applied intensity of $2 \times 10^{13}$ W cm$^{-2}$. Furthermore, at the highest intensity, at which strong-field effects become dominant, the plasmon contributes to accelerating the dissociation of the molecule. Overall, our simulations pave the way to bridge the intensity gap between TDDFT modeling and experiments in plasmonic catalysis.</description>

      <title>Learning continuous SOC-dependent thermal decomposition kinetics for Li-ion cathodes using KA-CRNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries is strongly influenced by the state of charge (SOC). Existing predictive models typically infer scalar kinetic parameters at a full SOC or a few discrete SOC levels, preventing them from capturing the continuous SOC dependence that governs exothermic behavior during abuse conditions. To address this, we apply the Kolmogorov-Arnold Chemical Reaction Neural Network (KA-CRNN) framework to learn continuous and realistic SOC-dependent exothermic cathode-electrolyte interactions. We apply a physics-encoded KA-CRNN to learn SOC-dependent kinetic parameters for cathode-electrolyte decomposition directly from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data. A mechanistically informed reaction pathway is embedded into the network architecture, enabling the activation energies, pre-exponential factors, enthalpies, and related parameters to be represented as continuous and fully interpretable functions of the SOC. The framework is demonstrated for NCA, NM, and NMA cathodes, yielding models that reproduce DSC heat-release features across all SOCs and provide interpretable insight into SOC-dependent oxygen-release and phase-transformation mechanisms. This approach establishes a foundation for extending kinetic parameter dependencies to additional environmental and electrochemical variables, supporting more accurate and interpretable thermal-runaway prediction and monitoring.</description>

      <title>Kagome Topology in Two-Dimensional Noble-Metal Monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) metallic lattices with kagome topology provide a unique platform for exploring the interplay between geometric frustration, reduced coordination, and lattice stability in elemental systems. Motivated by the recent experimental realization of atomically thin gold layers and kagome goldene, we present a first-principles investigation of free-standing kagome monolayers of Cu, Ag, and Au. Using density functional theory combined with lattice dynamics and ab initio molecular dynamics, we systematically assess their structural, mechanical, dynamical, and thermal stability. All kagome monolayers satisfy the 2D Born criteria and exhibit relatively low in-plane stiffness compared to graphene and hexagonal goldene, reflecting the porous nature of the kagome lattice and its metallic bonding. Among the three systems, the Au-based lattice displays the highest in-plane Young's modulus. Phonon calculations reveal that the unstrained kagome phase is dynamically unstable for all metals. However, a moderate biaxial tensile strain of 5% stabilizes the Ag and Au monolayers, while Cu retains residual unstable modes. Finite-temperature simulations further show that Cu rapidly reconstructs toward a trigonal lattice, Ag remains metastable at low temperature but collapses at room temperature, and Au exhibits competing kagome and trigonal motifs at 300 K, indicating near-degeneracy between these phases. These results establish that strain engineering and atomic size are key determinants of the stability of metallic kagome monolayers and provide guidance for future substrate-supported realizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hard sphere model is widely used in description of fluids and solid media as a zero approximation to real systems. Despite the uniqueness of the model, few analytical results are known for it, both for the 2D and 3D cases. In present research we have investigated melting of the hard disk system by considering accumulation of extended defects of a certain type in the crystaline phase, and jamming of the disk packing. It results in formulation of melting criteria with lower and upper bounds on volume ratio at melting transition: $25/21 \le V/V_0 \le 5/4$. It was found that, in full agreement with the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young theory, the 2D crystal melts into anisotropic liquid. The second transition, which is the transition between anisotropic and isotropic liquid has volume ratio $5/4 \le V/V_0 \le 13/9$.</description>

      <title>Lithium-ion battery degradation: Introducing the concept of reservoirs to design for lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing lithium-ion batteries for long service life remains a challenge, as most cells are optimized for beginning-of-life metrics such as energy density, often overlooking how design and operating conditions shape degradation. This work introduces a degradation-aware design framework built around finite, interacting reservoirs (lithium, porosity, and electrolyte) that are depleted over time by coupled degradation processes.
  We extend a physics-based Doyle-Fuller-Newman model to include validated mechanisms such as SEI growth, lithium plating, cracking, and solvent dry-out, and simulate how small design changes impact lifetime. Across more than 1,000 cycles, we find that increasing electrolyte volume by just 1% or porosity by 5% can extend service life by over 30% without significantly affecting cell energy density. However, lithium excess, while boosting initial capacity, can accelerate failure if not supported by sufficient structural or ionic buffers.
  Importantly, we show that interaction between reservoirs is crucial to optimal design: multi-reservoir tuning yields either synergistic benefits or compound failures, depending on operating conditions. We also quantify how C-rate and operating temperature influence degradation pathways, emphasizing the need for co-optimized design and usage profiles.
  By reframing degradation as a problem of managing finite internal reservoirs, this work offers a predictive and mechanistic foundation for designing lithium-ion batteries that balance energy, durability, and application-specific needs.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Large Language Models in Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific research, yet prevailing science benchmarks probe decontextualized knowledge and overlook the iterative reasoning, hypothesis generation, and observation interpretation that drive scientific discovery. We introduce a scenario-grounded benchmark that evaluates LLMs across biology, chemistry, materials, and physics, where domain experts define research projects of genuine interest and decompose them into modular research scenarios from which vetted questions are sampled. The framework assesses models at two levels: (i) question-level accuracy on scenario-tied items and (ii) project-level performance, where models must propose testable hypotheses, design simulations or experiments, and interpret results. Applying this two-phase scientific discovery evaluation (SDE) framework to state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a consistent performance gap relative to general science benchmarks, diminishing return of scaling up model sizes and reasoning, and systematic weaknesses shared across top-tier models from different providers. Large performance variation in research scenarios leads to changing choices of the best performing model on scientific discovery projects evaluated, suggesting all current LLMs are distant to general scientific "superintelligence". Nevertheless, LLMs already demonstrate promise in a great variety of scientific discovery projects, including cases where constituent scenario scores are low, highlighting the role of guided exploration and serendipity in discovery. This SDE framework offers a reproducible benchmark for discovery-relevant evaluation of LLMs and charts practical paths to advance their development toward scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>First-principles simulation of spin diffusion in static solids using dynamic mean-field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of disordered nuclear spin ensembles are the subject of nuclear magnetic resonance studies. Due to the through-space long-range dipolar interaction generically many spins are involved in the time evolution, so that exact brute force calculations are impossible. The recently established spin dynamic mean-field theory (spinDMFT) represents an efficient and unbiased alternative to overcome this challenge. The approach only requires the dipolar couplings as input and the only prerequisite for its applicability is that each spin interacts with a large number of other spins. In this article, we show that spinDMFT can be used to describe spectral spin diffusion in static samples and to simulate zero-quantum line shapes which eluded an efficient quantitative simulation so far to the best of our knowledge. We perform benchmarks for two test substances that establish an excellent match with published experimental data. As spinDMFT combines low computational effort with high accuracy, we strongly suggest to use it for large-scale simulations of spin diffusion, which are important in various areas of magnetic resonance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics offers a powerful route to manipulate material properties. However, it is unclear whether and how quantized fields affect crystals periodicity. Here, we extend Bloch's theorem to crystals under the strong light-matter coupling, showing that polariton quasiparticles preserve lattice periodicity. We formulate a general framework to incorporate the effect of multimode cavity fields in a simple and tractable way. We find that the additional modes contribute to the system's energy by small modifications that become noticeable only at low frequencies. Within the single-photon approximation the multimode contribution manifests as a spatially uniform effective field in the crystal's plane. This provides a formal justification for the single-mode and long-wavelength approximations commonly used in molecular polaritonics. This work establishes a rigorous theoretical framework that clarifies how polaritonic states in crystalline solids should be described.</description>

      <title>Best practices for nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations aim to describe the coupled electron-nuclear dynamics of molecules in excited electronic states. These simulations have been applied to understand a plethora of photochemical and photophysical processes, and, as a result, the number of nonadiabatic dynamics simulations has been growing significantly over the past decade. Yet, the field remains in its infancy, and a potential user may find it difficult to approach this type of simulation, given their complexity and the number of elements that should be considered for a (hopefully) successful nonadiabatic dynamics simulation. Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics relies on several key steps: finding a level of electronic-structure theory to describe the molecule in its Franck-Condon region and beyond, describing the photoexcitation process, selecting a method to perform the nonadiabatic dynamics, and analyzing the final results before calculating observables for a more direct comparison with experiment. This Best Practices guide aims to provide a general guide for the user of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics by (i) discussing the fundamentals of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics and the various trajectory-based methods developed for molecular systems, (ii) introducing the different electronic-structure methods and concepts - adiabatic/diabatic representation, conical intersections - that can be used with nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (or for benchmarking), (iii) providing details on the various steps required to perform a nonadiabatic dynamics simulation and their practical use, as well as guided examples and a discussion on the calculation of observables, (iv) proposing a FAQ with the typical questions a user may have when performing nonadiabatic dynamics, and (v) sketching a checklist for the key practical steps when performing a (trajectory-based) nonadiabatic molecular dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report an iterative algorithm to retrieve accurate real space information from gas phase ultrafast diffraction measurements with missing data at low momentum transfer. The algorithm operates in a manner similar to phase retrieval algorithms which transform signals back and forth between the signal domain and the Fourier transform domain and apply constraints to retrieve the missing phase. Our algorithm retrieves missing data that is not accessible experimentally by applying a real-space constraint that requires only an approximate a-priori knowledge of the shortest and longest internuclear distances in the molecule. We demonstrate successful retrieval of the missing data in simulated data and in experimentally measured electron diffraction signals of photo-dissociated iodobenzene molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18283v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) functionalized with covalent defects are a promising class of optoelectronic materials with strong, tunable photoluminescence and demonstrated single photon emission (SPE). Here, we investigate sulfur-oxide containing compounds as a new class of optically active dopants on (6,5) SWCNT. Experimentally, it has been found that when the SWCNT is exposed to sodium dithionite, the resulting compound displays a red-shifted and bright photoluminescence peak that is characteristic of doping with covalent defects. We perform density functional theory calculations on the possible adsorbed compounds that may be the source of doping (S, SO, SO2 and SO3). We predict that the two smallest molecules strongly bind to the SWCNT with binding energies of ~ 1.5-1.8 eV and 0.56 eV for S and SO, respectively, and introduce in-gap electronic states into the bandstructure of the tube consistent with the measured red-shift of (0.1-0.3) eV, consistent with measurements. In contrast, the larger compounds are found to be either unbound or weakly physisorbed with no appreciable impact on the electronic structure of the tube, indicating that they are unlikely to occur. Overall, our study suggests that sulfur-based compounds are promising new dopants for (6,5) SWCNT with tunable electronic properties.</description>

Abstract: Error mitigation is essential for the practical implementation of quantum algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This work explores and extends Clifford Data Regression (CDR) to mitigate noise in quantum chemistry simulations using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Using the H$_4$ molecule with the tiled Unitary Product State (tUPS) ansatz, we perform noisy simulations with the ibm torino noise model to investigate in detail the effect of various hyperparameters in CDR on the error mitigation quality. Building on these insights, two improvements to the CDR framework are proposed. The first, Energy Sampling (ES), improves performance by selecting only the lowest-energy training circuits for regression, thereby further biasing the sample energies toward the target state. The second, Non-Clifford Extrapolation (NCE), enhances the regression model by including the number of non-Clifford parameters as an additional input, enabling the model to learn how the noisy-ideal mapping evolves as the circuit approaches the optimal one. Our numerical results demonstrate that both strategies outperform the original CDR.</description>
