      <title>Towards Solving the Gilbert-Pollak Conjecture via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gilbert-Pollak Conjecture \citep{gilbert1968steiner}, also known as the Steiner Ratio Conjecture, states that for any finite point set in the Euclidean plane, the Steiner minimum tree has length at least $\sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.866$ times that of the Euclidean minimum spanning tree (the Steiner ratio). A sequence of improvements through the 1980s culminated in a lower bound of $0.824$, with no substantial progress reported over the past three decades. Recent advances in LLMs have demonstrated strong performance on contest-level mathematical problems, yet their potential for addressing open, research-level questions remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present a novel AI system for obtaining tighter lower bounds on the Steiner ratio. Rather than directly prompting LLMs to solve the conjecture, we task them with generating rule-constrained geometric lemmas implemented as executable code. These lemmas are then used to construct a collection of specialized functions, which we call verification functions, that yield theoretically certified lower bounds of the Steiner ratio. Through progressive lemma refinement driven by reflection, the system establishes a new certified lower bound of 0.8559 for the Steiner ratio. The entire research effort involves only thousands of LLM calls, demonstrating the strong potential of LLM-based systems for advanced mathematical research.</description>

      <title>Transitive Sets of Mutually Orthogonal Latin Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate MacNeish's conjecture (known to be false in general) in the setting of what we call "transitive" Mutually Orthogonal Latin Squares (MOLS). When we restrict our attention to "simply transitive" MOLS, we find that the conjecture holds. We provide some partial results towards the transitive case, as well as the outcome of a computer search, which introduces a new construction of MOLS. In particular, we were unable to find any transitive large (conjecture-violating) sets of MOLS in the literature.</description>

      <title>Quaternionic Perfect Sequences and Hadamard Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A finite sequence of numbers is perfect if it has zero periodic autocorrelation after a nontrivial cyclic shift. In this work, we study quaternionic perfect sequences having a one-to-one correspondence with the binary sequences arising in Williamson's construction of quaternion-type Hadamard matrices. Using this correspondence, we devise an enumeration algorithm that is significantly faster than previously used algorithms and does not require the sequences to be symmetric. We implement our algorithm and use it to enumerate all circulant and possibly non-symmetric Williamson-type matrices of orders up to 21; previously, the largest order exhaustively enumerated was 13. We prove that when the blocks of a quaternion-type Hadamard matrix are circulant, the blocks are necessarily pairwise amicable. This dramatically improves the filtering power of our algorithm: in order 20, the number of block pairs needing consideration is reduced by a factor of over 25,000. We use our results to construct quaternionic Hadamard matrices of interest in quantum communication and prove they are not equivalent to those constructed by other means. We also study the properties of quaternionic Hadamard matrices analytically, and demonstrate the feasibility of characterizing quaternionic Hadamard matrices with a fixed pattern of entries. These results indicate a richer set of properties and suggest an abundance of quaternionic Hadamard matrices for sufficiently large orders.</description>

      <title>A Cheeger Inequality for Size-Specific Conductance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\mu$-conductance measure proposed by Lov\'asz and Simonovits is a size-specific conductance score that identifies the set with smallest conductance while disregarding those sets with volume smaller than a $\mu$ fraction of the whole graph. Using $\mu$-conductance enables us to study the network structures in new ways. In this manuscript we study a modified spectral cut for $\mu$-conductance that is a natural relaxation of the integer program of $\mu$-conductance and show that the optimum of this program has a two-sided Cheeger inequality with $\mu$-conductance.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Algorithms for Coordinated Motion Planning: Minimizing Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15950v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the parameterized complexity of a generalization of the coordinated motion planning problem on graphs, where the goal is to route a specified subset of a given set of $k$ robots to their destinations with the aim of minimizing the total energy (i.e., the total length traveled). We develop novel techniques to push beyond previously-established results that were restricted to solid grids.
  We design a fixed-parameter additive approximation algorithm for this problem parameterized by $k$ alone. This result, which is of independent interest, allows us to prove the following two results pertaining to well-studied coordinated motion planning problems: (1) A fixed-parameter algorithm, parameterized by $k$, for routing a single robot to its destination while avoiding the other robots, which is related to the famous Rush-Hour Puzzle; and (2) a fixed-parameter algorithm, parameterized by $k$ plus the treewidth of the input graph, for the standard \textsc{Coordinated Motion Planning} (CMP) problem in which we need to route all the $k$ robots to their destinations. The latter of these results implies, among others, the fixed-parameter tractability of CMP parameterized by $k$ on graphs of bounded outerplanarity, which include bounded-height subgrids.
  We complement the above results with a lower bound which rules out the fixed-parameter tractability for CMP when parameterized by the total energy. This contrasts the recently-obtained tractability of the problem on solid grids under the same parameterization. As our final result, we strengthen the aforementioned fixed-parameter tractability to hold not only on solid grids but all graphs of bounded local treewidth -- a class including, among others, all graphs of bounded genus.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Lift-and-Project Differentiable Approach For the Maximum Cut Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scalable framework for solving the Maximum Cut (MaxCut) problem in large graphs using projected gradient ascent on quadratic objectives. Our approach is differentiable and leverages GPUs for gradient-based optimization. It is not a machine learning method and does not require training data. Starting from a continuous relaxation of the classical quadratic binary formulation, we present a parallelized strategy that explores multiple initialization vectors in batch. We analyze the relaxed objective, showing it is convex and has fixed-points corresponding to local optima, particularly at boundary points, highlighting a key challenge in non-convex optimization. To improve exploration, we introduce a lifted quadratic formulation that over-parameterizes the solution space. We also provide a theoretical characterization of these lifted fixed-points. Finally, we propose DECO, a dimension-alternating algorithm that switches between the unlifted and lifted formulations, combined with importance-based degree initialization and a population-based evolutionary hyper-parameter search. Experiments on diverse graph families show that our methods attain comparable or superior performance relative to recent neural networks and GPU-accelerated sampling approaches.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of minimal transversals of hypergraphs of bounded VC-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00694v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of enumerating all minimal transversals (also called minimal hitting sets) of a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$. An equivalent formulation of this problem known as the \emph{transversal hypergraph} problem (or \emph{hypergraph dualization} problem) is to decide, given two hypergraphs, whether one corresponds to the set of minimal transversals of the other. The existence of a polynomial time algorithm to solve this problem is a long standing open question. In \cite{fredman_complexity_1996}, the authors present the first sub-exponential algorithm to solve the transversal hypergraph problem which runs in quasi-polynomial time, making it unlikely that the problem is (co)NP-complete.
  In this paper, we show that when one of the two hypergraphs is of bounded VC-dimension, the transversal hypergraph problem can be solved in polynomial time, or equivalently that if $\mathcal{H}$ is a hypergraph of bounded VC-dimension, then there exists an incremental polynomial time algorithm to enumerate its minimal transversals. This result generalizes most of the previously known polynomial cases in the literature since they almost all consider classes of hypergraphs of bounded VC-dimension. As a consequence, the hypergraph transversal problem is solvable in polynomial time for any class of hypergraphs closed under partial subhypergraphs. We also show that the proposed algorithm runs in quasi-polynomial time in general hypergraphs and runs in polynomial time if the conformality of the hypergraph is bounded, which is one of the few known polynomial cases where the VC-dimension is unbounded.</description>

      <title>Spirals and Beyond: Competitive Plane Search with Multi-Speed Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing the worst-case search time for a hidden point target in the plane using multiple mobile agents of differing speeds, all starting from a common origin. The search time is normalized by the target's distance to the origin, following the standard convention in competitive analysis. The goal is to minimize the maximum such normalized time over all target locations, the search cost. As a base case, we extend the known result for a single unit-speed agent, which achieves an optimal cost of about $\mathcal{U}_1 = 17.28935$ via a logarithmic spiral, to $n$ unit-speed agents. We give a symmetric spiral-based algorithm where each agent follows a logarithmic spiral offset by equal angular phases. This yields a search cost independent of which agent finds the target. We provide a closed-form upper bound $\mathcal{U}_n$ for this setting, which we use in our general result. Our main contribution is an upper bound on the worst-case normalized search time for $n$ agents with arbitrary speeds. We give a framework that selects a subset of agents and assigns spiral-type trajectories with speed-dependent angular offsets, again making the search cost independent of which agent reaches the target. A corollary shows that $n$ multi-speed agents (fastest speed 1) can beat $k$ unit-speed agents (cost below $\mathcal{U}_k$) if the geometric mean of their speeds exceeds $\mathcal{U}_n / \mathcal{U}_k$. This means slow agents may be excluded if they lower the mean too much, motivating non-spiral algorithms. We also give new upper bounds for point search in cones and conic complements using a single unit-speed agent. These are then used to design hybrid spiral-directional strategies, which outperform the spiral-based algorithms when some agents are slow. This suggests that spiral-type trajectories may not be optimal in the general multi-speed setting.</description>

      <title>On the complex zeros and the computational complexity of approximating the reliability polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we relate the location of the complex zeros of the reliability polynomial to parameters at which a certain family of rational functions derived from the reliability polynomial exhibits chaotic behaviour. We use this connection to prove new results about the location of reliability zeros. In particular we show that there are zeros with modulus larger than $1$ with essentially any possible argument. We moreover use this connection to show that approximately evaluating the reliability polynomial for planar graphs at a non-positive algebraic number in the unit disk is #P-hard.</description>
