      <title>Random Effects Models for Understanding Variability and Association between Brain Functional and Structural Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human brain is organized as a complex network, where connections between regions are characterized by both functional connectivity (FC) and structural connectivity (SC). While previous studies have primarily focused on network-level FC-SC correlations (i.e., the correlation between FC and SC across all edges within a predefined network), edge-level correlations (i.e., the correlation between FC and SC across subjects at each edge) has received comparatively little attention. In this study, we systematically analyze both network-level and edge-level FC-SC correlations, demonstrating that they lead to divergent conclusions about the strength of brain function-structure association. To explain these discrepancies, we introduce new random effects models that decompose FC and SC variability into different sources: subject effects, edge effects, and their interactions. Our results reveal that network-level and edge-level FC-SC correlations are influenced by different effects, each contributing differently to the total variability in FC and SC. This modeling framework provides the first statistical approach for disentangling and quantitatively assessing different sources of FC and SC variability and yields new insights into the relationship between functional and structural brain networks.</description>

      <title>The Multi-biophysical nature of Computation in brain neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comprehending the nature of action potentials is fundamental to our understanding of the functioning of nervous systems in general. The ionic mechanisms underlying action potentials in the squid giant axon were first described by Hodgkin and Huxley in 1952 and their findings have formed our orthodox view of how the physiological action potential functions. However, substan-tial evidence has now accumulated to show that the action potential is accompanied by a syn-chronized coupled soliton pressure pulse in the cell membrane, the action potential pulse (AP-Pulse) which we have recently shown to have an essential function in computation. Here we ex-plore the interactions between the soliton and the ionic mechanisms known to be associated with the action potential. Computational models of the action potential usually describe it as a binary event, but we have shown that it must be a quantum ternary event known as the computa-tional action potential (CAP), whose temporal fixed point is the threshold of the soliton, rather than the rather plastic action potential peak used in other models to facilitate meaningful compu-tation. We have demonstrated this type of frequency computation for the retina, in detail, and also provided an extensive analysis for computation for other brain neural networks. The CAP ac-companies the APPulse and the Physiological action potential. Therefore, we conclude that nerve impulses appear to be an ensemble of three inseparable, interdependent, concurrent states: the physiological action potential, the APPulse and the CAP. However, while the physio-logical action potential is important in terms of neural connectivity, it is irrelevant to computational processes as this is always facilitated by the soliton part of the APPulse.</description>
