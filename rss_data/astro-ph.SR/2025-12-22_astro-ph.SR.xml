      <title>Empirical instability strip for classical Cepheids II. The Small Magellanic Cloud galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. This study aims to determine empirical intrinsic edges of the classical Cepheids instability strip (IS) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) galaxy, considering various effects that alter its shape, and compare them with theoretical models and other galaxies. Methods. We used the data of classical fundamental-mode (F) and first-overtone mode (1O) SMC Cepheids from the OGLE-IV variable star catalog, with the final cleaned sample including 2388 F and 1560 1O Cepheids. The IS borders are determined by tracing the edges of the color distribution along the strip. Based on that, and using evolutionary tracks, the IS crossing times are computed. Results. We obtained the blue and red edges of the IS in V- and I-photometric bands and in the HR diagram, and detected breaks at periods between 1.4 and 3 days. A comparison with existing theoretical models showed good agreement for the blue edge and significant differences for the red edge. We also found that the IS of the SMC is wider than that of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), with its red edge being redder despite its lower metallicity. The analysis of crossing times showed that the expected number of Cepheids as a function of period agrees with the observed distribution for P &gt; 1 days but differs for P &lt; 1 days. Conclusions. Slope changes along the SMC IS borders are most likely explained by the distribution of metallicity. The behavior of the blue loops at the SMC metallicity is not consistent with observations, and at the LMC metallicity, the blue loops are too short for lower-mass stars. A comparison of theoretical edges with our empirical ISs imposes constraints on the models and enables the identification of valid ones. Based on the positions of the breaks, our study also suggests that fundamental-mode Cepheids with periods longer than 3 days should be used for distance determination.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Systematic Age Discrepancies in Very Young Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We infer the ages of three young stellar clusters, NGC 2004, NGC 7419, and NGC 2100, using Stellar Ages, a statistical algorithm designed to infer stellar population properties from color magnitude diagrams. Recent studies have revealed emerging inconsistencies in the inferred ages of very young stellar clusters with ages less than or equal to 50 Myr. Here, we identify and quantify two distinct discrepancies. First, we identify a systematic age offset of 0.55 plus minus 0.09 dex between red supergiant and bright blue star age estimates, equivalent to a factor of approximately 3.5 in linear age, with bright blue star ages appearing systematically younger than those inferred from red supergiants. Second, given the observed numbers of red supergiants and bright blue stars, we find a pronounced deficit of lower-mass main-sequence stars relative to expectations from a standard initial mass function. Although these discrepancies resemble those reported for intermediate-age clusters, their magnitude and character suggest that they are unique to the evolution of massive stars. Together, these results highlight population-level inconsistencies with single-star evolutionary models and underscore the need to consider multiple evolutionary tracers when age-dating young clusters. By combining individual stellar ages with population-wide constraints, our approach refines prior work on cluster age determinations and provides new insight into massive star evolution and the interpretation of cluster demographics.</description>

      <title>The mass distribution of clumpy accretion onto the nearby young star TW Hya</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of high time-resolution and decades-long monitoring of classical T Tauri stars provides a vast opportunity to test the variability of the star-disk connections. However, most monitoring surveys use single broad-band filters, which makes the conversion of photometric variability into accretion rate difficult. In this study, we analyze accretion bursts onto the nearby young star TW Hya over short (hours, days) and long (months, years) timescales by calibrating TESS and ASAS-SN $g$-band photometry to accretion rates with simultaneous spectroscopy. The high cadence TESS light curve shows bursts of accretion in clumps with masses from a sensitivity limit of $\sim10^{-13}$~M$_\odot$ up to $3\times 10^{-11}$\,M$_\odot$. The average burst duration of 1.8 days is longer than a simple estimate of the thermal response timescale, supporting the interpretation that the photometric variability probes the instantaneous accretion rate. The reset timescale of 1.2--2 days derived from the structure function and previously reported quasi-periods of 3.5--4 days are consistent with bursts that may be related to the different rotation between the stellar magnetosphere and inner disk or with azimuthal asymmetries in the inner disk. The near-daily ASAS-SN light curve across 8 years reveals some seasonal changes in brightness with a standard deviation of $\sim 0.13$ mag, about half of the scatter seen on short timescales. This study demonstrates the importance of coordinating contemporaneous multi-epoch spectroscopy with time domain surveys to interpret light curves of young stars.</description>

      <title>Prediction of the Solar Polar Fields in 2026: An Unusually Weak Level Across the Last Five Solar Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar polar fields are essential for the solar cycle and the heliospheric magnetic field. Cycle 25 is now entering its declining phase, the critical period during which most of the cycle's polar fields are established. Therefore, reliable polar-field prediction is now especially important. Polar-field evolution is governed by the poleward transport of already-emerged active-region (AR) flux over a timescale of a few years. Thus, surface flux-transport models can reliably provide one-year predictions without requiring information about future AR emergence. Our prediction method is validated using simulations of the surface magnetic field from 2020-2025 and hindcasts of the 2023-2024 polar fields, employing a newly constrained profile of the meridional flow. Using the most recent HMI synoptic magnetogram as the initial condition, we predict the polar-field evolution from October 2025 to October 2026. The southern polar field is predicted to strengthen gradually, while the northern field is expected to decline sharply until March 2026 due to some ARs with abnormal polarity. By that time, the northern polar field becomes exceptionally weak, and the southern field remains relatively weak, raising concerns about the polar-field strength at the cycle 25/26 minimum and the amplitude of cycle 26.</description>

      <title>Quantifying sunspot group nesting with density-based unsupervised clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sunspot groups often emerge in spatial-temporal clusters, known as nests or complexes of activity. Quantifying how frequently such nesting occurs is important for understanding the organisation and recurrence of solar magnetic fields. We introduce an automated approach to identify nests in the longitude-time domain and to measure the fraction of sunspot groups that belong to them. The method combines a smooth representation of emergence patterns with a density-based clustering procedure, validated using synthetic solar-like cycles and corrected for variations in data density. We apply this method to 151 years of sunspot-group observations from the Royal Greenwich Observatory Photoheliographic Results (RGO, 1874-1976) and Kislovodsk Mountain Astronomical Station (KMAS, 1955-2025) catalogues. Across all cycles and latitude bands, the mean nesting degree is $\langle D\rangle = 0.61 \pm 0.12$, implying that about 60 percent all sunspot groups emerge within nests. Nesting is strongest at mid-latitudes (10$^\circ$-20$^\circ$), and results from the two independent datasets agree in the period of overlap. The identified nests range from compact clusters to long-lived, drifting structures, offering new quantitative constraints on the persistence and organisation of solar magnetic activity.</description>

      <title>Using a neural network approach and starspots dependent models to predict effective temperatures and ages of young stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a statistical approach to accurately predict the effective temperatures of pre-main sequence stars, which are necessary for determining stellar ages using the isochrone methodology and cutting-age starspots-dependent models. By training a Neural Network model on high-quality spectroscopic temperatures from the Gaia-ESO Survey as the response variable, and using photometric data from Gaia DR3 and 2MASS catalogs as explanatory variables, we implemented a methodology to accurately derive the effective temperatures of much larger populations of stars for which only photometric data are available. The model demonstrated robust performance for low-mass stars with temperatures below 7000 K, including young stars, the primary focus of this work. Predicted temperatures were employed to construct Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams and to predict stellar ages of different young clusters and star forming regions through isochrone interpolation, achieving excellent agreement with spectroscopic-based ages and literature values derived from model-independent methods like lithium equivalent widths. The inclusion of starspot evolutionary models improved the age predictions, providing a more accurate description of stellar properties. Additionally, the results regarding the effective temperature and age predictions of the young clusters provide evidence for intrinsic age spreads in the youngest clusters, suggesting multiple formation events over time.</description>

      <title>A search for late-type brown dwarfs in the Euclid Quick Data Release 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the identification and characterization of 15 mid-to-late T dwarf candidates in the Euclid Quick Release 1 (Q1) dataset, based on a combined photometric and spectroscopic analysis. Candidates were initially selected via color-based cuts in the Euclid $Y_E - J_E$ and $J_E - H_E$ color-color space, targeting the region occupied by ultracool dwarfs in synthetic photometry from the Sanghi et al. (2024) sample. From an initial pool of 38,845 sources, we extracted low-resolution near-infrared spectra from the Euclid NISP instrument and applied a two-stage validation procedure that included spectral template fitting followed by visual inspection. Eight of the 15 validated candidates are newly identified objects with no prior literature association. We examined their morphological and photometric properties and compared them with established spectral standards. Photometric distances were derived using band-averaged distance modulus estimates. We discuss the limitations and promise of the Euclid survey for ultracool dwarf studies, and demonstrate the potential for discovering substellar populations beyond the reach of current wide-field surveys.</description>

      <title>A VLA search for compact radio sources in the explosive molecular outflows DR 21 and G5.89</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-angular-resolution ($\sim0\rlap{.}''1$) VLA Ku-band (12--18 GHz) observations of two explosive molecular outflows (EMOs), DR 21 and G5.89, in a search for runaway stars related to these explosive events. In DR 21, we identified 13 compact radio sources (CRS), 9 located in the DR 21 core and near the CO streamer ejection region. The radio properties of the CRSs show that three are nonthermal radio emitters, likely magnetically active stars, while the nature of the remaining CRSs cannot be conclusively identified. All detected CRSs are good candidates for follow-up proper motion studies to confirm whether they are runaway stars. We also identify multiple ionized arc-shaped structures that can be fitted with parabolas whose symmetry axes converge to a position coincident with CRSs #11, raising the possibility that this source is the main ionizing star. A re-analysis of the 18 molecular outflow streamers refines the center of the explosive event, which aligns closely with the position indicated by the arcs convergence point, supporting a common stellar origin for the EMOs and the HII-region. In G5.89, the observations reveal a shell with a square-like morphology. The strong extended emission from this HII region prevents the detection of weak compact radio sources inside the shell; only two were identified well beyond the shell, and a single parabolic arc was fitted within this region. Overall, arc structures in ionized regions seem to be good tracers of the origin of the ionizing sources.</description>

      <title>Pre-supernova O-C shell mergers could produce more $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ than the explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ in massive stars is thought to occur during explosive nucleosynthesis, however recent studies have shown it can be produced during O-C shell mergers prior to core collapse. We investigate how mixing according to 3D macro physics derived from hydrodynamic simulations impacts the pre-supernova O-C shell merger nucleosynthesis and if it can dominate the explosive supernova production of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ and other radioactive isotopes. We compare a range of observations and models of explosive $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ yields to pre-explosive multi-zone mixing-burning nucleosynthesis simulations of an O-C shell merger in a $15~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ stellar model with mixing conditions corresponding to different 3D hydro mixing scenarios. Radioactive species produced in the O shell have a spread in their pre-explosive yields predictions across different 3D mixing scenarios of 2.14 dex on average. $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ has the largest spread of 4.78 dex. The pre-explosive production of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ can be larger than the production of all massive star models in the NuGrid data set where $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ is dominated by the explosive nucleosynthesis contribution, as well all other massive star and supernova models. We conclude that quantitative predictions of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ and other radioactive species more broadly require an understanding of the 3D hydrodynamic mixing conditions present during the O-C shell merger.</description>

      <title>On the complex nature of coronal heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large part of the hot corona consists of magnetically confined, bright plasma loops. These observed loops are in turn structured into bright strands. We investigate the relationship between magnetic field geometry, plasma properties and bright strands with the help of a 3D resistive MHD simulation of a coronal loop rooted in a self-consistent convection zone layer. We find that it is impossible to identify a loop as a simple coherent magnetic flux tube that coincides with plasma of nearly uniform temperature and density. The location of bright structures is determined by a complex interplay between heating, cooling and evaporation timescales. Current sheets form preferentially at the interfaces of magnetic flux from different sources. They may also form within bundles of magnetic field lines since motions within magnetic concentrations drive plasma flows on a range of timescales that provide further substructure and can locally enhance magnetic field gradients and thus facilitate magnetic reconnection. The numerical experiment therefore possesses aspects of both the flux tube tectonics and flux braiding models. While modelling an observed coronal loop as a cylindrical flux tube is useful to understand the physics of specific heating mechanisms in isolation, it does not describe well the structure of a coronal loop rooted in a self-consistently evolving convection zone.</description>

      <title>ESO Expanding Horizon White Paper: Revealing the properties of matter at supranuclear densities with gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding dense matter under extreme conditions is one of the most fundamental puzzles in modern physics. Complex interactions give rise to emergent, collective phenomena. While nuclear experiments and Earth - based colliders provide valuable insights, much of the quantum chromodynamics phase diagram at high density and low temperature remains accessible only through astrophysical observations of neutron stars, neutron star mergers, and stellar collapse. Astronomical observations thus offer a direct window to the physics on subatomic scales with gravitational waves presenting an especially clean channel. Next-generation gravitational - wave observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope, would serve as unparalleled instruments to transform our understanding of neutron star matter. They will enable the detection of up to tens of thousands of binary neutron star and neutron star - black hole mergers per year, a dramatic increase over the few events accessible with current detectors. They will provide an unprecedented precision in probing cold, dense matter during the binary inspiral, exceeding by at least an order of magnitude what current facilities can achieve. Moreover, these observatories will allow us to explore uncharted regimes of dense matter at finite temperatures produced in a subset of neutron star mergers, areas that remain entirely inaccessible to current instruments. Together with multimessenger observations, these measurements will significantly deepen our knowledge of dense nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>The final stages of binary evolution using multi-messenger studies</title>

Abstract: Ultracompact Galactic binaries with orbital periods below an hour are among the strongest persistent gravitational-wave (GW) sources in the mHz band and will constitute the dominant population detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Tens of thousands are predicted to be individually resolved, with a substantial fraction bright enough for electromagnetic (EM) follow-up. This opens an unprecedented multi-messenger window on compact binary evolution, tidal interactions, mass transfer, and the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. We highlight key science enabled by joint GW + EM constraints and emphasize the critical need for rapid, high-cadence spectroscopic capabilities in the 2040s. In particular, the most compact (&lt;10 min) binaries detected by LISA will require read-noise-free, zero-dead-time spectroscopic facilities, potentially realized through coordinated arrays of telescopes with time-staggered exposures, to measure radial velocities, tidal heating signatures, and orbital evolution with the precision needed for transformative multi-messenger studies.</description>

      <title>The supernova Ia progenitor problem in the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are fundamental to cosmology and galactic chemical evolution, yet the nature of their progenitor systems remains unresolved. Multiple evolutionary pathways, including single-degenerate, double-degenerate, and helium-donor systems, are thought to contribute to the SN Ia population, but direct observational constraints are limited. This uncertainty hampers our understanding of SN Ia diversity and introduces systematic uncertainties in their use as precision cosmological probes. By the 2040s, surveys such as Gaia, LSST, SDSS-V, 4MOST, and the gravitational-wave mission LISA will identify thousands of compact binaries in the Milky Way that are potential SN Ia progenitors. However, survey discoveries alone are insufficient. Robust identification and characterization require high-time-resolution, phase-resolved spectroscopy to determine fundamental parameters such as component masses, orbital inclinations, chemical compositions, and accretion states. Addressing these challenges demands new observational capabilities. The most compact binaries require continuous, dead-time-free spectroscopy with negligible readout noise, while the progenitor population spans a wide range of brightness and orbital periods. A modular, multi-aperture telescope array equipped with fast, low-noise spectrographs can flexibly combine collecting area for faint targets, observe bright systems efficiently, and deliver uninterrupted time series through staggered exposures. Such observations are difficult for single-aperture facilities.</description>

      <title>Hidden Companions of the Early Milky Way I. New alpha-Enhanced Exoplanet Hosts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planet formation in the chemically ancient, dynamically heated Galactic thick disc remains poorly constrained, owing to the expectation that its low solid reservoirs, short disc lifetimes, and harsh irradiation environments inhibit efficient assembly of planetary bodies. However, an increasing number of confirmed thick disc planet hosts now challenge this view, indicating that planetary formation and survival in the early Milky Way may have been more resilient -- and more diverse -- than standard disc-evolution models suggest. Here we present a homogeneous characterisation of 38 exoplanetary systems orbiting bona fide thick disc stars, combining new detections with a systematic reassessment of archival systems. High-precision radial velocities and space-based transit photometry, combined with uniform high-resolution spectroscopy, yield self-consistent stellar and planetary parameters, and thick disc membership is secured via joint chemical and kinematic criteria. Among these systems, we identify two remarkably low-density, inflated planets -- TOI-1927 b and TOI-2643 b -- representing the first puffy planets known to orbit thick disc stars, and an outcome that is highly unexpected in metal-poor environments, thereby challenging current models of atmospheric retention and thermal inflation at low metallicity. This consolidated sample establishes a new empirical baseline for understanding how planetary architectures emerge under the depleted, short-lived discs characteristic of the early Milky Way.</description>

      <title>The structure and evolution of a high-mass stellar merger in the Hertzsprung gap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Post-main-sequence binary mergers are a common evolutionary pathway for massive stars, but the effects of merging on the long-term structure and evolution of the resulting star are a matter of active debate. Furthermore, the way in which merger products are modeled in 1D is not uniform. We present the evolution of an 11 M$_\odot$ and 6.6 M$_\odot$ binary on an 11 day orbit, that merges while the primary is crossing the Hertzsprung gap. We construct the merger product either by rapidly accreting the secondary onto the surface of the primary or by injecting material from the secondary deeper into the primary via entropy sorting. We then evolve them to carbon ignition, comparing their interior structures at this stage. We find that all merger products experience an extended blue supergiant phase and have undermassive helium cores and low carbon mass fractions compared to single and stripped stars. However, the evolution of central density, temperature, and composition in the entropy-sorted model is distinct from those of the rapid-accretion models.</description>

      <title>The magnetic origin of the outer boundaries of sunspots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Sunspot boundaries are commonly outlined by contours of the continuum intensity. However, their magnetic nature has not yet been fully characterised.
  Aims. We investigate the properties of the outer boundary of a long-lived sunspot to identify the magnetic property that defines it.
  Methods. We analysed the magnetic properties of AR NOAA11591 spot during its two passages across the solar disc, using SDO/HMI continuum intensity and magnetic field, and determined their contours to outline the outer boundary.
  Results. During the 1st disc passage, in which the sunspot is in its stable phase, the intensity contours at 0.9 of the mean quiet Sun intensity and isocontours of the magnetic field strength of 625G provide an almost perfect match between the two contours. With these thresholds, the time-averaged area of mismatch is minimised, yielding an average distance between the contours of 0.58 pixel, corresponding to less than 0.26 arcsec. During the 2nd disc passage, the spot shows clear signs of decay, and we find that the 0.9 intensity and 625G magnetic isocontours detach from each other, coupled to the disappearance of penumbra. In this super-equipartition area, granulation still operates.
  Conclusions. Based on a comparison with simulation data from our previous work, and in agreement with findings of other authors, we conclude that the outer boundary of stable sunspots is defined by an invariant magnetic field: the equipartition field. From the discrepancy between intensity and magnetic contours during the decaying phase of the sunspot, we surmise that alongside the well-established (magneto-)convective regimes of the photosphere - granular, penumbral, and umbral - a super-equipartition granular regime can be identified. In this regime, bright, but smaller granules occur where the magnetic field exceeds equipartition but remains sub-critical for convection suppression.</description>

      <title>SpecCLIP: Aligning and Translating Spectroscopic Measurements for Stars</title>

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language understanding through vast datasets and large-scale parameterization. Inspired by this success, we present SpecCLIP, a foundation model framework that extends LLM-inspired methodologies to stellar spectral analysis. Stellar spectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical information about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral datasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support diverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves pre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed by contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different instruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve spectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between spectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information between embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework enabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We demonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets improves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and chemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data. Additionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities offer potential for anomaly detection. Our results suggest that contrastively trained foundation models enriched with spectrum-aware decoders can advance precision stellar spectroscopy. Our code SpecCLIP is publicly available at https://github.com/Xiaosheng-Zhao/SpecCLIP</description>

      <title>SN 2024cld: unveiling the complex mass-loss histories of evolved supergiant progenitors to core collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-explosion mass loss in supernova (SN) progenitors is a crucial unknown factor in stellar evolution, yet has been illuminated recently by the diverse zoo of interacting transients. We present SN2024cld, a transitional core-collapse SN at a distance of 39 Mpc, straddling the boundary between SN II and SN IIn, showing persistent interaction with circumstellar material (CSM) similar to H-rich SN1998S and PTF11iqb. The SN was discovered and classified just 12h post-explosion via the GOTO-FAST high-cadence program. Optical spectroscopy, photometry, and polarimetry over 220d chart the complex, long-lived interaction in this transient. Early evolution is dominated by CSM interaction, showing a 14d rise to a peak absolute magnitude of g=-17.6 mag, with clear flash-ionisation signatures. SN2024cld also shows a slowly-evolving late time light curve powered by CSM interaction, with high-velocity (6000 km/s) shoulders on a strong multi-component H-alpha profile. Dense polarimetric coverage reveals marked evolution in the photospheric geometry -- peaking at p=2% 10 days post-explosion, and rotating approx. 60 deg as the ejecta sweep more distant CSM. We observe a narrow 60 km/s H-alpha P Cygni feature throughout, associated with pre-shock CSM. SN2024cld represents among the best-observed 98S-like SNe to date, revealing a multi-component CSM structure: a dense, inner aspherical envelope, CSM disk/torus, and tenuous, extended wind. We propose this SN arose from an evolved supergiant progenitor experiencing multiple mass loss episodes in its terminal years, with binary interaction plausibly generating the CSM disk. SN2024cld constrains the progenitors and mass-loss paradigms of 98S-like SNe, unveiling the chaotic ends of evolved supergiant stars from afar.</description>
