      <title>Impact of super-Gaussian electron distributions on plasma K-shell emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron distributions in laser-produced plasmas will be driven toward a super-Gaussian distribution due to inverse bremsstrahlung absorption [Langdon, Phys. Rev. Lett. 44, 575 (1980)]. Both theoretical and experimental evidence suggest that fundamental plasma properties are altered by the super-Gaussian distribution. This paper examines how the super-Gaussian distribution affects the ionization balance and K-shell emission of atomic plasmas, utilizing approximate formulas and detailed collisional-radiative simulations. While the impact on plasma ionization is small, K-shell spectra can be significantly modified. Based on these findings, we demonstrate that K-shell spectroscopy can be used to infer super-Gaussian or other similar non-equilibrium electron distributions.</description>

      <title>Electron heating in bulk overdense plasma aided by time dependent external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the localized electron heating in a bulk overdense plasma. The method relies on using a time dependent magnetic field. An initially high external magnetic field imposed on the overdense plasma target enables the propagation of a laser pulse inside it through the pass bands that occur in the magnetized dispersion relation. The choice of decaying external magnetic field is then tailored appropriately to achieve Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) with the frequency of the laser electromagnetic field. At the resonance location, the field energy of the laser gets transferred to the electrons. These studies have been carried out with the help of the Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulation technique on the OSIRIS4.0 platform. A detailed study has been carried out to illustrate the energy gain by electrons for a variety of temporal profiles of the magnetic field, laser intensities, and polarizations. The experiments in this regime may be within reach in the near future. For instance, the choice of long-wavelength CO$_2$ laser requires a magnetic field of about 10s of kilo Tesla to comfortably elicit a magnetized response from electrons. Recent technological advancements have shown the generation of about 1.4 kilo Tesla of magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Boosting the NOx production in microwave air plasma: A synergy of chemistry and vibrational kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs a quasi-1.5D multi-temperature model to investigate the mechanisms governing NOx production and energy costs in microwave plasma reactors operating at 80 mbar, focusing on the interplay of vibrational, chemical and electron kinetics, thermodynamics, and transport processes across the discharge and afterglow. In the plasma discharge zone, non-thermal processes enhance NOx production as electrons transfer energy effectively to the vibrational mode of N2. However, the non-thermal enhancement is found to diminish rapidly within the central-afterglow region. The simulation results show good agreement with experimental data for both the temperature profile and energy cost. Turbulent effects facilitate radial NO diffusion into cooler regions while simultaneously enhancing cooling of the axial region. These findings highlight the potential to improve NOx synthesis efficiency by optimizing turbulence and maintaining non-thermal conditions, offering new opportunities for the advancement of plasma-based chemical processes.</description>

      <title>Langmuir Wave Excitation in Solar-wind Magnetic Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic holes are structures commonly observed in various space plasma environments throughout the solar system, including the solar wind. These structures are characterized by a localized decrease in magnetic field strength, coincident with an increase in plasma density. Previous observational studies in the solar wind link the presence of Langmuir waves to magnetic holes, suggesting a strong correlation between these phenomena. We develop a model based on magnetic-moment conservation and its violation to explain the excitation of Langmuir waves in magnetic holes. Our model illustrates that magnetic holes induce changes in the electron velocity distribution function that emit electrostatic Langmuir waves due to the bump-on-tail instability. Using data from the Solar Orbiter spacecraft, we provide a comprehensive analysis of this process and test our predictions with observations. The consistency between the model and observations indicates that our proposed process is a viable mechanism for producing Langmuir waves in magnetic holes in the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Public perspectives on the design of fusion energy facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As fusion energy technologies approach demonstration and commercial deployment, understanding public perspectives on future fusion facilities will be critical for achieving social license, especially because fusion energy facilities, unlike large fission reactors, may be sited in closer proximity to people and communities, due to distinct regulatory frameworks. In a departure from the 'decide-announce-defend' approach typically used to site energy infrastructure, we develop a participatory design methodology for collaboratively designing fusion energy facilities with prospective host communities. We present here our findings from a participatory design workshop that brought together 22 community participants and 34 engineering students. Our analysis of the textual and visual data from this workshop shows a range of design values and decision-making criteria with 'integrity' and 'respect' ranking highest among values and 'economic benefits' and 'environmental protection/safety' ranking highest among decision-making criteria. Salient design themes that emerge across facility concepts include connecting the history and legacy of the community to the design of the facility, care for workers, transparency and access to the facility, and health and safety of the host community. Participants reported predominantly positive sentiments, expressing joy and surprise as the workshop progressed from learning about fusion to designing the hypothetical facility. Our findings suggest that carrying out participatory design in the early stages of technology development can invite and make concrete public hopes and concerns, improve understanding of, and curiosity about, an emerging technology, build toward social license, and inform context-specific development of fusion energy facilities.</description>

      <title>MeV cosmic-ray electrons modify the TeV pair-beam plasma instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic pair beams created in the intergalactic medium (IGM) by TeV gamma rays from blazars are expected to produce a detectable GeV-scale electromagnetic cascade, but the cascade component is absent in the spectra of many hard-spectrum TeV-emitting blazars. One common explanation is that weak intergalactic magnetic fields deflect the electron-positron pairs away from our line of sight. An alternative possibility is that electrostatic beam-plasma instabilities drain the energy of these pairs before a cascade can develop. Recent studies have shown that beam scattering by oblique electrostatic modes leads to minimal energy loss. But these modes might be suppressed by linear Landau damping (LLD) due to MeV-scale cosmic-ray electrons in the IGM. In this work, we explore the impact of LLD on the energy-loss efficiency of plasma instabilities in pair beams associated with 1ES 0229+200. We find that LLD effectively suppresses oblique electrostatic modes, while quasi-parallel ones grow to larger amplitudes. In this way, LLD enhances the energy-loss efficiency of the instability by more than an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Optical effects in unmagnetized cold plasmas by a chiral axion factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unmagnetized cold plasma modes are investigated in the context of the chiral Maxwell-Carroll-Field-Jackiw (MCJF) electrodynamics, where the axion chiral factor acts retrieving some typical properties of magnetized plasmas. The Maxwell equations are rewritten for a cold, uniform, and collisionless fluid plasma model, allowing us to determine the dispersion relation, new refractive indices, and propagating modes. We find four distinct refractive indices modified by the purely timelike CFJ background that plays the magnetic conductivity chiral parameter role associated with right-circularly polarized (RCP) and left-circularly polarized (LCP) waves. For each refractive index, the propagation and absorption zones are determined and illustrated for some specific parameter values. Modified RCP and LCP helicons are found in the low-frequency regime. The optical behavior is investigated, revealing that the chiral factor induces birefringence, measured in terms of the rotatory power (RP). The dichroism coefficient is carried out for the absorbing zones. The negative refraction zones may enhance the involved rotatory power, yielding RP sign reversion, a feature of rotating plasmas and MCFJ chiral plasmas. Charge density oscillations and Langmuir waves are also discussed, revealing no modified dispersion relation due to the chiral axion factor.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic field solver for QED polarization in super-strong magnetic fields of magnetar and laser plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Super-strongly magnetized plasmas play a crucial role in extreme environments of magnetar and laboratory laser experiments, demanding comprehensive understanding of how quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects influence plasma behaviour. Earlier analytical and semi-analytical calculations have shown that QED effects can significantly modify the plasma polarization mode behaviour around magnetars using analytical and semi-analytical calculations. In this work, we present the first electromagnetic field solver that is valid beyond the Schwinger limit. QED vacuum polarization in super-strong magnetic fields are modeled with nonlinear Maxwell equations. We show that electromagnetic waves in simulations follow the analytical solutions well and reproduce the birefringence effects of electromagnetic wave modes between the $O$ and $X$ polarizations of perpendicular electromagnetic waves and those between $L$ and $R$ polarizations of parallel waves. This new framework can be applied to kinetic as well as in other types of computer simulations. The solver's key advantage lies in its versatility, allowing it to be used in gyro-motion, gyro-center, and gyro-kinetic simulations, which do not resolve the cyclotron motion, or in plasma studies with ground-level Landau quantization.</description>

      <title>Fast solvers for Tokamak fluid models with PETSC -- Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work begins the development of fast, scalable solvers for scientific and engineering-relevant magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) models of tokamaks using multigrid methods. These tokamak models are characterized by a distinguished direction in the toroidal coordinate that is partially aligned with the magnetic guide field, which dominates the plasma dynamics. All tokamak models exploit this structure, for example, NIMROD at https://nimrodteam.org uses $2D$, unstructured, high-order finite elements in the poloidal plane with Fourier modes in the toroidal coordinate, and the $3D$, extended MHD code \textit{M3D-C1}\footnote{https://m3dc1.pppl.gov} uses $2D$, unstructured $C^1$ elements in the poloidal plane with cubic Hermite functions in the toroidal direction. This structure suggests addressing the toroidal coordinate first, which \textit{NIMROD} does at the formulation level, but the \textit{M3D-C1} approach leaves in the algebraic system to be solved at each time step in an implicit time integrator. This work addressed the toroidal coordinate in the \textit{M3D-C1} velocity solve by adding semi-coarsening multigrid to the existing PETSC at https://petsc.org -- Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation -- block Jacobi solver, with the addition of little new code that allows for smaller Jacobi subdomains that are better suited to contemporary, highly parallel, hardware. Competitive performance of this new solver configuration is demonstrated on a self-consistent runaway electron model of a SPARC at https://cfs.energy/technology/sparc disruption, and the next steps in the development of this new approach are outlined.</description>

      <title>Structure and dynamics of finite three-dimensional Yukawa clusters in complex plasmas : Newtonian versus Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structure and dynamics of a harmonically confined three dimensional finite dust cluster are investigated via both Langevin Dynamics (LD) and frictionless Molecular Dynamics (fMD) simulation. The static structure of the system is analyzed through the Radial Distribution Function, Center-two-particle correlation function(C2P) and angular correlation function. The intra-shell angular correlation, Radial Distribution Function and C2P remains largely unaffected by the dynamics employed. However, the inter-shell angular correlation exhibits sharp peaks at irregular angular intervals in fMD which are not seen in LD indicating strongly correlated motion of the two spherical shells in the cluster in fMD. The single particle dynamics of the cluster is characterized by the Van - Hove self autocorrelation function and Mean Squared Displacement (MSD). Notably, the Van - Hove autocorrelation function in fMD simulations exhibits narrower width and higher peak height as compared to the LD simulations, suggesting greater particle mobility in LD. Trajectory analysis reveals a rotational motion of the particles about a common axis in fMD which disappears with progressively increasing friction coefficient. We show that the disappearance of rotational motion with the introduction of neutral friction in the dynamics is due to the much faster relaxation of the interparticle distance as well as interparticle angular separation in LD as compared to fMD.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a plasma wakefield acceleration scheme capable of boosting initially subrelativistic particles to relativistic velocities within millimeter-scale distances. A subluminal light pulse drives a wake whose velocity is continuously matched to the beam speed through a tailored plasma density, thereby extending the dephasing length. We develop a theoretical model that is generalizable across particle mass, initial velocity, and the particular accelerating bucket being used, and we verify its accuracy with particle-in-cell simulations using laser drivers with energies in the Joule range.</description>
