      <title>On the accessibility of stable reactor operating regimes in quasi-symmetric stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximising particle and energy confinement is crucial for achieving the sustained burning plasma conditions necessary to realise fusion energy. For stellarator reactors, one proposed strategy for avoiding destructive instabilities is to operate at high-field but low(er) plasma pressure. In this work, we investigate the accessibility of such a reactor-relevant low-beta regime in a reactor-scale quasi-axisymmetric stellarator using state-of-the-art high-fidelity macro- and microscopic simulation tools. We consider a configuration with a flattened core pressure profile and favourable properties from the macroscopic and neoclassical perspectives. By contrast, linear and nonlinear calculations with the GENE code show an abrupt transition to a regime of highly deleterious transport at low (local) plasma beta. We describe the characterisation of these transport regimes as well as the confinement transition. We discuss the implications broadly for stellarator optimisation and highlight the impact on quasi-symmetric stellarator design strategies.</description>

      <title>Impact of fast ions on turbulent transport in high-\b{eta} HL-2A scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fast-ion (FI) on turbulent transport is one of the key topics of magnetic confinement fusion. This work focus on the impact of FI pressure gradients on turbulence in a high-\b{eta} plasma scenario using gyrokinetic simulations. Linear analyses reveal that FIs strongly stabilize ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes via the thermal-ion dilution, while their influence on trapped electron modes (TEMs) is minimal. At elevated FI pressure gradients, a transition to a FI-driven BAE (FI-BAE) regime occurs, as evidenced by mode structure and frequency alignment within the Alfv\'enic gap. Electron \b{eta} scans further demonstrate the emergence of kinetic ballooning modes (KBMs) at higher \b{eta}, whereas an ITG-TEM hybrid turbulence dominates near experimental \b{eta} values. Nonlinear simulations show that moderate FI pressure suppresses transport via zonal flow (ZF) shear, whereas strong FI drive weakens ZFs and enhances transport by destabilizing FI-BAEs. These results highlight the dual role of FIs in regulating turbulence and offer insight into multiscale transport physics relevant for high-performance plasmas.</description>

      <title>Treatment of sunflower seeds by cold atmospheric plasma enhances their tolerance to water stress during germination and early seedling development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of ambient air plasma treatment on both sunflower seed germination and early steps of seedling development under water stress. Dry seeds were exposed to a cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) generated in a dielectric barrier device where excited molecular nitrogen and ozone were detected by optical emission spectroscopy and mass spectrometry respectively. Interestingly, we explain the crucial role of gap's accuracy when treating seeds with CAP, especially to improve interaction between seeds and plasma and therefore ensure an efficient treatment. CAP significantly improved the germination rates of seeds of dormant and non-dormant sunflower genotypes under water stress, demonstrating its efficiency in alleviating seed dormancy and in improving germination under suboptimal conditions. Furthermore, greenhouse experiments demonstrated that plasma treatment also stimulated seedling development under water stress conditions. These findings highlight the potential of CAP treatment as an effective approach to promote the whole process of emergence of crop species.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically Consistent Vibrational-Electron Heating: Generalized Model for Multi-Quantum Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of electron temperature ($T_{\rm e}$) is critical for non-equilibrium plasma applications ranging from hypersonic flight to plasma-assisted combustion. We recently proposed a thermodynamically consistent model for vibrational-electron heating [Phys. Fluids 37, 096141 (2025)] that enforces the convergence of $T_{\rm e}$ to the vibrational temperature ($T_{\rm v}$) at equilibrium. However, the original derivation was restricted to single-quantum transitions, limiting its validity to low-temperature regimes ($T_{\rm e} \lesssim 1.5$ eV). In this Letter, we generalize the model to include multi-quantum overtone transitions, extending its applicability to high-energy regimes. We demonstrate that previous models neglecting hot-band transitions incur a systematic heating error of $\exp(-\theta_{\rm v}/T_{\rm v})$, where $\theta_{\rm v}$ is the characteristic vibrational temperature. This error exceeds 40\% when $T_{\rm v}$ is greater than $\theta_{\rm v}$, effectively preventing thermal relaxation. To correct this, we derive a formulation where the total heating rate is a summation of channel-specific cooling rates $Q_{\rm e-v}^{(m)}$, each associated with a quantum jump $m$, scaled by a thermodynamic factor $\exp(m\theta_{\rm v}/T_{\rm e}-m\theta_{\rm v}/T_{\rm v})$. This generalized model preserves thermodynamic consistency by ensuring zero net energy transfer at equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Breaking seed dormancy in Mediterranean Brassica rapa wild populations: is cold plasma treatment efficient?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turnip (Brassica rapa) is a native species of the Mediterranean area, spread from northwest France to south Algeria. In this study, dormancy and germination traits were assessed for 61 wild Brassica rapa populations collected across the Mediterranean region. Seed dormancy is a key factor influencing germination and seedling establishment. Three dormancy-breaking methods were compared: gibberellic acid, scarification and cold plasma. The efficiency and selectivity were evaluated through germination ability, time to 10% germination (T10), mean germination time and greenhouse emergence. Five days after imbibition, germination was only 18% for the untreated seeds but 60% for the plasma-treated seeds. Germination also began 24 hours earlier and mean germination time was reduced across most populations. However, there was a limited effect on seedling emergence, which remained around 55% for both untreated and treated samples. Comparative analysis indicates that cold plasma was more effective in alleviating embryo dormancy. In addition, histological and scanning electron microscopy showed that the seed coat differed according to the geographical origin of the populations, with a deeper dormancy in seeds from Sicilian populations.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric magnetic field effects on hollow cathode generated plasma column in APPEL-device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An elongated plasma column has been successfully generated and sustained in a linear plasma device using a hollow cathode discharge in the presence of an axisymmetric magnetic field. The confinement of cold energetic electrons produced near the hollow cathode plays a crucial role in guiding the plasma along the device axis. Experimental diagnostics reveal a high concentration of energetic electrons in the peripheral region near the source, which progressively converge toward the axis at a downstream location approximately 3.0 meters from the cathode. The length of the plasma column exhibits an inverse relationship with the electron-neutral collision frequency, indicating the significance of collisional damping in the propagation of energetic electrons. These observations are further supported by fluid simulations performed using COMSOL Multiphysics, which qualitatively reproduce the experimental trends. The results are consistent with a theoretical model previously proposed by the authors, reinforcing the understanding of energetic electron behaviour in magnetically guided plasma columns.</description>

      <title>Ab initio recombination in the expanding ultracold plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficiency of recombination is of crucial importance for the existence of ultracold plasmas, particularly, the ones formed in the magneto-optical traps. Unfortunately, a straightforward simulation of the recombination encounters the problem of huge difference in the spatial and temporal scales for free and bound motion of the electrons. As a result, only the "virtual" electron-ion pairs are usually reproduced in such simulations, and it is necessary to employ some additional criteria to identify them with the recombined atoms (this might be a minimal number of revolutions of the electron about the nearest ion or a maximal distance between them). It is the aim of this paper to present the first successful ab initio simulation of the recombination without any auxiliary assumptions. We employed a special algorithm, which was based on: (i) using the "scalable" reference frame, co-moving with the expanding plasma, (ii) dynamical choice of the number of "mirror" cells, taking into account in calculation of the Coulomb sums, and (iii) accurate treatment of the singular interparticle interactions, without any truncation or "softening" of the Coulomb forces. Then, the recombination events are identified by a series of sharp equidistant peaks in the kinetic and/or potential energies for a sample of particles, which are caused by the captured electrons passing near the pericenters of their orbits; and this is confirmed by a detailed inspection of the particle trajectories. Thereby, we were able to trace formation of the real - rather than "virtual" - electron-ion pairs. The total efficiency of recombination for the realistic experimental conditions was found to be about 20%, which is in perfect agreement both with the laboratory measurements and with the earlier semi-empirical simulations.</description>

      <title>Predicting core transport in ITER baseline discharges with neon injections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving self-consistent performance predictions for ITER requires integrated modeling of core transport and divertor power exhaust under realistic impurity conditions. We present results from the first systematic power-flow and impurity-content study for the ITER 15 MA baseline scenario constrained directly by existing SOLPS-ITER neon-seeded divertor solutions. Using the OMFIT STEP workflow, stationary temperature and density profiles are predicted with TGYRO for $1.5 \le Z_{\rm eff} \le 2.5$, and the corresponding power crossing the separatrix $P_{\rm sep}$ is evaluated. We find that $P_{\rm sep}$ varies by more than a factor of 1.7 across this scan and matches the $\sim 100$~MW SOLPS-ITER prediction when $Z_{\rm eff} \simeq 1.6$ or when auxiliary heating is reduced to $\sim 75\%$ of nominal. Rotation-sensitivity studies show that plausible variations in toroidal flow magnitude modify $P_{\rm sep}$ by $\lesssim 20\%$, while AURORA modeling confirms that charge-exchange radiation inside the separatrix is dynamically negligible under predicted ITER neutral densities. These results identify a restricted compatibility window, $Z_{\rm eff} \approx 1.6$--1.75 and $0.75 \lesssim f_{P_{\rm aux}} \le 1.0$, in which core transport predictions remain aligned with neon-seeded divertor protection targets. This self-consistent, model-constrained framework provides actionable guidance for impurity control and auxiliary-heating scheduling in early ITER operation and supports future whole-device scenario optimization.</description>

      <title>Electrode Geometry Optimization in Vortex-Type Seawater Magnetohydrodynamic Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) generators present a promising pathway for clean energy conversion by directly transforming conductive fluids' kinetic energy into electricity. This study investigates the impact of electrode geometry modifications on the performance of a vortex-type seawater MHD generator. Three electrode designs, partial, whole-area, and spiral, are analyzed through combined analytical and numerical simulations using COMSOL Multiphysics. The study focuses on internal resistance reduction, current density distribution, and overall power output. The results indicate that electrode area and spacing are critical determinants of performance. The whole-area electrode achieves the highest output, with a 155 percent increase in power compared to the baseline partial electrode. The spiral electrode demonstrates reduced internal resistance and improved current flow but exhibits lower open-circuit voltage due to reduced electrode spacing. The simulations show strong agreement with theoretical models, with deviations of less than 4 percent in open-circuit voltage predictions. These findings highlight the importance of geometric optimization for advancing seawater-based MHD generators as sustainable and efficient energy conversion systems.</description>

      <title>Spatial, Spectral and Temporal Response of High Intensity Laser Plasma Mirrors- Direct Observation of the Ponderomotive Push</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasma-based optics have emerged as a powerful platform for manipulating and amplifying ultra-intense laser pulses. However, the inherently nonlinear and dynamic nature of plasma leads to significant spatial, spectral, and temporal modulations when driven at relativistic intensities. These modifications can dramatically alter the structure of the reflected laser pulses, posing challenges for their use in applications such as vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) and X-ray generation, as well as relativistic particle acceleration. Comprehensive, multidimensional diagnostics are essential to accurately characterize these so-called `plasma mirrors' (PMs). We present a direct, \textit{in situ} measurement of the three-dimensional plasma surface evolution during femtosecond laser irradiation, achieved through simultaneous analysis of the wavefront, spectrum, and temporal profile of the reflected light. Our measurements reveal surface deformations on the order of a few hundred nanometers at relativistic intensities, in agreement with three-dimensional particle-in-cell (3D-PIC) simulations. Additionally, the PM induces substantial modifications to the pulse spectrum and temporal profile, introducing spatio-temporal couplings.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Velocity-Space Signature of Ion Cyclotron Damping Using Liouville Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ion cyclotron damping is a key mechanism for the dissipation of electromagnetic wave energy in weakly collisional plasmas. This study presents a combined approach using Liouville mapping and the field-particle correlation technique to investigate qualitatively and quantitatively the velocity-space signature of ion cyclotron damping. Liouville mapping offers a computationally efficient way to predict perturbations to the particle velocity distribution function using single-particle trajectories in prescribed electromagnetic fields. One may apply the field-particle correlation technique to these perturbed velocity distributions to reveal the unique velocity-space signatures of the secular energy transfer rate associated with specific wave-particle interactions. We validate this method by reproducing known Landau damping signatures for kinetic Alfv\'en waves, and then we apply this method to ion cyclotron waves where ion cyclotron damping dominates. The resulting velocity-space signature reveals distinct energization features of ion cyclotron damping : (i) a quadrupolar pattern in the perpendicular $(v_x, v_y)$ plane; and (ii) a localized energization near the $n = 1$ resonant velocity in gyrotropic $(v_\parallel, v_\perp)$ velocity-space. The quantitative patterns remain unchanged as the ion plasma beta $\beta_i$ is varied, ultimately showing minimal $v_\perp$ dependence on $\beta_i$ of the velocity-space signature at the $n = 1$ resonant velocity. This work provides a systematic study of how the ion cyclotron damping signature varies with $\beta_i$, offering a practical foundation to identify ion cyclotron damping using kinetic simulation data or spacecraft data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14400v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When electron inertia is the only non-ideal effect in the evolution of a magnetic field $\vec{B}$, the field lines of $\vec{B}$ reconnect, but the lines of a related field $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ do not. $\vec{\mathcal{B}} \equiv \vec{B} + \vec{\nabla}\times \left( (c/\omega_{pe})^2\mu_0\vec{j} \right)$ with $\omega_{pe}$ the plasma frequency and $\vec{j}$ the current density. Although a full four-dimensional relativistic calculation of $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ has been made, studies of $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ have been focused on systems that depend on only two spatial coordinates. Three results are given: (1) A relatively simple demonstration in three dimensional space that the lines of $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ do not reconnect when electron inertia is the only non-ideal effect. (2) The guiding center motion of charged particles is modified by a term that is proportional to $(c/\omega_{pe})^2$, which is smaller than the drifts proportional to the gyroradius unless the current density is extremely large. (3) In three dimensional space, the evolution velocity of $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ is characteristically chaotic, which means neighboring streamlines separate exponentially on a timescale $\tau_u$. $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ undergoes large scale reconnection on a timescale that is only an order of magnitude or two longer than $\tau_u$ unless all diffusive non-ideal effects, such as resistivity, are absolutely zero.</description>

      <title>Synchronized Catastrophic Collapse and Extreme Intensity Amplification of Ultra-Intense Pulses in Near-Resonance Magnetized Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-high field intensities are essential for developing high-energy-density physics and compact plasma accelerators, but they are essentially constrained by the limitations of focusing distance and nonlinear efficiency. We present a theoretical model for extreme laser energy concentration in under-dense plasma that shows a highly effective, magnetically supported pathway. We demonstrate a fundamental, nonlinear enhancement of the relativistic self-focusing (RSF) mechanism by adjusting an external magnetic field close to the cyclotron resonance (Ce=0.7). Over a remarkably short distance of 1.25 Rayleigh lengths, the pulse is driven into a catastrophic, coupled collapse by this magnetic enhancement. Significant temporal self-compression (0.60) and simultaneous spatial confinement (0.05) are the outcomes of the dynamics. Importantly, this combined confinement results in a localized peak intensity amplification factor greater than 103 compared to the initial state. This work offers a clear, practical blueprint for upcoming laser-plasma experiments and validates a reliable and compact technique for producing petawatt-scale power densities.</description>

      <title>Charge transport and mode transition in dual-energy electron beam diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11290</link>

Abstract: This Letter uncovers five distinct charge transport modes and their transitions in dual-energy electron beam diodes. We via first-principle particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations establish that the specific mode (e.g., space charge oscillations) and the current transport characteristics are essentially governed by the interplay between the electron beam energy and injected current density. A generalized analysis is conducted for n-component electron beams, and a theoretical piecewise function is for the transmitted current density proposed, which agrees well with the PIC results under designed conditions. The discovery provides a mechanistic picture of multiple electron beam transport in diodes, paving the way for novel designs of high-performance modern vacuum electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Assessing the economic benefits of space weather mitigation investment decisions: Evidence from Aotearoa New Zealand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Space weather events pose a growing threat to modern economies, yet their macroeconomic consequences still remain underexplored. This study presents the first dedicated economic assessment of geomagnetic storm impacts on Aotearoa New Zealand, quantifying potential gross domestic product (GDP) losses across seven conservative disruption and mitigation scenarios due to an extreme coronal mass ejection (CME). The primary focus is upon the damaging impacts of geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) on the electrical power transmission network. We support space weather mitigation investments decisions by providing a first-order approximation of their potential economic benefits, using best-in-class scientific models. In the absence of mitigation, a severe but realistic storm could result in up to NZ\$8.36 billion in lost GDP, with more than half stemming from cascading supply chain effects. Yet, even less severe scenarios incur losses exceeding NZ\$3 billion. Importantly, even with conservative impact estimates we find that research-led operational strategies, such as optimized switching and islanding, can avoid up to NZ\$370 million in losses for as little as NZ\$0.5 million in expenditure, delivering a benefit-cost ratio of 740 to 1. Equally, physical protections such as GIC blocking devices achieve benefit-cost returns up to 80 to 1, highlighting the strong case for investment in space weather mitigation. When also acknowledging additional unmodelled impacts, including multi-billion losses in capital equipment and long-term revenue, the economic rationale for pre-emptive mitigation becomes even more pertinent. Future research needs to integrate the modelling of capital and revenue losses for strategically important industrial facilities.</description>
