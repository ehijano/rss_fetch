      <title>Improving BLE Based Localization Accuracy Using Proximity Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bluetooth Low Energy systems are one of the most popular solutions used for indoor localization. Unfortunately their accuracy might not be sufficient for some of the applications. One way to reduce localization errors is hybrid positioning, which combines measurement results obtained with different techniques. The paper describes a concept of a hybrid localization system in which Bluetooth Low Energy technology is supported with the use of laser proximity sensors. Results from both system parts are fused using a novel, simple positioning algorithm. The proposed system concept was tested using BLE and proximity sensors evaluation boards.</description>

      <title>First path component power based NLOS mitigation in UWB positioning system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper describes an NLOS (Non-Line-of-Sight) mitigation method intended for use in a UWB positioning system. In the proposed method propagation conditions between the localized objects and the anchors forming system infrastructure are classified into one of three categories: LOS (Line-of-Sight), NLOS and severe NLOS. Non-Line-of-Sight detection is conducted based on first path signal component power measurements. For each of the categories, average NLOS inducted time of arrival bias and bias standard deviation have been estimated based on results gathered during a measurement campaign conducted in a fully furnished apartment. To locate a tag, an EKF (Extended Kalman Filter) based algorithm is used. The proposed method of NLOS mitigation consists in correcting measurement results obtained in NLOS conditions and lowering their significance in a tag position estimation process. The paper includes the description of the method and the results of the conducted experiments.</description>

      <title>Dual-Frequency Radar Wave-Inversion for Sub-Surface Material Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moisture estimation of sub-surface soil and the overlaying biomass layer is pivotal in precision agriculture and wildfire risk assessment. However, the characterization of layered material is nontrivial due to the radar penetration-resolution tradeoff. Here, a waveform inversion-based method was proposed for predicting the dielectric permittivity (as a moisture proxy) of the bottom soil layer and the top biomass layer from radar signals. Specifically, the use of a combination of a higher and a lower frequency radar compared to a single frequency in predicting the permittivity of both the soil and the overlaying layer was investigated in this study. The results show that each layer was best characterized via one of the frequencies. However, for the simultaneous prediction of both layers permittivity, the most consistent results were achieved by inversion of data from a combination of both frequencies, showing better correlation with in situ permittivity and reduced prediction errors.</description>

      <title>Fractional Delay Alignment Modulation for Spatially Sparse Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delay alignment modulation (DAM) is a novel transmission technique for wireless systems with high spatial resolution by leveraging delay compensation and path-based beamforming, to mitigate the inter-symbol interference (ISI) without resorting to complex channel equalization or multi-carrier transmission. However, most existing studies on DAM consider a simplified scenario by assuming that the channel multi-path delays are integer multiples of the signal sampling interval. This paper investigates DAM for the more general and practical scenarios with fractional multi-path delays. We first analyze the impact of fractional multi-path delays on the existing DAM design, termed integer DAM (iDAM), which can only achieve delay compensations that are integer multiples of the sampling interval. It is revealed that the existence of fractional multi-path delays renders iDAM no longer possible to achieve perfect delay alignment. To address this issue, we propose a more generic DAM design called fractional DAM (fDAM), which achieves fractional delay pre-compensation via upsampling and fractional delay filtering. By leveraging the Farrow filter structure, the proposed approach can eliminate ISI without real-time computation of filter coefficients, as typically required in traditional channel equalization techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed fDAM outperforms the existing iDAM and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in terms of symbol error rate (SER) and spectral efficiency, while maintaining a comparable peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) as iDAM, which is considerably lower than OFDM.</description>

      <title>A new framework of sensor selection for developing a fault detection system based on data-envelopment analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several methods have been proposed to identify which sensor sets are optimal for finding and localizing faults under different conditions for mechanical equipment. In order to preserve acceptable performance while minimizing costs, it is crucial to identify the most effective set of sensors available. Nevertheless, some sensor sets can behave differently in fault detection because of uncertainty in the measurement data contaminated by noise interference. This paper develops new sensor selection models using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), which has proven helpful as a management approach for determining an optimal number of sensors, associated costs, and sensor performance in the fault diagnosis. We propose four linear optimization models for sensor selection to design the fault detection system. The validity of the presented models is demonstrated using a vibration dataset collected from a gearbox. Based on the case study results, the proposed methods are effectively superior to the other comparison sensor selection methods in fault detection accuracy.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Bellman Mappings for Reinforcement Learning: Application to Robust Adaptive Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper designs novel nonparametric Bellman mappings in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) for reinforcement learning (RL). The proposed mappings benefit from the rich approximating properties of RKHSs, adopt no assumptions on the statistics of the data owing to their nonparametric nature, require no knowledge on transition probabilities of Markov decision processes, and may operate without any training data. Moreover, they allow for sampling on-the-fly via the design of trajectory samples, re-use past test data via experience replay, effect dimensionality reduction by random Fourier features, and enable computationally lightweight operations to fit into efficient online or time-adaptive learning. The paper offers also a variational framework to design the free parameters of the proposed Bellman mappings, and shows that appropriate choices of those parameters yield several popular Bellman-mapping designs. As an application, the proposed mappings are employed to offer a novel solution to the problem of countering outliers in adaptive filtering. More specifically, with no prior information on the statistics of the outliers and no training data, a policy-iteration algorithm is introduced to select online, per time instance, the ``optimal'' coefficient p in the least-mean-p-power-error method. Numerical tests on synthetic data showcase, in most of the cases, the superior performance of the proposed solution over several RL and non-RL schemes.</description>

      <title>Evolving Semantic Communication with Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, learning-based semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a promising approach in the upcoming 6G network and researchers have made remarkable efforts in this field. However, existing works have yet to fully explore the advantages of the evolving nature of learning-based systems, where knowledge accumulates during transmission have the potential to enhance system performance. In this paper, we explore an evolving semantic communication system for image transmission, referred to as ESemCom, with the capability to continuously enhance transmission efficiency. The system features a novel channel-aware semantic encoder that utilizes a pre-trained Semantic StyleGAN to extract the channel-correlated latent variables consisting of serval semantic vectors from the input images, which can be directly transmitted over a noisy channel without further channel coding. Moreover, we introduce a semantic caching mechanism that dynamically stores the transmitted semantic vectors in the local caching memory of both the transmitter and receiver. The cached semantic vectors are then exploited to eliminate the need to transmit similar codes in subsequent transmission, thus further reducing communication overhead. Simulation results highlight the evolving performance of the proposed system in terms of transmission efficiency, achieving superior perceptual quality with an average bandwidth compression ratio (BCR) of 1/192 for a sequence of 100 testing images compared to DeepJSCC and Inverse JSCC with the same BCR.

      <title>Monitoring Wandering Behavior of Persons Suffering from Dementia Using BLE Based Localization System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the aging of our populations, dementia will become a problem which would directly or indirectly affect a large number of people. One of the most dangerous dementia symptoms is wandering. It consists in aimless walking and spatial disorientation, which might lead to various unpleasant situations like falling down accidents at home to leaving the living place and going missing. Therefore, in order to ensure elderly people's safety it is crucial to detect and alarm the caregivers in case of such incidents. It can be done by tracking the sufferers movements and detecting signs of repetitiveness. The paper presents the results of the study, in which the wandering behavior of people suffering from dementia was monitored using a Bluetooth Low Energy based positioning system. The paper includes the description of the system used for patients localization and the results of the tests performed in a long term care facility.</description>

      <title>Integrated Communication, Localization, and Sensing in 6G D-MIMO Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future generations of mobile networks call for concurrent sensing and communication functionalities in the same hardware and/or spectrum. Compared to communication, sensing services often suffer from limited coverage, due to the high path loss of the reflected signal and the increased infrastructure requirements. To provide a more uniform quality of service, distributed multiple input multiple output (D-MIMO) systems deploy a large number of distributed nodes and efficiently control them, making distributed integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) possible. In this paper, we investigate ISAC in D-MIMO through the lens of different design architectures and deployments, revealing both conflicts and synergies. In addition, simulation and demonstration results reveal both opportunities and challenges towards the implementation of ISAC in D-MIMO.</description>

      <title>Gegenbauer Graph Neural Networks for Time-varying Signal Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing time-varying graph signals (or graph time-series imputation) is a critical problem in machine learning and signal processing with broad applications, ranging from missing data imputation in sensor networks to time-series forecasting. Accurately capturing the spatio-temporal information inherent in these signals is crucial for effectively addressing these tasks. However, existing approaches relying on smoothness assumptions of temporal differences and simple convex optimization techniques have inherent limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that incorporates a learning module to enhance the accuracy of the downstream task. To this end, we introduce the Gegenbauer-based graph convolutional (GegenConv) operator, which is a generalization of the conventional Chebyshev graph convolution by leveraging the theory of Gegenbauer polynomials. By deviating from traditional convex problems, we expand the complexity of the model and offer a more accurate solution for recovering time-varying graph signals. Building upon GegenConv, we design the Gegenbauer-based time Graph Neural Network (GegenGNN) architecture, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure. Likewise, our approach also utilizes a dedicated loss function that incorporates a mean squared error component alongside Sobolev smoothness regularization. This combination enables GegenGNN to capture both the fidelity to ground truth and the underlying smoothness properties of the signals, enhancing the reconstruction performance. We conduct extensive experiments on real datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate that GegenGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its superior capability in recovering time-varying graph signals.</description>

      <title>Biased Over-the-Air Federated Learning under Wireless Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Over-the-Air (OTA) computation has emerged as a promising federated learning (FL) paradigm that leverages the waveform superposition properties of the wireless channel to realize fast model updates. Prior work focused on the OTA device ``pre-scaler" design under \emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions, in which devices experience the same average path loss, resulting in zero-bias solutions. Yet, zero-bias designs are limited by the device with the worst average path loss and hence may perform poorly in \emph{heterogeneous} wireless settings. In this scenario, there may be a benefit in designing \emph{biased} solutions, in exchange for a lower variance in the model updates. To optimize this trade-off, we study the design of OTA device pre-scalers by focusing on the OTA-FL convergence. We derive an upper bound on the model ``optimality error", which explicitly captures the effect of bias and variance in terms of the choice of the pre-scalers. Based on this bound, we identify two solutions of interest: minimum noise variance, and minimum noise variance zero-bias solutions. Numerical evaluations show that using OTA device pre-scalers that minimize the variance of FL updates, while allowing a small bias, can provide high gains over existing schemes.</description>

      <title>TDANet: A Novel Temporal Denoise Convolutional Neural Network With Attention for Fault Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fault diagnosis plays a crucial role in maintaining the operational integrity of mechanical systems, preventing significant losses due to unexpected failures. As intelligent manufacturing and data-driven approaches evolve, Deep Learning (DL) has emerged as a pivotal technique in fault diagnosis research, recognized for its ability to autonomously extract complex features. However, the practical application of current fault diagnosis methods is challenged by the complexity of industrial environments. This paper proposed the Temporal Denoise Convolutional Neural Network With Attention (TDANet), designed to improve fault diagnosis performance in noise environments. This model transforms one-dimensional signals into two-dimensional tensors based on their periodic properties, employing multi-scale 2D convolution kernels to extract signal information both within and across periods. This method enables effective identification of signal characteristics that vary over multiple time scales. The TDANet incorporates a Temporal Variable Denoise (TVD) module with residual connections and a Multi-head Attention Fusion (MAF) module, enhancing the saliency of information within noisy data and maintaining effective fault diagnosis performance. Evaluation on two datasets, CWRU (single sensor) and Real aircraft sensor fault (multiple sensors), demonstrates that the TDANet model significantly outperforms existing deep learning approaches in terms of diagnostic accuracy under noisy environments.</description>

      <title>3D-Speaker-Toolkit: An Open Source Toolkit for Multi-modal Speaker Verification and Diarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces 3D-Speaker-Toolkit, an open source toolkit for multi-modal speaker verification and diarization. It is designed for the needs of academic researchers and industrial practitioners. The 3D-Speaker-Toolkit adeptly leverages the combined strengths of acoustic, semantic, and visual data, seamlessly fusing these modalities to offer robust speaker recognition capabilities. The acoustic module extracts speaker embeddings from acoustic features, employing both fully-supervised and self-supervised learning approaches. The semantic module leverages advanced language models to apprehend the substance and context of spoken language, thereby augmenting the system's proficiency in distinguishing speakers through linguistic patterns. Finally, the visual module applies image processing technologies to scrutinize facial features, which bolsters the precision of speaker diarization in multi-speaker environments. Collectively, these modules empower the 3D-Speaker-Toolkit to attain elevated levels of accuracy and dependability in executing speaker-related tasks, establishing a new benchmark in multi-modal speaker analysis. The 3D-Speaker project also includes a handful of open-sourced state-of-the-art models and a large dataset containing over 10,000 speakers. The toolkit is publicly available at https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/3D-Speaker.</description>

      <title>DeepHeteroIoT: Deep Local and Global Learning over Heterogeneous IoT Sensor Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data or readings evince variations in timestamp range, sampling frequency, geographical location, unit of measurement, etc. Such presented sequence data heterogeneity makes it difficult for traditional time series classification algorithms to perform well. Therefore, addressing the heterogeneity challenge demands learning not only the sub-patterns (local features) but also the overall pattern (global feature). To address the challenge of classifying heterogeneous IoT sensor data (e.g., categorizing sensor data types like temperature and humidity), we propose a novel deep learning model that incorporates both Convolutional Neural Network and Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit to learn local and global features respectively, in an end-to-end manner. Through rigorous experimentation on heterogeneous IoT sensor datasets, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed model, which outperforms recent state-of-the-art classification methods as well as several machine learning and deep learning baselines. In particular, the model achieves an average absolute improvement of 3.37% in Accuracy and 2.85% in F1-Score across datasets</description>

      <title>Secure Full-Duplex Communication via Movable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates physical layer security (PLS) for a movable antenna (MA)-assisted full-duplex (FD) system. In this system, an FD base station (BS) with multiple MAs for transmission and reception provides services for an uplink (UL) user and a downlink (DL) user. Each user operates in half-duplex (HD) mode and is equipped with a single fixed-position antenna (FPA), in the presence of a single-FPA eavesdropper (Eve). To ensure secure communication, artificial noise (AN) is transmitted to obstruct the interception of Eve. The objective of this paper is to maximize the sum secrecy rate (SSR) of the UL and DL users by jointly optimizing the beamformers of the BS and the positions of MAs. This paper also proposes an alternating optimization (AO) method to address the non-convex problem, which decomposes the optimization problem into three subproblems and solves them iteratively. Simulation results demonstrate a significant performance gain in the SSR achieved by the proposed scheme compared to the benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>A Signature Based Approach Towards Global Channel Charting with Ultra Low Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Channel charting, an unsupervised learning method that learns a low-dimensional representation from channel information to preserve geometrical property of physical space of user equipments (UEs), has drawn many attentions from both academic and industrial communities, because it can facilitate many downstream tasks, such as indoor localization, UE handover, beam management, and so on. However, many previous works mainly focus on charting that only preserves local geometry and use raw channel information to learn the chart, which do not consider the global geometry and are often computationally intensive and very time-consuming. Therefore, in this paper, a novel signature based approach for global channel charting with ultra low complexity is proposed. By using an iterated-integral based method called signature transform, a compact feature map and a novel distance metric are proposed, which enable channel charting with ultra low complexity and preserving both local and global geometry. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method using synthetic and open-source real-field datasets.</description>

      <title>Dual Simplex Volume Maximization for Simplex-Structured Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simplex-structured matrix factorization (SSMF) is a generalization of nonnegative matrix factorization, a fundamental interpretable data analysis model, and has applications in hyperspectral unmixing and topic modeling. To obtain identifiable solutions, a standard approach is to find minimum-volume solutions. By taking advantage of the duality/polarity concept for polytopes, we convert minimum-volume SSMF in the primal space to a maximum-volume problem in the dual space. We first prove the identifiability of this maximum-volume dual problem. Then, we use this dual formulation to provide a novel optimization approach which bridges the gap between two existing families of algorithms for SSMF, namely volume minimization and facet identification. Numerical experiments show that the proposed approach performs favorably compared to the state-of-the-art SSMF algorithms.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Sensing and Communication for ISAC Networks: Performance Analysis and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks intending to effectively balance sensing and communication (S&amp;C) performance at the network level. Through the simultaneous utilization of multi-point (CoMP) coordinated joint transmission and distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar techniques, we propose a cooperative networked ISAC scheme to enhance both S&amp;C services. Then, the tool of stochastic geometry is exploited to capture the S&amp;C performance, which allows us to illuminate key cooperative dependencies in the ISAC network. Remarkably, the derived expression of the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the localization accuracy unveils a significant finding: Deploying $N$ ISAC transceivers yields an enhanced sensing performance across the entire network, in accordance with the $\ln^2N$ scaling law. Simulation results demonstrate that compared to the time-sharing scheme, the proposed cooperative ISAC scheme can effectively improve the average data rate and reduce the CRLB.</description>

      <title>Invertibility of Discrete-Time Linear Systems with Sparse Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the fundamental problems of interest for discrete-time linear systems is whether its input sequence may be recovered given its output sequence, a.k.a. the left inversion problem. Many conditions on the state space geometry, dynamics, and spectral structure of a system have been used to characterize the well-posedness of this problem, without assumptions on the inputs. However, certain structural assumptions, such as input sparsity, have been shown to translate to practical gains in the performance of inversion algorithms, surpassing classical guarantees. Establishing necessary and sufficient conditions for left invertibility of systems with sparse inputs is therefore a crucial step toward understanding the performance limits of system inversion under structured input assumptions. In this work, we provide the first necessary and sufficient characterizations of left invertibility for linear systems with sparse inputs, echoing classic characterizations for standard linear systems. The key insight in deriving these results is in establishing the existence of two novel geometric invariants unique to the sparse-input setting, the weakly unobservable and strongly reachable subspace arrangements. By means of a concrete example, we demonstrate the utility of these characterizations. We conclude by discussing extensions and applications of this framework to several related problems in sparse control.</description>

      <title>Localising the Seizure Onset Zone from Single-Pulse Electrical Stimulation Responses with a Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, and many patients require surgical intervention when medication fails to control seizures. For effective surgical outcomes, precise localisation of the epileptogenic focus - often approximated through the Seizure Onset Zone (SOZ) - is critical yet remains a challenge. Active probing through electrical stimulation is already standard clinical practice for identifying epileptogenic areas. This paper advances the application of deep learning for SOZ localisation using Single Pulse Electrical Stimulation (SPES) responses. We achieve this by introducing Transformer models that incorporate cross-channel attention. We evaluate these models on held-out patient test sets to assess their generalisability to unseen patients and electrode placements.
  Our study makes three key contributions: Firstly, we implement an existing deep learning model to compare two SPES analysis paradigms - namely, divergent and convergent. These paradigms evaluate outward and inward effective connections, respectively. Our findings reveal a notable improvement in moving from a divergent (AUROC: 0.574) to a convergent approach (AUROC: 0.666), marking the first application of the latter in this context. Secondly, we demonstrate the efficacy of the Transformer models in handling heterogeneous electrode placements, increasing the AUROC to 0.730. Lastly, by incorporating inter-trial variability, we further refine the Transformer models, with an AUROC of 0.745, yielding more consistent predictions across patients. These advancements provide a deeper insight into SOZ localisation and represent a significant step in modelling patient-specific intracranial EEG electrode placements in SPES. Future work will explore integrating these models into clinical decision-making processes to bridge the gap between deep learning research and practical healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>Real-time Seismic Intensity Prediction using Self-supervised Contrastive GNN for Earthquake Early Warning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14336v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seismic intensity prediction from early or initial seismic waves received by a few seismic stations can enhance Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) systems, particularly in ground motion-based approaches like PLUM. While many operational EEW systems currently utilize point-source-based models that estimate the warning area based on magnitude and distance measures, direct intensity prediction offers a potential improvement in accuracy and reliability. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach, Seismic Contrastive Graph Neural Network (SC-GNN), for highly accurate seismic intensity prediction using a small portion of initial seismic waveforms from a few seismic stations. The SC-GNN consists of two key components: (i) a graph neural network (GNN) to propagate spatiotemporal information through a graph-like structure representing seismic station distribution and wave propagation, and (ii) a self-supervised contrastive learning component to train the network with larger time windows and enable predictions using shorter initial waveforms. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through experiments on three real-world seismic datasets, where it shows superior performance over existing techniques, including a significant reduction in mean squared error (MSE) and the lowest standard deviation of error, indicating its robustness, reliability, and strong positive relationship between predicted and actual values. Notably, the SC-GNN model maintains superior performance even with 5s input waveforms, making it especially suitable for enhancing EEW applications.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates an experimental software defined radio (SDR) implementation on 180 GHz. Rate scarcity and frequency sparsity are discussed as hardware bottlenecks. Experimental challenges are explained along with the derived system model of such a cascaded structure. Multiple error metrics for the terahertz (THz) signal are acquired, and various case scenarios are subsequently compared. The SDR-THz testbed reaches 3.2 Mbps with &lt; 1 degree skew error. The use of a reflector plate can fine-tune the frequency error and gain imbalance in the expense of at least 14.91 dB signal-to-noise ratio. The results demonstrate the complete feasibility of SDR-based baseband signal generation in THz communication, revealing abundant opportunities to overcome hardware limitations in experimental research.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Downlink Coverage in Clustered Low Earth Orbit Satellite Constellations: A Stochastic Geometry Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Satellite networks are emerging as vital solutions for global connectivity beyond 5G. As companies such as SpaceX, OneWeb, and Amazon are poised to launch a large number of satellites in low Earth orbit, the heightened inter-satellite interference caused by mega-constellations has become a significant concern. To address this challenge, recent works have introduced the concept of satellite cluster networks where multiple satellites in a cluster collaborate to enhance the network performance. In order to investigate the performance of these networks, we propose mathematical analyses by modeling the locations of satellites and users using Poisson point processes, building on the success of stochastic geometry-based analyses for satellite networks. In particular, we suggest the lower and upper bounds of the coverage probability as functions of the system parameters, including satellite density, satellite altitude, satellite cluster area, path loss exponent, and Nakagami parameter $m$. We validate the analytical expressions by comparing them with simulation results. Our analyses can be used to design reliable satellite cluster networks by effectively estimating the impact of system parameters on the coverage performance.</description>

Abstract: Underwater environment is substantially less explored territory as compared to earth surface due to lack of robust underwater communication infrastructure. For Internet of Underwater things connectivity, underwater wireless optical communication can play a vital role, compared to conventional radio frequency communication, due to longer range, high data rate, low latency, and unregulated bandwidth. This study proposes underwater wireless optical communication driven local area network UWOC LAN, comprised of multiple network nodes with optical transceivers. Moreover, the temperature sensor data is encapsulated with individual authentication identity to enhance the security of the framework at the user end. The proposed system is evaluated in a specially designed water tank of 4 meters. The proposed system evaluation analysis shows that the system can transmit underwater temperature data reliably in real time. The proposed secure UWOC LAN is tested within a communication range of 16 meters by incorporating multi hop connectivity to monitor the underwater environment.</description>

      <title>Multi-Antenna Dual-Blind Deconvolution for Joint Radar-Communications via SoMAN Minimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In joint radar-communications (JRC) applications such as secure military receivers, often the radar and communications signals are overlaid in the received signal. In these passive listening outposts, the signals and channels of both radar and communications are unknown to the receiver. The ill-posed problem of recovering all signal and channel parameters from the overlaid signal is termed as \textit{dual-blind deconvolution} (DBD). In this work, we investigate DBD for a multi-antenna receiver. We model the radar and communications channels with a few (sparse) \textit{continuous-valued} parameters such as time delays, Doppler velocities, and directions-of-arrival (DoAs). To solve this highly ill-posed DBD, we propose to minimize the sum of multivariate atomic norms (SoMAN) that depend on unknown parameters. To this end, we devise an exact semidefinite program using theories of positive hyperoctant trigonometric polynomials (PhTP). Our theoretical analyses show that the minimum number of samples and antennas required for perfect recovery is logarithmically dependent on the maximum of the number of radar targets and communications paths rather than their sum. We show that our approach is easily generalized to include several practical issues such as gain/phase errors and additive noise. Numerical experiments show the exact parameter recovery for different JRC scenarios.</description>

      <title>Square Root LASSO: Well-posedness, Lipschitz stability and the tuning trade off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15588v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies well-posedness and parameter sensitivity of the Square Root LASSO (SR-LASSO), an optimization model for recovering sparse solutions to linear inverse problems in finite dimension. An advantage of the SR-LASSO (e.g., over the standard LASSO) is that the optimal tuning of the regularization parameter is robust with respect to measurement noise. This paper provides three point-based regularity conditions at a solution of the SR-LASSO: the weak, intermediate, and strong assumptions. It is shown that the weak assumption implies uniqueness of the solution in question. The intermediate assumption yields a directionally differentiable and locally Lipschitz solution map (with explicit Lipschitz bounds), whereas the strong assumption gives continuous differentiability of said map around the point in question. Our analysis leads to new theoretical insights on the comparison between SR-LASSO and LASSO from the viewpoint of tuning parameter sensitivity: noise-robust optimal parameter choice for SR-LASSO comes at the "price" of elevated tuning parameter sensitivity. Numerical results support and showcase the theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: This work is concerned with the recovery of piecewise constant images from noisy linear measurements. We study the noise robustness of a variational reconstruction method, which is based on total (gradient) variation regularization. We show that, if the unknown image is the superposition of a few simple shapes, and if a non-degenerate source condition holds, then, in the low noise regime, the reconstructed images have the same structure: they are the superposition of the same number of shapes, each a smooth deformation of one of the unknown shapes. Moreover, the reconstructed shapes and the associated intensities converge to the unknown ones as the noise goes to zero.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Non-Negative Matrix Factorization on Noisy Data With Negative Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a dimensionality reduction technique that has shown promise for analyzing noisy data, especially astronomical data. For these datasets, the observed data may contain negative values due to noise even when the true underlying physical signal is strictly positive. Prior NMF work has not treated negative data in a statistically consistent manner, which becomes problematic for low signal-to-noise data with many negative values. In this paper we present two algorithms, Shift-NMF and Nearly-NMF, that can handle both the noisiness of the input data and also any introduced negativity. Both of these algorithms use the negative data space without clipping, and correctly recover non-negative signals without any introduced positive offset that occurs when clipping negative data. We demonstrate this numerically on both simple and more realistic examples, and prove that both algorithms have monotonically decreasing update rules.</description>

Abstract: Active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has attracted significant attention in wireless communications, due to its reflecting elements (REs) capable of reflecting incident signals with not only phase shifts but also amplitude amplifications. In this paper, we are interested in active RIS-aided interference channels in which $K$ user pairs share the same time and frequency resources with the aid of active RIS. Thanks to the promising amplitude amplification capability, activating a moderate number of REs, rather than all of them, is sufficient for the active RIS to mitigate cross-channel interferences. Motivated by this, we propose a power-aware sparse reflect beamforming design for the active RIS-aided interference channels, which allows the active RIS to flexibly adjust the number of activated REs for the sake of reducing hardware and power costs. Specifically, we establish the power consumption model in which only those activated REs consume the biasing and operation power that supports the amplitude amplification, yielding an $\ell_0$-norm power consumption function. Based on the proposed model, we investigate a sum-rate maximization problem and an active RIS power minimization problem by carefully designing the sparse reflect beamforming vector. To solve these problems, we first replace the nonconvex $\ell_0$-norm function with an iterative reweighted $\ell_1$-norm function. Then, fractional programming is used to solve the sum-rate maximization, while semidefinite programming together with the difference-of-convex algorithm (DCA) is used to solve the active RIS power minimization. Numerical results show that the proposed sparse designs can notably increase the sum rate of user pairs and decrease the power consumption of active RIS in interference channels.</description>
