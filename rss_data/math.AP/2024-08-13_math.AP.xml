      <title>$L^2$-Theory for nonlocal operators on domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis explores the $L^2$-Theory for nonlocal operators of L\'evy type on bounded domains, as well as their local counterparts. The research was completed at Bielefeld University in Germany and has since garnered significant attention in the field of analysis of nonlocal operators. To enhance its visibility, we believe it is convenient to make it available on arXiv. Interested readers are strongly encouraged to use the following referencing format: "Guy Fabrice Foghem Gounoue. $L^2$-Theory for nonlocal operators on domains.

      <title>General rogue waves of infinite order: Exact properties, asymptotic behavior, and effective numerical computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to a comprehensive analysis of a family of solutions of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation called general rogue waves of infinite order. These solutions have recently been shown to describe various limit processes involving large-amplitude waves, and they have also appeared in some physical models not directly connected with nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. We establish the following key property of these solutions: they are all in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ with respect to the spatial variable but they exhibit anomalously slow temporal decay. In this paper we define general rogue waves of infinite order, establish their basic exact and asymptotic properties, and provide computational tools for calculating them accurately.</description>

      <title>Existence and non-uniqueness of probabilistically strong solutions to 3D stochastic magnetohydrodynamic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with the 3D stochastic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations driven by additive noise on torus. For arbitrarily prescribed divergence-free initial data in $L^{2}_x$, we construct infinitely many probabilistically strong and analitically weak solutions in the class $L^{r}_{\Omega}L_{t}^{\gamma}W_{x}^{s,p}$, where $r&gt;1$ and $(s, \gamma, p)$ lie in a supercritical regime with respect to the the Lady\v{z}henskaya-Prodi-Serrin (LPS) criteria. In particular, we get the non-uniqueness of probabilistically strong solutions, which is sharp at one LPS endpoint space. Our proof utilizes intermittent flows which are different from those of Navier-Stokes equations and derives the non-uniqueness even in the high viscous and resistive regime beyond the Lions exponent 5/4. Furthermore, we prove that as the noise intensity tends to zero, the accumulation points of stochastic MHD solutions contain all deterministic solutions to MHD solutions, which include the recently constructed solutions in [28, 29] to deterministic MHD systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Behaviour of a Soap Film Bridge Driven by an Electrostatic Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a free boundary problem describing a tubular soap film bridge driven by an electrostatic force. To realize the electrostatic force, the soap film bridge is placed inside an outer metal cylinder and a voltage difference between this cylinder and the soap film is applied. Our model consists of a quasilinear parabolic equation for the evolution of the film coupled with an elliptic equation for the electrostatic potential in the unknown domain between outer cylinder and soap film bridge. For the rotationally symmetric case, we prove local well-posedness of this free boundary problem by recasting it as a single quasilinear parabolic equation with a non-local source term. Moreover, for large applied voltages, we show that solutions do not exist globally for a wide class of initial values.</description>

      <title>Blow-up result for semilinear damped wave equations with data from negative order Sobolev spaces: the critical case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address an open question posed in (Chen and Reissig, {\it J. Evol. Equ.} 23, 13, (2023)). Specifically, we show that the weak solution to the damped wave equation with power type nonlinearity $|u|^p,$ given initial data from the Sobolev spaces of negative order $\dot{H}^{-\gamma}(\mathbb{R}^n), \gamma \in (0, \frac{n}{2})$, will blow-up in the critical case $p = p_{\text{Crit}}(n, \gamma):=1+\frac{4}{n+2\gamma}$. We also investigated a similar question in the context of the damped wave equations associated with sub-Laplacian on the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n,$ filling the gap of (Dasgupta et. al, {\it J. Evol. Equ.} 24, 51, (2024)) by proving that the critical exponent $p = p_{\text{Crit}}(Q, \gamma)=1+\frac{4}{Q+2\gamma}$ belongs to the blow-up case, where $Q:=2n+2$ is the homogeneous dimension of $\mathbb{H}^n.$ Our proof hinges upon suitable test function methods. Finally, we end this paper by exploring the diffusion phenomenon of the damped wave equation on the Heisenberg group with initial data belonging additionally to Sobolev spaces of negative order.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity results for Schr\"odinger type fractional $p$-Laplacian boundary value problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the existence and multiplicity of solutions for the following problem \begin{equation}\label{probaa1}
  \left\{ \begin{aligned}
  -(\Delta)_{p}^{s} u + V(x)|u|^{p-2}u &amp;= \lambda f(u),&amp;x\in\Omega;
  u&amp;=0,&amp;x\in \R^{N}\backslash\Omega,
  \end{aligned}
  \right. \end{equation} where $\Omega\subset\R^{N}$ is an open bounded set with Lipschitz boundary $\partial\Omega$, $N\geqslant 2,$ $V\in L^{\infty}(\R^{N})$, and $(-\Delta)_p^s$ denotes the fractional $p$-Laplacian with $s\in(0,1), 1&lt;p$, $sp&lt;N$, $\lambda&gt;0$, and $f:\R\rightarrow\R$ is a continuous function. We extend the results of Lopera {\it et al.} in \cite{Lopera1} by proving the existence of a second weak solution for problem (\ref{probaa1}). We apply a variant of the mountain-pass theorem due to Hofer \cite{Hofer2} and infinite-dimensional Morse theory to obtain the existence of at least two solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the shape optimization problem for the existence of stable equilibrium configurations of nematic and cholesteric liquid crystal drops surrounded by an isotropic solution to include a broader family of admissible domains with inner boundaries, allowing discontinuities in the director field across them. Within this setting, we prove the existence of optimal configurations under a volume constraint and show that the minimization problem is a natural generalization of that posed for regular domains.</description>

      <title>The nonlocal Almgren problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the nonlocal Almgren problem, the goal is to investigate the convexity of a minimizer under a mass constraint via a nonlocal free energy generated with some nonlocal perimeter and convex potential. In the paper, the main result is a quantitative stability theorem for the nonlocal free energy assuming symmetry on the potential. In addition, several results that involve uniqueness, non-existence, and moduli estimates from the theory for crystals are proven also in the nonlocal context.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and large deviations of L\'{e}vy-driven Marcus stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Baryakhtar equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Baryakhtar (SLLBar) equation with pure jump noise in Marcus canonical form, which describes the dynamics of magnetic spin field in a ferromagnet at elevated temperatures with the effective field $\mathbf{H}_{\textrm{eff}}$ influenced by external random noise. Under the natural assumption that the magnetic body $\mathcal{O}\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d=1,2,3$) is bounded with smooth boundary, we shall prove that the initial-boundary value problem of SLLBar equation possesses a unique global probabilistically strong and analytically weak solution with initial data in the energy space $\mathbb{H}^1(\mathcal{O})$. Then by employing the weak convergence method, we proceed to establish a Freidlin-Wentzell type large deviation principle for pathwise solutions to the SLLBar equation.</description>

      <title>A chemotaxis-fluid model driven by L\'{e}vy noise in $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence and uniqueness of global solutions to the Cauchy problem for a coupled stochastic chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes system with multiplicative L\'{e}vy noises in $\mathbb{R}^2$. The existence of global martingale solutions is proved under a framework that is based on the Faedo-Galerkin approximation scheme and stochastic compactness method, where the verification of tightness depends crucially on a novel stochastic version of Lyapunov functional inequality and proper compactness criteria in Fr\'{e}chet spaces. A pathwise uniqueness result is also established with suitable assumption on the jump noises, which indicates that the considered system admits a unique global strong solution.</description>

      <title>Resonant large deviations principle for the beating NLS equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a large deviations principle for the solution to the beating NLS equation on the torus with random initial data supported on two Fourier modes. When these modes have different initial variance, we prove that the resonant energy exchange between them increases the likelihood of extreme wave formation. Our results show that nonlinear focusing mechanisms can lead to tail fattening of the probability measure of the sup-norm of the solution to a nonlinear dispersive equation.</description>

      <title>Scattering theory for the Inhomogeneous Kinetic Wave Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we construct global strong dispersive solutions to the space inhomogeneous kinetic wave equation (KWE) which propagate $L^1_{xv}$ -- moments and conserve mass, momentum and energy. We prove that they scatter, and that the wave operators mapping the initial data to the scattering states are 1-1, onto and continuous in a suitable topology.
  Our proof is carried out entirely in physical space, and combines dispersive estimates for the free transport with new trilinear bounds for the gain and loss operators of the KWE on weighted Lebesgue spaces. A fundamental tool in obtaining these bounds is a novel collisional averaging estimate.
  Finally we show that the nonlinear evolution preserves positivity forward in time. For this, we use the Kaniel-Shinbrot iteration scheme \cite{KS}, properly initialized to ensure the successive approximations are dispersive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an Oberbeck-Boussinesq model, rigorously derived, which includes compressibility, one could expect that the onset of convection for the B\'enard problem occurs at a higher critical Rayleigh number. Since of the difficulties related to the new partial differential equations, with non constant coefficients and a non divergence-free velocity field, we show the increased stability of the rest state by exploring the related Lorenz approximation system.</description>

Abstract: We consider the initial-boundary value problems on $\mathbb{R}^{+}\times \mathbb{R}^{+}$ for one-dimension systems of quasilinear wave equations with null conditions. We show that for homogeneous Dirichlet boundary values and sufficiently small initial data, classical solutions always globally exist. The key innovation in the proof is a new framework of bootstrap argument via coupled high-low order energy estimates.</description>

      <title>Global weak solutions to a fractional Cahn-Hilliard cross-diffusion system in lymphangiogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spectral-fractional Cahn-Hilliard cross-diffusion system, which describes the pre-patterning of lymphatic vessel morphology in collagen gels, is studied. The model consists of two higher-order quasilinear parabolic equations and describes the evolution of the fiber phase volume fraction and the solute concentration. The free energy consists of the nonconvex Flory-Huggins energy and a fractional gradient energy, modeling nonlocal long-range correlations. The existence of global weak solutions to this system in a bounded domain with no-flux boundary conditions is shown. The proof is based on a three-level approximation scheme, spectral-fractional calculus, and a priori estimates coming from the energy inequality.</description>

      <title>Gradient flow for a class of diffusion equations with Dirichlet boundary data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a variational characterisation for a class of non-linear evolution equations with constant non-negative Dirichlet boundary conditions on a bounded domain as gradient flows in the space of non-negative measures. The relevant geometry is given by the modified Wasserstein distance introduced by Figalli and Gigli that allows for a change of mass by letting the boundary act as a reservoir. We give a dynamic formulation of this distance as an action minimisation problem for curves of non-negative measures satisfying a continuity equation in the spirit of Benamou-Brenier. Then we characterise solutions to non-linear diffusion equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions as metric gradient flows of internal energy functionals in the sense of curves of maximal slope.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rate of Particle System for Second-order PDEs On Wasserstein Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a convergence rate for particle approximations of a class of second-order PDEs on Wasserstein space. We show that, up to some error term, the infinite-dimensional inf(sup)-convolution of the finite-dimensional value function yields a super (sub)-viscosity solution to the PDEs on Wasserstein space. Hence, we obtain a convergence rate using a comparison principle of such PDEs on Wasserstein space. Our argument is purely analytic and relies on the regularity of value functions established in \cite{DaJaSe23}.</description>

      <title>The Westervelt-Rayleigh-Plesset model of ultrasound contrast imaging with microbubbles: analysis and simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound contrast imaging is a specialized imaging technique that applies microbubble contrast agents to traditional medical sonography, providing real-time visualization of blood flow and vessels. Gas-filled microbubbles are injected into the body, where they undergo compression and rarefaction and interact nonlinearly with the ultrasound waves. Therefore, the propagation of sound through a bubbly liquid is a strongly nonlinear problem that can be modeled by a nonlinear acoustic wave equation for the propagation of the pressure waves coupled via the source terms to a nonlinear ordinary differential equation of Rayleigh-Plesset type for the bubble dynamics. In this work, we first derive a hierarchy of such coupled models based on constitutive laws. We then focus on the coupling of Westervelt's acoustic equation to Rayleigh-Plesset type equations, where we rigorously show the existence of solutions locally in time under suitable conditions on the initial pressure-microbubble data and final time. Thirdly, we devise and discuss numerical experiments on both single-bubble dynamics and the interaction of microbubbles with ultrasound waves.</description>

      <title>Singular limit and convergence rate via projection method in a model for plant-growth dynamics with autotoxicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06177</link>

Abstract: We investigate a fast-reaction--diffusion system modelling the effect of autotoxicity on plant-growth dynamics, in which the fast-reaction terms are based on the dichotomy between healthy and exposed roots depending on the toxicity. The model was proposed in [Giannino, Iuorio, Soresina, forthcoming] to account for stable stationary spacial patterns considering only biomass and toxicity, and its fast-reaction (cross-diffusion) limit was formally derived and numerically investigated. In this paper, the cross-diffusion limiting system is rigorously obtained as the fast-reaction limit of the reaction-diffusion system with fast-reaction terms by performing a bootstrap argument involving energies. Then, a thorough well-posedness analysis of the cross-diffusion system is presented, including a $L^\infty_{x,t}$-bound, uniqueness, stability, and regularity of weak solutions. This analysis, in turn, becomes crucial to establish the convergence rate for the fast reaction limit, thanks to the key idea of using an inverse Neumann Laplacian operator. Finally, numerical experiments illustrate the analytical findings on the convergence rate.</description>

      <title>On the First Eigenvalue of the $p$-Laplace Operator with Robin Boundary Conditions in the Complement of a Compact Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the first eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ of the $p$-Laplace operator subject to Robin boundary conditions in the exterior of a compact set. We discuss the conditions for the existence of a variational $\lambda_1$, depending on the boundary parameter, the space dimension, and $p$. Our analysis involves the first $p$-harmonic Steklov eigenvalue in exterior domains. We establish properties of $\lambda_1$ for the exterior of a ball, including general inequalities, the asymptotic behavior as the boundary parameter approaches zero, and a monotonicity result with respect to a special type of domain inclusion. In two dimensions, we generalized to $p\neq 2$ some known shape optimization results.</description>

      <title>New quermassintegral and Poincar\'{e} type inequalities for non-convex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the first part of this paper, we study the following non-homogeneous, locally constrained inverse curvature flow in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, \begin{align*} \dot{x}=\left(\frac{1}{\frac{E_k(\hat{\kappa})}{E_{k-1}(\hat{\kappa})}-\alpha }-\langle x,\nu\rangle\right)\nu, \quad k=2,3,\ldots,n-1. \end{align*} Assuming that the initial hypersurface $\mathcal{M}_0 \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is star-shaped and its shifted principal curvatures $\hat{\kappa}=\kappa+\alpha(1,\ldots,1)$ lie in the convex set \begin{align*} \Gamma_{\alpha,k}:=\Gamma_{k-1}\cap \{\lambda\in \mathbb{R}^n:\, E_k(\lambda)-\alpha E_{k-1}(\lambda)&gt;0\}, \end{align*} we show that the flow admits a smooth solution that exists for all positive times, and it converges smoothly to a round sphere. As a corollary, we obtain a new set of Alexandrov-Fenchel-type inequalities for non-convex domains.
  In the second part, we derive a Poincar\'{e} type inequality for $k$-convex hypersurfaces which complements a more general version of the well-known Heintze-Karcher inequality.</description>

Abstract: In integral geometry generalized with Aleksandrov's variational theory, Lutwak-Xi-Yang-Zhang \cite{LXYZ} recently opened the door to researching the cone-chord measures and its log-Minkowski problem stemming from the chord integrals, named as the chord log-Minkowski problem. In the smooth category, the solvability of the chord log-Minkowski problem is amounts to dealing with a new {M}onge-{A}mp\`ere equation involving a Riesz potential. In this paper, to study the regularity of the chord log-Minkowski problem, we first discover a novel result on the boundary smooth estimation of the Riesz potential. Based on this estimation, we obtain the regularity of the chord log-Minkowski problem from the point view of elliptic {M}onge-{A}mp\`ere equation and a nonlocal Gauss curvature flow equation. Our results may be served as a bridge facilitating the relation among integral geometry, differential geometry and partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>An Eulerian hyperbolic model for heat transfer derived via Hamilton's principle: analytical and numerical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new model for heat transfer in compressible fluid flows. The model is derived from Hamilton's principle of stationary action in Eulerian coordinates, in a setting where the entropy conservation is recovered as an Euler--Lagrange equation. The governing system is shown to be hyperbolic. It is asymptotically consistent with the Euler equations for compressible heat conducting fluids, provided the addition of suitable relaxation terms. A study of the Rankine--Hugoniot conditions and the Clausius--Duhem inequality reveals that contact discontinuities cannot exist while expansion waves and compression fans are possible solutions to the governing equations. Evidence of these properties is provided on a set of numerical test cases.</description>

Abstract: We establish the existence of an optimal partition for the Yamabe equation in the whole space made up of mutually linearly isometric sets, each of them invariant under the action of a group of linear isometries. To do this, we establish the existence of a solution to a weakly coupled competitive Yamabe system, whose components are invariant under the action of the group, and each of them is obtained from the previous one by composing it with a linear isometry. We show that, as the coupling parameter goes to minus infinity, the components of the solutions segregate and give rise to an optimal partition that has the properties mentioned above. Finally, taking advantage of the symmetries considered, we establish the existence of infinitely many sign-changing solutions for the Yamabe equation that are different from those previously found in the by W.Y. Ding, and del Pino, Musso, Pacard and Pistoia</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose nonlocal diffusion models with Dirichlet boundary. These nonlocal diffusion models preserve the maximum principle and also have corresponding variational form. With these good properties, we can prove the well-posedness and the vanishing nonlocality convergence. Furthermore, by specifically designed weight function, we can get a nonlocal diffusion model with second order convergence which is optimal for nonlocal diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Optimal asymptotic lower bound for stability of fractional Sobolev inequality and the stability of Log-Sobolev inequality on the sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11787v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the optimal asymptotic lower bound for the stability of fractional Sobolev inequality: \begin{equation}\label{Sob sta ine} \left\|(-\Delta)^{s/2} U \right\|_2^2 - \mathcal S_{s,n} \| U\|_{\frac{2n}{n-2s}}^2\geq C_{n,s} d^{2}(U, \mathcal{M}_s), \end{equation} where $\mathcal{M}_s$ is the set of maximizers of the fractional Sobolev inequality of order $s$, $s\in (0, 1)$ and $C_{n,s}$ denotes the optimal lower bound of stability. We prove that the optimal lower bound $C_{n,s}$ behaves asymptotically at the order of $\frac{1}{n}$ when $n\rightarrow +\infty$ for any fixed $s\in (0,1)$. This extends the work by Dolbeault-Esteban-Figalli-Frank-Loss [19] on the stability of the first order Sobolev inequality and quantify the asymptotic behavior for lower bound of stability of fractional Sobolev inequality established by the current author's previous work in [15] in the case of $s\in (0, 1)$. Moreover, $C_{n,s}$ behaves asymptotically at the order of $s$ when $s\rightarrow 0$ for any given dimension $n$. (See Theorem 1.1.) As an application of this asymptotic estimate as $s\to 0$ and through the end-point differentiation method, we also derive the global stability for the log-Sobolev inequality on the sphere established by Beckner in [3,4] with the optimal asymptotic lower bound on the sphere. (see Theorem 1.6). This sharpens the earlier work by the authors in [14] where only the local stability for the log-Sobolev inequality on the sphere was proved. We also obtain the asymptotically optimal lower bound for the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality when $s\to 0$ for fixed dimension $n$ and when $n\to \infty$ for fixed $s\in (0, 1)$ (See Theorem 1.4 and the subsequent Remark 1.5).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the uniqueness of mild solutions to the forced or unforced Navier-Stokes equations in the whole space. It is known that the uniqueness of mild solutions to the unforced Navier-Stokes equations holds in $L^{\infty}(0,T;L^d(\mathbb{R}^d))$ when $d\geq 4$, and in $C([0,T];L^d(\mathbb{R}^d))$ when $d\geq3$. As for the forced Navier-Stokes equations, when $d\geq3$ the uniqueness of mild solutions in $C([0,T];L^{d,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d))$ with force $f$ and initial data $u_{0}$ in some proper Lorentz spaces is known. In this paper we show that for $d\geq3$, the uniqueness of mild solutions to the forced Navier-Stokes equations in $ C((0,T];\widetilde{L}^{d,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d))\cap L^\beta(0,T;\widetilde{L}^{d,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d))$ for $\beta&gt;2d/(d-2)$ holds when there is a mild solution in $C([0,T];\widetilde{L}^{d,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d))$ with the same initial data and force. Here $\widetilde{L}^{d,\infty}$ is the closure of ${L^{\infty}\cap L^{d,\infty}}$ with respect to $L^{d,\infty}$ norm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Gelfand problem with general supercritical nonlinearities in the two-dimensional unit ball. In this paper, we prove the non-existence of an unstable solution for any positive small parameter $\lambda$. The result implies that once the bifurcation curve emanates from the starting point, then the curve never approaches $\lambda=0$. As a result, we obtain the existence of a radial singular solution. In addition, we prove the uniformly boundedness of finite Morse index solutions. As a result, we prove that the bifurcation curve has infinitely many turning points. We remark that these properties are well-known in $N$ dimensions with $3\le N \le 9$ and less known in two dimensions. Our results clarify that the bifurcation structure is solely determined by the supercriticality of the nonlinearities if $2\le N\le 9$.</description>

Abstract: We show that buoyancy driven flows can be steered in an arbitrary time towards any state by applying as control only an external temperature profile in a subset of small measure. More specifically, we prove that the 2D incompressible Boussinesq system on the torus is globally approximately controllable via physically localized heating or cooling. In addition, our controls have an explicitly prescribed structure; even without such structural requirements, large data controllability results for Boussinesq flows driven merely by a physically localized temperature profile were so far unknown. The presented method exploits various connections between the model's underlying transport-, coupling-, and scaling mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: We show optimal upper and lower pointwise estimates for the Green's function for elliptic operators that are the sum of a Laplacian term and a singular drift term that behaves like the inverse distance to the boundary, in not necessarily bounded chord-arc domains in $\R^{n}$ with $n\geq 3$. In particular, such a term does not belong to the Lorentz space or the Kato space considered in other recent work of Sakellaris and Mourgoglou. We also do not make any assumptions on the divergence of the drift term. Adopting standards arguments, while assuming the Bourgain estimate on the elliptic measure, this also shows doubling of the corresponding elliptic measure, in the chord-arc domains.</description>

      <title>Optimal stability of Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev and Sobolev inequalities of arbitrary orders with dimension-dependent constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Dolbeault-Esteban-Figalli-Frank-Loss [20] established the optimal stability of the first-order Sobolev inequality with dimension-dependent constant. Subsequently, Chen-Lu-Tang [18] obtained the optimal stability for the fractional Sobolev inequality of order $s$ when $0&lt;s&lt;1$. However, the optimal stability question for Sobolev inequality of order $s$ when $1&lt;s&lt;\frac{n}{2}$ is still unsolved. Furthermore, the optimal stability for the HLS inequality still remains open. The purpose of this paper is to solve these problems. Our strategy is to first establish the optimal stability for the HLS inequality. The main difficulty lies in establishing the optimal local stability of HLS inequality when $1&lt;s&lt;\frac{n}{2}$. The proof of the local stability when $0&lt;s\leq 1$ using duality does not work for $1&lt;s&lt;n/2$. Thus, we directly establish the optimal local stability for the HLS inequality. The loss of the Hilbert structure of the distance appearing in the stability of the HLS inequality brings much challenge to establishing the desired stability. To achieve our goal, we develop a new strategy based on the $H^{-s}-$decomposition instead of $L^{\frac{2n}{n+2s}}-$decomposition to obtain the local stability of the HLS inequality with $L^{\frac{2n}{n+2s}}-$distance. However, this kind of ``new local stability" adds new difficulties to deduce the global stability from the local stability using the rearrangement flow because of the non-uniqueness and non-continuity of $\|r\|_{\frac{2n}{n+2s}}$ for the rearrangement flow. We establish the norm comparison theorem for $\|r\|_{\frac{2n}{n+2s}}$ and ``new continuity" theorem for the rearrangement flow to overcome this difficulty (see Lemma 3.1, Lemma 3.3 and Lemma 3.5). We also deduce the optimal stability of the Sobolev inequality of order s when $1\le s&lt;\frac{n}{2}$ as an important application.</description>

      <title>Long-time behavior to the 3D isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are concerned with the long-time behavior of classical solutions to the isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\mathbb R^3$. Our main results and innovations can be stated as follows: Under the assumption that the density $\rho({\bf{x}}, t)$ verifies $\rho({\bf{x}},0)\geq c&gt;0$ and $\sup_{t\geq 0}\|\rho(\cdot,t)\|_{L^\infty}\leq M$, we establish the optimal decay rates of the solutions. This greatly improves the previous result (Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 234 (2019), 1167--1222), where the authors require an extra hypothesis $\sup_{t\geq 0}\|\rho(\cdot,t)\|_{C^\alpha}\leq M$ with $\alpha$ arbitrarily small. We prove that the vacuum state will persist for any time provided that the initial density contains vacuum and the far-field density is away from vacuum, which extends the torus case obtained in (SIAM J. Math. Anal. 55 (2023), 882--899) to the whole space. We derive the decay properties of the solutions with vacuum as far-field density. This in particular gives the first result concerning the $L^\infty$-decay with a rate $(1+t)^{-1}$ for the pressure to the 3D compressible Navier-Stokes equations in the presence of vacuum. The main ingredient of the proof relies on the techniques involving blow-up criterion, a key time-independent positive upper and lower bounds of the density, and a regularity interpolation trick.</description>

      <title>The influence of advection on the propagation phenomena of reaction-diffusion equations with KPP-bistable nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to propagation phenomena for a reaction-diffusion-advection equation in a one-dimensional heterogeneous environment, where heterogeneity is reflected by the nonlinearity term -- being KPP type on $(-\infty, -L]$ and being bistable type on $[L,+\infty)$ for some $L&gt;0$. A comprehensive analysis is presented on the influence of advection and heterogeneous reactions, based on various values of the advection rate $c$. Denote by $c_m$ and $c_b$ the spreading speeds of KPP and bistable reactions, respectively. When $c&gt;-c_m$, it is shown that propagation can always occur with leftward spreading speed $c_m+c$ and rightward spreading speed $\min\big(\max(c_b-c,0),c_m-c\big)$. Moreover, a logarithmic delay of the level sets in the left direction is discovered. When $c \le -c_m$, propagation phenomena are determined by the initial data and by the sign of $c_b$. In particular, when $c_b&gt;0$, the leftward propagation speed is $c_b+c$ if the initial population is "large enough"; whereas extinction occurs if the initial value is located in the bistable region and is "relatively small". In addition, the attractiveness of the bistable traveling wave is obtained when the leftward spreading speed is $c_b+c$ and/or when the rightward spreading speed is $c_b-c$.</description>

      <title>From Monte Carlo to neural networks approximations of boundary value problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study probabilistic and neural network approximations for solutions to Poisson equation subject to Holder data in general bounded domains of $\mathbb{R}^d$. We aim at two fundamental goals.
  The first, and the most important, we show that the solution to Poisson equation can be numerically approximated in the sup-norm by Monte Carlo methods, and that this can be done highly efficiently if we use a modified version of the walk on spheres algorithm as an acceleration method. This provides estimates which are efficient with respect to the prescribed approximation error and with polynomial complexity in the dimension and the reciprocal of the error. A crucial feature is that the overall number of samples does not not depend on the point at which the approximation is performed.
  As a second goal, we show that the obtained Monte Carlo solver renders in a constructive way ReLU deep neural network (DNN) solutions to Poisson problem, whose sizes depend at most polynomialy in the dimension $d$ and in the desired error. In fact we show that the random DNN provides with high probability a small approximation error and low polynomial complexity in the dimension.</description>

      <title>Integral formulation of Klein-Gordon singular waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the analysis of singular waveguides separating insulating phases in two-space dimensions. The insulating domains are modeled by a massive Schr\"odinger equation and the singular waveguide by appropriate jump conditions along the one-dimensional interface separating the insulators. We present an integral formulation of the problem and analyze its mathematical properties. We also implement a fast multipole and sweeping-accelerated iterative algorithm for solving the integral equations, and demonstrate numerically the fast convergence of this method. Several numerical examples of solutions and scattering effects illustrate our theory.</description>

      <title>Metastability and time scales for parabolic equations with drift 1: the first time scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the elliptic operator given by $$ \mathscr{L}_{\epsilon}f= {b} \cdot \nabla f + \epsilon \Delta f $$ for some smooth vector field $ b\colon \mathbb R^d \to\mathbb R^d$ and a small parameter $\epsilon&gt;0$. Consider the initial-valued problem $$ \left\{ \begin{aligned} &amp;\partial_ t u_\epsilon = \mathscr L_\epsilon u_\epsilon,\\ &amp;u_\epsilon (0, \cdot) = u_0(\cdot), \end{aligned} \right. $$ for some bounded continuous function $u_0$. Denote by $\mathcal M_0$ the set of critical points of $b$ which are stable stationary points for the ODE $\dot x (t) = b (x(t))$. Under the hypothesis that $\mathcal M_0$ is finite and $ b = -(\nabla U + \ell)$, where $ \ell$ is a divergence-free field orthogonal to $\nabla U$, the main result of this article states that there exist a time-scale $\theta^{(1)}_\epsilon$, $\theta^{(1)}_\epsilon \to \infty$ as $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$, and a Markov semigroup $\{p_t : t\ge 0\}$ defined on $\mathcal M_0$ such that $$ \lim_{\epsilon\to 0} u_\epsilon (t\theta^{(1)}_\epsilon, x)
  =\sum_{m'\in \mathcal M_0} p_t(m, m')\, u_0( m'), $$ for all $t&gt;0$ and $ x$ in the domain of attraction of $m$ for the ODE $\dot{x}(t)= b( x(t))$. The time scale $\theta^{(1)}$ is critical in the sense that, for all time scale $\varrho_\epsilon$ such that $\varrho_\epsilon \to \infty$, $\varrho_\epsilon/\theta^{(1)}_\epsilon \to 0$, $$ \lim_{\epsilon\to 0} u_\epsilon (\varrho_\epsilon, x)=u_0(m) $$ for all $x \in \mathcal D(m)$. Namely, $\theta_\epsilon^{(1)}$ is the first scale at which the solution to the initial-valued problem starts to change. In a companion paper [Landim, Lee, Seo, forthcoming] we extend this result finding all critical time-scales at which the solution $u_\epsilon$ evolves smoothly in time and we show that the solution $u_\epsilon$ is expressed in terms of the semigroup of some Markov chain taking values in sets formed by unions of critical points of $b$.</description>

Abstract: Transformers play a central role in the inner workings of large language models. We develop a mathematical framework for analyzing Transformers based on their interpretation as interacting particle systems, which reveals that clusters emerge in long time. Our study explores the underlying theory and offers new perspectives for mathematicians as well as computer scientists.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions for a coherent phenomenon of condensation in conservative Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While it is known that Hamiltonian systems may undergo a phenomenon of condensation akin to Bose-Einstein condensation, not all the manifestations of this phenomenon have been uncovered yet. In this work we present a novel form of condensation in conservative Hamiltonian systems that stands out due to its evolution through highly coherent states. The result is based on a deterministic approach to obtain exact explicit solutions representing the dynamical formation of condensates in finite time. We reveal a dual-cascade behavior during the process, featuring inverse and direct transfer of conserved quantities across the spectrum. The direct cascade yields the excitation of arbitrarily high modes in finite time, being associated with the formation of a small-scale coherent structure. We provide a fully analytic description of the processes involved.</description>

      <title>Remarks on regularization by noise, convex integration and spontaneous stochasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This note is devoted to a discussion of the potential links and differences between three topics: regularization by noise, convex integration, spontaneous stochasticity. All of them deal with the effect on large scales of a small-scale perturbation of fluid dynamic equations. The effects sometimes have something in common, like convex integration and spontaneous stochasticity, sometimes they look the opposite, as in regularization by noise. We are not aware of rigorous links or precise explanations of the differences, and hope to drive new research with this comparative examination.</description>
