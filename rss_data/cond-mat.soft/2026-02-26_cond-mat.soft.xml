      <title>From molecular model to tensor model of nematic liquid crystals through entropy decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the mathematical modeling of nematic liquid crystals, a practical and physically reliable $\mathbf{Q}$-tensor model can be derived from Onsager's molecular model with the Bingham closure. However, this procedure leads to a singular entropy term that implicitly depends on $\mathbf{Q}$, creating both computational and theoretical difficulties. In this paper, we characterize this entropy contribution by splitting it into a singular but explicit leading term and an implicit but regular correction term, the latter of which is proven to be sufficiently regular to be accurately approximated numerically, for example, by neural networks. This yields a computationally convenient free energy that can be used for the computation of nematic liquid crystals. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the resulting free energy can capture the isotropic-nematic phase transition as well as the free-boundary droplet configurations.</description>

      <title>From Global Flocking to Local Clustering: Interplay between Velocity Alignment and Visual Perception of Active Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective behavior in biological systems was first captured by the Vicsek model, in which particles align their velocities in the average direction of neighbors, leading to coherent motion and showing an order-disorder transition. However, in many complex environments, the interactions are non-reciprocal, lacking an action-reaction symmetry. Using framework of the Vicsek model, we implement non-reciprocity by restricting interactions to neighbors located inside a finite vision cone, for a particle by limiting its set of interacting neighbors which fall within a vision-cone, providing a minimal description for cognitive perception. Using detailed numerical simulations, we explore the clustering and flocking behavior due to competition between noise and limited visual perception in the presence of alignment interaction. For low noise, with reduction in the vision angle the system shows transition from a global coherent motion to locally ordered small-sized clusters. This behavior is confirmed through the steady-state distributions of velocity components and their fluctuation relative to the global mean. This is also characterized using a polar order-parameter and a two-point velocity correlation function. Interestingly, at small vision angles, particles exhibit strong short-range correlations within clusters even in the absence of any global coherence. Time-evolution of the related correlation functions illustrate the pathways towards the emergence of such structures. The time dependence of the average cluster size and the length-scale calculated from the two-point velocity correlation show scaling behavior and indicate that the emergence of density field clustering is a consequence of the velocity-field coherence. Any kind of ordering and clustering disappear in the limit of high noise and low vision-angle regime.</description>

      <title>Chapman-Enskog expansion for chirally colliding disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a two-dimensional fluid of hard disks undergoing chiral, energy- and momentum-conserving collisions. We show that despite the microscopic breaking of time-reversal symmetry, the H-theorem is obeyed, guaranteeing a relaxation towards equilibrium in the absence of external forces. In the dilute limit, a Chapman-Enskog expansion yields analytical expressions for the shear and odd viscosity and the thermal conductivity. Theoretical predictions are confirmed by nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Measuring elastic properties of granular hydrogels: Effects of capillary interaction and ionic conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elastic properties of granular hydrogels are commonly characterised under wet conditions, yet the influence of capillary interactions remains unclear. In practical applications, hydrogels operate in aqueous environments containing dissolved ionic species, where swelling and elastic behaviour depend sensitively on ionic conditions. In this study, an experimental setup is developed to measure elastic responses of granular hydrogels under wet conditions. This setup directly observes liquid bridges formation and its evolution during compression. Our results show that neglecting capillary contributions leads to a systematic underestimation of the Young's modulus of hydrogels. Such an underestimation due to the capillary interaction increases as the sample size or its intrinsic stiffness decreases. In addition to the swelling ratio, the tested samples were also prepared under controlled salinity levels. The experimentally observed dependence of stiffness on swelling and salinity conditions is well captured by a modified constitutive model. The development of this study offers a robust testing protocol for measuring elastic properties of hydrogels under various environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Confinement-Induced Symmetry Breaking of Active Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The actomyosin cortex, a thin layer of a cross-linked polymer network near the cell surface, generates active forces that are responsible for cell shape changes. Many developmental processes that involve such cell shape changes, most prominently embryonic cell division, are spatially confined by eggshells. To investigate the potential role of confinement in redirecting active stresses and enabling symmetry breaking phenomena during cell shape transformations, we study a hydrodynamic minimal model in which the cell cortex is represented as an active fluid surface that undergoes symmetric division in the absence of confinement. When enclosed by an ellipsoidal shell, a spontaneous symmetry-breaking transition emerges at a critical degree of confinement, where symmetrically dividing surfaces become unstable and polarized geometries appear. We show that this transition is controlled by the tightness of the confinement and analyze the solution space of stationary surfaces to identify the mechanisms underlying confinement-induced symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Self-avoiding tethered surfaces are always flat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scaling behavior of fully flexible elastic tethered surfaces has been debated for decades. Some theories predict that self-avoiding surfaces would crumple in the absence of bending rigidity, while most simulations suggested that they would remain flat. Recent simulations on ideal membranes with lattice perforations suggest that systematically removing surface area from a membrane may provide an alternative way to crumpling self-avoiding surfaces. We perform extensive numerical simulations of two models of fully flexible elastic tethered surfaces in which self-avoidance can be systematically and continuously tuned to the ideal limit. We show that in the thermodynamic limit, these surfaces remain flat with a size exponent $\nu=1$ for any finite degree of self-avoidance, with or without membrane perforations.</description>

      <title>Stress Relaxation in Monodisperse Entangled Polymer Melts: Correlation Between Viscoelastic Response and Single-Chain Relaxation via Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stress relaxation in several types of entangled monodisperse linear polymer melts by comparing the shear stress relaxation modulus, $G(t)$, with the end-to-end vector autocorrelation function, $P(t)$. The study includes three Kremer-Grest bead-spring models with varying chain stiffness, as well as a chemistry-specific coarse-grained model of \emph{cis}-1,4-polybutadiene. For each model, multiple chain lengths were simulated, spanning a range of $N/N_e = 5$-$50$ entanglements per chain. We observe that in all cases the behavior of $G(t)$, beyond the short-time Rouse regime, is accurately described by $G^0_{\mathrm{N}}[P(t)]^2$, where the chain-length-independent prefactor $G^0_{\mathrm{N}}$ denotes the plateau modulus. This correlation is consistent with both double reptation and dynamic tube dilation models of polymer relaxation, although the two models are based on different physical pictures. The double reptation model represents the melt as a transient network in which stress relaxation is governed by the survival probability of pairwise entanglements. The dynamic tube dilation model, however, assumes that the tube of constraints surrounding a polymer chain progressively enlarges as relaxation proceeds. The relation $G(t) = G^0_\mathrm{N}[P(t)]^2$ can serve as a basis for determining the plateau modulus and the corresponding entanglement length. It also simplifies the modeling of $G(t)$, since an accurate analytical expression for $P(t)$ is sufficient to describe the long-time behavior of $G(t)$. We further compare the simulation data for $P(t)$ and $G(t)$ with theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of Dense Active Fluids: Turbulence-Like States and the Role of Advected Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense suspensions of self-propelled bacteria and related active fluids exhibit spontaneous flow generation, vortex formation, and spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics despite operating at vanishingly small Reynolds numbers. These phenomena, commonly referred to as active turbulence, display striking visual and statistical similarities to classical inertial turbulence while arising from fundamentally different nonequilibrium mechanisms. In this article, we present a combined review and theoretical study of hydrodynamic models for dense active fluids, with particular emphasis on bacterial suspensions described by the Toner--Tu--Swift--Hohenberg (TTSH) framework. We review key experimental and theoretical developments underlying the analogy between active and inertial turbulence, highlighting the emergence of multiple dynamical regimes and the conditions under which universal spectral and intermittent behavior arises in homogeneous systems. Moving beyond the conventional assumption of spatially uniform activity, we introduce a minimal model in which the activity field is heterogeneous and dynamically advected by the flow it generates. Thus treating activity as a spatiotemporally evolving field coupled to the TTSH dynamics, we investigate how advection and diffusion lead to sharp activity fronts, confinement of turbulent motion, and complex interfacial morphologies. Our numerical results demonstrate that spatial variations in activity can induce transient coexistence of distinct spectral regimes and that universality in active turbulence is inherently local and time-dependent in heterogeneous systems. These findings underscore the importance of treating activity as a dynamical field in its own right and provide a framework for studying active turbulence in more realistic, spatially structured biological and synthetic active matter systems.</description>

      <title>Micellar effects on Ostwald ripening in emulsions: Transition from cubic to quadratic particle size growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ostwald ripening in O/W emulsions in presence of solubilizing micelles is theoretically studied. At small average sizes, the kinetics is predicted to follow the classical Lifshits-Slezov-Wagner cubic law, with the rate proportional to the molecular solubility of the oil in water, as if no micelles were present. At larger particle sizes the kinetics transitions to the Wagner's quadratic law. The crossover point for the kinetics depends on the dynamics of the oil solubilizate-micelle exchange; it is set by the value of the oil atmosphere distribution parameter, kappa, which, somewhat like Debye length, is proportional to the square root of the micellar concentration. It should be noted that in the range when 1/kappa is close to the particle average radius, the ripening kinetics still nearly follows the cubic law, with only moderate deviations; in this case, the micellar effects are experimentally seen not as the deviations from the linearity, but as an apparent increase in the cubic rate. The increase is predicted to be larger in case of nonionic micelles of ethylene oxide type compared to ionic ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature has a crucial influence on rubber friction and tire dynamics. The temperature field in a rubber tread block is the sum of the background temperature $T_0({\bf x},t)$, which varies slowly in time and space, and the flash temperature $\Delta T({\bf x},t)$, which in nonzero only close to the macroasperity contact regions, and which varies rapidly in time often on the millisecond time scale. Here we study the motion of a single tire tread block and how it is influenced by the flash temperature. We also present a theory and experimental results for the size of the macroasperity contact regions. In particular, we show that for a large enough nominal contact area, in most cases the diameter $D$ of the macroasperity contact regions are nearly independent of the elastic modulus and the nominal contact pressure.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Thermal Modulation and Patterning using a Programmable 1024 Element Microheater Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable microheater arrays are essential for a variety of applications including gas sensing, microfluidic lab on a chip devices, 3D printers, and biosensors that rely on DNA amplification. Increasing the density and number of heating elements directly correlates with the precision with which spatiotemporal heat profiles can be delivered. However, large arrays have thus far not been realized. One challenge is that as the number of elements in an array increases, the complexity of connecting them grows. Here, we show that row-column addressing provides a promising architecture for the efficient operation of a large micro-heater array. We introduce a programmable 32 x 32 microheater array consisting of individually addressable robust platinum (Pt)-based Joule heating elements- each smaller than 300 micrometer. We show that combining high-voltage multiplexed electronics and sequential addressing controlled by a high frequency clock, allows the independent operation of the 1024 microheater elements. We demonstrate the generation of heat images and the patterning of metallic structures formed from the liquid metal Gallium. Our work demonstrates new capabilities for on-chip thermal devices, and opens the possibility to realize novel heat-controlled microactuation systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological tissues are active materials whose non-equilibrium dynamics emerge from distinct cellular force-generating mechanisms. Using a two-dimensional active foam model, we compare the effects of traction forces and junctional tension fluctuations on confluent tissue dynamics. While these two modes of activity produce qualitatively different cell shapes, rearrangement statistics, and spatiotemporal correlations in fluid states, we find that the long-time cellular motion universally converges to persistent Brownian dynamics. This universal feature contrasts with the non-universal correlations between cell geometry, rearrangement rate, and fluidity, which depend sensitively on the underlying modes of active force. Our results demonstrate that persistent Brownian motion provides a minimal framework for describing tissue dynamics, while distinct active forces leave identifiable structural and dynamical signatures, thereby enabling inference of the dominant active force in fluid state tissues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a 2D XY model subjected to time-correlated noise, a model of direct relevance to active crystals, which were shown recently to be able to support very large deformations without melting in the presence of persistent fluctuations. We find that our persistent XY model can remain quasi-ordered in spite of correlations decaying much faster than allowed in equilibrium. We then investigate theoretically and numerically the order-disorder transition and conclude that it remains of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type, but with scaling exponents that vary with the persistence time of the noise.</description>

      <title>Thermal activation drives a finite-size crossover from scale-free to runaway avalanches in amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate thermal avalanche dynamics in amorphous solids using elastoplastic models with local activation rules and no external driving. Dynamical heterogeneities, quantified through persistence measurements and the associated four-point susceptibility $\chi_4$, reveal the emergence of correlated spatiotemporal rearrangements as temperature is varied. As temperature increases, avalanche statistics evolve from scale-free behavior with exponential cutoffs to regimes dominated by system-spanning runaway events. We identify a system-size-dependent critical temperature $T_c(L)$ that separates intermittent avalanche dynamics from thermally assisted flow, where self-sustained avalanches transiently fluidize the system. We show that $T_c(L)$ decreases algebraically with increasing system size, suggesting that in the thermodynamic limit arbitrarily small but finite temperatures may destabilize the intermittent regime. The relation between avalanche size and duration resembles that in sheared systems, whereas the statistics of minimal distances to yielding reveal a temperature-driven reorganization of marginal stability absent in strictly driven overdamped dynamics. Our results demonstrate that thermal activation alone can generate a finite-size-controlled instability scale in disordered elastic media.</description>

      <title>Hermitian and non-Hermitian topology in active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-propulsion is a quintessential aspect of biological systems, which can induce nonequilibrium phenomena that have no counterparts in passive systems. Motivated by biophysical interest together with recent advances in experimental techniques, active matter has been a rapidly developing field in physics. Meanwhile, over the past few decades, topology has played a crucial role to understand certain robust properties appearing in condensed matter systems. For instance, the nontrivial topology of band structures leads to the notion of topological insulators, where one can find robust gapless edge modes protected by the bulk band topology. We here review recent progress in an interdisciplinary area of research at the intersection of these two fields. Specifically, we give brief introductions to active matter and band topology in Hermitian systems, and then explain how the notion of band topology can be extended to nonequilibrium (and thus non-Hermitian) systems including active matter. We review recent studies that have demonstrated the intimate connections between active matter and topological materials, where exotic topological phenomena that are unfeasible in passive systems have been found. A possible extension of the band topology to nonlinear systems is also briefly discussed. Active matter can thus provide an ideal playground to explore topological phenomena in qualitatively new realms beyond conservative linear systems.</description>

      <title>Density-Independent transient caging in the high-density phase of motility-induced phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13140</link>

Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of active matter using a two-dimensional active Brownian particles model. In these systems, self-propelled particles undergo motility-induced phase separation (MIPS), spontaneously segregating into dense and dilute phases. We find that in the high-density phase, local particle mobility exhibits transient caging, with diffusivity remaining unchanged despite variations in the global system density. As global density increases further, the system undergoes a transition to a solid-like state through an intermediate regime with pronounced dynamical arrest. Our findings identify a distinct high-density regime characterized by transient caging and dynamical slowing down in a monodisperse active system, shedding new light on the connection between MIPS and nonequilibrium arrest.</description>

      <title>The Interplay Between Liquid-Liquid Phase Equilibria, Sequence, and Tg in Copolymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18659v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Copolymerization is commonly employed to tune polymers' glass formation and improve properties such as ion conductivity and adhesion. Classically, mixing rules such as the Fox equation are employed to explain glass transition temperature (Tg) variations with copolymer composition. However, many copolymers deviate from these mixing rules in a manner that is monomer-sequence sensitive. We perform molecular dynamics simulations to probe the interplay between copolymer sequence, liquid-liquid phase equilibria, and Tg. We find that the direction and sequence-dependence of Tg shift are predicted by the liquid-liquid phase behavior of the comonomers. Systems tending towards Upper Critical Solution Temperature behavior negative Tg deviations, while systems tending towards Lower Critical Solution Temperature behavior exhibit positive Tg deviations. In both cases, this effect is strengthened with increasing alternation - a consequence of bond-induced forced mixing. These results inform strategies for rationally varying copolymer Tg, at fixed composition, via design of polymer chain sequence.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal Binary-fluid Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although effective non-reciprocal interactions have been investigated in a variety of fields, their consequences have not been explored in hydrodynamical turbulence. We initiate such an exploration by introducing non-reciprocal binary-fluid tubulence and uncover its properties by developing a two-dimensional (2D) Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (NRCHNS) model. We show that, as we increase the strength of the non-reciprocal terms, this model displays a hitherto unanticipated type of turbulence, with an inverse cascade of energy and an energy spectrum $E(k)\sim k^{-5/3}$, reminiscent of the well-known inverse cascade in forced, 2D fluid turbulence, but distinct from it, in so far as it develops a non-reciprocal flux $\mathbf J$. We demonstrate how NRCHNS turbulence suppresses $J(t) = |\mathbf J|$, as the Reynolds number increases. We compare and contrast 2D NRCHNS turbulence with its fluid-turbulence counterpart by examining spectra, fluxes, spectral balances, flow topologies, and signatures of multifractality.</description>
