      <title>EvoPort: An Evolutionary Framework for Portfolio Optimization via Randomized Alpha Discovery and Ensemble-Based Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce EvoPort, a novel evolutionary portfolio optimization method that leverages stochastic exploration over a spectrum of investment pipeline depths. From raw equity data, we employ a randomized feature generation framework that hierarchically produces mathematical, logical, time-series, and cross-sectional operators for uncovering latent trading signals. Candidate alphas are then evaluated through a randomized hill-climbing optimization procedure, taking as guidance performance measures such as mean squared error (MSE) or Sharpe ratio. In order to increase robustness and generalizability further, we use a random ensemble model selection process whereby a heterogeneous set of machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, XG-Boost) are randomly drawn and combined to backtest the generated alphas. Finally, we use randomized portfolio weighting schemes based on the Markowitz modern portfolio theory with stochastic optimization techniques such as inverse volatility, risk parity, and variance-constrained approaches to optimally allocate assets. Our empirical results on real equity datasets demonstrate that EvoPort not only discovers rich sets of heterogeneous predictive signals but also constructs very robust and profitable portfolios. Compared to conventional alpha construction and allocation methods, our approach exhibits significant improvement in cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio, and drawdown control. We highlight the interpretability, scalability, and modularity of EvoPort, and speculate on its use as a general-purpose research pipeline for modern quantitative finance.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Mixture of $t$-Factor Analyzers for Clustering High-dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel hybrid approach for estimating the mixture model of $t$-factor analyzers (MtFA) that employs multivariate $t$-distribution and factor model to cluster and characterize grouped data. The traditional estimation method for MtFA faces computational challenges, particularly in high-dimensional settings, where the eigendecomposition of large covariance matrices and the iterative nature of Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms lead to scalability issues. We propose a computational scheme that integrates a profile likelihood method into the EM framework to efficiently obtain the model parameter estimates. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through simulations showcasing its superior computational efficiency compared to the existing method, while preserving clustering accuracy and resilience against outliers. Our method is applied to cluster the Gamma-ray bursts, reinforcing several claims in the literature that Gamma-ray bursts have heterogeneous subpopulations and providing characterizations of the estimated groups.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Quantile Bayes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a multivariate posterior sampling procedure through deep generative quantile learning. Simulation proceeds implicitly through a push-forward mapping that can transform i.i.d. random vector samples from the posterior. We utilize Monge-Kantorovich depth in multivariate quantiles to directly sample from Bayesian credible sets, a unique feature not offered by typical posterior sampling methods. To enhance the training of the quantile mapping, we design a neural network that automatically performs summary statistic extraction. This additional neural network structure has performance benefits, including support shrinkage (i.e., contraction of our posterior approximation) as the observation sample size increases. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach on several examples where the absence of likelihood renders classical MCMC infeasible. Finally, we provide the following frequentist theoretical justifications for our quantile learning framework: {consistency of the estimated vector quantile, of the recovered posterior distribution, and of the corresponding Bayesian credible sets.</description>

      <title>Consistent and Scalable Composite Likelihood Estimation of Probit Models with Crossed Random Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15681v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimation of crossed random effects models commonly requires computational costs that grow faster than linearly in the sample size $N$, often as fast as $\Omega(N^{3/2})$, making them unsuitable for large data sets. For non-Gaussian responses, integrating out the random effects to get a marginal likelihood brings significant challenges, especially for high dimensional integrals where the Laplace approximation might not be accurate. We develop a composite likelihood approach to probit models that replaces the crossed random effects model with some hierarchical models that require only one-dimensional integrals. We show how to consistently estimate the crossed effects model parameters from the hierarchical model fits. We find that the computation scales linearly in the sample size. We illustrate the method on about five million observations from Stitch Fix where the crossed effects formulation would require an integral of dimension larger than $700{,}000$.</description>

      <title>Topological Graph Simplification Solutions to the Street Intersection Miscount Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00258v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Street intersection counts and densities are ubiquitous measures in transport geography and planning. However, typical street network data and typical street network analysis tools can substantially overcount them. This article explains the three main reasons why this happens and presents solutions to each. It contributes algorithms to automatically simplify spatial graphs of urban street networks -- via edge simplification and node consolidation -- resulting in faster parsimonious models and more accurate network measures like intersection counts and densities, street segment lengths, and node degrees. These algorithms' information compression improves downstream graph analytics' memory and runtime efficiency, boosting analytical tractability without loss of model fidelity. Finally, this article validates these algorithms and empirically assesses intersection count biases worldwide to demonstrate the problem's widespread prevalence. Without consolidation, traditional methods would overestimate the median urban area intersection count by 14\%. However, this bias varies drastically across regions, underscoring these algorithms' importance for consistent comparative empirical analyses.</description>

      <title>Bhirkuti's Relative Efficiency (BRE): Examining its Performance in Psychometric Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional Relative Efficiency (RE), based solely on variance, has limitations in evaluating estimator performance, particularly in planned missing data designs. We introduce Bhirkuti's Relative Efficiency (BRE), a novel metric that integrates precision and accuracy to provide a more robust assessment of efficiency. To compute BRE, we use interquartile range (IQR) overlap to measure precision and apply a bias adjustment factor based on the absolute median relative bias (AMRB). Monte Carlo simulations using a Latent Growth Model (LGM) with planned missing data illustrate that BRE maintains theoretically consistency and interpretability, avoiding paradoxes such as RE exceeding 100%. Visualizations via boxplots and ridgeline plots confirm that BRE provides a stable and meaningful estimator efficiency evaluation, making it a valuable advancement in psychometric and statistical modeling. By addressing fundamental weaknesses in traditional RE, BRE provides a superior, theoretically justified alternative for relative efficiency in psychometric modeling, structural equation modeling, and missing data research. This advancement enhances data-driven decision-making and offers a methodologically rigorous tool for researchers analyzing incomplete datasets.</description>
