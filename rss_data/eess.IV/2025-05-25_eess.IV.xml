      <title>Distillation-Enabled Knowledge Alignment Protocol for Semantic Communication in AI Agent Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future networks are envisioned to connect massive artificial intelligence (AI) agents, enabling their extensive collaboration on diverse tasks. Compared to traditional entities, these agents naturally suit the semantic communication (SC), which can significantly enhance the bandwidth efficiency. Nevertheless, SC requires the knowledge among agents to be aligned, while agents have distinct expert knowledge for their individual tasks in practice. In this paper, we propose a distillation-enabled knowledge alignment protocol (DeKAP), which distills the expert knowledge of each agent into parameter-efficient low-rank matrices, allocates them across the network, and allows agents to simultaneously maintain aligned knowledge for multiple tasks. We formulate the joint minimization of alignment loss, communication overhead, and storage cost as a large-scale integer linear programming problem and develop a highly efficient greedy algorithm. From computer simulation, the DeKAP establishes knowledge alignment with the lowest communication and computation resources compared to conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>TAGS: 3D Tumor-Adaptive Guidance for SAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) such as CLIP and SAM have recently shown great promise in image segmentation tasks, yet their adaptation to 3D medical imaging-particularly for pathology detection and segmentation-remains underexplored. A critical challenge arises from the domain gap between natural images and medical volumes: existing FMs, pre-trained on 2D data, struggle to capture 3D anatomical context, limiting their utility in clinical applications like tumor segmentation. To address this, we propose an adaptation framework called TAGS: Tumor Adaptive Guidance for SAM, which unlocks 2D FMs for 3D medical tasks through multi-prompt fusion. By preserving most of the pre-trained weights, our approach enhances SAM's spatial feature extraction using CLIP's semantic insights and anatomy-specific prompts. Extensive experiments on three open-source tumor segmentation datasets prove that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models (+46.88% over nnUNet), interactive segmentation frameworks, and other established medical FMs, including SAM-Med2D, SAM-Med3D, SegVol, Universal, 3D-Adapter, and SAM-B (at least +13% over them). This highlights the robustness and adaptability of our proposed framework across diverse medical segmentation tasks.</description>

      <title>Assessing the generalization performance of SAM for ureteroscopy scene understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The segmentation of kidney stones is regarded as a critical preliminary step to enable the identification of urinary stone types through machine- or deep-learning-based approaches. In urology, manual segmentation is considered tedious and impractical due to the typically large scale of image databases and the continuous generation of new data. In this study, the potential of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) -- a state-of-the-art deep learning framework -- is investigated for the automation of kidney stone segmentation. The performance of SAM is evaluated in comparison to traditional models, including U-Net, Residual U-Net, and Attention U-Net, which, despite their efficiency, frequently exhibit limitations in generalizing to unseen datasets. The findings highlight SAM's superior adaptability and efficiency. While SAM achieves comparable performance to U-Net on in-distribution data (Accuracy: 97.68 + 3.04; Dice: 97.78 + 2.47; IoU: 95.76 + 4.18), it demonstrates significantly enhanced generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution data, surpassing all U-Net variants by margins of up to 23 percent.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Adaptation of Pre-trained Vision Backbones for Energy-Efficient Image Coding for Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image Coding for Machines (ICM) focuses on optimizing image compression for AI-driven analysis rather than human perception. Existing ICM frameworks often rely on separate codecs for specific tasks, leading to significant storage requirements, training overhead, and computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient framework that leverages pre-trained vision backbones to extract robust and versatile latent representations suitable for multiple tasks. We introduce a task-specific low-rank adaptation mechanism, which refines the pre-trained features to be both compressible and tailored to downstream applications. This design minimizes trainable parameters and reduces energy costs for multi-task scenarios. By jointly optimizing task performance and entropy minimization, our method enables efficient adaptation to diverse tasks and datasets without full fine-tuning, achieving high coding efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms traditional codecs and pre-processors, offering an energy-efficient and effective solution for ICM applications. The code and the supplementary materials will be available at: https://gitlab.com/viper-purdue/efficient-compression.</description>

      <title>SUFFICIENT: A scan-specific unsupervised deep learning framework for high-resolution 3D isotropic fetal brain MRI reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality 3D fetal brain MRI reconstruction from motion-corrupted 2D slices is crucial for clinical diagnosis. Reliable slice-to-volume registration (SVR)-based motion correction and super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) methods are essential. Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing SVR and SRR when compared to conventional methods. However, it requires large-scale external training datasets, which are difficult to obtain for clinical fetal MRI. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised iterative SVR-SRR framework for isotropic HR volume reconstruction. Specifically, SVR is formulated as a function mapping a 2D slice and a 3D target volume to a rigid transformation matrix, which aligns the slice to the underlying location in the target volume. The function is parameterized by a convolutional neural network, which is trained by minimizing the difference between the volume slicing at the predicted position and the input slice. In SRR, a decoding network embedded within a deep image prior framework is incorporated with a comprehensive image degradation model to produce the high-resolution (HR) volume. The deep image prior framework offers a local consistency prior to guide the reconstruction of HR volumes. By performing a forward degradation model, the HR volume is optimized by minimizing loss between predicted slices and the observed slices. Comprehensive experiments conducted on large-magnitude motion-corrupted simulation data and clinical data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework over state-of-the-art fetal brain reconstruction frameworks.</description>

      <title>Anatomy-Guided Multitask Learning for MRI-Based Classification of Placenta Accreta Spectrum and its Subtypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Placenta Accreta Spectrum Disorders (PAS) pose significant risks during pregnancy, frequently leading to postpartum hemorrhage during cesarean deliveries and other severe clinical complications, with bleeding severity correlating to the degree of placental invasion. Consequently, accurate prenatal diagnosis of PAS and its subtypes-placenta accreta (PA), placenta increta (PI), and placenta percreta (PP)-is crucial. However, existing guidelines and methodologies predominantly focus on the presence of PAS, with limited research addressing subtype recognition. Additionally, previous multi-class diagnostic efforts have primarily relied on inefficient two-stage cascaded binary classification tasks. In this study, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed for efficient one-stage multiclass diagnosis of PAS and its subtypes, based on 4,140 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) slices. Our model features two branches: the main classification branch utilizes a residual block architecture comprising multiple residual blocks, while the second branch integrates anatomical features of the uteroplacental area and the adjacent uterine serous layer to enhance the model's attention during classification. Furthermore, we implement a multitask learning strategy to leverage both branches effectively. Experiments conducted on a real clinical dataset demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>DECT-based Space-Squeeze Method for Multi-Class Classification of Metastatic Lymph Nodes in Breast Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Accurate assessment of metastatic burden in axillary lymph nodes is crucial for guiding breast cancer treatment decisions, yet conventional imaging modalities struggle to differentiate metastatic burden levels and capture comprehensive lymph node characteristics. This study leverages dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) to exploit spectral-spatial information for improved multi-class classification. Purpose: To develop a noninvasive DECT-based model classifying sentinel lymph nodes into three categories: no metastasis ($N_0$), low metastatic burden ($N_{+(1-2)}$), and heavy metastatic burden ($N_{+(\geq3)}$), thereby aiding therapeutic planning. Methods: We propose a novel space-squeeze method combining two innovations: (1) a channel-wise attention mechanism to compress and recalibrate spectral-spatial features across 11 energy levels, and (2) virtual class injection to sharpen inter-class boundaries and compact intra-class variations in the representation space. Results: Evaluated on 227 biopsy-confirmed cases, our method achieved an average test AUC of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80-0.91) across three cross-validation folds, outperforming established CNNs (VGG, ResNet, etc). The channel-wise attention and virtual class components individually improved AUC by 5.01% and 5.87%, respectively, demonstrating complementary benefits. Conclusions: The proposed framework enhances diagnostic AUC by effectively integrating DECT's spectral-spatial data and mitigating class ambiguity, offering a promising tool for noninvasive metastatic burden assessment in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>FreqU-FNet: Frequency-Aware U-Net for Imbalanced Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation faces persistent challenges due to severe class imbalance and the frequency-specific distribution of anatomical structures. Most conventional CNN-based methods operate in the spatial domain and struggle to capture minority class signals, often affected by frequency aliasing and limited spectral selectivity. Transformer-based models, while powerful in modeling global dependencies, tend to overlook critical local details necessary for fine-grained segmentation. To overcome these limitations, we propose FreqU-FNet, a novel U-shaped segmentation architecture operating in the frequency domain. Our framework incorporates a Frequency Encoder that leverages Low-Pass Frequency Convolution and Daubechies wavelet-based downsampling to extract multi-scale spectral features. To reconstruct fine spatial details, we introduce a Spatial Learnable Decoder (SLD) equipped with an adaptive multi-branch upsampling strategy. Furthermore, we design a frequency-aware loss (FAL) function to enhance minority class learning. Extensive experiments on multiple medical segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that FreqU-FNet consistently outperforms both CNN and Transformer baselines, particularly in handling under-represented classes, by effectively exploiting discriminative frequency bands.</description>

      <title>Distance Estimation in Outdoor Driving Environments Using Phase-only Correlation Method with Event Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing adoption of autonomous driving, the advancement of sensor technology is crucial for ensuring safety and reliable operation. Sensor fusion techniques that combine multiple sensors such as LiDAR, radar, and cameras have proven effective, but the integration of multiple devices increases both hardware complexity and cost. Therefore, developing a single sensor capable of performing multiple roles is highly desirable for cost-efficient and scalable autonomous driving systems.
  Event cameras have emerged as a promising solution due to their unique characteristics, including high dynamic range, low latency, and high temporal resolution. These features enable them to perform well in challenging lighting conditions, such as low-light or backlit environments. Moreover, their ability to detect fine-grained motion events makes them suitable for applications like pedestrian detection and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication via visible light.
  In this study, we present a method for distance estimation using a monocular event camera and a roadside LED bar. By applying a phase-only correlation technique to the event data, we achieve sub-pixel precision in detecting the spatial shift between two light sources. This enables accurate triangulation-based distance estimation without requiring stereo vision. Field experiments conducted in outdoor driving scenarios demonstrated that the proposed approach achieves over 90% success rate with less than 0.5-meter error for distances ranging from 20 to 60 meters.
  Future work includes extending this method to full position estimation by leveraging infrastructure such as smart poles equipped with LEDs, enabling event-camera-based vehicles to determine their own position in real time. This advancement could significantly enhance navigation accuracy, route optimization, and integration into intelligent transportation systems.</description>

      <title>A Unified Multi-Scale Attention-Based Network for Automatic 3D Segmentation of Lung Parenchyma &amp; Nodules In Thoracic CT Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lung cancer has been one of the major threats across the world with the highest mortalities. Computer-aided detection (CAD) can help in early detection and thus can help increase the survival rate. Accurate lung parenchyma segmentation (to include the juxta-pleural nodules) and lung nodule segmentation, the primary symptom of lung cancer, play a crucial role in the overall accuracy of the Lung CAD pipeline. Lung nodule segmentation is quite challenging because of the diverse nodule types and other inhibit structures present within the lung lobes. Traditional machine/deep learning methods suffer from generalization and robustness. Recent Vision Language Models/Foundation Models perform well on the anatomical level, but they suffer on fine-grained segmentation tasks, and their semi-automatic nature limits their effectiveness in real-time clinical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel method for accurate 3D segmentation of lung parenchyma and lung nodules. The proposed architecture is an attention-based network with residual blocks at each encoder-decoder state. Max pooling is replaced by strided convolutions at the encoder, and trilinear interpolation is replaced by transposed convolutions at the decoder to maximize the number of learnable parameters. Dilated convolutions at each encoder-decoder stage allow the model to capture the larger context without increasing computational costs. The proposed method has been evaluated extensively on one of the largest publicly available datasets, namely LUNA16, and is compared with recent notable work in the domain using standard performance metrics like Dice score, IOU, etc. It can be seen from the results that the proposed method achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Towards Prospective Medical Image Reconstruction via Knowledge-Informed Dynamic Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image reconstruction from measurement data is a vital but challenging inverse problem. Deep learning approaches have achieved promising results, but often requires paired measurement and high-quality images, which is typically simulated through a forward model, i.e., retrospective reconstruction. However, training on simulated pairs commonly leads to performance degradation on real prospective data due to the retrospective-to-prospective gap caused by incomplete imaging knowledge in simulation. To address this challenge, this paper introduces imaging Knowledge-Informed Dynamic Optimal Transport (KIDOT), a novel dynamic optimal transport framework with optimality in the sense of preserving consistency with imaging physics in transport, that conceptualizes reconstruction as finding a dynamic transport path. KIDOT learns from unpaired data by modeling reconstruction as a continuous evolution path from measurements to images, guided by an imaging knowledge-informed cost function and transport equation. This dynamic and knowledge-aware approach enhances robustness and better leverages unpaired data while respecting acquisition physics. Theoretically, we demonstrate that KIDOT naturally generalizes dynamic optimal transport, ensuring its mathematical rationale and solution existence. Extensive experiments on MRI and CT reconstruction demonstrate KIDOT's superior performance.</description>

      <title>Dual Attention Residual U-Net for Accurate Brain Ultrasound Segmentation in IVH Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a severe neurological complication among premature infants, necessitating early and accurate detection from brain ultrasound (US) images to improve clinical outcomes. While recent deep learning methods offer promise for computer-aided diagnosis, challenges remain in capturing both local spatial details and global contextual dependencies critical for segmenting brain anatomies. In this work, we propose an enhanced Residual U-Net architecture incorporating two complementary attention mechanisms: the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and a Sparse Attention Layer (SAL). The CBAM improves the model's ability to refine spatial and channel-wise features, while the SAL introduces a dual-branch design, sparse attention filters out low-confidence query-key pairs to suppress noise, and dense attention ensures comprehensive information propagation. Extensive experiments on the Brain US dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance, with a Dice score of 89.04% and IoU of 81.84% for ventricle region segmentation. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating spatial refinement and attention sparsity for robust brain anatomy detection.

      <title>UltraBoneUDF: Self-supervised Bone Surface Reconstruction from Ultrasound Based on Neural Unsigned Distance Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Bone surface reconstruction plays a critical role in computer-assisted orthopedic surgery. Compared to traditional imaging modalities such as CT and MRI, ultrasound offers a radiation-free, cost-effective, and portable alternative. Continuous bone surface reconstruction can be employed for many clinical applications. However, due to the inherent limitations of ultrasound imaging, B-mode ultrasound typically capture only partial bone surfaces. Existing reconstruction methods struggle with such incomplete data, leading to artifacts and increased reconstruction errors. Effective techniques for accurately reconstructing thin and open bone surfaces from real-world 3D ultrasound volumes remain lacking. Methods: We propose UltraBoneUDF, a self-supervised framework designed for reconstructing open bone surfaces from ultrasound using neural Unsigned Distance Functions. To enhance reconstruction quality, we introduce a novel global feature extractor that effectively fuses ultrasound-specific image characteristics. Additionally, we present a novel loss function based on local tangent plane optimization that substantially improves surface reconstruction quality. UltraBoneUDF and baseline models are extensively evaluated on four open-source datasets. Results: Qualitative results highlight the limitations of the state-of-the-art methods for open bone surface reconstruction and demonstrate the effectiveness of UltraBoneUDF. Quantitatively, UltraBoneUDF significantly outperforms competing methods across all evaluated datasets for both open and closed bone surface reconstruction in terms of mean Chamfer distance error: 1.10 mm on the UltraBones100k dataset (39.6\% improvement compared to the SOTA), 0.23 mm on the OpenBoneCT dataset (69.3\% improvement), 0.18 mm on the ClosedBoneCT dataset (70.2\% improvement), and 0.05 mm on the Prostate dataset (55.3\% improvement).</description>

      <title>Promptable cancer segmentation using minimal expert-curated data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated segmentation of cancer on medical images can aid targeted diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. However, its adoption is limited by the high cost of expert annotations required for training and inter-observer variability in datasets. While weakly-supervised methods mitigate some challenges, using binary histology labels for training as opposed to requiring full segmentation, they require large paired datasets of histology and images, which are difficult to curate. Similarly, promptable segmentation aims to allow segmentation with no re-training for new tasks at inference, however, existing models perform poorly on pathological regions, again necessitating large datasets for training. In this work we propose a novel approach for promptable segmentation requiring only 24 fully-segmented images, supplemented by 8 weakly-labelled images, for training. Curating this minimal data to a high standard is relatively feasible and thus issues with the cost and variability of obtaining labels can be mitigated. By leveraging two classifiers, one weakly-supervised and one fully-supervised, our method refines segmentation through a guided search process initiated by a single-point prompt. Our approach outperforms existing promptable segmentation methods, and performs comparably with fully-supervised methods, for the task of prostate cancer segmentation, while using substantially less annotated data (up to 100X less). This enables promptable segmentation with very minimal labelled data, such that the labels can be curated to a very high standard.</description>

      <title>Explainable Anatomy-Guided AI for Prostate MRI: Foundation Models and In Silico Clinical Trials for Virtual Biopsy-based Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully automated, anatomically guided deep learning pipeline for prostate cancer (PCa) risk stratification using routine MRI. The pipeline integrates three key components: an nnU-Net module for segmenting the prostate gland and its zones on axial T2-weighted MRI; a classification module based on the UMedPT Swin Transformer foundation model, fine-tuned on 3D patches with optional anatomical priors and clinical data; and a VAE-GAN framework for generating counterfactual heatmaps that localize decision-driving image regions. The system was developed using 1,500 PI-CAI cases for segmentation and 617 biparametric MRIs with metadata from the CHAIMELEON challenge for classification (split into 70% training, 10% validation, and 20% testing). Segmentation achieved mean Dice scores of 0.95 (gland), 0.94 (peripheral zone), and 0.92 (transition zone). Incorporating gland priors improved AUC from 0.69 to 0.72, with a three-scale ensemble achieving top performance (AUC = 0.79, composite score = 0.76), outperforming the 2024 CHAIMELEON challenge winners. Counterfactual heatmaps reliably highlighted lesions within segmented regions, enhancing model interpretability. In a prospective multi-center in-silico trial with 20 clinicians, AI assistance increased diagnostic accuracy from 0.72 to 0.77 and Cohen's kappa from 0.43 to 0.53, while reducing review time per case by 40%. These results demonstrate that anatomy-aware foundation models with counterfactual explainability can enable accurate, interpretable, and efficient PCa risk assessment, supporting their potential use as virtual biopsies in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>A Foundation Model Framework for Multi-View MRI Classification of Extramural Vascular Invasion and Mesorectal Fascia Invasion in Rectal Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Accurate MRI-based identification of extramural vascular invasion (EVI) and mesorectal fascia invasion (MFI) is pivotal for risk-stratified management of rectal cancer, yet visual assessment is subjective and vulnerable to inter-institutional variability. Purpose: To develop and externally evaluate a multicenter, foundation-model-driven framework that automatically classifies EVI and MFI on axial and sagittal T2-weighted MRI. Methods: This retrospective study used 331 pre-treatment rectal cancer MRI examinations from three European hospitals. After TotalSegmentator-guided rectal patch extraction, a self-supervised frequency-domain harmonization pipeline was trained to minimize scanner-related contrast shifts. Four classifiers were compared: ResNet50, SeResNet, the universal biomedical pretrained transformer (UMedPT) with a lightweight MLP head, and a logistic-regression variant using frozen UMedPT features (UMedPT_LR). Results: UMedPT_LR achieved the best EVI detection when axial and sagittal features were fused (AUC = 0.82; sensitivity = 0.75; F1 score = 0.73), surpassing the Chaimeleon Grand-Challenge winner (AUC = 0.74). The highest MFI performance was attained by UMedPT on axial harmonized images (AUC = 0.77), surpassing the Chaimeleon Grand-Challenge winner (AUC = 0.75). Frequency-domain harmonization improved MFI classification but variably affected EVI performance. Conventional CNNs (ResNet50, SeResNet) underperformed, especially in F1 score and balanced accuracy. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that combining foundation model features, harmonization, and multi-view fusion significantly enhances diagnostic performance in rectal MRI.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Learned Image Compression Through Modeling Neural Training Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As learned image compression (LIC) methods become increasingly computationally demanding, enhancing their training efficiency is crucial. This paper takes a step forward in accelerating the training of LIC methods by modeling the neural training dynamics. We first propose a Sensitivity-aware True and Dummy Embedding Training mechanism (STDET) that clusters LIC model parameters into few separate modes where parameters are expressed as affine transformations of reference parameters within the same mode. By further utilizing the stable intra-mode correlations throughout training and parameter sensitivities, we gradually embed non-reference parameters, reducing the number of trainable parameters. Additionally, we incorporate a Sampling-then-Moving Average (SMA) technique, interpolating sampled weights from stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training to obtain the moving average weights, ensuring smooth temporal behavior and minimizing training state variances. Overall, our method significantly reduces training space dimensions and the number of trainable parameters without sacrificing model performance, thus accelerating model convergence. We also provide a theoretical analysis on the Noisy quadratic model, showing that the proposed method achieves a lower training variance than standard SGD. Our approach offers valuable insights for further developing efficient training methods for LICs.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Multispectral Crop-Weed Segmentation for Precision Agriculture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient crop-weed segmentation is critical for site-specific weed control in precision agriculture. Conventional CNN-based methods struggle to generalize and rely on RGB imagery, limiting performance under complex field conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight transformer-CNN hybrid. It processes RGB, Near-Infrared (NIR), and Red-Edge (RE) bands using specialized encoders and dynamic modality integration. Evaluated on the WeedsGalore dataset, the model achieves a segmentation accuracy (mean IoU) of 78.88%, outperforming RGB-only models by 15.8 percentage points. With only 8.7 million parameters, the model offers high accuracy, computational efficiency, and potential for real-time deployment on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and edge devices, advancing precision weed management.</description>

      <title>Dual Ascent Diffusion for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ill-posed inverse problems are fundamental in many domains, ranging from astrophysics to medical imaging. Emerging diffusion models provide a powerful prior for solving these problems. Existing maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) or posterior sampling approaches, however, rely on different computational approximations, leading to inaccurate or suboptimal samples. To address this issue, we introduce a new approach to solving MAP problems with diffusion model priors using a dual ascent optimization framework. Our framework achieves better image quality as measured by various metrics for image restoration problems, it is more robust to high levels of measurement noise, it is faster, and it estimates solutions that represent the observations more faithfully than the state of the art.</description>

      <title>From Flight to Insight: Semantic 3D Reconstruction for Aerial Inspection via Gaussian Splatting and Language-Guided Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity 3D reconstruction is critical for aerial inspection tasks such as infrastructure monitoring, structural assessment, and environmental surveying. While traditional photogrammetry techniques enable geometric modeling, they lack semantic interpretability, limiting their effectiveness for automated inspection workflows. Recent advances in neural rendering and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offer efficient, photorealistic reconstructions but similarly lack scene-level understanding.
  In this work, we present a UAV-based pipeline that extends Feature-3DGS for language-guided 3D segmentation. We leverage LSeg-based feature fields with CLIP embeddings to generate heatmaps in response to language prompts. These are thresholded to produce rough segmentations, and the highest-scoring point is then used as a prompt to SAM or SAM2 for refined 2D segmentation on novel view renderings. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of various feature field backbones (CLIP-LSeg, SAM, SAM2) in capturing meaningful structure in large-scale outdoor environments. We demonstrate that this hybrid approach enables flexible, language-driven interaction with photorealistic 3D reconstructions, opening new possibilities for semantic aerial inspection and scene understanding.</description>

      <title>F-ANcGAN: An Attention-Enhanced Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Architecture for Synthetic Image Generation of Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanomaterial research is becoming a vital area for energy, medicine, and materials science, and accurate analysis of the nanoparticle topology is essential to determine their properties. Unfortunately, the lack of high-quality annotated datasets drastically hinders the creation of strong segmentation models for nanoscale imaging. To alleviate this problem, we introduce F-ANcGAN, an attention-enhanced cycle consistent generative adversarial system that can be trained using a limited number of data samples and generates realistic scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images directly from segmentation maps. Our model uses a Style U-Net generator and a U-Net segmentation network equipped with self-attention to capture structural relationships and applies augmentation methods to increase the variety of the dataset. The architecture reached a raw FID score of 17.65 for TiO$_2$ dataset generation, with a further reduction in FID score to nearly 10.39 by using efficient post-processing techniques. By facilitating scalable high-fidelity synthetic dataset generation, our approach can improve the effectiveness of downstream segmentation task training, overcoming severe data shortage issues in nanoparticle analysis, thus extending its applications to resource-limited fields.</description>

      <title>Groupwise Image Registration with Edge-Based Loss for Low-SNR Cardiac MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To perform image registration and averaging of multiple free-breathing single-shot cardiac images, where the individual images may have a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
  Methods: To address low SNR encountered in single-shot imaging, especially at low field strengths, we propose a fast deep learning (DL)-based image registration method, called Averaging Morph with Edge Detection (AiM-ED). AiM-ED jointly registers multiple noisy source images to a noisy target image and utilizes a noise-robust pre-trained edge detector to define the training loss. We validate AiM-ED using synthetic late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) images from the MR extended cardiac-torso (MRXCAT) phantom and free-breathing single-shot LGE images from healthy subjects (24 slices) and patients (5 slices) under various levels of added noise. Additionally, we demonstrate the clinical feasibility of AiM-ED by applying it to data from patients (6 slices) scanned on a 0.55T scanner.
  Results: Compared to a traditional energy-minimization-based image registration method and DL-based VoxelMorph, images registered using AiM-ED exhibit higher values of recovery SNR and three perceptual image quality metrics. An ablation study shows the benefit of both jointly processing multiple source images and using an edge map in AiM-ED.
  Conclusion: For single-shot LGE imaging, AiM-ED outperforms existing image registration methods in terms of image quality. With fast inference, minimal training data requirements, and robust performance at various noise levels, AiM-ED has the potential to benefit single-shot CMR applications.</description>

      <title>Rapid Whole Brain Motion-robust Mesoscale In-vivo MR Imaging using Multi-scale Implicit Neural Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-resolution whole-brain in vivo MR imaging at mesoscale resolutions remains challenging due to long scan durations, motion artifacts, and limited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This study proposes Rotating-view super-resolution (ROVER)-MRI, an unsupervised framework based on multi-scale implicit neural representations (INR), enabling efficient recovery of fine anatomical details from multi-view thick-slice acquisitions. ROVER-MRI employs coordinate-based neural networks to implicitly and continuously encode image structures at multiple spatial scales, simultaneously modeling anatomical continuity and correcting inter-view motion through an integrated registration mechanism. Validation on ex-vivo monkey brain data and multiple in-vivo human datasets demonstrates substantially improved reconstruction performance compared to bicubic interpolation and state-of-the-art regularized least-squares super-resolution reconstruction (LS-SRR) with 2-fold reduction in scan time. Notably, ROVER-MRI achieves an unprecedented whole-brain in-vivo T2-weighted imaging at 180 micron isotropic resolution in only 17 minutes of scan time on a 7T scanner with 22.4% lower relative error compared to LS-SRR. We also demonstrate improved SNR using ROVER-MRI compared to a time-matched 3D GRE acquisition. Quantitative results on several datasets demonstrate better sharpness of the reconstructed images with ROVER-MRI for different super-resolution factors (5 to 11). These findings highlight ROVER-MRI's potential as a rapid, accurate, and motion-resilient mesoscale imaging solution, promising substantial advantages for neuroimaging studies.</description>

      <title>Fourier-Based 3D Multistage Transformer for Aberration Correction in Multicellular Specimens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-resolution tissue imaging is often compromised by sample-induced optical aberrations that degrade resolution and contrast. While wavefront sensor-based adaptive optics (AO) can measure these aberrations, such hardware solutions are typically complex, expensive to implement, and slow when serially mapping spatially varying aberrations across large fields of view. Here, we introduce AOViFT (Adaptive Optical Vision Fourier Transformer) -- a machine learning-based aberration sensing framework built around a 3D multistage Vision Transformer that operates on Fourier domain embeddings. AOViFT infers aberrations and restores diffraction-limited performance in puncta-labeled specimens with substantially reduced computational cost, training time, and memory footprint compared to conventional architectures or real-space networks. We validated AOViFT on live gene-edited zebrafish embryos, demonstrating its ability to correct spatially varying aberrations using either a deformable mirror or post-acquisition deconvolution. By eliminating the need for the guide star and wavefront sensing hardware and simplifying the experimental workflow, AOViFT lowers technical barriers for high-resolution volumetric microscopy across diverse biological samples.</description>

      <title>CostFilter-AD: Enhancing Anomaly Detection through Matching Cost Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) seeks to localize the anomaly mask of an input image with respect to normal samples. Either by reconstructing normal counterparts (reconstruction-based) or by learning an image feature embedding space (embedding-based), existing approaches fundamentally rely on image-level or feature-level matching to derive anomaly scores. Often, such a matching process is inaccurate yet overlooked, leading to sub-optimal detection. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of cost filtering, borrowed from classical matching tasks, such as depth and flow estimation, into the UAD problem. We call this approach {\em CostFilter-AD}. Specifically, we first construct a matching cost volume between the input and normal samples, comprising two spatial dimensions and one matching dimension that encodes potential matches. To refine this, we propose a cost volume filtering network, guided by the input observation as an attention query across multiple feature layers, which effectively suppresses matching noise while preserving edge structures and capturing subtle anomalies. Designed as a generic post-processing plug-in, CostFilter-AD can be integrated with either reconstruction-based or embedding-based methods. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA benchmarks validate the generic benefits of CostFilter-AD for both single- and multi-class UAD tasks. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/ZHE-SAPI/CostFilter-AD.</description>

      <title>D3C2-Net: Dual-Domain Deep Convolutional Coding Network for Compressive Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.13560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By mapping iterative optimization algorithms into neural networks (NNs), deep unfolding networks (DUNs) exhibit well-defined and interpretable structures and achieve remarkable success in the field of compressive sensing (CS). However, most existing DUNs solely rely on the image-domain unfolding, which restricts the information transmission capacity and reconstruction flexibility, leading to their loss of image details and unsatisfactory performance. To overcome these limitations, this paper develops a dual-domain optimization framework that combines the priors of (1) image- and (2) convolutional-coding-domains and offers generality to CS and other inverse imaging tasks. By converting this optimization framework into deep NN structures, we present a Dual-Domain Deep Convolutional Coding Network (D3C2-Net), which enjoys the ability to efficiently transmit high-capacity self-adaptive convolutional features across all its unfolded stages. Our theoretical analyses and experiments on simulated and real captured data, covering 2D and 3D natural, medical, and scientific signals, demonstrate the effectiveness, practicality, superior performance, and generalization ability of our method over other competing approaches and its significant potential in achieving a balance among accuracy, complexity, and interpretability.

Abstract: Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a tomographic imaging modality capable of real-time, high-sensitivity mapping of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. Model-based image reconstruction provides an alternative to conventional methods that rely on a measured system matrix, eliminating the need for laborious calibration measurements. Nevertheless, model-based approaches must account for the complexities of the imaging chain to maintain high image quality. A recently proposed direct reconstruction method leverages weighted Chebyshev polynomials in the frequency domain, removing the need for a simulated system matrix. However, the underlying model neglects key physical effects, such as nanoparticle anisotropy, leading to distortions in reconstructed images. To mitigate these artifacts, an adapted direct Chebyshev reconstruction (DCR) method incorporates a spatially variant deconvolution step, significantly improving reconstruction accuracy at the cost of increased computational demands. In this work, we evaluate the adapted DCR on six experimental phantoms, demonstrating enhanced reconstruction quality in real measurements and achieving image fidelity comparable to or exceeding that of simulated system matrix reconstruction. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient approximation for the spatially variable deconvolution, reducing both runtime and memory consumption while maintaining accuracy. This method achieves computational complexity of O(N log N ), making it particularly beneficial for high-resolution and three-dimensional imaging. Our results highlight the potential of the adapted DCR approach for improving model-based MPI reconstruction in practical applications.</description>
