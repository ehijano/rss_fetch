      <title>Generating the symmetric group by three prefix reversals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cubic pancake graphs are Cayley graphs over the symmetric group $\mathrm{Sym}_n$ generated by three prefix reversals. There is the following open problem: characterize all the sets of three prefix reversals that generate $\mathrm{Sym}_n$. We present a partial answer to this problem, in particular, we characterize all generating sets of three elements that contain at least one of the prefix reversals $r_2, r_3, r_{n-2}$, and $r_{n-1}$. We also give some computational results relating to the diameter and the girth of some cubic pancake graphs.</description>

      <title>Triple systems with bounded matching number: some constructions and exact Tur\'{a}n number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Tur\'{a}n numbers of $3$-graphs avoiding $3$-graphs $F$ and $M_{s+1}^3$, a matching of size $s+1$. We disprove a conjecture of Gerbner, Tompkins, and Zhou [European Journal of Combinatorics, 2025, 127:104155] on $\ex(n,\{F,M^3_{s+1}\})$ for $3$-graph $F$ with $\chi(F)=2$ by constructing infinitely many counterexamples. For this family, we determine the asymptotic Tur\'{a}n number via edge-colored Tur\'{a}n problem. In addition, for the $3$-graph $F_{3,2}$ with edge set $\{123,145,245,345\}$, we determine the exact value of $\ex(n,\{F_{3,2}, M_{s+1}^3\})$ for every integers $s$ and all $n \ge 12s^2$.</description>

      <title>Affine Jacobi-Trudi formulas and $q,t$-Rogers-Ramanujan identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conjecture affine or Hall-Littlewood analogues of the dual Jacobi-Trudi formulas for orthogonal and symplectic Schur functions indexed by rectangular partitions of maximal height. These conjectures are then used to derive $t$-analogues of many known Rogers-Ramanujan identities for the characters of standard modules of affine Lie algebras. This includes $t$-analogues of the classical Rogers-Ramanujan identities, (some of) the Andrews-Gordon identities and the $\mathrm{C}_n^{(1)}$, $\mathrm{A}_{2n}^{(2)}$ and $\mathrm{D}_{n+2}^{(2)}$ GOW identities. We also prove an affine analogue of the dual Jacobi-Trudi formula for Schur functions indexed by rectangular partitions of arbitrary height.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional quadrangle condition and cuboctahedra in latin hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-known quadrangle criterion states that a latin square is istopic to the Cayley table of a group if and only if all quadrangles spanned by the same triple of symbols coincide in the fourth symbol. Gowers and Long (2020) reformulated it in the following way: the Cayley tables of the most associative quasigroups have the maximum number of octahedra.
  In the present paper, we state the multidimensional quadrangle condition for $d$-dimensional latin hypercubes in terms of the reconstruction of subcubes of order $2$ from a bundle of $d+1$ entries and in terms of the maximal number of cuboctahedra. In particular, we show that the must associative $d$-ary quasigroups have Cayley tables such that every $2$-dimensional plane is isotopic to a latin square principally isotopic to the Cayley table of a group. We also estimate the number of cuboctahedra in latin squares and hypercubes from below and provide some computational results.</description>

      <title>Exact results and the structure of extremal families for the Duke--Erd\H{o}s forbidden sunflower problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1977, Duke and Erd\H{o}s asked the following general question: What is the largest size of a family $\mathtt{F} \subset \binom{[n]}{k}$ that does not contain a sunflower with $s$ petals and core of size exactly $t - 1$? This problem is closely related to the famous Erd\H{o}s--Rado sunflower problem of determining the size $\phi(s,t)$ of the largest $t$-uniform family with no $s$-sunflower. In this paper, we answer this question exactly for $t=2$, odd $s$ and $k\ge 5$, provided $n$ is large enough. Previously, the only know exact extremal result on this problem was due to Chung and Frankl from 1987.
  One of the important ingredients for the proof that we obtained is a stability result for the Duke--Erd\H{o}s problem, which was previously not known, mostly due to our lack of understanding of the behaviour of $\phi(s,t)$.
  For large $k$ and $n$ we in fact manage to reduce the Duke--Erd\H{o}s problem to an Erd\H{o}s--Rado-like problem which depends on $t$ and $s$ only. In particular, we get a good understanding of the structure of extremal families for the Duke--Erd\H{o}s problem in terms of the Erd\H{o}s--Rado problem. Previously, a much looser variant of this connection (only in terms of the sizes, rather than the structure, of respective extremal families) was established in a seminal work of Frankl and F\"uredi from 1987.</description>

      <title>Independent sets and colorings of $K_{t,t,t}$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ajtai, Erd\H{o}s, Koml\'os, and Szemer\'edi conjectured in 1981 that for every graph $F$, every $n$-vertex $F$-free graph of average degree $d$ contains an independent set of size $\Omega(n \log d / d)$. The largest class of graphs for which this was previously known was established by Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov in 1999, who proved it for the so-called almost bipartite graphs, namely subgraphs of $K_{1,t,t}$.
  We prove the conjecture for all 3-colorable graphs $F$, i.e., subgraphs of $K_{t,t,t}$, representing the first progress on the problem in more than 25 years. More precisely, we show that every $n$-vertex $K_{t,t,t}$-free graph of average degree $d$ contains an independent set of size at least $(1 - o(1)) n \log d / d$, matching Shearer's celebrated bound for triangle-free graphs (the case $t = 1$) and thereby yielding a substantial strengthening of it. Our proof combines a new variant of the R\"odl nibble method for constructing independent sets with a Tur\'an-type result on $K_{t,t,t}$-free graphs.
  A closely related conjecture of Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov (1999) asserts that any $F$-free graph of maximum degree at most $\Delta$ has chromatic number $O(\Delta / \log \Delta)$. This was previously known only for almost bipartite graphs (verified by Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov themselves), while most recent results were concerned with improving the leading constant factor in the case where $F$ is almost bipartite. We also establish this conjecture for all $3$-colorable graphs $F$, representing the first progress toward the conjecture since it was posed.</description>

      <title>A Proof of Talagrand's Creating Large Sets Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Talagrand conjectured that if a family of sets $\mathcal{F}$ over $X = \{ 1,2,\cdots, N \}$ is of large measure, then constant times of unions of sets in $\mathcal{F}$ will cover a large portion of the power set of $X$. This conjecture is a central open problem at the intersection of combinatorics and probability theory, and was described by Talagrand as a personal favorite. This paper provides a proof confirming this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Roman ${2}$-domination on Graphs with "few" 4-paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ with vertex set $V$, $f : V \rightarrow \{0, 1, 2\}$ is a \emph{Roman $\{2\}$-dominating function} (or \emph{italian dominating function}) of $G$ if for every vertex $v\in V$ with $f(v) =0$, either there exists a vertex $u$ adjacent to $v$ with $f(u) = 2$, or two distinct vertices $x,\; y$ both adjacent to $v$ with $f(x)=f(y)=1$. The decision problem associated with Roman $\{2\}$-domination is NP-complete even for bipartite graphs (Chellali et al., 2016).
  In this work we initiate the study of Roman $\{2\}$-domination on graph classes with a limited number of 4-paths. We base our study on a modular decomposition analysis. In particular, we study Roman $\{2\}$-domination under some operations in graphs such as join, union, complementation, addition of pendant vertices and addition of twin vertices. We then obtain the Roman $\{2\}$-domination number of spiders, well-labelled spiders and certain prime split graphs that are crucial in the modular decomposition of partner-limited graphs. In all, we provide linear-time algorithms to compute the Roman $\{2\}$-domination number of cographs, $P_4$-sparse graphs, $P_4$-tidy graphs and partner-limited graphs. Finally, we derive the NP-completeness of Roman $\{2\}$-domination on $P_4$-laden graphs.</description>

      <title>Labeled histories and maximally probable labeled topologies with multifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In mathematical phylogenetics, labeled histories describe the sequences by which sets of labeled lineages coalesce to a shared ancestral lineage. We study labeled histories for at-most-$r$-furcating trees. Consider a rooted leaf-labeled tree in which internal nodes each have $i$ offspring, and $i$ is permitted to range from 2 to $r$ across internal nodes, for a specified value of $r$. For labeled topologies with $n$ leaves, we enumerate the total number of labeled histories with at-most-$r$-furcation. We enumerate the labeled histories possessed by a specific at-most-$r$-furcating labeled topology. We then demonstrate that the maximally probable at-most-$r$-furcating unlabeled topology on $n \geq 2$ leaves -- the unlabeled topology whose labelings have the largest number of labeled histories -- is the maximally probable strictly bifurcating unlabeled topology on $n$ leaves. Finally, we enumerate labeled histories for at-most-$r$-furcating labeled topologies in a setting that permits simultaneous branchings. We similarly reduce the problem of identifying the maximally probable at-most-$r$-furcating unlabeled topology on $n \geq 2$ leaves, allowing simultaneity, to that of identifying the maximally probable strictly bifurcating unlabeled topology on $n$ leaves, with simultaneity; we conjecture the shape of this bifurcating unlabeled topology. The computations contribute to the study of multifurcation, which arises in various biological processes, and they connect to analogous mathematical settings involving precedence-constrained scheduling.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms and Implementations for Extracting Maximum-Size $(k,\ell)$-Sparse Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multigraph $G = (V, E)$ is $(k, \ell)$-sparse if every subset $X \subseteq V$ induces at most $\max\{k|X| - \ell, 0\}$ edges. Finding a maximum-size $(k, \ell)$-sparse subgraph is a classical problem in rigidity theory and combinatorial optimization, with known polynomial-time algorithms. This paper presents a highly efficient and flexible implementation of an augmenting path method, enhanced with a range of powerful practical heuristics that significantly reduce running time while preserving optimality. These heuristics $\unicode{x2013}$ including edge-ordering, node-ordering, two-phase strategies, and pseudoforest-based initialization $\unicode{x2013}$ steer the algorithm toward accepting more edges early in the execution and avoiding costly augmentations. A comprehensive experimental evaluation on both synthetic and real-world graphs demonstrates that our implementation outperforms existing tools by several orders of magnitude. We also propose an asymptotically faster algorithm for extracting an inclusion-wise maximal $(k,2k)$-sparse subgraph with the sparsity condition required only for node sets of size at least three, which is particularly relevant to 3D rigidity when $k = 3$. We provide a carefully engineered implementation, which is publicly available online and is proposed for inclusion in the LEMON graph library.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the infinite product defined by \[ P(z) = -\prod_{n=1}^{\infty} (\Phi_n(z))^{-1/n}, \] where \( \Phi_n(z) \) is the \( n \)-th cyclotomic polynomial, is constant inside the unit disk. The proof translates a result of Ramanujan on Ramanujan sums, equivalent to the prime number theorem, to the setting of infinite products. We also show that similar identities proved by Ramanujan lead to additional results on infinite cyclotomic products.</description>

      <title>Complexity and algorithms for Arc-Kayles and Non-Disconnecting Arc-Kayles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arc-Kayles is a game where two players alternate removing two adjacent vertices until no move is left, the winner being the player who played the last move. Introduced in 1978, its computational complexity is still open. More recently, subtraction games, where the players cannot disconnect the graph while removing vertices, were introduced. In particular, Arc-Kayles admits a non-disconnecting variant that is a subtraction game. We study the computational complexity of subtraction games on graphs, proving that they are PSPACE-complete even on very structured graph classes (split, bipartite of any even girth). We give a quadratic kernel for Non-Disconnecting Arc-Kayles when parameterized by the feedback edge number, as well as polynomial-time algorithms for clique trees and a subclass of threshold graphs. We also show that a sufficient condition for a second player-win on Arc-Kayles is equivalent to the graph isomorphism problem.</description>

      <title>Independent Domination of k-Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a simple, finite, nonempty graph $G=(V(G),E(G))$, a vertex subset $D\subseteq V(G)$ is said to be a dominating set if every vertex $v\in V(G)-D$ is adjacent to a vertex in $D$. The independent domination number $\gamma_i(G)$ is the minimum cardinality among all independent dominating sets of $G$. Since determining the domination number for general graphs is NP-complete, we focus on the class of $k$-trees. Favaron established a tight upper bound for $1$-trees, while Campos and Wakabayashi determined a tight upper bound for maximal outerplanar graphs, a subclass of $2$-trees. We generalize these results and establish a tight upper bound for the independent domination number of $k$-trees for all $k\in \mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>A positivity conjecture for a quotient of $q$-binomial coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06032v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conjecture that, if the quotient of two $q$-binomial coefficients with the same top argument is a polynomial, then it has non-negative coefficients. We summarise what is known about the conjecture and prove it in two non-trivial cases. Moreover, we move ahead to extend our conjecture to D. Stanton's fake Gaussian sequences. As a corollary we obtain that a polynomial that is conjectured to be a cyclic sieving polynomial for Kreweras words [S. Hopkins and M. Rubey, Selecta Math. (N.S.) 28 (2022), Paper No. 10] is indeed a polynomial with non-negative integer coefficients.</description>

      <title>Totally odd immersions of complete graphs in graph products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10227v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, let $im(G)$ denote the maximum integer $t$ such that $G$ contains $K_t$ as an immersion. A recent paper of Collins, Heenehan, and McDonald (2023) studied the behaviour of this parameter under graph products, asking how large can $im(G\ast H)$ be in terms of $im(G)$ and $im(H)$, when $\ast$ is one of the four standard graph products. We consider a similar question for the parameter $toi(G)$ which denotes the maximum integer $t$ such that $G$ contains $K_t$ as a totally odd immersion. As an application, we obtain that no minimum counterexample to the immersion-analogue of the Odd Hadwiger Conjecture can be obtained from the Cartesian, direct (tensor), lexicographic or strong product of graphs.</description>

      <title>A poset game on submonoids of additively indecomposable ordinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by Garc\'ia-Marco and Knauer arXiv:1705.11034, we consider the Chomp game on a natural well-partial order structure defined on submonoids $\mathcal{S}^\sigma\subseteq\omega^\sigma$ of additively indecomposable ordinals generated by sets of ordinals under natural sum and product of ordinals. We have called the generatinng sets of ordinals for which the game terminates in a finite number of steps well-partial order generators, and, under very mild conditions, we have characterized those that are finite.
  A fundamental observation is that, for every ordinal $\sigma$, there exists an ordinal $\xi$ such that, for any class $\{ (\mathcal{S}^\tau;\leq_{\mathcal{S}^\tau}) \mid \tau\geq\sigma\}$ of well-partial orders generated by a subset of $\omega^\sigma$, the second player has a winning strategy on all those posets or only on $\{ (\mathcal{S}^\beta;\leq_{\mathcal{S}^\beta}) \mid\beta\in\alpha\}$ for some successor ordinal $\alpha\leq\xi$ (and the first player will have a winning strategy on the rest of the posets). This Hanf number-style property could be valuable in proving the existence of winning strategies. We conjecture that $ \xi $ is the smallest possible and, using results from arXiv:1908.09664, we prove that, if we restrict ourselves to the classes generated by finite sets of ordinals, $\xi&lt;|\omega^\sigma|^+$. We also explicitly describe a winning strategy for a specific family of classes.</description>

      <title>Vertex-transitive nut graph order-degree existence problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A nut graph is a nontrivial simple graph whose adjacency matrix has a simple eigenvalue zero such that the corresponding eigenvector has no zero entries. It is known that the order $n$ and degree $d$ of a vertex-transitive nut graph satisfy $4 \mid d$, $d \ge 4$, $2 \mid n$ and $n \ge d + 4$; or $d \equiv 2 \pmod 4$, $d \ge 6$, $4 \mid n$ and $n \ge d + 6$. Here, we prove that for each such $n$ and $d$, there exists a $d$-regular Cayley nut graph of order $n$. As a direct consequence, we obtain all the pairs $(n, d)$ for which there is a $d$-regular vertex-transitive (resp. Cayley) nut graph of order $n$.</description>

      <title>Longest increasing subsequences for distributions with atoms, and an inhomogeneous Hammersley process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A famous result by Hammersley and Versik-Kerov states that the length $L_n$ of the longest increasing subsequence among $n$ iid continuous random variables grows like $2\sqrt{n}$. We investigate here the asymptotic behavior of $L_n$ for distributions with atoms. For purely discrete random variables, we characterize the asymptotic order of $L_n$ through a variational problem and provide explicit estimates for classical distributions. The proofs rely on a coupling with an inhomogeneous version of the discrete-time continuous-space Hammersley process. This reveals that, in contrast to the continuous case, the discrete setting exhibits a wide range of growth rates between $\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $o(\sqrt{n})$, depending on the tail behavior of the distribution. We can then easily deduce the asymptotics of $L_n$ for a completely arbitrary distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sign-coherence about $c$-vectors was conjectured by Fomin-Zelevinsky and solved completely by Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich for integer skew-symmetrizable case. We prove this conjecture associated with $c$-vectors for rank 3 real cluster-cyclic skew-symmetrizable case. Simultaneously, we establish their self-contained recursion and monotonicity. Then, these $c$-vectors are proved to be roots of certain quadratic equations. Based on these results, we prove that the corresponding exchange graphs of $C$-pattern and $G$-pattern are $3$-regular trees. We also study the structure of tropical signs and equip the dihedral group $\mathrm{D}_6$ with a cluster realization via certain mutations.</description>

Abstract: Using the semiformal method in combinatorics we generalize P\'olya's theorem. This theorem determines the limiting probability that walks in the grid graph $\mathbb{Z}^d$ visit the given vertex. We generalize it to the countable complete graph $K_{\mathbb{N}}$ with edge weights in $\mathbb{C}$. In part II we treat edge weights in $\mathbb{C}[[x_1,\dots,x_k]]$.</description>

      <title>VC-dimension of Salem sets over finite fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The VC-dimension, introduced by Vapnik and Chervonenkis in 1968 in the context of learning theory, has in recent years provided a rich source of problems in combinatorial geometry. Given $E\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^d$ or $E\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, finding lower bounds on the VC-dimension of hypothesis classes defined by geometric objects such as spheres and hyperplanes is equivalent to constructing appropriate geometric configurations in $E$. The complexity of these configurations increases exponentially with the VC-dimension.
  These questions are related to the Erd\H{o}s distance problem and the Falconer problem when considering a hypothesis class defined by spheres. In particular, the Erd\H{o}s distance problem over finite fields is equivalent to showing that the VC-dimension of translates of a sphere of radius $t$ is at least one for all nonzero $t\in \mathbb{F}_q$. In this paper, we show that many of the existing techniques for distance problems over finite fields can be extended to a much broader context, not relying on the specific geometry of circles and spheres. We provide a unified framework which allows us to simultaneously study highly structured sets such as algebraic curves, as well as random sets.</description>

      <title>Edge-spectral Tur\'{a}n theorems for color-critical graphs with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical result of Nosal asserts that every $m$-edge graph with spectral radius $\lambda (G)&gt; \sqrt{m}$ contains a triangle. A celebrated extension of Nikiforov [35] states that if $G$ is an $m$-edge graph with $\lambda (G)&gt; \sqrt{(1- {1}/{r})2m}$, then $G$ contains a clique $K_{r+1}$. This result implies the Tur\'{a}n theorem and Wilf theorem, and offers a new perspective on the existence of substructures. The edge-spectral conditions are versatile for enforcing substructures, as they can be applied to any sparse graph regardless of its edge density. In this paper, we prove that for any color-critical graph $F$ with chromatic number $\chi (F)=r+1\ge 4$, if $m$ is sufficiently large and $G$ is an $F$-free graph with $m$ edges, then $\lambda (G)\le \sqrt{(1- {1}/{r})2m}$, with equality if and only if $G$ is a regular complete $r$-partite graph. This settles an open problem proposed by Yu and Li [52] and also gives spectral bounds for graphs forbidding books and wheels.
  Secondly, we establish an asymptotic formula and structural characterization when we forbid an almost-bipartite graph $F$, where $F$ is called almost-bipartite if it can be made bipartite by removing at most one edge. As applications, we determine the unique $m$-edge spectral extremal graph for every integer $m$ when avoiding certain substructures, including complete bipartite graphs plus an edge, cycles plus an edge, and theta graphs, etc. Our results resolve an open problem proposed by Li, Zhao and Zou [24], as well as two conjectures posed by Liu and Li [31]. The arguments in our proofs are based on the edge-spectral stability method recently established by the authors. In addition, we develop some new spectral techniques, including the stability result for the Perron--Frobenius eigenvector.</description>

      <title>The Complexity Classes of Hamming Distance Recoverable Robust Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.06939v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the well-known complexity class NP are combinatorial problems, whose optimization counterparts are important for many practical settings. These problems typically consider full knowledge about the input. In practical settings, however, uncertainty in the input data is a usual phenomenon, whereby this is normally not covered in optimization versions of NP problems. One concept to model the uncertainty in the input data, is recoverable robustness. The instance of the recoverable robust version of a combinatorial problem P is split into a base scenario $\sigma_0$ and an uncertainty scenario set $\textsf{S}$. The base scenario and all members of the uncertainty scenario set are instances of the original combinatorial problem P. The task is to calculate a solution $s_0$ for the base scenario $\sigma_0$ and solutions $s$ for all uncertainty scenarios $\sigma \in \textsf{S}$ such that $s_0$ and $s$ are not too far away from each other according to a distance measure, so $s_0$ can be easily adapted to $s$. This paper introduces Hamming Distance Recoverable Robustness, in which solutions $s_0$ and $s$ have to be calculated, such that $s_0$ and $s$ may only differ in at most $\kappa$ elements. We survey the complexity of Hamming distance recoverable robust versions of optimization problems, typically found in NP for different scenario encodings. The complexity is primarily situated in the lower levels of the polynomial hierarchy. The main contribution of the paper is a gadget reduction framework that shows that the recoverable robust versions of problems in a large class of combinatorial problems is $\Sigma^P_{3}$-complete. This class includes problems such as Vertex Cover, Coloring or Subset Sum. Additionally, we expand the results to $\Sigma^P_{2m+1}$-completeness for multi-stage recoverable robust problems with $m \in \mathbb{N}$ stages.</description>

      <title>Linear Extensions of Rotor-Routing in Directed Graphs: Reachability Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for rotor-routing that extends the classical model to a broad class of multigraphs equipped with Generalized Rotor Mechanisms (GRM). This perspective places rotor-routing on the same footing as abelian sandpiles by interpreting both as conservative instances of Vector Addition Systems (VAS). Within this framework, routing becomes a linear transformation governed by arc mechanisms, while legality is enforced through non-negativity constraints.
  We introduce four routing models -- free routing, standard rotor-routing, cyclic GRM routing, and fully general GRM routing -- and study their reachability problems in both the linear and legal settings. Our results generalize previous characterizations for standard rotor-routing and extend them to the GRM setting. In particular, we show that legal reachability in GRM multigraphs is NP-complete, whereas the cyclic GRM routing model, which includes the classical rotor-router, admits a polynomial-time algorithm.</description>

      <title>Toda-Type Presentations for the Quantum K Theory of Partial Flag Varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a determinantal, Toda-type, presentation for the equivariant K theory of a partial flag variety ${\rm Fl}(r_1, \dots, r_k;n)$. The proof relies on pushing forward the Toda presentation obtained by Maeno, Naito and Sagaki for the complete flag variety ${\rm Fl}(n)$, via Kato's ${\rm K}_T({\rm pt})$-algebra homomorphism from the quantum K ring of ${\rm Fl}(n)$ to that of ${\rm Fl}(r_1, \dots, r_k;n)$. Starting instead from the Whitney presentation for ${\rm Fl}(n)$, we show that the same pushforward technique gives a recursive formula for polynomial representatives of quantum K Schubert classes in any partial flag variety which do not depend on quantum parameters. In an appendix, we include another proof of the Toda presentation for the equivariant quantum K ring of ${\rm Fl}(n)$, following Anderson, Chen, and Tseng, which is based on the fact that the ${\rm K}$-theoretic $J$-function is an eigenfunction of the finite difference Toda Hamiltonians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the theory of integer $C$-, $G$-matrices in cluster algebras to the real case. By a skew-symmetrizing method, we can reduce the problem of skew-symmetrizable patterns to the one of skew-symmetric patterns. In this sense, we extend the sign-coherence of integer $C$-, $G$-matrices proved by Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich to a more general real class called of quasi-integer type. Furthermore, we give a complete classification of this type by a combinatorial method of real weighted quivers. However, the sign-coherence of real $C$-, $G$-matrices does not always hold in general. For this purpose, we classify all the rank $2$ case and the finite type case via the Coxeter diagrams. We also give two conjectures about the real exchange matrices and $C$-, $G$-matrices. Under these conjectures, the dual mutation, $G$-fan structure and synchronicity property hold. As an application, the isomorphism of several kinds of exchange graphs is studied.</description>

      <title>Reinforced Generation of Combinatorial Structures: Applications to Complexity Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18057v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can AI based methods help us make advances in complexity theory? We provide evidence towards answering this in the affirmative, using AlphaEvolve (an LLM code mutation agent) to obtain new results in three settings:
  a) We improve a recent result of Kunisky and Yu to obtain near-optimal upper and (conditional) lower bounds on certification algorithms for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set on random 3- and 4-regular graphs. Our improved lower bounds are obtained by constructing nearly extremal Ramanujan graphs on as many as $163$ vertices, and our upper bounds are obtained via analytical arguments.
  b) We obtain new inapproximability results for MAX-4-CUT and MAX-3-CUT, proving that it is NP-hard to approximate them within factors of $0.987$ and $0.9649$ respectively, using AlphaEvolve to discover new gadget reductions. Our MAX-4-CUT result improves upon the SOTA of $0.9883$, and our MAX-3-CUT result improves on the current best gadget-based inapproximability result of $0.9853$, but falls short of the SOTA of $16/17$ that relies on a custom PCP (rather than a reduction from ``standard'' H{\aa}stad-style PCPs).
  c) Inapproximability for the metric Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP): We show that it is NP-hard to approximate the minimum cost tour within a factor of $111/110$ using AlphaEvolve to discover a new gadget, thus improving the SOTA of $117/116$. Along the way, we provide new modular soundness and completeness arguments that can be of independent interest.
  A key technical challenge we faced: verifying a candidate construction produced by AlphaEvolve is costly (sometimes requiring time exponential in the size of the construction). We used AlphaEvolve itself to evolve the verification procedure to be faster (sometimes by $10,000\times$ for our gadgets). Our results suggest that gadget based proofs would benefit from a pass through AI-based tools to obtain stronger results.</description>
