      <title>Approximation properties for dynamical W*-correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05024v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{G}$ be a locally compact quantum group, and $A,B$ von Neumann algebras on which $\mathbb{G}$ acts. We refer to these as $\mathbb{G}$-dynamical W$^*$-algebras. We make a study of $\mathbb{G}$-equivariant $A$-$B$-correspondences, that is, Hilbert spaces $\mathcal{H}$ with an $A$-$B$-bimodule structure by $*$-preserving normal maps, and equipped with a unitary representation of $\mathbb{G}$ which is equivariant with respect to the above bimodule structure. Such structures are a Hilbert space version of the theory of $\mathbb{G}$-equivariant Hilbert C$^*$-bimodules. We show that there is a well-defined Fell topology on equivariant correspondences, and use this to formulate approximation properties for them. Within this formalism, we then characterize amenability of the action of a locally compact group on a von Neumann algebra, using recent results due to Bearden and Crann. We further consider natural operations on equivariant correspondences such as taking opposites, composites and crossed products, and examine the continuity of these operations with respect to the Fell topology.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-assisted classical capacities of some channels acting as radial multipliers on fermion algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15440v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a new class of unital quantum channels on $\mathrm{M}_{2^k}$, acting as radial multipliers when we identify the matrix algebra $\mathrm{M}_{2^k}$ with a finite-dimensional fermion algebra. Our primary contribution lies in the precise computation of the (optimal) rate at which classical information can be transmitted through these channels from a sender to a receiver when they share an unlimited amount of entanglement. Our approach relies on new connections between fermion algebras with the $n$-dimensional discrete hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$. Significantly, our calculations yield exact values applicable to the operators of the fermionic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup. This advancement not only provides deeper insights into the structure and behaviour of these channels but also enhances our understanding of Quantum Information Theory in a dimension-independent context.</description>

      <title>Conditional representation stability, classification of $*$-homomorphisms, and relative eta invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quasi-representation of a group is a map from the group into a matrix algebra (or similar object) that approximately satisfies the relations needed to be a representation. Work of many people starting with Kazhdan and Voiculescu, and recently advanced by Dadarlat, Eilers-Shulman-S\o{}rensen and others, has shown that there are topological obstructions to approximating unitary quasi-representations of groups by honest representations, where `approximation' is understood to be with respect to the operator norm.
  The purpose of this paper is to explore whether approximation is possible if the known obstructions vanish, partially generalizing work of Gong-Lin and Eilers-Loring-Pedersen for the free abelian group of rank two, and the Klein bottle group. We show that this is possible, at least in a weak sense, for some `low-dimensional' groups including fundamental groups of closed surfaces, certain Baumslag-Solitar groups, free-by-cyclic groups, and many fundamental groups of three manifolds.
  The techniques used in the paper are $K$-theoretic: they have their origin in Baum-Connes-Kasparov type assembly maps, and in the Elliott program to classify $C^*$-algebras; Kasparov's bivariant KK-theory is a crucial tool. The key new technical ingredients are: a stable uniqueness theorem in the sense of Dadarlat-Eilers and Lin that works for non-exact $C^*$-algebras; and an analysis of maps on $K$-theory with finite coefficients in terms of the relative eta invariants of Atiyah-Patodi-Singer. Despite the proofs going through $K$-theoretic machinery, the main theorems can be stated in elementary terms that do not need any $K$-theory.</description>
