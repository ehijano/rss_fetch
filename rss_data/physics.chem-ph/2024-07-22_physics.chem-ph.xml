      <title>On the microscopic structure of neat linear alkylamine liquids: an x-ray scattering and computer simulation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ambient condition linear amines, from propylamine up to nonylamine, are studied by x-ray scattering and Molecular Dynamics simulations of various force field models. The major finding is that the pre-peak in alkylamines is of about one order of magnitude weaker than that in alkanols, hence suggesting much weaker hydrogen bonding induced clustering of the amine groups than for the hydroxyl groups. Computer simulation studies reveal that OPLS-UA model reproduces the pre-peak, but with larger amplitudes, while the GROMOS-UA and CHARMM-AA force fields show almost no pre-peak. Simulations of all models reveal the existence of hydrogen bonded clusters, equally confirmed through the prominent pre-peak of the structure factor between the nitrogen atoms. But, this pre-peak gets nearly cancelled by the various combinations of the atom-atom structure factors contributions to the scattering intensity, except for the OPLS model. The purpose of this work is to understand the weakness of the scattering pre-peak from the pair correlation function perspective, considered as an order parameter associated to the concept of charge order. The difference between models is equally analyzed from the same perspective. The analysis reveals the strong charge order induced structural similarity between amines and water, as opposed to mono-ols. This is traced back to the C2v symmetry of both the water molecule and the amine head group. It explains both the existence of H-bonded clusters and the weak scattering pre-peak. Concerning the models, the presence or absence of partial charges in the methyl groups of the alkyl tails explains the presence or absence of the pre-peak in the calculated scattering intensities</description>

      <title>Complete retrieval of attosecond photoelectron dynamics from partially-coherent states in entangled photoemission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the complete photoemission dynamics in situations of electron-ion entanglement can be retrieved from photoelectron spectral measurements without information on the ion. To this end, we develop an energy-time analysis of the photoelectron's reduced density matrix based on first principles. We test and assess our approach with numerical simulations on a low dimensional model molecule in interaction with broadband composite pulses occulting the vibrational resolution. Our method is directly applicable to recent experimental schemes measuring the photoelectron reduced density matrices in atomic and molecular photoemission. Therefore, it opens a new window on the dynamics of decoherence and entanglement at the attosecond timescale.</description>

      <title>Fragment quantum embedding using the Householder transformation: a multi-state extension based on ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent works by Yalouz et al. (J. Chem. Phys. 157, 214112, 2022) and Sekaran et al. (Phys. Rev. B 104, 035121, 2021; Computation 10, 45, 2022), Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) has been reformulated through the use of the Householder transformation as a novel tool to embed a fragment within extended systems. The transformation was applied to a reference non-interacting one-electron reduced density matrix to construct fragments' bath orbitals, which are crucial for subsequent ground state calculations. In the present work, we expand upon these previous developments and extend the utilization of the Householder transformation to the description of multiple electronic states, including ground and excited states. Based on an ensemble noninteracting density matrix, we demonstrate the feasibility of achieving exact fragment embedding through successive Householder transformations, resulting in a larger set of bath orbitals. We analytically prove that the number of additional bath orbitals scales directly with the number of fractionally occupied natural orbitals in the reference ensemble density matrix. A connection with the regular DMET bath construction is also made. Then, we illustrate the use of this ensemble embedding tool in single-shot DMET calculations to describe both ground and first excited states in a Hubbard lattice model and an ab initio hydrogen system. Lastly, we discuss avenues for enhancing ensemble embedding through self-consistency and explore potential future directions.</description>

      <title>Minimum tracking linear response Hubbard and Hund corrected Density Functional Theory in CP2K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the implementation of the Hubbard ($U$) and Hund ($J$) corrected Density Functional Theory (DFT+$U$+$J$) functionality in the Quickstep program, which is part of the CP2K suite. The tensorial and L\"owdin subspace representations are implemented and compared. Full analytical DFT+$U$+$J$ forces are implemented and benchmarked for the tensorial and L\"owdin representations. We also present the implementation of the recently proposed minimum-tracking linear-response method that enables the $U$ and $J$ parameters to be calculated on first principles basis without reference to the Kohn-Sham eigensystem. These implementations are benchmarked against recent results for different materials properties including DFT+$U$ band gap opening in NiO, the relative stability of various polaron distributions in TiO$_2$, the dependence of the calculated TiO$_2$ band gap on +$J$ corrections, and, finally, the role of the +$U$ and +$J$ corrections for the computed properties of a series of the hexahydrated transition metals. Our implementation provides results consistent with those already reported in the literature from comparable methods. We conclude the contribution with tests on the influence of the L\"owdin orthonormalization on the occupancies, calculated parameters, and derived properties.</description>

      <title>Statistical Survey of Chemical and Geometric Patterns on Protein Surfaces as a Blueprint for Protein-mimicking Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recent breakthroughs in understanding how protein sequence relates to structure and function, considerably less attention has been paid to the general features of protein surfaces beyond those regions involved in binding and catalysis. This paper provides a systematic survey of the universe of protein surfaces and quantifies the sizes, shapes, and curvatures of the positively/negatively charged and hydrophobic/hydrophilic surface patches as well as correlations between such patches. It then compares these statistics with the metrics characterizing nanoparticles functionalized with ligands terminated with positively and negatively charged ligands. These particles are of particular interest because they are also surface-patchy and have been shown to exhibit both antibiotic and anticancer activities - via selective interactions against various cellular structures - prompting loose analogies to proteins. Our analyses support such analogies in several respects (e.g., patterns of charged protrusions and hydrophobic niches similar to those observed in proteins), although there are also significant differences. Looking forward, this work provides a blueprint for the rational design of synthetic nanoobjects with further enhanced mimicry of proteins' surface properties.</description>

      <title>Channel-facilitated transport under resetting dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transport of particles through channels holds immense significance in physics, chemistry, and biological sciences. For instance, the motion of solutes through biological channels is facilitated by specialized proteins that create water-filled channels and valuable insights can be obtained by studying the transition paths of particles through a channel and gathering statistics on their lifetimes within the channel or their exit probabilities. In a similar vein, we consider a one-dimensional model of channel-facilitated transport where a diffusive particle is subject to attractive interactions with the walls within a limited region of the channel. We study the statistics of conditional and unconditional escape times, in the presence of resetting--an intermittent dynamics that brings the particle back to its initial coordinate randomly. We determine analytically the physical conditions under which such resetting mechanism can become beneficial for faster escape of the particles from the channel thus enhancing the transport. Our theory has been verified with the aid of Brownian dynamics simulations for various interaction strengths and extent. The overall results presented herein highlight the scope of resetting-based strategies to be universally promising for complex transport processes of single or long molecules through biological membranes.</description>

      <title>Coarse-graining bistability with the Martini force field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An increasing interest in molecular structures whose long term dynamics resemble those of bistable mechanical systems promotes the the search of possible candidates that may operate as two-state switching units. Of particular interest are the systems that are capable to exhibit such bistable effects as spontaneous vibrations, stochastic resonance and spontaneous synchronization. Previously, in all-atom molecular dynamics simulations it has been demonstrated that short pyridine-furan springs show these bistable phenomena. In this article we introduce a coarse-grained model of such springs and investigate the possibility to observe the bistability effects, such as spontaneous vibrations, in such model. Our findings allow the studies of short pyridine-furan springs at large time an length scales and open field for further computational research of large bistable systems.</description>

      <title>Extending Radiowave Frequency Detection Range with Dressed States of Solid-State Spin Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensors using solid-state spin defects excel in the detection of radiofrequency (RF) fields, serving various purposes in communication, ranging, and sensing. For this purpose, pulsed dynamical decoupling (PDD) protocols are typically applied, which enhance sensitivity to RF signals. However, these methods are limited to frequencies of a few megahertz, which poses a challenge for sensing higher frequencies. We introduce an alternative approach based on a continuous dynamical decoupling (CDD) scheme involving dressed states of nitrogen vacancy (NV) ensemble spins driven within a microwave resonator. We compare the CDD methods to established PDD protocols and demonstrate the detection of RF signals up to $\sim$ 85 MHz, about ten times the current limit imposed by the PDD approach under identical conditions. Implementing the CDD method in a heterodyne synchronized protocol combines the high frequency detection with high spectral resolution. This advancement extends to various domains requiring detection in the high frequency (HF) and very high frequency (VHF) ranges of the RF spectrum, including spin sensor-based magnetic resonance spectroscopy at high magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Polynomial propagators for classical molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical molecular dynamics simulation is performed mostly using the established velocity Verlet integrator or other symplectic propagation schemes. In this work, an alternative formulation of numerical propagators for classical molecular dynamics is introduced based on an expansion of the time evolution operator in series of Chebyshev and Newton polynomials. The suggested propagators have, in principle, arbitrary order of accuracy which can be controlled by the choice of expansion order after that the series is truncated. However, the expansion converges only after a minimum number of terms is included in the expansion and this number increases linearly with the time step size. Measurements of the energy drift demonstrate the acceptable long-time stability of the polynomial propagators. It is shown that a system of interacting Lennard-Jones particles is tractable by the proposed technique and that the scaling with the expansion order is only polynomial while the scaling with the number of particles is the same as with the conventional velocity Verlet. The proposed method is, in principle, extendable for further interaction force fields and for integration with a thermostat, and can be parallelized to speed up the computation of every time step.</description>

      <title>Learning Collective Variables with Synthetic Data Augmentation through Physics-Inspired Geodesic Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01542v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In molecular dynamics simulations, rare events, such as protein folding, are typically studied using enhanced sampling techniques, most of which are based on the definition of a collective variable (CV) along which acceleration occurs. Obtaining an expressive CV is crucial, but often hindered by the lack of information about the particular event, e.g., the transition from unfolded to folded conformation. We propose a simulation-free data augmentation strategy using physics-inspired metrics to generate geodesic interpolations resembling protein folding transitions, thereby improving sampling efficiency without true transition state samples. This new data can be used to improve the accuracy of classifier-based methods. Alternatively, a regression-based learning scheme for CV models can be adopted by leveraging the interpolation progress parameter.</description>

      <title>Understanding Discrepancies of Wavefunction Theories for Large Molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum mechanical many-electron calculations can predict properties of atoms, molecules and even complex materials. The employed computational methods play a quintessential role in many scientifically and technologically relevant research fields. However, a question of paramount importance is whether approximations aimed at reducing the computational complexity for solving the many-electron Schr\"odinger equation, are accurate enough. Here, we investigate recently reported discrepancies of noncovalent interaction energies for large molecules predicted by two of the most widely-trusted many-electron theories: diffusion quantum Monte Carlo and coupled-cluster theory. We are able to unequivocally pin down the source of the puzzling discrepancies and present modifications to widely-used coupled-cluster methods needed for more accurate noncovalent interaction energies of large molecules on the hundred-atom scale. This enhances the reliability of predictions from quantum mechanical many-electron theories across a wide range of critical applications, including drug design, catalysis, and the innovation of new functional materials, such as those for renewable energy technologies.</description>
