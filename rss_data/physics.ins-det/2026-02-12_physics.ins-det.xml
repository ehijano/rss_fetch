      <title>The MUSE Target Chamber Post Veto</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Muon Scattering Experiment (MUSE) was developed to address the proton radius puzzle through simultaneous electron-proton and muon-proton scattering using the Paul Scherrer Institute's PiM1 secondary beamline. MUSE uses a large-solid-angle, non-magnetic spectrometer to detect beam particles scattering from a liquid hydrogen cell contained within a vacuum chamber. Due to the large scattering windows, the structural integrity of the chamber is supported by posts located at small scattering angles. While out of the acceptance, particles in the tails of the beam distribution can strike these posts, causing a significant trigger background. We describe the design and performance of the Target Chamber Post Veto (TCPV) detector installed inside the vacuum chamber to remove these background events at the trigger level.</description>

      <title>The high speed analog optical readout system designed for low temperature experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For low-temperature experiments such as liquid xenon dark matter detectors, it is crucial to read out detector signals from cryostats. Traditionally, photoelectrical signals are transmitted from the cryogenic region to the outside using coaxial cables through vacuum feedthroughs on the cryostats. In this paper, we investigate an analog optical transmission method in which the raw electrical signals are converted into optical signals with light intensity linearly proportional to the electrical amplitude, transmitted out of the cryogenic environment through optical fiber, and subsequently converted back into electrical signals by photoelectric devices while preserving the signal waveform. This new approach offers advantages, including low attenuation over long-distance transmission and reduced crosstalk across the feedthroughs. Additionally, the low-temperature optical wavelength multiplexing scheme has been investigated and applied, increasing the transmission capability of a single fiber. At -100 degree Celsius, the proposed analog optical readout system achieves a -3dB bandwidth of larger than 150MHz, a dynamic range of up to 500mV, and a low cryogenic-region power consumption of 70mW per channel, demonstrating its strong potential for low-temperature experiments.</description>

      <title>Application of a high-precision distributed uranium source for determining the effective mass and volume of a HPGe detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A distributed uranium source with the accurately certified activity of 238U has been used to verify the effective mass of the HPGe detector intended for the {\nu}GeN neutrino experiment. The source, dissolved in nitric acid, provides homogeneous irradiation of the detector crystal allowing the study of its mass and volume. The experimental spectra obtained with the distributed source have been compared to the detailed Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations. The measured counting rates of several gamma-lines agree with the simulated efficiencies, confirming that the detector mass and volume coincide with the manufacturer specifications. The results demonstrate the applicability of such sources for mass calibration of HPGe detectors.</description>

      <title>A Helical-Deflector-Based Radio-Frequency Spiral Scanning System for keV Energy Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design, modeling, and experimental validation of a radio-frequency based time-to-position conversion system for keV electrons incorporating a helical deflector operating in the 400-1000 MHz range. The device performs circular deflection of the electrons when driven by a single RF frequency and enables spiral scanning when two phase-locked RF voltages with slightly different frequencies are applied. The superposition of the two phase-locked RF voltages produces an amplitude-beating field whose slowly varying envelope modulates the deflection radius, transforming the circular scan into a controlled spiral on the detector plane. A detailed theoretical model describing the electron dynamics under two phase-locked RF voltages with different frequencies was derived, yielding analytical expressions for the transverse velocity and radius-vector components at the deflector exit. Spiral scanning will allow measurements with picosecond resolution in a time range 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than the period of the circular scanning.</description>

      <title>High-voltage generation system for a traveling-wave Stark decelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we describe the high-voltage generation system we have developed for a traveling-wave Stark decelerator (TWSD). The TWSD can reduce the forward velocity of a molecular beam of heavy neutral polar molecules such as strontium monofluoride (SrF) and barium monofluoride (BaF) from $\sim$ 200 m/s down to $\sim$ 6 m/s. The main motivation for the development of this device is the increased sensitivity from precision spectroscopy of the decelerated molecules to test fundamental physics. The high-voltage generation system can produce eight pulsed sinusoidal waveforms with a maximum amplitude of 10 kV and a linear frequency sweep from 16.7 kHz down to 500 Hz over the span of 40 ms at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The eight waveforms are phase-offset to each other by 45 degrees. To slow down the heavy molecules, the decelerator is required to have a length of $\sim$ 4 m, which results in a significant capacitive coupling between adjacent channels of $\sim$ 160 pF. As a consequence, the control and stability of the waveforms is extra challenging. We designed a method that compensates for the frequency-dependent coupling between the eight channels. Allowing for amplitude and phase-offsets that do not deviate more than 1% and 2 degrees, respectively, from their design values during the frequency sweep. The system outperforms commercially available options in terms of stability, output voltage amplitude, cost and ease of maintenance. This approach is also relevant for other fields where precise control of high-voltage waveforms is required, such as particle accelerator physics, plasma physics and mass spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Search for Dark Matter via Invisible Decays in ${}^{46}$Sc Nuclear Gamma Cascades with a CsI(Tl) Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23001v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter remains one of the most compelling open problems in modern physics, motivating experimental searches for new light, weakly coupled particles beyond the Standard Model. Despite extensive efforts employing diverse detection strategies, large regions of parameter space remain unexplored. We report a high-statistics laboratory search for invisible decay modes in nuclear $\gamma$-ray cascades using approximately $100~\mathrm{kg}$ of CsI(Tl) scintillators operated at Texas A\&amp;M University. The experiment employs a high-activity ${}^{46}$Sc radioactive source and a ``missing-$\gamma$'' technique, in which the absence of a photon from a well-identified cascade serves as a signature of new physics. Unlike appearance-disappearance experiments, this approach requires only a single photon conversion into a dark-sector particle, enabling sensitivity to significantly weaker couplings. The setup provides simultaneous sensitivity to a broad class of light dark-sector candidates, including axions and axion-like particles, dark scalars, and dark photons in the $0.1 - 1 \text{ MeV}$ mass region. Through careful control of detector containment, energy resolution, and environmental backgrounds, we excludes certain regions on the previously explored parameter space. With foreseeable improvements in detector volume and systematic uncertainty control, this technique has the potential to probe currently unexplored parameter space for axion-like particles and light dark scalars.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Doberman (Detector OBsERving and Monitoring ApplicatioN), a lightweight, modular, and open-source slow control system designed for small-to medium-scale physics experiments. Doberman addresses the gap between heavyweight industrial SCADA frameworks and ad hoc laboratory solutions by providing a flexible software architecture that supports heterogeneous instrumentation, distributed deployment, automated control, and robust alarm handling. The web-based graphical user interface Doberview provides live and continuously updated visualization, configuration, and control of the entire experiment, supporting both routine operation and rapid response to exceptional conditions. Doberman has been deployed and validated in multiple experimental setups, ranging from a remotely operated underground gamma-ray spectrometer to a large, highly instrumented liquid xenon test facility with several hundred monitored quantities.
  Doberman and Doberview are released under permissive open-source licenses, and the software, documentation, and example device integrations are publicly available.</description>
