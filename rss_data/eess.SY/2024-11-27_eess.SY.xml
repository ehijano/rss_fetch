      <title>Electromagnetic Formation Flying with State and Input Constraints Using Alternating Magnetic Field Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a feedback control algorithm for electromagnetic formation flying with constraints on the satellites' states and control inputs. The algorithm combines several key techniques. First, we use alternating magnetic field forces to decouple the electromagnetic forces between each pair of satellites in the formation. Each satellite's electromagnetic actuation system is driven by a sum of amplitude-modulated sinusoids, where amplitudes are controlled in order to prescribe the time-averaged force between each pair of satellites. Next, the desired time-averaged force is computed from a optimal control that satisfies state constraints (i.e., no collisions and an upper limit on intersatellite speeds) and input constraints (i.e., not exceeding satellite's apparent power capability). The optimal time-averaged force is computed using a single relaxed control barrier function that is obtained by composing multiple control barrier functions that are designed to enforce each state and input constraint. Finally, we demonstrate the satellite formation control method in a numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Simulation Framework for Power Resilience Estimation and Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing frequency of extreme weather events poses significant risks to power distribution systems, leading to widespread outages and severe economic and social consequences. This paper presents a novel simulation framework for assessing and enhancing the resilience of power distribution networks under such conditions. Resilience is estimated through Monte Carlo simulations, which simulate extreme weather scenarios and evaluate the impact on infrastructure fragility. Due to the proprietary nature of power networks topology, a distribution network is synthesized using publicly available data. To generate the weather scenarios, an extreme weather generation method is developed. To enhance resilience, renewable resources such as solar panels and energy storage systems (batteries in this study) are incorporated. A customized Genetic Algorithm is used to determine the optimal locations and capacities for solar and battery installations, maximizing resilience while balancing cost constraints. Experiment results demonstrate that on a large-scale synthetic distribution network with more than 300,000 nodes and 300,000 edges, distributed energy resources (DERs) can significantly improve resilience metrics, providing utilities with valuable insights for community-level power system resilience enhancement.</description>

      <title>Avoiding Deadlocks Is Not Enough: Analysis and Resolution of Blocked Airplanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The foreseen increased usage of unmanned airplanes has been shown to lead to the emergence of pathological phenomena referred to as blocking in which airplanes stick together and fly in parallel for a long time. Although deadlock, a well-known pathological phenomenon in multi-agent systems, has been widely studied, it does not cover this temporal blocking phenomenon. As airspace becomes not only more autonomous but also increasingly crowded, and accommodates various types of aircraft, the blocking phenomenon is likely to occur even more frequently and negatively impact airplane systems. Therefore, it is crucial to understand and address the blocking phenomenon carefully in control design. To analyze blocking, we model airplane avoidance controllers using safety filters and examine the underlying causes in a two-airplane encounter situation. Furthermore, we propose an intention-aware strategy that efficiently resolves this pathological behavior while incidentally addressing deadlocks. Notably, the developed strategy does not rely on central coordination and communications which become unreliable in harsh situations. The analytical results are based on a simple dynamic model for airplanes, while the proposed resolution strategy is verified in both this simple model and a more realistic one.</description>

      <title>Traffic Wave Properties for Automated Vehicles During Traffic Oscillations via Analytical Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an analytical approximation framework to understand the dynamics of traffic wave propagation for Automated Vehicles (AVs) during traffic oscillations. The framework systematically unravels the intricate relationships between the longitudinal control model of the AVs and the properties of traffic waves. We apply Laplacian Transformation and Describing Function Analysis to mathematically derive the traffic wave properties of an AV in car-following scenarios. Further, we incorporate Newell's car-following model to determine the speed of the traffic waves. Our analysis extends to both homogenous and heterogenous traffic, systematically handling intra-heterogeneities and inter-heterogeneities in traffic wave propagation using the established analytical framework. We validate our approach via numerical simulations and show the connections between the AV control system and traffic wave properties. This research emphasizes the importance of rethinking our understanding of traffic wave properties when AVs are present in the traffic system.</description>

      <title>Strengthening Power System Resilience to Extreme Weather Events Through Grid Enhancing Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change significantly increases risks to power systems, exacerbating issues such as aging infrastructure, evolving regulations, cybersecurity threats, and fluctuating demand. This paper focuses on the utilization of Grid Enhancing Technologies (GETs) to strengthen power system resilience in the face of extreme weather events. GETs are pivotal in optimizing energy distribution, enabling predictive maintenance, ensuring reliable electricity supply, facilitating renewable energy integration, and automating responses to power instabilities and outages. Drawing insights from resilience theory, the paper reviews recent grid resilience literature, highlighting increasing vulnerabilities due to severe weather events. It demonstrates how GETs are crucial in optimizing smart grid operations, thereby not only mitigating climate-related impacts but also promoting industrial transformation.

      <title>Information Control Barrier Functions: Preventing Localization Failures in Mobile Systems Through Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a new framework for preventing localization failures in mobile systems that must estimate their state using measurements. Safety is guaranteed by imposing the nonlinear least squares optimization solved in modern localization algorithms remains well-conditioned. Specifically, the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix are made to be always positive via two methods that leverage control barrier functions to achieve safe set invariance. The proposed method is not constrained to any specific measurement or system type, offering a very general solution to the safe mobility with localization problem. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated on a system being provided range-only and heading-only measurements for localization.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Based Dynamic Programming for Efficient Vehicle Parking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In urban environments, parking has proven to be a significant source of congestion and inefficiency. In this study, we propose a methodology that offers a systematic solution to minimize the time spent by drivers in finding parking spaces. Drawing inspiration from statistical mechanics, we utilize an entropy model to predict the distribution of available parking spots across different levels of a multi-story parking garage, encoded by a single parameter: temperature. Building on this model, we develop a dynamic programming framework that guides vehicles to the optimal floor based on the predicted occupancy distribution. This approach culminates in our Temperature-Informed Parking Policy (TIPP), which not only predicts parking spot availability but also dynamically adjusts parking assignments in real-time to optimize vehicle placement and reduce search times. We compare TIPP with simpler policies and the theoretical optimal solution to demonstrate its effectiveness and gauge how closely it approaches the ideal parking strategy. The results highlight the potential of integrating TIPP in real-world applications, paving the way for smarter, more efficient urban landscapes.</description>

      <title>Computation-power Coupled Modeling for IDCs and Collaborative Optimization in ADNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The batch and online workload of Internet data centers (IDCs) offer temporal and spatial scheduling flexibility. Given that power generation costs vary over time and location, harnessing the flexibility of IDCs' energy consumption through workload regulation can optimize the power flow within the system. This paper focuses on multi-geographically distributed IDCs managed by an Internet service company (ISC), which are aggregated as a controllable load. The load flexibility resulting from spatial load regulation of online workload is taken into account. A two-step workload scheduling mechanism is adopted, and a computation-power coupling model of ISC is established to facilitate collaborative optimization in active distribution networks (ADNs). To address the model-solving problem based on the assumption of scheduling homogeneity, a model reconstruction method is proposed. An efficient iterative algorithm is designed to solve the reconstructed model. Furthermore, the Nash bargaining solution is employed to coordinate the different optimization objectives of ISC and power system operators, thereby avoiding subjective arbitrariness. Experimental cases based on a 33-node distribution system are designed to verify the effectiveness of the model and algorithm in optimizing ISC's energy consumption and power flow within the system.</description>

      <title>Zero-order Control Barrier Functions for Sampled-Data Systems with State and Input Dependent Safety Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel zero-order control barrier function (ZOCBF) for sampled-data systems to ensure system safety. Our formulation generalizes conventional control barrier functions and straightforwardly handles safety constraints with high-relative degrees or those that explicitly depend on both system states and inputs. The proposed ZOCBF condition does not require any differentiation operation. Instead, it involves computing the difference of the ZOCBF values at two consecutive sampling instants. We propose three numerical approaches to enforce the ZOCBF condition, tailored to different problem settings and available computational resources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a collision avoidance example and a rollover prevention example on uneven terrains.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Conservatism in Safety-Critical Control for Input-Delayed Systems via Adaptive Delay Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Input delays affect systems such as teleoperation and wirelessly autonomous connected vehicles, and may lead to safety violations. One promising way to ensure safety in the presence of delay is to employ control barrier functions (CBFs), and extensions thereof that account for uncertainty: delay adaptive CBFs (DaCBFs). This paper proposes an online adaptive safety control framework for reducing the conservatism of DaCBFs. The main idea is to reduce the maximum delay estimation error bound so that the state prediction error bound is monotonically non-increasing. To this end, we first leverage the estimation error bound of a disturbance observer to bound the state prediction error. Second, we design two nonlinear programs to update the maximum delay estimation error bound satisfying the prediction error bound, and subsequently update the maximum state prediction error bound used in DaCBFs. The proposed method ensures the maximum state prediction error bound is monotonically non-increasing, yielding less conservatism in DaCBFs. We verify the proposed method in an automated connected truck application, showing that the proposed method reduces the conservatism of DaCBFs.</description>

      <title>A "Breathing" Mobile Communication Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frequent migration of large-scale users leads to the load imbalance of mobile communication networks, which causes resource waste and decreases user experience. To address the load balancing problem, this paper proposes a dynamic optimization framework for mobile communication networks inspired by the average consensus in multi-agent systems. In this framework, all antennas cooperatively optimize their CPICH (Common Pilot Channel) transmit power in real-time to balance their busy-degrees. Then, the coverage area of each antenna would change accordingly, and we call this framework a ``breathing'' mobile communication network. To solve this optimization problem, two algorithms named BDBA (Busy-degree Dynamic Balancing Algorithm) and BFDBA (Busy-degree Fast Dynamic Balancing Algorithm) are proposed. Moreover, a fast network coverage calculation method is introduced, by which each antenna's minimum CPICH transmit power is determined under the premise of meeting the network coverage requirements. Besides, we present the theoretical analysis of the two proposed algorithms' performance, which prove that all antennas' busy-degrees will reach consensus under certain assumptions. Furthermore, simulations carried out on three large datasets demonstrate that our cooperative optimization can significantly reduce the unbalance among antennas as well as the proportion of over-busy antennas.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Discrete-Time Dynamic Vehicle Model with Assured Numerical Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical stability is of great significance for discrete-time dynamic vehicle model. Among the unstable factors, low-speed singularity stands out as one of the most challenging issues, which arises from that the denominator of tire side angle term only contains the vehicle longitudinal speed. Consequently, for the common low-speed and stop-start driving scenarios, the calculated tire slip angle will approach infinity, which will further lead to the numerical explosion of other vehicle states. In response to this critical challenge, we propose a discrete-time dynamic vehicle model that effectively mitigates the low-speed singularity issue, ensuring numerical stability and maintaining the explicit form-highly favored by model-based control algorithms. To validate the numerical stability of our model, we conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis, establishing sufficient conditions for stability, and conduct extensive empirical validation tests across a wide spectrum of speeds. Subsequent to the validation process, we conduct comprehensive simulations comparing our proposed model with both kinematic models and existing dynamic models discretized through the forward Euler method. The results demonstrate that our proposed model shows better comprehensive performance in terms of both the accuracy and numerical stability. Finally, the real vehicle experiments are carried out to support that our proposed model can closely aligns to the real vehicle trajectories showcasing its practicality and ease of use. Notably, our work stands as the pioneering endeavor in introducing an explicit discrete-time dynamic vehicle model suitable for common urban driving scenarios including low-speed and stop-start.</description>

      <title>Assessing Electricity Network Capacity Requirements for Industrial Decarbonisation in Great Britain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decarbonising the industrial sector is vital to reach net zero targets. The deployment of industrial decarbonisation technologies is expected to increase industrial electricity demand in many countries and this may require upgrades to the existing electricity network or new network investment. While the infrastructure requirements to support the introduction of new fuels and technologies in industry, such as hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage are often discussed, the need for investment to increase the capacity of the electricity network to meet increasing industrial electricity demands is often overlooked in the literature. This paper addresses this gap by quantifying the requirements for additional electricity network capacity to support the decarbonisation of industrial sectors across Great Britain (GB). The Net Zero Industrial Pathways model is used to predict the future electricity demand from industrial sites to 2050 which is then compared spatially to the available headroom across the distribution network in GB. The results show that network headroom is sufficient to meet extra capacity demands from industrial sites over the period to 2030 in nearly all GB regions and network scenarios. However, as electricity demand rises due to increased electrification across all sectors and industrial decarbonisation accelerates towards 2050, the network will need significant new capacity (71 GW + by 2050) particularly in the central, south, and north-west regions of England, and Wales. Without solving these network constraints, around 65% of industrial sites that are large point sources of emissions would be constrained in terms of electric capacity by 2040. These sites are responsible for 69% of industrial point source emissions.</description>

      <title>Ensuring Safety in Target Pursuit Control: A CBF-Safe Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the pursuit control problem for multi-agent systems, aiming to ensure collision-free tracking under input saturation and external disturbances. We propose a novel Control Barrier Function (CBF)-Safe Reinforcement Learning (CSRL) algorithm, which integrates model-free reinforcement learning with a safety filter to guarantee system safety. The framework introduces an input-constrained CBF that dynamically adjusts control bounds, enabling robust target tracking even during evasive maneuvers. A safety filter is designed to transform unsafe RL actions into safe control signals by solving a Quadratic Program (QP), ensuring the safety for sensing, collision avoidance, and input constraints of pursuers. Theoretical analysis proves the feasibility of the CBF-QP using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the CSRL algorithm, demonstrating its ability to handle complex pursuit scenarios while maintaining safety and improving control performance.</description>

Abstract: This study addresses critical challenges of cybersecurity in digital substations by proposing an innovative task-oriented dialogue (ToD) system for anomaly detection (AD) in multicast messages, specifically, generic object oriented substation event (GOOSE) and sampled value (SV) datasets. Leveraging generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technology, the proposed framework demonstrates superior error reduction, scalability, and adaptability compared with traditional human-in-the-loop (HITL) processes. Notably, this methodology offers significant advantages over machine learning (ML) techniques in terms of efficiency and implementation speed when confronting novel and/or unknown cyber threats, while also maintaining model complexity and precision. The research employs advanced performance metrics to conduct a comparative assessment between the proposed AD and HITL-based AD frameworks, utilizing a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed for generating and extracting features of IEC61850 communication messages. This approach presents a promising solution for enhancing the reliability of power system operations in the face of evolving cybersecurity challenges.</description>

      <title>Enhancing LLMs for Power System Simulations: A Feedback-driven Multi-agent Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of experimental technologies with large language models (LLMs) is transforming scientific research, positioning AI as a versatile research assistant rather than a mere problem-solving tool. In the field of power systems, however, managing simulations -- one of the essential experimental technologies -- remains a challenge for LLMs due to their limited domain-specific knowledge, restricted reasoning capabilities, and imprecise handling of simulation parameters. To address these limitations, we propose a feedback-driven, multi-agent framework that incorporates three proposed modules: an enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module, an improved reasoning module, and a dynamic environmental acting module with an error-feedback mechanism. Validated on 69 diverse tasks from Daline and MATPOWER, this framework achieves success rates of 93.13% and 96.85%, respectively, significantly outperforming the latest LLMs (ChatGPT 4o and o1-preview), which achieved a 27.77% success rate on standard simulation tasks and 0% on complex tasks. Additionally, our framework also supports rapid, cost-effective task execution, completing each simulation in approximately 30 seconds at an average cost of 0.014 USD for tokens. Overall, this adaptable framework lays a foundation for developing intelligent LLM-based assistants for human researchers, facilitating power system research and beyond.</description>

      <title>Modelling to Generate Continuous Alternatives: Enabling Real-Time Feasible Portfolio Generation in Convex Planning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decarbonization provides new opportunities to plan energy systems for improved health, resilience, equity, and environmental outcomes, but challenges in siting and social acceptance of transition goals and targets threaten progress. Modelling to Generate Alternatives (MGA) provides an optimization method for capturing many near-cost-optimal system configurations, and can provide insights into the tradeoffs between objectives and flexibility available in the system. However, MGA is currently limited in interactive applicability to these problems due to a lack of methods for allowing users to explore near-optimal feasible spaces. In this work we describe Modelling to Generate Continuous Alternatives (MGCA), a novel post-processing algorithm for convex planning problems which enables users to rapidly generate new interior solutions, incorporate new constraints, and solve within the space with convex objectives. MGCA begins with a dimensionality reduction to capacity decisions and metric values. We then take advantage of convex combinations to generate interior points by allowing user weight specification and encoding convex combinations in an optimization problem with user-defined additional constraints and objective. Dimensionality reduction enables this problem to solve in tenths of a second, suitable for analysis in interactive settings. We discuss the interpolation of capacity and operational metric values, finding capacity metrics can be perfectly interpolated while operational metrics remain within the feasible range of the points used to create them. We demonstrate interpolated solutions can be exported and re-solved with an economic dispatch model to provide operational metric values consistent with least-cost decision-making and show interpolated metric values are generally within 10% of the optimal value.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Trajectory Adaptation for Efficient UAV Inspections of Wind Energy Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The research presents an automated method for determining the trajectory of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for wind turbine inspection. The proposed method enables efficient data collection from multiple wind installations using UAV optical sensors, considering the spatial positioning of blades and other components of the wind energy installation. It includes component segmentation of the wind energy unit (WEU), determination of the blade pitch angle, and generation of optimal flight trajectories, considering safe distances and optimal viewing angles. The results of computational experiments have demonstrated the advantage of the proposed method in monitoring WEU, achieving a 78% reduction in inspection time, a 17% decrease in total trajectory length, and a 6% increase in average blade surface coverage compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, the process minimizes the average deviation from the optimal trajectory by 68%, indicating its high accuracy and ability to compensate for external influences.</description>

      <title>Anytime Acceleration of Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates stepsize-based acceleration of gradient descent with {\em anytime} convergence guarantees. For smooth (non-strongly) convex optimization, we propose a stepsize schedule that allows gradient descent to achieve convergence guarantees of $O(T^{-1.03})$ for any stopping time $T$, where the stepsize schedule is predetermined without prior knowledge of the stopping time. This result provides an affirmative answer to a COLT open problem \citep{kornowski2024open} regarding whether stepsize-based acceleration can yield anytime convergence rates of $o(T^{-1})$. We further extend our theory to yield anytime convergence guarantees of $\exp(-\Omega(T/\kappa^{0.97}))$ for smooth and strongly convex optimization, with $\kappa$ being the condition number.</description>

      <title>On Future Power Systems Digital Twins: A Vision Towards a Standard Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02568v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy sector's digital transformation brings mutually dependent communication and energy infrastructure, tightening the relationship between the physical and the digital world. Digital twins (DT) are the key concept for this. This paper initially discusses the evolution of the DT concept across various engineering applications before narrowing its focus to the power systems domain. By reviewing different definitions and applications, we present a new definition of DTs specifically tailored to power systems. Based on the proposed definition and extensive deliberations and consultations with distribution system operators, energy traders, and municipalities, we introduce a vision of a standard DT ecosystem architecture that offers services beyond real-time updates and can seamlessly integrate with existing transmission and distribution system operators' processes, while reconciling with concepts such as microgrids and local energy communities based on a system-of-systems view. We also discuss our vision related to the integration of power system DTs into various phases of the system's life cycle, such as long-term planning, emphasizing challenges that remain to be addressed, such as managing measurement and model errors, and uncertainty propagation. Finally, we present our vision of how artificial intelligence and machine learning can enhance several power systems DT modules established in the proposed architecture.</description>

      <title>Predict. Optimize. Revise. On Forecast and Policy Stability in Energy Management Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research addresses the challenge of integrating forecasting and optimization in energy management systems, focusing on the impacts of switching costs, forecast accuracy, and stability. It proposes a novel framework for analyzing online optimization problems with switching costs and enabled by deterministic and probabilistic forecasts. Through empirical evaluation and theoretical analysis, the research reveals the balance between forecast accuracy, stability, and switching costs in shaping policy performance. Conducted in the context of battery scheduling within energy management applications, it introduces a metric for evaluating probabilistic forecast stability and examines the effects of forecast accuracy and stability on optimization outcomes using the real-world case of the Citylearn 2022 competition. Findings indicate that switching costs significantly influence the trade-off between forecast accuracy and stability, highlighting the importance of integrated systems that enable collaboration between forecasting and operational units for improved decision-making. The study shows that committing to a policy for longer periods can be advantageous over frequent updates. Results also show a correlation between forecast stability and policy performance, suggesting that stable forecasts can mitigate switching costs. The proposed framework provides valuable insights for energy sector decision-makers and forecast practitioners when designing the operation of an energy management system.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Safety Verification for Markov Decision Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a distributionally robust safety verification method for Markov decision processes where only an ambiguous transition kernel is available instead of the precise transition kernel. We define the ambiguity set around the nominal distribution by considering a Wasserstein distance. To this end, we introduce a robust safety function to characterize probabilistic safety in the face of uncertain transition probability. First, we obtain an upper bound on the robust safety function in terms of a distributionally robust Q-function. Then, we present a convex program-based distributionally robust Q-iteration algorithm to compute the robust Q-function. By considering a numerical example, we demonstrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Controllability and Vector Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01238</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.01238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kalman's fundamental notion of a controllable state space system \cite{k} has been generalised to higher order systems by Willems \cite{w}, and further to distributed systems defined by partial differential equations \cite{ps}. It turns out, that for systems defined in several important spaces of distributions, controllability is now identical to the notion of vector potential in physics, or of vanishing homology in mathematics. These notes will explain this relationship, and a few of its consequences. It will also pose an important question: does a controllable system, in any space of distributions, always admit a vector potential? In other words, is Kalman's notion of a controllable system, suitably generalised, nothing more -- nor less -- than the possibility of describing the dynamics of the system by means of a vector potential?
  Furthermore, it also turns out that the category of distributed systems bears many formal similarities to the category of affine algebraic sets. This raises a second important question: what is the category for which these distributed systems are `local models', just as affine algebraic sets are local models for the category of algebraic varieties? It would then be possible to extend the theory of control described in these notes to this larger category of systems.</description>

      <title>Powerformer: A Section-adaptive Transformer for Power Flow Adjustment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02771v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel transformer architecture tailored for learning robust power system state representations, which strives to optimize power dispatch for the power flow adjustment across different transmission sections. Specifically, our proposed approach, named Powerformer, develops a dedicated section-adaptive attention mechanism, separating itself from the self-attention used in conventional transformers. This mechanism effectively integrates power system states with transmission section information, which facilitates the development of robust state representations. Furthermore, by considering the graph topology of power system and the electrical attributes of bus nodes, we introduce two customized strategies to further enhance the expressiveness: graph neural network propagation and multi-factor attention mechanism. Extensive evaluations are conducted on three power system scenarios, including the IEEE 118-bus system, a realistic 300-bus system in China, and a large-scale European system with 9241 buses, where Powerformer demonstrates its superior performance over several baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous System Identification and Model Predictive Control with No Dynamic Regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04143v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an algorithm for the simultaneous system identification and model predictive control of nonlinear systems. The algorithm has finite-time near-optimality guarantees and asymptotically converges to the optimal (non-causal) controller. Particularly, the algorithm enjoys sublinear dynamic regret, defined herein as the suboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows how the unknown disturbances and system dynamics will adapt to its actions. The algorithm is self-supervised and applies to control-affine systems with unknown dynamics and disturbances that can be expressed in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Such spaces can model external disturbances and modeling errors that can even be adaptive to the system's state and control input. For example, they can model wind and wave disturbances to aerial and marine vehicles, or inaccurate model parameters such as inertia of mechanical systems. The algorithm first generates random Fourier features that are used to approximate the unknown dynamics or disturbances. Then, it employs model predictive control based on the current learned model of the unknown dynamics (or disturbances). The model of the unknown dynamics is updated online using least squares based on the data collected while controlling the system. We validate our algorithm in both hardware experiments and physics-based simulations. The simulations include (i) a cart-pole aiming to maintain the pole upright despite inaccurate model parameters, and (ii) a quadrotor aiming to track reference trajectories despite unmodeled aerodynamic drag effects. The hardware experiments include a quadrotor aiming to track a circular trajectory despite unmodeled aerodynamic drag effects, ground effects, and wind disturbances.</description>

      <title>Envisioning an Optimal Network of Space-Based Lasers for Orbital Debris Remediation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The significant expansion of the orbital debris population poses a serious threat to the safety and sustainability of space operations. This paper investigates orbital debris remediation through a network of collaborative space-based lasers, leveraging the principle of momentum transfer onto debris via laser ablation. A novel delta-v vector analysis framework quantifies the cumulative effects of multiple concurrent laser-to-debris (L2D) engagements, utilizing the vector composition of the imparted delta-v vectors. The paper formulates the Concurrent Location-Scheduling Problem (CLSP) to optimize the placement of laser platforms and the scheduling of L2D engagements, aiming to maximize debris remediation capacity. Given the computational intractability of the CLSP, a decomposition strategy is employed, yielding two sequential subproblems: (1) determining optimal laser platform locations via the Maximal Covering Location Problem, and (2) scheduling L2D engagements using a novel integer linear programming approach to maximize debris remediation capacity. Computational experiments evaluate the efficacy of the proposed framework across diverse mission scenarios, demonstrating critical network functions such as collaborative and controlled nudging, deorbiting, and just-in-time collision avoidance. A sensitivity analysis further explores the impact of varying the number and distribution of laser platforms on debris remediation capacity, offering insights into optimizing the performance of space-based laser networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Networked robotic systems balance compute, power, and latency constraints in applications such as self-driving vehicles, drone swarms, and teleoperated surgery. A core problem in this domain is deciding when to offload a computationally expensive task to the cloud, a remote server, at the cost of communication latency. Task offloading algorithms often rely on precise knowledge of system-specific performance metrics, such as sensor data rates, network bandwidth, and machine learning model latency. While these metrics can be modeled during system design, uncertainties in connection quality, server load, and hardware conditions introduce real-time performance variations, hindering overall performance. We introduce PEERNet, an end-to-end and real-time profiling tool for cloud robotics. PEERNet enables performance monitoring on heterogeneous hardware through targeted yet adaptive profiling of system components such as sensors, networks, deep-learning pipelines, and devices. We showcase PEERNet's capabilities through networked robotics tasks, such as image-based teleoperation of a Franka Emika Panda arm and querying vision language models using an Nvidia Jetson Orin. PEERNet reveals non-intuitive behavior in robotic systems, such as asymmetric network transmission and bimodal language model output. Our evaluation underscores the effectiveness and importance of benchmarking in networked robotics, demonstrating PEERNet's adaptability. Our code is open-source and available at github.com/UTAustin-SwarmLab/PEERNet.</description>

      <title>Safety Filtering While Training: Improving the Performance and Sample Efficiency of Reinforcement Learning Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) controllers are flexible and performant but rarely guarantee safety. Safety filters impart hard safety guarantees to RL controllers while maintaining flexibility. However, safety filters can cause undesired behaviours due to the separation between the controller and the safety filter, often degrading performance and robustness. In this paper, we analyze several modifications to incorporating the safety filter in training RL controllers rather than solely applying it during evaluation. The modifications allow the RL controller to learn to account for the safety filter, improving performance. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of training RL with safety filters, featuring simulated and real-world experiments with a Crazyflie 2.0 drone. We examine how various training modifications and hyperparameters impact performance, sample efficiency, safety, and chattering. Our findings serve as a guide for practitioners and researchers focused on safety filters and safe RL.</description>

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a data-driven strategy for minimizing/maximizing black-box functions based on probabilistic surrogate models. In the presence of safety constraints, the performance of BO crucially relies on tight probabilistic error bounds related to the uncertainty surrounding the surrogate model. For the case of Gaussian Process surrogates and Gaussian measurement noise, we present a novel error bound based on the recently proposed Wiener kernel regression. We prove that under rather mild assumptions, the proposed error bound is tighter than bounds previously documented in the literature which leads to enlarged safety regions. We draw upon a numerical example to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed error bound in safe BO.</description>
