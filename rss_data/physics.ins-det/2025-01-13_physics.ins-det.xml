      <title>Multi-track reconstruction algorithm in the Mu2e experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mu2e experiment, under construction at Fermilab, will search for the neutrino-less coherent $\mu^-N\rightarrow e^-N$ conversion in the field of a $^{27}$Al nucleus. Such a process violates lepton flavor conservation. About $60\%$ of muons stopped by an $^{27}$Al nucleus will undergo nuclear capture, while about $40\%$ will decay in orbit. To quantify the conversion probability, we define $R_{\mu e}$, which is given by the ratio between the $\mu^-\rightarrow e^-$ conversion rate and the nuclear capture rate [1]: \begin{equation} R_{\mu e}= \frac{\Gamma\left(\mu^- + N\left(Z,A\right)\rightarrow e^- + N\left(Z,A\right)\right)}{\Gamma\left(\mu^- + N\left(Z,A\right)\rightarrow \nu^-_\mu + N\left(Z-1,A\right)\right)}\,. \end{equation} The upper limit on $R_{\mu e}$ is $7\cdot 10^{-13}$ at $90\%$ CL, set by the SINDRUM II experiment~\cite{SINDRUM II:limit}. The goal of the Mu2e experiment is to reach a sensitivity on $R_{\mu e}$ of $8\cdot 10^{-17}$ at $90\%$ CL. This represents a four-order of magnitude improvement over the current experimental limit. Mu2e will take its first data in 2027. The signature for the muon conversion is a monochromatic electron of $104.97$~\si{\mega\eV}/c, an energy slightly below the muon rest mass. While the main experiment goal is to reconstruct the conversion electron, i.e., an event with a single track, there are motivations to develop an efficient tracking algorithm for reconstructing more simultaneous tracks. This could better constrain the background generated by $p\bar{p}$-annihilation in the Al target and to search for other Beyond the Standard Model processes. In this paper, we present an algorithm designed to reconstruct multi-particle events.</description>

      <title>Track reconstruction as a service for collider physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing charged-particle track reconstruction algorithms is crucial for efficient event reconstruction in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments due to their significant computational demands. Existing track reconstruction algorithms have been adapted to run on massively parallel coprocessors, such as graphics processing units (GPUs), to reduce processing time. Nevertheless, challenges remain in fully harnessing the computational capacity of coprocessors in a scalable and non-disruptive manner. This paper proposes an inference-as-a-service approach for particle tracking in high energy physics experiments. To evaluate the efficacy of this approach, two distinct tracking algorithms are tested: Patatrack, a rule-based algorithm, and Exa$.$TrkX, a machine learning-based algorithm. The as-a-service implementations show enhanced GPU utilization and can process requests from multiple CPU cores concurrently without increasing per-request latency. The impact of data transfer is minimal and insignificant compared to running on local coprocessors. This approach greatly improves the computational efficiency of charged particle tracking, providing a solution to the computing challenges anticipated in the High-Luminosity LHC era.</description>

      <title>Introducing new resonant soft x-ray scattering capability in SSRL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSXS) is a powerful technique for probing both spatial and electronic structures within solid-state systems.We present a newly developed RSXS capability at beamline 13-3 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL), designed to enhance materials science research. This advanced setup achieves a base sample temperature as low as 9.8 K combined with extensive angular motions (azimuthal \phi and flipping \chi), enables comprehensive exploration of reciprocal space. Two types of detectors, an Au/GaAsP Schottky photodiode and a CCD detector with over 95% quantum efficiency, are integrated to effectively capture scattered photons. Extensive testing has confirmed the enhanced functionality of this RSXS setup, including its temperature and angular performance. The versatility and effectiveness of the system have been demonstrated through studies of various materials, including superlattice heterostructures and high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Development of SQUID Array Amplifiers for the LiteBIRD CMB Satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiteBIRD is an upcoming JAXA-led mission that aims to measure primordial gravitational waves in the B-mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background. It is set to launch in 2032. The LiteBIRD detector array consists of around 5000 TES detectors which are read out using digital frequency multiplexing over a bandwidth of 1-6 MHz. The multiplexing factor ranges from 58x to 68x. We are presently developing single-stage SQUID array amplifiers for LiteBIRD readout. Due to the reduced complexity and cost, and greater heritage from ground-based experiments such as the South Pole Telescope and Simons Array, single-stage SQUID array amplification is preferable for the first-stage amplification, as long as it can meet the requirements. The LiteBIRD single-stage SQUID Array is required to have high transimpedance amplification while maintaining a low input inductance and low dynamic resistance. In addition, the input-referred current noise must be very low, and the power dissipation must remain below about 100 nW. These requirements have non-trivial interactions. To maximize performance within these requirements we have performed lumped-element SQUID simulation. We find that by optimizing SQUID internal damping elements and inductive loading, good single-stage SQUID array performance can be obtained for LiteBIRD, including significant engineering margin.</description>

      <title>Gas contamination and mitigation in a 100 m$^3$ / 10 bar argon TPC with optical readout: a viability study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaseous Optical Time Projection Chambers (OTPCs) aimed at Neutrino Physics and Rare Event Searches will likely exceed the tonne scale during the next decade. This will make their performance sensitive to gas contamination levels as low as 100 ppb, that is challenging at room temperature due to outgassing from structural materials. In this work we discuss gas distribution and impurity mitigation on a 5 m-length/5 m-diameter 10 bar TPC filled with Ar/CF$_4$ admixed at 99/1 per volume (1.75 tonne), loaded with technical plastics in order to enhance light collection and readout. Different distributor topologies, outgassing and flow rates are discussed. Specifically, our work is aimed at illustrating the conceptual viability of the optical readout of ND-GAr's TPC (within the DUNE Near-Detector complex), in terms of material compatibility. For our proposal, with perforated distributors aligned with the electric field, and under realistic assumptions, the concentration of contaminants can be controlled within a week from chamber filling. In the case of N$_2$, injection of fresh gas at %-level seems to represent the safest strategy to keep the concentration within operability limits.</description>

      <title>Small Angle Neutron Scattering in McStas: optimization for high throughput virtual experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present the development of small angle scattering components in McStas that describe the neutron interaction with 70 different form and structure factors. We describe the considerations taken into account for the generation of these components, such as the incorporation of polydispersity and orientational distribution effects in the Monte Carlo simulation. These models can be parallelized by means of multi-core simulations and graphical processing units (GPUs). The acceleration schemes for the aforementioned models are benchmarked, and the resulting performance is presented. This allows for the estimation of computation times in high-throughput virtual experiments. The presented work enables the generation of large datasets of virtual experiments that can be explored and used by machine learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Neural Architecture Codesign for Fast Physics Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a pipeline to streamline neural architecture codesign for physics applications to reduce the need for ML expertise when designing models for novel tasks. Our method employs neural architecture search and network compression in a two-stage approach to discover hardware efficient models. This approach consists of a global search stage that explores a wide range of architectures while considering hardware constraints, followed by a local search stage that fine-tunes and compresses the most promising candidates. We exceed performance on various tasks and show further speedup through model compression techniques such as quantization-aware-training and neural network pruning. We synthesize the optimal models to high level synthesis code for FPGA deployment with the hls4ml library. Additionally, our hierarchical search space provides greater flexibility in optimization, which can easily extend to other tasks and domains. We demonstrate this with two case studies: Bragg peak finding in materials science and jet classification in high energy physics, achieving models with improved accuracy, smaller latencies, or reduced resource utilization relative to the baseline models.</description>

      <title>OmniJet-${\alpha_{ C}}$: Learning point cloud calorimeter simulations using generative transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the first use of generative transformers for generating calorimeter showers as point clouds in a high-granularity calorimeter. Using the tokenizer and generative part of the OmniJet-${\alpha}$ model, we represent the hits in the detector as sequences of integers. This model allows variable-length sequences, which means that it supports realistic shower development and does not need to be conditioned on the number of hits. Since the tokenization represents the showers as point clouds, the model learns the geometry of the showers without being restricted to any particular voxel grid.</description>

      <title>Optical frequency comb integration in radio telescopes: advancing signal generation and phase calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) enables high-angular-resolution observations in astronomy and geodesy by synthesizing a virtual telescope with baselines spanning hundreds to thousands of kilometres. Achieving high instrumental phase stability in VLBI relies on the generation of high-quality, atomic-referenced RF local oscillator (LO) and RF-comb signals for the effective downconversion of celestial RF signals and precise phase calibration, respectively. As observing frequencies move into higher ranges with wider bandwidth, conventional electronic methods face significant challenges in maintaining the quality of these signals. Here, we demonstrate that an optical frequency comb (OFC) can be used as a versatile tool to generate and distribute low-noise and atomic-referenced RF-comb and RF-LO signals in the VLBI telescope. Hydrogen maser-stabilized optical pulses are transmitted over a timing-stabilized fibre link from the observatory building to the VLBI receiver system at the telescope, where photodetection converts them into the required RF-comb and RF-LO signals. In VLBI test observation, we successfully detected VLBI fringes and extracted the RF-combs characteristics in a format suitable for VLBI instrumental phase calibration. These results highlight the high potential of OFC-based technology for enhancing next-generation broadband VLBI measurements, advancing astrophysical research and facilitating intercontinental clock comparison.</description>

      <title>Bound-State Beta Decay of $\mathbf{\mathrm{^{205}{Tl}^{81+}}}$ Ions and the LOREX Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stable $^{205}$Tl ions have the lowest known energy threshold for capturing electron neutrinos ($\nu_e$) of ${ E}_{\nu_e}\ge50.6$\,keV. The Lorandite Experiment (LOREX), proposed in the 1980s, aims at obtaining the longtime averaged solar neutrino flux by utilizing natural deposits of Tl-bearing lorandite ores. To determine the $\nu_e$ capture cross section, it is required to know the strength of the weak transition connecting the ground state of $^{205}$Tl and the 2.3 keV first excited state in $^{205}$Pb. The only way to experimentally address this transition is to measure the bound-state beta decay ($\beta_{b}$) of fully ionized $\mathrm{^{205}Tl^{81+}}$ ions. After three decades of meticulous preparation, the half-life of the $\beta_{b}$ decay of $\mathrm{^{205}Tl^{81+}}$ has been measured to be $291_{-27}^{+33}$ days using the Experimental Storage Ring (ESR) at GSI, Darmstadt. The longer measured half-life compared to theoretical estimates reduces the expected signal-to-noise ratio in the LOREX, thus challenging its feasibility.</description>

      <title>Precision determination of the track-position resolution of beam telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beam tests using tracking telescopes are a standard method for determining the spatial resolution of detectors. This requires the precise knowledge of the position resolution of beam tracks reconstructed at the Device Under Test (DUT). A method is proposed which achieves this using a segmented silicon detector with readout with charge digitization. It is found that the DUT spatial resolution for particles with normal incidence is less than 1 $\mu$m for events where clusters consist of two pixels (or strips). Given this accuracy, the residual of the beam track-position at the DUT and the position reconstructed in the DUT provides the beam track-position resolution distribution. The method is developed using simulated events, which are also used to study how to deal with cross-talk, electronics noise, energetic $\delta $-electrons, and incident beams with a few degrees off the normal to the sensor plane. To validate the method, the position resolution of beam tracks reconstructed by the EUDET beam telescope of the DESY II Test Beam Facility is determined using a CMS Phase-2 prototype pixel sensor.</description>

      <title>Performance of Silicon photomultipliers at low temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present experimental results of characterization of Silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) in a temperature range from 90~mK to 40~K. Two SiPMs, one from ONSEMI and one from Hamamatsu Photonics were tested. Operating voltage ranges, dark count rates, afterpulsing effects and photon detection efficiencies (PDE) were determined with illumination by 275 and 470~nm light fed into the cryostat via an optical fiber. A cryogenic shutter provided a true dark condition, where thermal radiation from room temperature is shielded and the thermal excitations in the chips are frozen. A second tunneling breakdown was observed at this condition, which substantially limits the operating voltage range for the temperatures 20-30 K. Below $\sim$5 K, both SiPMs recover to an operating over-voltage range of 3-5 V. We found the chips function through the entire tested temperature range, and are capable of withstanding thermal cycling with no major performance degradation.</description>

Abstract: The Resistive Plate Chamber using Diamond-Like Carbon electrodes (DLC-RPC) has been developed as a background tagging detector in the MEG$~$II experiment. The DLC-RPC is planned to be installed in a high-intensity and low-momentum muon beam. This detector is required to have a detection efficiency of above 90 % with four active gaps in the muon beam due to the limitation of the material budget. In such an environment, the high current flowing through the resistive electrodes causes a voltage drop, which reduces the performance of the DLC-RPC. This voltage drop can be suppressed by implementing a current evacuation pattern, though discharges are more likely to occur near the pattern. Therefore the pattern must be covered by a protection cover made of an insulator. In this study, electrode samples with the current evacuation pattern and different widths of protection cover (0.2 mm and 0.8 mm) have been produced, and their performance and stability were measured. The detection efficiency of the single-gap for $\beta$-ray from a $^{90}$Sr source was measured to be up to approximately 60 % in both electrode samples. The target efficiency can be achieved even with a drop of 100 $-$ 150 V. On the other hand, after more than a dozen hours of operation, discharges suddenly occurred and the detector was prevented from further operation. These discharges created current paths on the spacing pillars. This serious problem must be investigated and solved in the future.</description>

Abstract: The ATLAS tile calorimeter (TileCal) is the hadronic sampling calorimeter covering the central region of the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This paper gives an overview of the calorimeter's operation and performance during the years 2015-2018 (Run 2). In this period, ATLAS collected proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and the TileCal was $99.65\%$ efficient for data-taking. The signal reconstruction, the calibration procedures, and the detector operational status are presented. The performance of two ATLAS trigger systems making use of TileCal information, the minimum-bias trigger scintillators and the tile muon trigger, is discussed. Studies of radiation effects allow the degradation of the output signals at the end of the LHC and HL-LHC operations to be estimated. Finally, the TileCal response to isolated muons, hadrons and jets from proton-proton collisions is presented. The energy and time calibration methods performed excellently, resulting in good stability and uniformity of the calorimeter response during Run 2. The setting of the energy scale was performed with an uncertainty of $2\%$. The results demonstrate that the performance is in accordance with specifications defined in the Technical Design Report.</description>
