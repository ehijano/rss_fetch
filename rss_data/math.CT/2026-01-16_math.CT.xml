      <title>Rewriting Systems on Arbitrary Monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce monoidal rewriting systems (MRS), an abstraction of string rewriting in which reductions are defined over an arbitrary ambient monoid rather than a free monoid of words. This shift is partly motivated by logic: the class of free monoids is not first-order axiomatizable, so "working in the free setting" cannot be treated internally when applying first-order methods to rewriting presentations.
  To analyze these systems categorically, we define $\mathbf{NCRS_2}$ as the 2-category of Noetherian Confluent MRS. We then prove the existence of a canonical biadjunction between $\mathbf{NCRS_2}$ and $\mathbf{Mon}$.
  Finally, we classify all Noetherian Confluent MRS that present a given fixed monoid. For this, we introduce Generalized Elementary Tietze Transformations (GETTs) and prove that any two presentations of a monoid are connected by a (possibly infinite) sequence of these transformations, yielding a complete characterization of generating systems up to GETT-equivalence.</description>

      <title>From higher-order rewriting systems to higher-order categorial algebras and higher-order Curry-Howard isomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This ongoing project aims to define and investigate, from the standpoint of category theory, order theory and universal algebra, the notions of higher-order many-sorted rewriting system and of higher-order many-sorted categorial algebra and their relationships, via the higher-order Curry-Howard isomorphisms. The ultimate goal, to be developed in future versions of this work, is to define and investigate the category of towers, whose objects will consist of families, indexed by $\mathbb{N}$, of higher-order many-sorted rewriting systems and of higher-order many-sorted categorial algebras, including higher-order Curry-Howard type results for the latter, together with an additional structure that intertwines such $\mathbb{N}$-families; and whose morphism from a tower to another will be families, indexed by $\mathbb{N}$, of morphisms between its higher-order many-sorted rewriting systems and of higher-order many-sorted categorial algebras compatible with their structures. All feedback is appreciated.</description>

      <title>Monoidal Relative Categories Model Monoidal $\infty$-Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20606v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the homotopy theory of monoidal relative categories is equivalent to that of monoidal $\infty$-categories, and likewise in the symmetric monoidal setting. As an application, we give a concise and complete proof of the fact that every presentably monoidal or presentably symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category is presented by a monoidal or symmetric monoidal model category, which, in the monoidal case, was sketched by Lurie, and in the symmetric monoidal case, was proved by Nikolaus--Sagave.</description>

      <title>The free bifibration on a functor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07314v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing the free bifibration generated by a functor of categories $p : D \to C$. This problem was previously considered by Lamarche, and is closely related to the problem, considered by Dawson, Par\'e, and Pronk, of ``freely adjoining adjoints'' to a category. We develop a proof-theoretic approach to the problem, beginning with a construction of the free bifibration $\Lambda_p : Bifib(p)\to C$ in which objects of $Bifib(p)$ are formulas of a primitive ``bifibrational logic'', and arrows are derivations in a cut-free sequent calculus modulo a notion of permutation equivalence. We show that instantiating the construction to the identity functor generates a _zigzag double category_ $\mathbb{Z}(C)$, which is also the free double category with companions and conjoints (or fibrant double category) on $C$. The approach adapts smoothly to the more general task of building $(P,N)$-fibrations, where one only asks for pushforwards along arrows in $P$ and pullbacks along arrows in $N$ for some subsets of arrows; this encompasses Kock and Joyal's notion of _ambifibration_ when $(P,N)$ form a factorization system. We establish a series of progressively stronger normal forms, guided by ideas of _focusing_ from proof theory, and obtain a canonicity result under assumption that the base category is factorization preordered relative to $P$ and $N$. This canonicity result allows us to decide the word problem and to enumerate relative homsets without duplicates. Finally, we describe several examples of a combinatorial nature, including a category of plane trees generated as a free bifibration over $\omega$, and a category of increasing forests generated as a free ambifibration over $\Delta$, which contains the lattices of noncrossing partitions as quotients of its fibers by the Beck-Chevalley condition for bicartesian squares.</description>

      <title>Directed univalence in simplicial homotopy type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simplicial type theory extends homotopy type theory with a directed path type which internalizes the notion of a homomorphism within a type. This concept has significant applications both within mathematics -- where it allows for synthetic (higher) category theory -- and programming languages -- where it leads to a directed version of the structure identity principle. In this work, we construct the first types in simplicial type theory with non-trivial homomorphisms. We extend simplicial type theory with modalities and new reasoning principles to obtain triangulated type theory in order to construct the universe of discrete types $\mathcal{S}$. We prove that homomorphisms in this type correspond to ordinary functions of types i.e., that $\mathcal{S}$ is directed univalent. The construction of $\mathcal{S}$ is foundational for both of the aforementioned applications of simplicial type theory. We are able to define several crucial examples of categories and to recover important results from category theory. Using $\mathcal{S}$, we are also able to define various types whose usage is guaranteed to be functorial. These provide the first complete examples of the proposed directed structure identity principle.</description>

      <title>Rational RG flow, extension, and Witt class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08935v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a renormalization group flow preserving a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_1$. If it flows to a rational conformal field theory, the surviving symmetry $\mathcal S_1$ flows to a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_2$ with monoidal functor $F:\mathcal S_1\to\mathcal S_2$. By clarifying mathematical (especially category theoretical) meaning of renormalization group domain wall/interface or boundary condition, we find the hidden extended vertex operator (super)algebra gives a unique (up to braided equivalence) completely $(\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2)'$-anisotropic representative of the Witt equivalence class $[\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2]$. The mathematical conjecture is supported physically, and passes various tests in concrete examples including non/unitary minimal models, and Wess-Zumino-Witten models. In particular, the conjecture holds beyond diagonal cosets.
  The picture also establishes the conjectured half-integer condition, which fixes infrared conformal dimensions mod $\frac12$. It further leads to the double braiding relation, namely braiding structures jump at conformal fixed points. As an application, we solve the flow from the $E$-type minimal model $(A_{10},E_6)\to M(4,3)$.</description>

Abstract: Gelaki-Naidu-Nikshych and Turaev-Virelizier showed the existence of $G$-braiding on the
  relative Drinfeld center of a $G$-graded tensor category. We will explain this concept
