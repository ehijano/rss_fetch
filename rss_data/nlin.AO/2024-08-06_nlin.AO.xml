      <title>Opinion Dynamics with Set-Based Confidence: Convergence Criteria and Periodic Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new multidimensional extension of the Hegselmann-Krause (HK) opinion dynamics model, where opinion proximity is not determined by a norm or metric. Instead, each agent trusts opinions within the Minkowski sum $\xi+\mathcal{O}$, where $\xi$ is the agent's current opinion and $\mathcal{O}$ is the confidence set defining acceptable deviations. During each iteration, agents update their opinions by simultaneously averaging the trusted opinions. Unlike traditional HK systems, where $\mathcal{O}$ is a ball in some norm, our model allows the confidence set to be non-convex and even unbounded.
  We demonstrate that the new model, referred to as SCOD (Set-based Confidence Opinion Dynamics), can exhibit properties absent in the conventional HK model. Some solutions may converge to non-equilibrium points in the state space, while others oscillate periodically. These ``pathologies'' disappear if the set $\mathcal{O}$ is symmetric and contains zero in its interior: similar to the usual HK model, SCOD then converges in a finite number of iterations to one of the equilibrium points. The latter property is also preserved if one agent is "stubborn" and resists changing their opinion, yet still influences the others; however, two stubborn agents can lead to oscillations.</description>

      <title>Dynamics on invariant tori emerging through forced symmetry breaking in phase oscillator networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider synchrony patterns in coupled phase oscillator networks that correspond to invariant tori. For specific nongeneric coupling, these tori are equilibria relative to a continuous symmetry action. We analyze how the invariant tori deform under forced symmetry breaking as more general network interaction terms are introduced. We first show in general that perturbed tori that are relative equilibria can be computed using a parametrization method; this yields an asymptotic expansion of an embedding of the perturbed torus, as well as the local dynamics on the torus. We then apply this result to a coupled oscillator network, and we numerically study the dynamics on the persisting tori in the network by looking for bifurcations of their periodic orbits in a boundary-value-problem setup. This way we find new bifurcating stable synchrony patterns that can be the building blocks of larger global structures such as heteroclinic cycles.</description>

      <title>Explosive neural networks via higher-order interactions in curved statistical manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions underlie complex phenomena in systems such as biological and artificial neural networks, but their study is challenging due to the lack of tractable standard models. By leveraging the maximum entropy principle in curved statistical manifolds, here we introduce curved neural networks as a class of prototypical models for studying higher-order phenomena. Through exact mean-field descriptions, we show that these curved neural networks implement a self-regulating annealing process that can accelerate memory retrieval, leading to explosive order-disorder phase transitions with multi-stability and hysteresis effects. Moreover, by analytically exploring their memory capacity using the replica trick near ferromagnetic and spin-glass phase boundaries, we demonstrate that these networks enhance memory capacity over the classical associative-memory networks. Overall, the proposed framework provides parsimonious models amenable to analytical study, revealing novel higher-order phenomena in complex network systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Theory for Adaptive Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01403v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of adaptive dynamics, involving many degrees of freedom on two separated timescales, one for fast changes of state variables and another for the slow adaptation of parameters controlling the former's dynamics is crucial for understanding feedback mechanisms underlying evolution and learning. We present a path-integral approach \`a la Martin-Siggia-Rose-De Dominicis-Janssen (MSRDJ) to analyse nonequilibrium phase transitions in such dynamical systems. As an illustration, we apply our framework to the adaptation of gene-regulatory networks under a dynamic genotype-phenotype map: phenotypic variations are shaped by the fast stochastic gene-expression dynamics and are coupled to the slowly evolving distribution of genotypes, each encoded by a network structure. We establish that under this map, genotypes corresponding to reciprocal networks of coherent feedback loops are selected within an intermediate range of environmental noise, leading to phenotypic robustness.</description>
